AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will measure river width, water surface elevation, and slope for rivers wider than 50-100 m. SWOT observations will enable estimation of river discharge by using simple flow laws such as the Manning-Strickler equation, complementing in situ streamgages. Several discharge inversion algorithms designed to compute unobserved flow law parameters (e.g., friction coefficient and bathymetry) have been proposed, but to date, a systematic assessment of factors controlling algorithm performance has not been conducted. Here, we assess the performance of the five algorithms that are expected to be used in the construction of the SWOT product. To perform this assessment, we used synthetic SWOT observations created with hydraulic model output corrupted with SWOT-like error. Prior information provided to the algorithms was purposefully limited to an estimate of mean annual flow (MAF), designed to produce a "worst case" benchmark. Prior MAF error was an important control on algorithm performance, but discharge estimates produced by the algorithms are less biased than the MAF; thus, the discharge algorithms improve on the prior. We show for the first time that accuracy and frequency of remote sensing observations are less important than prior bias, hydraulic variability among reaches, and flow law accuracy in governing discharge algorithm performance. The discharge errors and error sensitivities reported herein are a bounding benchmark, representing worst possible expected errors and error sensitivities. This study lays the groundwork to develop predictive power of algorithm performance, and thus map the global distribution of worst-case SWOT discharge accuracy.

TI Particle tracking model of bimolecular reactive transport in porous
   media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB We use a particle tracking approach to analyze the dynamics that control bimolecular reactive transport (A + B -> C) in porous media. Particle transitions are governed by spatial and temporal distributions to account for the transport within a continuous time random walk framework. Particle tracking simulations are compared to measurements from a laboratory experiment of bimolecular reactive transport in a constant flow field. The simulations capture the experimental sequence of evolving C particle profiles using a marginally Fickian temporal distribution to quantify the particle transitions. The first profile is a fit with the model parameters, and subsequent ones are predictions. The rate of production of reaction product C over time is found to follow a power law. At early times after the injection of A particles into a uniform distribution of B particles, the strong contact and reaction between A and B particles induces the formation of a spatial void between the reactants. At longer times, the production of C is nearly constant and depends on the fluctuations of velocities of reactant particles that can surmount the void. We probe the behavioral dependence of the A, B, and C spatial profiles on the spectra of velocity fluctuations of the reactants. The latter are generated by different temporal distributions, namely, a decaying exponential distribution, which is equivalent to advective-dispersive (Fickian) transport, and the truncated power law with degrees of non-Fickian behavior, which is characteristic of transport in heterogeneous media. We demonstrate that the C profile exhibits subtle dynamics because of competition between the dispersion (spreading of the plumes) of A and B and the (power law) production rate.

ID SPECTRAL-ANALYSES; AQUIFER
AB The identification of the turbidity mechanisms in two karstic springs (Ribaa and Bittit) located in the Middle Atlas Plateau in Morocco was performed by means of correlation and spectral analyses applied to time series of rainfall, flow rates, and turbidity. Time series analyses of rainfall and discharges revealed high inertia and storage capacities of the karstic systems. However, the occurrence of turbidity in the springs proved independent of discharges. A causal relationship between rainfall and the occurrence of turbidity in the form of waves was established. Accordingly, turbidity was assumed to be related to the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing in the karst. Turbulent quickflows in the karst transmissive conduits, following heavy rainfall, are thought to provoke the resuspension of solid particles deposited in the conduits, as well as their transport towards outlets. An external origin has also been contemplated, concerning infiltration waters may be loaded with suspended matters washed from the watershed.

AB We examine groundwater recharge processes and their relationship to rainfall intensity in the semi-arid, southwestern Lake Chad Basin of Nigeria using a newly compiled database of stable isotope data (delta H-2, delta O-18) from groundwater and rainfall. delta O-18 signatures in groundwater proximate to surface waters are enriched in O-18 relative to regional rainfall and trace focused groundwater recharge from evaporated waters via ephemeral river discharge and Lake Chad; groundwater remote from river channels is comparatively depleted and associated with diffuse recharge, often via sand dunes. Stable isotope ratios of O and H (delta H-2, delta O-18) in groundwater samples regress to a value along the local meteoric waterline that is depleted relative to weighted mean composition of rainfall, consistent with rainfall exceeding the 60(th) percentile of monthly precipitation intensity. The observed bias in groundwater recharge to heavy monthly rainfall suggests that the intensification of tropical rainfall under global warming favours groundwater recharge in this basin.

AB In this study, we investigate the temporal oscillations of precipitation extremes in different climate regions of the United States. We apply quantile perturbation analysis to average daily precipitation and, to 1041 weather stations with high-quality data from 1900 to 2016. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the extreme precipitation and different well-known cyclical climate modes. Overall, the analysis of average daily precipitation identifies a drier condition in the middle decades of the twentieth century and, a wetter climate in the early century and recent decades. Moreover, the in situ analysis reveals a significant anomaly, mainly prevalent in the Central and Southern regions of the United States. We applied a finite set of linear regression models with different combinations of cyclical climate modes to inform the variability of anomalies with best performing models. Our results highlight the dominant effect of ENSO and NAO in the wide area of the United States.

AB Proper estimation of the spatial distribution of water-table depth is highly important in most groundwater studies. Groundwater depth is measured at specific and limited points and it is estimated for other parts using spatial estimation methods. In this study, two multivariate methods, artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR), are examined to estimate water-table depth in an unconfined aquifer located in Shibkooh, Iran. The different ancillary data, including spatial coordinates, digital elevation model (DEM), aquifer bed elevation, specific resistivity and aquifer thickness were used to improve estimates based on these methods. It was proved that performance of the ANN surpasses that of the MLR method. Using the spatial coordinates, the aquifer bed elevation and aquifer thickness resulted in the optimum spatial estimation of the water-table depth. These parameters, directly or indirectly, affect the water-table depth estimation through techniques such as ANN capable of modelling of nonlinear relationships.

AB Terrain variables are the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of snow cover. This paper aims to find a relationship between snow-cover area (SCA) and topographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect), using MODIS Terra data (MOD09A1) in parts of the Chenab basin, western Himalayas. The inter-annual variability of SCA% for each month has been analysed for the years 2000 to 2011. The analysis reveals that mean annual SCA value was maximum (37.89%) in 2005 and minimum (32.07%) in 2001. The slope classes with maximum and minimum SCA% are 5 degrees-10 degrees and 30 degrees-35 degrees, respectively. Among the 16 aspect classes, the ESE-facing slope evinces maximum SCA%. During the snow accumulation period, the expanse at 3600-4300m elevation, and in the depletion period, 4300-5000m elevation are found to have maximum rate of change in SCA% per 100m rise in elevation, i.e. 3.37% and 3.67%, respectively.

To this end, this paper develops a rainfall-runoff modelling approach that aims to capture the multiple sources and types of uncertainty in a single framework. The main assumption is that hydrological systems are nonlinear dynamical systems which can be described by stochastic differential equations (SDE). The dynamics of the system is based on the least action principle (LAP) as derived from Noether's theorem. The inflow process is considered as a sum of deterministic and random components. Using data from the Oueme River basin (Benin, West Africa), the basic properties for the random component are considered and the triple relationship between the structure of the inflowing rainfall, the corresponding SDE that describes the river basin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations (FPE) is analysed.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB Trend analysis was performed on strearnflow data for a collection of stations on the Canadian Prairies, in terms of spring and summer runoff volumes, peak flow rates and peak flow occurrences, as well as an annual volume measure, for analysis periods of 1966-2005, 1971-2005, and 1976-2005. The Mann-Kendall statistical test for trend and bootstrap resampling were used to identify the trends and to determine the field significance of the trends. Partial correlation analysis was used to identify relationships between hydrological variables that exhibit a significant trend and meteorological variables that exhibit a significant trend. Noteworthy results include decreasing trends in the spring snowmelt runoff event volume and peak flow, decreasing trends (earlier occurrence) in the spring snowmelt runoff event peak date and decreasing trends in the seasonal (1 March-31 October) runoff volume. These trends can be attributed to a combination of reductions in snowfall and increases in temperatures during the winter months.

AB Based on snow-depth and measured runoff data in the 19 river basins of the cryosphere areas of China, changes in cold season snow depth (CSSD) and spring runoff, and the relationship between CSSD and spring runoff were analysed. Decreasing trends in CSSD were detected mainly in the plains (plateaus), while increasing trends were found mainly in the mountainous regions. Different combinations of precipitation and temperature may be responsible for these results. The response of spring runoff to CSSD change varied greatly under climate warming. The runoff in April and May was commonly affected by CSSD, while the runoff in March was less affected by CSSD, but more by the increasing temperature causing more snowmelt in March. Due to relatively greater snow accumulation in spring, the runoff during spring was less affected by CSSD in the southern Tienshan Mountains.

ID FLOW; UNCERTAINTY; DISPERSION; TRANSPORT
AB A numerical technique is presented whereby aquifer hydraulic diffusivities (D) and macrodispersivities () are calculated by linear equations rewritten from flow and solute transport differential equations. The approach requires a GIS to calculate spatial and temporal hydraulic head (h) and solute concentration gradients. The model is tested in Portugal, in a semi-confined aquifer periodically monitored for h and chloride/sulphate concentrations. Average D (0.46 m(2)/s) and (1975 m) compare favourably with literature results. The relationship between and scale (L) is also investigated. In this context, two aquifer groups could be identified: the first group is heterogeneous at the macroscopic scale (solute travelled distances <1 km), but homogeneous at the megascopic scale. The overall scale dependency in this case is given by an equation of logarithmic type. The second group is heterogeneous at the macroscopic and megascopic scales, with a scale dependency of linear type.

   modeling; reaeration rate; river metabolism; small eddy model; surface

AB Air-water gas transfer influences fundamental processes of aquatic systems such as photosynthesis, respiration, and greenhouse gas emission. Previous predictive models for gas transfer velocity (K-L) often only apply to a small range of streams and rivers. Two "universal" scalings, K-L similar to 1/4 power of turbulent dissipation rate (epsilon(1/4)) and K-L similar to shear velocity (U*), deduced from classic thin-film theory and surface renewal theory, have been reported for lake and marine systems, but have not been adequately tested for streams or rivers. To test the two scalings and understand how K-L varies across systems, we compiled 588 field measurements of K-L, and used inverse modeling based on long-term high-frequency dissolved oxygen time series to estimate K-L of 35 streams and rivers capturing a wide range of discharge (0-221 m(3)/s). We found that the two scalings held for both the K-L estimated by inverse modeling and the K-L from measurements and outperformed 23 previous models in predicting K-L. Furthermore, the main driver of K-L variation shifts from bottom friction to other factors with increasing stream/river size. In most streams and a few rivers, correlation between U* and K-L is high, and discharge-K-L relationships are strongly positive, indicating that turbulence generated by bottom friction dominates near-surface turbulence, a fundamental control of K-L, thus, the two scaling models are applicable to these systems. However, most rivers (mean discharge >10 m(3)/s) show low correlations between U* and K-L, suggesting biochemical factors and winds likely override bottom friction in driving near-surface turbulence and K-L.

DE rainfall kinetic energy; momentum; stormwater; particle washoff; drop
   size distribution
ID RAINDROP; MODEL; N0
AB Previous studies have identified rainfall intensity as a contributing factor to the amount of suspended particles washed from urban areas during storms. Moreover, it has been postulated that the square of rainfall intensity (I-2) provides a measure of the rainfall kinetic energy (KE) available for washoff processes. This paper provides a theoretical. analysis of the potential inter-relationships between I-2 and rainfall KE. A hypothetical raindrop size distribution (DSD) was used to derive rainfall energy characteristics. A special form of the Marshall-Palmer DSD was developed that ensured conservation of rainfall mass over the analyzed range of rainfall intensities. This 'conserved rainfall mass' DSD was used to calculate the specific KE variants of rainfall (the time-specific KE, and the volume-specific KEp). It was found that KE, has a log(e)-based relationship with rainfall intensity. Empirical relationships widely used in soil erosion studies have generally adopted a log(10) basis. A direct relationship between the two KE variants and I-2 appears to be absent. A new KE variant (KEIA) is proposed and it is demonstrated that this variant supports the hypothesis that I-2 is a measure of the KE of rainfall. KEIA is the kinetic energy potentially transferred from raindrops to the proportion of the unit area impacted at a specific instant in time. It is a function of KE, and raindrop circumferential area. Relationships based on variants of rainfall momentum M are also investigated. The relationship between M-I and KEI is nearly linear as a fitted power function has an exponent close to unity (equal to 0.93). This suggests KE and M could be effectively interchangeable if used in particle washoff estimation. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A variety of interdisciplinary fields have provided distinct and complementary perspectives on human-water systems over the past few decades. In that context, an important distinctive feature of sociohydrology is its historical and methodological link to ecohydrology. This linkage implies a compatibility between the two fields that can be leveraged to address important modeling challenges in both fields. Sociohydrology has thus far focused on temporal dynamics and can benefit from recent advances in ecohydrology to represent spatial dynamics in coupled human-water systems. Conversely, as it increasingly focuses on human-altered catchments, ecohydrology can benefit from sociohydrology in terms of developing models of human behavior that are compatible with (eco)hydrological models, while being consistent with prevailing social science theories. We review recent work in ecohydrology and sociohydrology that substantiates these two arguments, and discuss the modeling of water-borne diseases as an example of a promising avenue of research that connects the two fields.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the degree of preferential flow in an unsaturated soil column using two different models: the dual-porosity model, MACRO, and the kinematic wave approach (KWA) based on boundary-layer flow theory. The soil column experiments consisted of six infiltrations with intensities varying from 15 to 101 mm h(-1). Bromide solution was also infiltrated at an intensity of 79 mm h(-1) and a concentration of 80 mg l(-1). Both MACRO and the KWA indicated the absence of pure preferential flow. The KWA indicated intermediate flow with dispersion of the wetting front with depth, whereas MACRO indicated flow dominated by the diffusion of capillary potential. These results shed light on the transition between flows dominated by momentum dissipation and by diffusion of capillary potential. The absence of pure macropore flow in the structured sandy soil is mainly due to efficient lateral mass exchange in this material.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in deep geological formations can lead to significant reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions if large amounts of CO2 can be stored. Estimates of the storage capacity are therefore essential to the evaluation of individual storage sites as well as the feasibility of the technology. One important limitation on the storage capacity is the radius of review, the lateral extent of the pressure perturbation, of the storage project. We show that pressure dissipation into ambient mudrocks retards lateral pressure propagation significantly and therefore increases the storage capacity. For a three-layer model of a reservoir surrounded by thick mudrocks, the far-field pressure is approximated well by a single-phase model. Through dimensional analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the lateral extent of the pressure front follows a power law that depends on a single dissipation parameter M proportional to log(10)(RkRSRl2), where R-k and R-S are the ratios of mudrock to reservoir permeability and specific storage, and R-l is the aspect ratio of the confined pressure plume. Both the coefficient and the exponent of the power law are sigmoid decreasing functions of M. The M values of typical storage sites are in the region where the power-law changes rapidly. The combination of large uncertainty in mudrock properties and the sigmoid shape leads to wide and strongly skewed probability distributions for the predicted radius of review and storage capacity. Therefore, if the lateral extent of the pressure front limits the storage capacity, the determination of the mudrock properties is an important component of site characterization.

AB This paper analyses and compares rainfall erosivity values that were computed with five different kinetic energy-intensity (ICE-I) relationships using the 0.5-h and 1-h maximum rainfall intensities (I-30 and I-60, respectively). The ICE-I relationships included three exponential equations (Brown and Foster, 1987 (BF); McGregor et al., 1995 (MG); van Dijk et al., 2002 (VD)), a logarithmic equation (Wischmeier and Smith, 1958 (WS)) and a linear equation (Hudson, 1961 (HU)). The KE-I relationships were used to compute rainfall erosivity from pluviographic records of 30 sites that are located in central Chile. A total of 415 years of data were used, and more than 18,000 storms were identified. The results showed that among the exponential equations, the MG relationship yielded erosivity results that were statistically identical to the VD and the BF relationships. However, when comparing the VD and the BF relationships, significant differences in erosivity were found, which showed that the exponential equation is highly sensitive to changes in its regression parameters and is therefore site-specific. Among all of the relationships, the WS logarithmic equation yielded the largest erosivity estimates; however, they were statistically equal to the estimates made with the MG and the VD relationships but were not statistically equal to estimates predicted by the BF relationship. In contrast, in comparison to the other equations, the HU linear relationship yielded significantly smaller erosivity values. Conversely, regardless of the ICE-I relationship and the site, computing erosivity using I-60 provided erosivity estimates that are 10% smaller than those obtained using I-30. The relative size of the erosivity estimates is due to the relative values of 10 and 130; on average I-60 was 10% smaller than I-30 at the study sites. Finally, because the rainfall erosivity estimates at the study sites were highly affected by the type of ICE-I relationship, these results demonstrate that selecting an appropriate KE-I relationship is crucial for accurately estimating erosivity. These differences were augmented because of the typically low rainfall intensities at the study sites. Under this condition, the differences between the ICE-I relationships were greatest. However, with higher rainfall intensities, all of the ICE-I relationships provide similar kinetic energy estimates, which makes the selection of the RE-I relationship less important than the use of a reliable I-30 value for computing rainfall erosivity.

AB Novel data-intelligence models developed through hybridization of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with different metaheuristic algorithms, namely grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), are proposed for daily river flow prediction of the Taleghan River, which is the major source of potable water for Tehran, the capital of Iran. Gamma test (GT) was used for the determination of input variables for the models. The ANFIS-WOA model was found to exhibit the best performance in prediction of river flow according to root mean square error (RMSE approximate to 3.75 m(3).s(-1)) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE approximate to 0.93). It improved the prediction performance of the classical ANFIS model by 6.5%. The convergence speed of ANFIS-WOA was also found to be higher compared to other hybrid models. The success of the ANFIS-WOA model indicates its potential for use in the simulation of highly nonlinear daily rainfall-runoff relationships.

AB Multiple segmented rating curves have been proposed to better capture the variability of the physical and hydraulic characteristics of river-floodplain systems. We evaluate the accuracy of one- and two-segmented rating curves by exploiting a large and unique database of direct measurements of stage and discharge data in more than 200 Swedish catchments. Such a comparison is made by explicitly accounting for the potential impact of measurement uncertainty. This study shows that two-segmented rating curves did not fit the data significantly better, nor did they generate fewer errors than one-segmented rating curves. Two-segmented rating curves were found to be slightly beneficial for low flow when there were strong indications of segmentation, but predicted the rating relationship worse in cases of weak indication of segmentation. Other factors were found to have a larger impact on rating curve errors, such as the uncertainty of the discharge measurements and the type of regression method.

AB This study develops a set of models to investigate the water budget of Lake Urmia in Iran, a permanent hypersaline lake that has suffered a declining water level since the late 1990s. The models are of the regressive-stochastic type, a combination of multilinear regression and autoregressive integrated moving average stochastic models. The multilinear regression models were used to construct the core of the relationship of lake water level to streamflow, precipitation, evaporation and groundwater depth. Afterward, stochastic models were used to generate data for each independent variable to estimate the oscillation in the lake water depth. Several criteria were used to compare the performance of the models in the aggregated and disaggregated cases with which the pre- and post-encroachment periods are considered, respectively. The regressive-stochastic models are found to be competitive with the existing models developed so far for Lake Urmia water level.

AB Centrifuge experiments modeling single-phase flow in prototype porous media typically use the same porous medium and permeant. Then, well-known scaling laws are used to transfer the results to the prototype. More general scaling laws that relax these restrictions are presented. For permeants that are immiscible with an accompanying gas phase, model-prototype (i.e., centrifuge model experiment-target system) scaling is demonstrated. Scaling is shown to be feasible for Miller-similar (or geometrically similar) media. Scalings are presented for a more, general class, Lisle-similar media, based on the equivalence mapping of Richards' equation onto itself. Whereas model-prototype scaling of Miller-similar media can be realized easily for arbitrary boundary conditions, Lisle-similarity in a finite length medium generally, but not always, involves a mapping to a moving boundary problem. An exception occurs for redistribution in Lisle-similar porous media, which is shown to map to spatially fixed boundary conditions. Complete model-prototype scalings for this example are derived.

AB Shannon's entropy theory measures the average uncertainty in the outcomes of an event. Since drought monitoring is an important issue, it is imperative to develop more user-friendly, modern methods for it. The present study investigates the uncertainty of the difference between monthly mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration utilizing Shannon's entropy over short-, mid-, and long-term dynamic time scales in the Karkheh Basin of Iran. An entropy-based precipitation-evapotranspiration index (EPEI) is defined for drought classification. EPEI is compared with the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in terms of spatiotemporal patterns. The results indicate a higher similarity between EPEI and SPEI under existing conditions with low average precipitation. Over short scales, both indices yield similar results in duration, frequency, and intensity. Over long scales, the consistency of the drought duration, frequency, and intensity results declines. The main difference between the two is the EPEI's ability to determine the early onset of the drought event.

AB The complex stream bank profiles in alluvial channels and rivers that are formed after reaching equilibrium has been a popular topic of research for many geomorphologists and river engineers. The entropy theory has recently been successfully applied to this problem. However, the existing methods restrict the further application of the entropy parameter to determine the cross-section slope of the river banks. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel approach in the extraction of the equation based on the calculation of the entropy parameter (lambda) and the transverse slope of the bank profile at threshold channel conditions. The effects of different hydraulic and geometric parameters are evaluated on a variation of the entropy parameter. Sensitivity analysis on the parameters affecting the entropy parameter shows that the most effective parameter on the lambda-slope multiplier is the maximum slope of the bank profile and the dimensionless lateral distance of the river banks.

AB Flow patterns in conjunction with seasonal and diurnal temperature variations control ecological and biogeochemical conditions in hyporheic sediments. In particular, hyporheic temperatures have a great impact on many temperature-sensitive microbial processes. In this study, we used 3-D coupled water flow and heat transport simulations applying the HydroGeoSphere code in combination with high-resolution observations of hydraulic heads and temperatures to quantify reach-scale water and heat flux across the river-groundwater interface and hyporheic temperature dynamics of a lowland gravel bed river. The model was calibrated in order to constrain estimates of the most sensitive model parameters. The magnitude and variations of the simulated temperatures matched the observed ones, with an average mean absolute error of 0.7 degrees C and an average Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.87. Our results indicate that nonsubmerged streambed structures such as gravel bars cause substantial thermal heterogeneity within the saturated sediment at the reach scale. Individual hyporheic flow path temperatures strongly depend on the flow path residence time, flow path depth, river, and groundwater temperature. Variations in individual hyporheic flow path temperatures were up to 7.9 degrees C, significantly higher than the daily average (2.8 degrees C), but still lower than the average seasonal hyporheic temperature difference (19.2 degrees C). The distribution between flow path temperatures and residence times follows a power law relationship with exponent of about 0.37. Based on this empirical relation, we further estimated the influence of hyporheic flow path residence time and temperature on oxygen consumption which was found to partly increase by up to 29% in simulations.

AB In this study, water level models are constructed to characterize mangrove flooding across urban gradients in Puerto Rico. The most urban sites exhibited 95% longer hydroperiods, 23% lower flood frequencies, and 110% lower depths than the least urban sites. Rainfall importance was explained more by geomorphology and tidal connectivity than by urbanization, but there was evidence for changes in tidal amplitudes along the urban gradient. Relationships between surface water chemical metrics and land cover contradicted previous studies by suggesting lower nutrients and biochemical oxygen demand with increasing urbanization. However, much of this changed with the exclusion of potential outlier sites, as well as under different statistical comparisons. These results reinforce the understanding that the most important drivers of urban mangrove hydrology and water quality in Puerto Rico are likely geomorphology and tidal connectivity, with some influence from surrounding land cover. Results should be considered alongside the reported errors stemming from digital elevation and rainfall response models.

AB Considering the rapid expansion of urban populations and the corresponding urbanization of landscapes, a dearth of knowledge exists regarding the role of urban vegetation in modulating urban ecosystem functioning. In response to the need for the development of new approaches to quantify ecohydrological processes along urban-to-rural gradients at alternate scales, this study explores the relationship between individual plant selection choices in landscaping and changes in urban hydrological functioning. This research examines differences in the variation of rainfall interception, leaf hydrophobicity, canopy structure, and water storage, between 13 species in an urban, semi-arid location. The species studied were selected based on resident preferences, and hence this research considers the role that urban residents play, through individual choices, in modifying the ecohydrology of an urban watershed. Rainfall interception, canopy surface storage, leaf hydrophobicity, and water droplet retention were significantly different between species. Results indicate that individual choice in plant selection for landscaping may influence urban hydrology.

AB To improve understanding of DOC dynamics in seasonal Mediterranean environments, rainfall, soil water, groundwater and stream water samples were taken during a 27-month period in the Can Vila catchment (northeast Spain). Using these data, we characterized DOC dynamics in the different hydrological compartments and analysed the factors affecting them. We also analysed DOC dynamics during storm events and the factors that control DOC delivery to the stream. The results show some seasonality in rainwater and soil water DOC concentrations, while no clear seasonality was observed in stream water and groundwater, where DOC dynamics were strongly related to discharge and water table variations. For storm events with several discharge peaks, the slope of the discharge-DOC concentration relationship was higher for the first peak. The rather similar dynamics of stream water DOC concentration in all floods contrast with the observed diversity of hydrological processes. This raises the question of the origin of the observed rapid DOC increase.e

AB A new seasonal and annual dataset describing Arctic sea ice extents for 1901-2015 was constructed by individually re-calibrating sea ice data sources from the three Arctic regions (North American, Nordic and Siberian) using the corresponding surface air temperature trends for the pre-satellite era (1901-1978), so that the strong relationship between seasonal sea ice extent and surface air temperature observed for the satellite era (1979-present) also applies to the pre-satellite era. According to this new dataset, the recent period of Arctic sea ice retreat since the 1970s followed a period of sea ice growth after the mid-1940s, which in turn followed a period of sea ice retreat after the 1910s. Arctic sea ice is a key component of the Arctic hydrological cycle, through both its freshwater storage role and its influence on oceanic and atmospheric circulation. Therefore, these new insights have significance for our understanding of Arctic hydrology.

AB qThe Horton-Strahler concept has been important in river basin geomorphology; it describes scaling properties and identifies GIUH but has also attracted criticisms, because it depends on the threshold area S, which is used to extract the channel network from digital elevation models (DEM), on the position of the outlet and on the few number of ratios used to identify the scaling laws. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes new indices independently of S and which have similar properties than the Horton-Strahler ratios. Applications were conducted on seven French basins. The methodology consists on analyzing the morphometric properties, such as the drained area, the number of sources, and the length of the channel network as a function of S. The results show that Horton-Strahler ratios vary considerably with S. Particularly, while the Omega-order length L-Omega is a staircase function of S, results show that the channel network is articulated around two main nodes independent of S, which are descriptors of L-Omega. Then, we compared the properties of Horton-Strahler laws to those obtained from self-similarity analysis, which enables to define new indices independent of S. These indices are calculated automatically from DEM, have similar properties as the Horton-Strahler ratios, and are used to calculate the GIUH independently of S. The four new descriptors R-Be, R-Le, R-Ae, and L-e, which have similar properties as R-B, R-L, R-A, and L-Omega respectively, are equivalent to those of Horton-Strahler's laws and can be used as indicators of hydrological similarity for catchment comparison and regionalization.

AB This study focuses mainly on increases in peak discharges with reductions in recurrence intervals for design hydrographs due to growing imperviousness. Rainfall-runoff simulation is a major basis for analyzing the hydrological. effects of urbanization. Available recordings of 50 rainfall-runoff events during 1966-2002 were used as the study sample. Forty events were calibrated to determine the relationships between impervious areas and hydrological parameters in the Nash and SCS models. Block Kriging and non-linear programming methods were used to estimate the mean rainfall and its hourly excess value, respectively. The remaining 10 cases were used to test the established relationships. Calibration and verification results confirm that the methods used in this study effectively illustrate the hydrological and geomorphic conditions in complex urbanization processes. The rainfall-runoff routings, by using the design storm approach and the established relationships, demonstrated the following: (1) peak flows of the design flood hydrographs increased by about 127, 266, 375, 440, 515, 564, 593, and 629 m(3)/s for eight return periods, respectively; (2) peak times were individually shortened from 9 to 6 h due to urbanization; (3) the recurrence intervals of 200, 100, 50, and 25 years before urbanization were reduced to about 88, 33, 16, and 8 years also due to urbanization if they would have occurred at the present time within the Wu-Tu watershed. Finally, these analytical results can be obtained easily from the designed diagram that shows the relationships among peak discharges, impervious areas and return periods. This research can be used to prevent disasters, toss of life and property damage. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an investigation on the combined effect of fluid rheology and permeability variations on the propagation of porous gravity currents in axisymmetric geometry. The fluid is taken to be of power-law type with behaviour index n and the permeability to depend from the distance from the source as a power-law function of exponent beta. The model represents the injection of a current of non-Newtonian fluid along a vertical bore hole in porous media with space-dependent properties. The injection is either instantaneous (alpha = 0) or continuous (alpha > 0). A self-similar solution describing the rate of propagation and the profile of the current is derived under the assumption of small aspect ratio between the current average thickness and length. The limitations on model parameters imposed by the model assumptions are discussed in depth, considering currents of increasing/decreasing velocity, thickness, and aspect ratio, and the sensitivity of the radius, thickness, and aspect ratio to model parameters. Several critical values of alpha and beta discriminating between opposite tendencies are thus determined. Experimental validation is performed using shear-thinning suspensions and Newtonian mixtures in different regimes. A box filled with ballotini of different diameter is used to reproduce the current, with observations from the side and bottom. Most experimental results for the radius and profile of the current agree well with the self-similar solution except at the beginning of the process, due to the limitations of the 2-D assumption and to boundary effects near the injection zone. The results for this specific case corroborate a general model for currents with constant or time-varying volume of power-law fluids propagating in porous domains of plane or radial geometry, with uniform or varying permeability, and the possible effect of channelization. All results obtained in the present and previous papers for the key parameters governing the dynamics of power-law gravity currents are summarized and compared to infer the combinations of parameters leading to the fastest/lowest rate of propagation, and of variation of thickness and aspect ratio.

AB Transaction costs are fundamental to implementing, evaluating, and monitoring public policy/programs for social, economic, and/or environmental welfare. Empirical accounting for transaction costs helps identify and evaluate adaptive public policy or program arrangements that improve future institutional choices under uncertainty. However, examples of empirical transaction cost studies are few, due largely to persistent measurement challenges and limits to transaction cost comprehension. A lack of studies limits both insights into the importance of transaction costs in institutional design and validation of theories surrounding cost trajectories over time under different institutional arrangements. In this paper we apply time series analysis to a unique database of public salinity management program transaction costs in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. Our study provides insights into the role of transaction costs in institutional efficiency and on empirical approaches to considering relationships between observed transaction cost trajectories and the efficiency of associated institutions. Our results indicate that the Murray-Darling Basin salinity management program succeeded in generating persistent declines in transaction costs and river salinity levels over time. We suggest some possible reasons for this that are associated with institutional design and reflect on what these findings may mean for other jurisdictions.

AB This study focuses on changes of biogeochemical parameters related to variable rainfall-runoff conditions and to land cover types for eight headwater catchments in Central Europe. Linear regression, Spearman rank correlation, principal component analysis and C/Q (concentration - discharge) hysteresis loops revealed the main relationships. The presence of peatbogs and waterlogged spruce forests had a decisive influence on the biogeochemistry (COD = chemical oxygen demand measured using the permanganate method(Mn), humins, Fe, P-PO43- TP = total phosphorus, N-NO3-). The strongest positive correlation of organic matter and Fe is represented in a catchment with the largest area of damaged forest (70%), but with a smaller proportion of waterlogged areas (8%). High flow rates influence greater release of organic matter and N-NO3-. The catchment with the highest (80%) peatbog cover and the catchment that had undergone revitalization showed similar behaviour in terms of water biogeochemistry. The type of rainfall-runoff event affected the velocity of pH changes, whereas the variability in electric conductivity was also controlled by the catchment characteristics and hydrological preconditions.

AB Effective management of water resources requires an understanding of local hydrology and its links to precipitation. This study provides insights into geometeorological controls on precipitation and the hydraulic relationship between the water sources in the Doon Valley of the Indian Himalaya. Results suggest that inherent variance in isotopic characteristics of precipitation is closely associated with the evolution of different sources of moisture and topographic features. Back trajectories and d-excess suggest that precipitation is transported from the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Mediterranean Sea. The differences in slopes and intercepts of delta O-18-delta H-2 regressions with space reveal that evaporation and local recycling regulate the compositional variation of precipitation. The study suggests a strong hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater and recharge through flowpaths with higher permeability, where the Indian summer monsoon acts as the dominant replenishment input. Using the vertical isotopic gradient of precipitation, the groundwater feeding zones were also determined.

AB In this article, we explore the soil water effect on vegetation growth in west-central Africa using remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture content (nSMC), terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), and leaf area index (LAI). TWSA is the only data to reflect deeper soil water used by perennial plants with their deep root systems, which microwave sensors cannot observe. However, deep groundwater complicates investigating the water availability of plants using TWSA. We confirmed that the TWSA's slope during the dry season, which might be caused by vegetation transpiration, was steeper towards equatorial regions. Our results show that the relationship between LAI and the TWSA's inclination during the dry season was negatively correlated in areas where the LAI was below 2 and the precipitation was less than 40 mm/month. This finding might enable us to investigate the water availability of perennial plants by focusing on the TWSA's slope during the dry season.

AB Evaporation is important basic information for irrigation decision making in water resources management. Developing countries usually use a small pan to observe surface evaporation, but the relationship between evaporation in different small pans is not sufficiently clear. In this paper, we use an extreme learning machine (ELM) model to predict and convert E20 (diameter 0.20 m) and E601 (diameter 0.62 m) pan data for 38 meteorological stations in southern China. Firstly, we obtained the best combination of meteorological parameters for forecasting E20 and E601, respectively, and we also found that the accuracy of the model can be significantly improved by adding pan data. Secondly, we found that during the conversion between E20 and E601, the model performance when using E601 data to predict the E20 evaporation is better than that when using E20 data to predict the E601 evaporation. Finally, the geographical factors were analysed, and the model performance was found to be relatively poor in the coastal area and the North-South junction.

AB Based on a three-month-scale standardized precipitation index (SPI-3) computed from the available rainfall data of 13 stations of Niger, meteorological drought trends, periodicities and the relationships with 10 oceanic-atmospheric variables were analysed using the Mann-Kendall test, continuous wavelet transform and cross-wavelet analysis, respectively. The results revealed a significant (p < 5%) increase in drought at five of the 13 stations. A common dominant drought periodicity of 2 years was found at all of the stations, whereas significant periodicities varied from 2 to 32 years at six stations. Among the considered climate indices, South Atlantic sea-surface temperature, Southern Oscillation Index, sea-level pressure, geopotential height and relative humidity from the Atlantic basin oscillated in anti-phase relative to the SPI-3 at an inter-annual to decadal time scale from 1960 to 1990. In this period, relative humidity from the Mediterranean basin and zonal wind oscillated in phase with the drought index.

AB Hydrological and glaciological data were gathered in the watershed (1.37 km(2)) of the Antizana Glacier 15 (0.7 km(2)) in the periods 1997-2002 and 1995-2005, respectively. In addition, tracer experiments were carried out to analyse the flow through permeable morainic deposits located between the glacier snout and the runoff gauging station. Over 11 years, the mean specific net balance of the glacier was negative (-627 mm w.e.), despite the occurrence of positive values in the La Nina years (1999-2000). From the glacier net mass balance between 1997 and 2002, it was found that the mean flow originating from ice melt was significantly higher than the mean discharge measured at the hydrological station. Analyses of tracer experiments and of the different components of the hydrological balance suggest groundwater flow that originates below the glacier accounts for the remaining water. This result is important for regional analyses of available water resources and for the relationship between hydro-cryospheric processes and volcanic activity.

ID STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; RETURN PERIOD; SPI; RISK
AB A methodology using the standardised precipitation index is proposed to develop critical drought intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves. We define dry periods within which we recognise droughts of different durations. The most severe drought for each drought duration in each year is called the critical drought. The total probability theorem-coupled frequency analysis is used to determine the best-fit probability distribution function of drought severity, which is then converted to intensity. The generalised extreme value probability distribution function is found to best fit the critical drought severity. The methodology is implemented using monthly precipitation data for a meteorological station in Turkey. The critical drought intensity decreases linearly with increasing drought duration, whereas the return period increases exponentially when the drought becomes more severe. The site-specific IDF curves furnished with an empirical relationship between the intensity and return period allow one to characterise the drought not by an index-based intensity but by its return period. This kind of presentation is physically easier to understand, in particular for stakeholders and decision makers in practice.

AB Rainfall-runoff models usually present good results, but parameter calibration sometimes is tedious and subjective, and in many cases it depends on additional data surveys in the field. An alternative to the conceptual models is provided by empirical models, which relate input and output by means of an arbitrary mathematical function that bears no direct relationship to the physical characteristics of the rainfall-runoff process. This category includes the artificial neural networks (ANNs), whose implementation is the main focus of this paper. This study evaluated the capacity of ANNs to model with accuracy the monthly rainfall-runoff process. The case study was performed in the Jangada River basin, Parana, Brazil. The results of the three ANNs that produced the best results were compared to those of a conceptual model at monthly time scale, IPHMEN. The ANNs presented the best results with highest correlation coefficients and Nash-Sutcliffe statistics and the smallest difference of volume. Citation Machado, F., Mine, M., Kaviski, E. Fill, H.

AB This study aimed to develop a new approach to build a functioning groundwater monitoring system by detecting a reduced set of observation wells (OWs) that optimally matches the hydraulic heads measured by other OWs within the field, namely as leader wells (LWs). The optimization models used in this work are the well-known genetic algorithm (GA) and modified genetic algorithm (MGA) and a new progressive combination (PC) model. Optimization was applied to achieve three sequential selection processes: best input combinations (BICk), LWs and core leader wells (CLWs). This approach was applied to the Assiut New Barrage (ANB), a megaproject located in Assiut city, Egypt. The results show that nine LWs among 33 OWs are adequate for regular monitoring, with a reduction ratio of 72.72%. Moreover, assigning CLWs among LWs increases the accuracy of fitting to existing OWs, and helps in understanding the spatial relationships among OWs.

AB Spatial and seasonal variations of curve number (CN) and initial abstraction ratio () in a watershed can result in inaccurate runoff volume estimations when using the US Natural Resources Conservation Service (SCS-CN) method with constant values for these parameters. In this paper, parameters of CN and are considered as calibration parameters and the sensitivity of estimated runoff to these parameters using the SCS-CN method is scrutinized. To incorporate the uncertainty associated with CN and , fuzzy linear regression (FLR) is applied to derive the relationships of CN and with rainfall depth (P) by employing a large dataset of storm events from four watersheds in Iran. Results indicate that the proposed approach provides more accuracy in estimation of runoff volume compared to the SCS method with constant values of CN and , and gives a straightforward technique for evaluating the hydrological effects of CN, , and P on runoff volume.

AB The flood peak is the dominating characteristic in nearly all flood-statistical analyses. Contrary to the general assumptions of design flood estimation, the peak is not closely related to other flood characteristics. Differentiation of floods into types provides a more realistic view. Often different parts of the probability distribution function of annual flood peaks are dominated by different flood types, which raises the question how shifts in flood regimes would modify the statistics of annual maxima. To answer this, a distinction into five flood types is proposed; then, temporal changes in flood-type frequencies are investigated. We show that the frequency of floods caused by heavy rain has increased significantly in recent years. A statistical model is developed that simulates peaks for each event type by type-specific peak-volume relationships. In a simulation study, we show how changes in frequency of flood event type lead to changes in the quantiles of annual maximum series.

AB In this surface water modelling study, a new spatial evaluation for assessing the impact of urbanization was applied for the semi-arid watersheds intersecting with the Gaza coastal aquifer. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated in a semi-automated approach for streamflow in the main watersheds. The results show that the model could simulate water budget components adequately within the complex semi-arid watersheds. Linear relationships between the change in urban area and the corresponding change in surface runoff or percolation were concluded for the urbanized sub-basins. The urban-surface runoff index (USI) and the urban-percolation index (UPI) were developed to represent a micro-level evaluation of different urban change scenarios in the sub-basins. The global urban-surface runoff index (GUSI) and the global urban-percolation index (GUPI) were derived as macro-level factors reflecting the influence on the overall Gaza coastal aquifer due to urban area expansion.

AB The assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution has proved to be an effective tool for water resource management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions like Mahdia and Ksour Essaf. The main objective of this study is to assess the aquifer vulnerability by applying the DRASTIC method as well as using sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of each DRASTIC parameter on the final vulnerability map. An additional objective is to demonstrate the role of the GIS techniques in the vulnerability assessment. The DRASTIC method assigns a high vulnerability to the coast of the Mahdia-Ksour Essaf. The lowest values are observed in the southern part of the study area. A sensitivity analysis applied in this study suggests that net recharge, aquifer media and depth of groundwater are the key factors determining vulnerability. The model is validated with groundwater quality data and the results have shown strong relationships between modified DRASTIC Vulnerability Index and nitrate and chloride concentrations.

AB In this paper a fuzzy dynamic wave routing model (FDWRM) for unsteady flow simulation in open channels is presented. The continuity equation of the dynamic wave routing model is preserved in its original form while the momentum equation is replaced by a fuzzy rule based model which is developed on the principle that during unsteady flow the disturbances in the form of discontinuities in the gradient of the physical parameters will propagate along the characteristics with a velocity equal to that of velocity of the shallow water wave. The model gets rid off the assumptions associated with the momentum equation by replacing it with the fuzzy rule based model. It overcomes the necessity of calculating friction slope (S-f) in flow routing and hence the associated uncertainties are eliminated. The robustness of the fuzzy rule based model enables the FDWRM to march the solution even in regions where the aforementioned assumptions are violated. Also the model can be used for flow routing in curved channels. When the model is applied to hypothetical flood routing problems in a river it is observed that the results are comparable to those of an implicit numerical model (INM) which solves the dynamic wave equations using an implicit numerical scheme. The model is also applied to a real case of flow routing in a field canal. The results match well with the measured data and the model performs better than the INK Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Knowledge of the relationship between rainfall intensity and kinetic energy and its variations in time and space is important for erosion prediction. However, between studies considerable variations exist in the reported shape and coefficients of this relationship. Some differences can be explained by methods of measurement and interpretation and sample size. range and bias, while part of the variability corresponds to actual differences in rainfall generating mechanisms. The present paper critically reviews published studies of rainfall intensity and kinetic energy with a view to derive a general predictive equation of an exponential form. The performance of this general equation is compared to that of existing equations using measured rainfall intensity and kinetic energy data for a site in southeastern Australia. It appeared that the energy of individual storms could only be predicted with limited accuracy because of natural variations in rainfall characteristics. By and large. the general equation produced energy estimates that were within 10% of predictions by a range of parameterisations of the exponential model fitted to specific data-sets. Re-calculation of rainfall erosivity factors as obtained by the older and revised USLE approaches does not seem warranted for most locations. However, in regions experiencing strong oceanic influence or at high elevations, overall C rainfall energy appears to be considerably lower than predicted by the general or USLE equations. Conversely, data collected at semi-arid to sub-humid locations suggest that rainfall energy may be higher than expected under those conditions. Standardised measurements are needed to evaluate rainfall intensity-kinetic energy relationships for such areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three change-point methodologies were used to detect changes in the mean value of annual streamflow series and analyse simultaneous changes in large-scale global sea surface temperature (SST) oscillations. To verify the relationship between the variables we used wavelet coherence analysis. A preliminary detection skill test was performed using asynthetic series and Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) presented the best results among the methods used (Pettitt test, Bai and Perron algorithm) when combined with a penalty selection via the Changepoints for a Range of Penalties (CROPS) method. However, the use of classical penalty functions resulted in a poor performance of PELT. The three methods showed an extremely high convergence rate (> 90%) for the correct change points and a smaller rate for false positives (< 24%). Changes in the streamflow mean value coincided with phase shift of the low-frequency indices Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), also corroborated by the wavelet results. Most of the changes can be associated with phase shift impacts in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone.

AB The discharge variability of the main rivers that drain the Guyana Shield is analysed over the last 50 years using cross-wavelet, coherence and composite analysis involving oceanic and atmospheric variables. We highlight the overall hydro-climatological homogeneity of this region that allowed us to focus on the longest discharge time series available. Therefore, a wavelet cross-analysis was carried out between monthly and seasonal Maroni River discharge at the Langa Tabiki station and selected climate indices. This confirms a strong relationship between the hydrology of the Guyana Shield and the Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) fluctuations. There is evidence of intermittent influence, of between inter-annual and near decadal scales, of the Atlantic SST fluctuations, in particular around 1970 and 1990. Finally, we show that the links between oceanic regions and high discharge in the rivers of Guyana are realized through the reinforcement of the Walker and Hadley cells between the Amazon and the adjacent oceans and through decreased trade winds and monsoon flux that favour the persistence of humidity over the Guyana Shield.

AB Socio-hydrology has recently garnered attention as a promising research paradigm among hydrologists. In this paper, we argue that viewing the socio-hydrological systems as a network of causal factors can assist in these efforts by revealing emergent properties of socio-hydrological systems. These factors, which are neither actors nor affiliations but symbolic representations of miscellaneous phenomena, represent the key variables affecting socio-hydrological system behaviour. Despite being crucial for understanding system dynamics, these factors are not captured by most equations of coupled human-water coevolutionary models. To demonstrate our method, we use qualitative case study research to analyse the Jaguaribe Basin in Ceara State-Brazil as a network of factors, i.e. mental conceptions, and representations of water resource management experts. We show that most results are unsurprising, exhibiting expected causal relationships. However, there was at least one unexpected result, which showed that the variable "conflict" was the single most sensitive variable to systemic evolution.

AB The vegetation in channels results in the loss of energy from, and the retardance of, flowing water. However, it helps to stabilize the slopes and bottoms of open channels. Recently, vegetated channels have been utilized to improve the quality of surface water and reduce the delivery of sediment and nutrient to rivers and swales. Accordingly, understanding the velocity distribution of vegetated channels is important. The velocity distribution above the canopy is normally assumed to follow the well-accepted logarithmic law, whereas that below the canopy follows an exponential law or power law. However, logarithmic, exponential, and power laws can be affected by some characteristics of the vegetation, resulting in a highly inaccurate description of velocity distributions in vegetated channels. In this study, a velocity distribution equation that is based on probability is developed for submerged vegetated channels. An extensive series of laboratory experiments were performed using Egeria densa, and the results of earlier research on channel beds of flumes are adopted to devise and validate a velocity distribution equation. The results reveal that the developed model of velocity distribution can be used to study the effect of submerged aquatic vegetation on velocity distribution.

AB Based on a future temperature increase of 0.5 degrees C and precipitation decrease of 25%, the climate elasticity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature changes in 12 Andean watersheds of the Coquimbo Region, north-central Chile, was assessed. Also, the possible relationships between this elasticity and specific physiographic characteristics of the watersheds (area, average elevation, slope distribution, terrain roughness, slope orientation, vegetation cover) were studied. Climate elasticity of streamflow ranged between 0 and 2.8. Watersheds presenting higher elevations, with a fairly well-balanced distribution of slope exposure tend to exhibit lower elasticity, which could be explained by the contribution of snowfall to the hydrological regime, more significant in those watersheds. Results should be considered when downscaling climate model projections at the basin scale in mountain settings. Finally, uncertainties in the approach, given by factors such as streamflow seasonality, data availability and representativeness and watershed characteristics, and therefore the scope of the results, are discussed.

AB The origin of groundwater and the processes controlling its chemical composition in complex coastal aquifers are of interest, as about 44% of the world's population lives in coastal areas. Groundwater over-exploitation in the highly urbanized coastal regions has exerted pressure on these aquifers, leading to seawater intrusion. This study aimed to identify (1) the complex relationship between natural and anthropogenic factors, and (2) the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry in an over-stressed coastal aquifer of southern India. The results indicate an increase in the extent of seawater intrusion from 4 km in 1969 to 17 km in 2014. Major hydrogeochemical processes controlling the aquifers are evaporation, ion exchange and dissolution of aluminosilicates, gypsum, halites and calcites. The integrated use of field investigation with hydrochemical, isotopic and hydrogeochemical modelling techniques allowed a conceptual model of the groundwater salinization process over 46 years to be developed as a basis for designing sustainable management measures.

AB Multi-objective optimisation is being increasingly applied in water supply management to identify optimal operating options. However, a key challenge in the implementation of multi-objective optimisation is interpreting the large and multidimensional Pareto-optimal set. This paper shows how cluster, visual and post-optimisation analysis can aid the decision maker in addressing this challenge. This is demonstrated for a case study based on South East Queensland Water Grid, Australia, as part of a broader operational planning framework. Firstly, cluster analysis identifies a smaller set of representative options to aid in visual analysis. Secondly, visual analysis techniques are used to identify the trade-offs between objectives, the relationships between decision variables and objective performance, and to shortlist promising operating options. Finally, post-optimisation analysis techniques identify efficient operating options from the Pareto set, based on decision-maker preferences. Together these techniques can be used to identify a shortlist of operating options, for further consideration using multicriteria analysis.

AB This study focuses on the variability of lake evaporation and also the periodic relationships among hydro-meteorological variables. The monthly hydro-meteorological data of Lake Keban were investigated by wavelet transforms. The results show that the main periodicity is on an annual scale. This periodicity is weaker for precipitation and wind speed but higher for evaporation, temperature, runoff and relative humidity. In addition to this, the continuous wavelet figures show some weak periodicities on the almost 10-year scale level but they are not continuous over time. Also, strong events on a short-term monthly scale are seen for evaporation, precipitation and runoff in 1988. This event in 1988 may be explained by the 1988 La Nina event, which was one of the strongest on record. Also, the periodicities on the 2-8-month scales in the precipitation data can be interpreted as being connected with the strong El Nino events of 1982 and 1992.

AB This work presents a proposal for the use of spontaneous potential logs to estimate the water quality in permeable layers of a formation that are located below the water table in uncased boreholes. These estimates aim to obtain the values for conductivity and total dissolved solids, which would enable us to learn their distributions with depth and determine the optimal extraction levels prior to completing these boreholes. This proposal consists of a methodology to process and interpret spontaneous potential logs. Laboratory measurements have been necessary to obtain the water resistivities versus their equivalent resistivities and versus the total dissolved solids. In addition, continuous analytical relationships have been developed for the range of applications found, and specific algorithms have been developed to determine the baseline of the spontaneous potential log. This methodology has been applied to a group of 27 boreholes located in the southern Duero continental detrital basin.

AB Predicting the impacts of climate change on water resources remains a challenging task and requires a good understanding of the dynamics of the forcing terms in the past. In this study, the variability of precipitation and drought patterns is studied over the Mediterranean catchment of the Medjerda in Tunisia based on an observed rainfall dataset collected at 41 raingauges during the period 1973-2012. The standardized precipitation index and the aridity index were used to characterize drought variability. Multivariate and geostatistical techniques were further employed to identify the spatial variability of annual rainfall. The results show that the Medjerda is marked by a significant spatio-temporal variability of drought, with varying extreme wet and dry events. Four regions with distinct rainfall regimes are identified by utilizing the K-means cluster analysis. A principal component analysis identifies the variables that are responsible for the relationships between precipitation and drought variability.

TI Transition from transient Theis wells to steady Thiem wells
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Simple analytical calculations of groundwater flow around wells usually employ the Thiem well formula for steady calculations and the Theis formula for transient calculations. The superposition principle can be used with both formulas and even for combinations of both formulas. It is generally assumed that flow converges to a steady state when the boundary conditions remain constant for a long time. However, the heads in Theis's formula do not converge to steady heads for large times, although the (specific) discharges do converge to those of the steady Thiem well. This undesirable behaviour of the Theis solution can be compensated by means of a new function: the ring well. The ring well is a combination of Theis's well and Glover's well (solution for a transient well in a circular island). A second function, uniform recharge during a time interval, is needed to assure that the heads converge at a specific level. The functions also allow an analytical transition with Theis wells between any two steady states consisting of Thiem wells. The functions do not have a wide range of practical applications but they increase insight into the relationship between the two main functions in groundwater flow.

AB In this paper, a new flow resistance equation for rill flow was deduced applying dimensional analysis and self-similarity theory. At first, the incomplete self-similarity hypothesis was used for establishing the flow velocity distribution whose integration gives the theoretical expression of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. Then the deduced theoretical resistance equation was tested by some measurements of flow velocity, water depth, cross section area, wetted perimeter, and bed slope carried out in 106 reaches of some rills shaped on an experimental plot. A relationship between the velocity profile, the channel slope, and the flow Froude number was also established. The analysis showed that the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor can be accurately estimated by the proposed theoretical approach based on a power-velocity profile.

AB The displacement of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in permeable porous rock by water saturating the surrounding fractures is studied. In many situations of practical interest, capillarity is the dominant driving force. Using the global pressure concept, it is shown that the water saturation is driven by a generic non-linear diffusion equation governing the matrix block counter-current spontaneous imbibition. In addition, in most cases, the saturation-dependent diffusion coefficient vanishes at the saturation end points, that renders the driving equation highly singular.In this paper, two exact asymptotic solutions valid for short and long times are presented, under the assumption that the conductivity vanishes as a power-law of both phase saturations at the extreme values of the fluid saturation.Focusing on the late-time domain, the asymptotic solution is derived using an Ansatz that is written under the form of a power-law time decay of the NAPL saturation. In the spatial domain, this solution is an eigenvector of the non-linear diffusion operator driving the saturation, for a problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions. If the diffusion coefficient varies as a power law of the NAPL saturation, the spatial variations of the solution are given analytically for a one-dimensional porous medium corresponding to parallel fracture planes. The analytical solution is in very good agreement with results of numerical simulations involving various realistic sets of input transport parameters.Generalization to the case of two-or three-dimensional matrix blocks of arbitrary shape is proposed using a similar Ansatz, solution of a non-linear eigenvalue problem. A fast converging algorithm based on a fixed-point sequence starting from a suitable first guess was developed. Comparisons with full-time simulations for several typical block geometries show an excellent agreement.These results permit to set-up an analytical formulation generalizing linear single-phase representation of matrix-to-fracture exchange term. It accounts for the non-linearity of the local flow equations using the power-law dependence of the conductivity for low NAPL saturation. The corresponding exponent can be predicted from the input conductivity parameters. Similar findings are also presented and validated numerically for two-or three-dimensional matrix blocks. That original approach paves the way to research leading to a more faithful description of matrix-to-fracture exchanges when considering a realistic fractured medium composed of a population of matrix blocks of various size and shapes.

AB The temporal and spatial characteristics of soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were analysed to explore the relative contributions of temperature and precipitation to soil moisture change. Non-significant changes in soil moisture were observed for the TP over the period 1950-2010, while a seasonal cycle was evident, with higher values in summer and smaller values in winter. The soil moisture showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, with higher values in the south than in the north of the TP. The soil moisture fluctuated with time, jointly influenced by precipitation and temperature changes, with precipitation the dominant factor, while temperature regulated the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation. The relative contribution of precipitation to soil moisture changes was over 80%, except for winter in which temperature was the dominant factor, with a relative contribution of more than 70%. Because of the sharp increase in temperature in winter, the uneven spatial distribution of soil moisture over the TP might harm the fragile ecological environment.

AB Four models of increasing complexity were tested and compared to simulate snow water equivalent at the local scale in the Moroccan High Atlas range. A classical temperature index model (TI) and three enhanced temperature index models that respectively include the potential clear-sky direct radiation (HTI), the incoming solar radiation (ETI-A) and net solar radiation (ETI-B), were subjected to annual and multi-annual calibration and cross-validated over the period 2003-2010. When calibrated yearly, the ETI models could be better transferred to other years, whereas all models, including the simple TI model, showed good transferability when calibrated over a longer period that includes inter-annual climate variability. No strong and recurrent relationships emerged between yearly calibrated model parameters and annual climate conditions. However, strong parameter compensation was observed for the enhanced models, which can be explained partly by the collinearity of air temperature and solar radiation causing equifinality of model parameters.

AB Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) affects the soil hydrological process and is influenced by many factors that exhibit strong spatial variations. To accurately measure K-s and its scale, spatial variability and relationship with collapsing gullies, we analysed four double-ring infiltrometer diameters in three soil layers during in situ experiments designed to measure K-s in two typical collapsing gullies (three slope sites) in Tongcheng County of China. The results showed that K-s increased with increasing inner ring diameter, but no significant difference existed between inner diameters of 30 and 40 cm. The K-s in red soil layers was higher than that in sandy soil layers, the transition layers had the lowest values. K-s also varied with slope position, gradually decreasing with distance from the gully head. The suggestion is that the spatial variation in K-s is affected not only by the intrinsic soil properties but also by the interaction with the collapsing gully.

AB This paper investigates the impact of the Hungry Horse Dam on streamflow dynamics in the South Fork of the Flathead River, Montana, USA. To this end, pre- and post-dam periods of raw and naturalized streamflow data were analysed. Pettitt's change point analysis indicated a significant change point in streamflow dynamics due to dam construction. Complexities in the pre- and post-dam periods were evaluated by sample and multi-scale entropy analyses, and the entropies of the post-dam period were found to be higher than those of the pre-dam period. Possible reasons for this, unrelated to the natural hydrological cycle caused by the dam, were analysed using wavelet analyses. The wavelet analyses showed a clear change in the phase relationship between precipitation and streamflow. Finally, weak positive trends found in the hydrological variables indicated the effects of human activities (e.g. dam construction). The results also revealed distorted lead times, which can improve the streamflow forecasts for different lead times.

AB Acceleration of the global water cycle over recent decades remains uncertain because of the high inter-annual variability of its components. Observations of pan evaporation (E-pan), a proxy of potential evapotranspiration (ETp), may help to identify trends in the water cycle over long periods. The complementary relationship (CR) states that ETp and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) depend on each other in a complementary manner, through land-atmosphere feedbacks in water-limited environments. Using a long-term series of E-pan observations in Australia, we estimated monthly ETa by the CR and compared our estimates with ETa measured at eddy covariance Fluxnet stations. The results confirm that our approach, entirely data-driven, can reliably estimate ETa only in water-limited conditions. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that ETa did not show any significant trend in the last 30 years, while short-term analysis may indicate a rapid climate change that is not perceived in a long-term perspective.

AB The development of statistical relationships between local hydroclimates and large-scale atmospheric variables enhances the understanding of hydroclimate variability. The rainfall in the study basin (the Upper Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand) is influenced by the Indian Ocean and tropical Pacific Ocean atmospheric circulation. Using correlation analysis and cross-validated multiple regression, the large-scale atmospheric variables, such as temperature, pressure and wind, over given regions are identified. The forecasting models using atmospheric predictors show the capability of long-lead forecasting. The modified k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) model, which is developed using the identified predictors to forecast rainfall, and evaluated by likelihood function, shows a long-lead forecast of monsoon rainfall at 7-9 months. The decreasing performance in forecasting dry-season rainfall is found for both short and long lead times. The developed model also presents better performance in forecasting pre-monsoon season rainfall in dry years compared to wet years, and vice versa for monsoon season rainfall.

AB Freshwater and sediment are crucial to the development and health of aquatic and wetland ecosystems in deltaic coastal regions. This study examines the long-term freshwater inflow (1940-2002) and total suspended solid loading (1978-2001), and their relationships with climate variables in three major river watersheds to Lake Pontchartrain, the largest inland estuary in the USA. The results show an average total annual freshwater inflow of 5.04 km(3) and an average total annual sediment loading of 210 360 t, with the highest contributions from the Amite River watershed. Over 69% of annual inflow occurred within the six months from December to May. About 66-71% of the annual total suspended solid loading occurred within the four months from January to April. An increasing trend of annual water inflow and sediment discharge was found in the Amite River watershed over the past 60 years, coinciding with the fastest population growth in this upper Lake Pontchartrain basin.

AB Optical disdrometers can be used to estimate rainfall erosivity; however, the relative accuracy of different disdrometers is unclear. This study compared three types of optical laser-based disdrometers to quantify differences in measured rainfall characteristics and to develop correction factors for kinetic energy (KE). Two identical PWS100 (Campbell Scientific), one Laser Precipitation Monitor (Thies Clima) and a first-generation Parsivel (OTT) were collocated with a weighing rain gauge (OTT Pluvio(2)) at a site in Austria. All disdrometers underestimated total rainfall compared to the rain gauge with relative biases from 2% to 29%. Differences in drop size distribution and velocity resulted in different KE estimates. By applying a linear regression to the KE-intensity relationship of each disdrometer, a correction factor for KE between the disdrometers was developed. This factor ranged from 1.15 to 1.36 and allowed comparison of KE between different disdrometer types despite differences in measured drop size and velocity.

AB In cold region environments, any alteration in the hydro-climatic regime can have profound impacts on river ice processes. This paper studies the implications of hydro-climatic trends on river ice processes, particularly on the freeze-up and ice-cover breakup along the Athabasca River in Fort McMurray in western Canada, which is an area very prone to ice-jam flooding. Using a stochastic approach in a one-dimensional hydrodynamic river ice model, a relationship between overbank flow and breakup discharge is established. Furthermore, the likelihood of ice-jam flooding in the future (2041-2070 period) is assessed by forcing a hydrological model with meteorological inputs from the Canadian regional climate model driven by two atmospheric-ocean general circulation climate models. Our results show that the probability of ice-jam flooding for the town of Fort McMurray in the future will be lower, but extreme ice-jam flood events are still probable.

AB The regional-scale consistency between four precipitation products from the GPCC, TRMM, WM, and CMORPH datasets over the Arabian Peninsula was assessed. Their macroscale relationships were inter-compared with soil moisture and total water storage (TWS) estimates from AMSR-E and GRACE. The consistency analysis was studied with multivariate statistical hypothesis testing and Pearson correlation metrics for the period from January 2000 to December 2010. The products and GRACE estimates were assessed over a representative sub-domain (United Arab Emirates) with available in situ well observations. Next, geographically temporally weighted regression (GTWR) was employed to examine the interdependencies among the peninsula's hydrological components. The results showed GPCC-TRMM recording the highest correlation (0.85) with insignificant mean differences over more than 90% of the peninsula. The highest GTWR predictive performance of TWS (R-2=0.84) was achieved with TRMM forcing, which indicates its potential to monitor changes in TWS over the arid peninsular region.

AB A discrete random particle representation of flow processes on shallow hillslopes is compared with solutions of the classical kinematic wave representation. The discrete Multiple Interacting Pathways (MIPs) model has the potential to represent the effects of complex heterogeneities and preferential flow pathways. It is shown that, under shared assumptions, the MIPs model can produce equivalent flow predictions to a standard kinematic wave realization. The MIPs model is then used to further explore the relationship between celerity and water velocity by introducing a velocity distribution, which represents the range of possible flow pathways, and therefore is representative of the nature of heterogeneity (or lack of it within a homogeneous case) within the subsurface. It is shown that, whilst flux constraints can be satisfied with a distribution of flow velocities, it can result in changes to the hydrograph. Multiple pathways also have an influence on the residence times for input increments, output increments and storage in the system.

AB There is a pressing need to improve capability to predict the hydrological responses of arid and semi-arid catchments. The literature indicates that physically-based rain fall-runoff models are not yet able to meet this challenge. Simple empirical or semi-empirical models may perform equally well or better, and provide basic but important information into catchment functioning. In this context, hourly data from 36 rainfall-runoff events in Wadi Ahin, a 734 kill catchment in the Sultanate of Oman, are analysed. Runoff volumes and peaks are regressed against descriptors of rainfall characteristics and antecedent conditions. The controls on runoff are found to be: rainfall volume, rainfall peak, rainfall spatial location arid variability, and antecedent wetness. Simple linear relationships between runoff peak arid volume, and rainfall Volume produce the best predictions, and robust prediction confidence limits. We speculate that application of physically-based models will not produce better predictions, but will allow us to test hypotheses about the underlying hydrological processes.

AB In the Baltic Sea region, the impact of physico-geographical factors is not very clear, although it is relevant in this basin. This study assessed the interaction of geographical factors (lakes, wetlands, forests, watercourse slope, and river network density) with selected flood characteristics (specific runoff of maximum discharge of spring flood (q(max)) and the date of maximum discharge of spring flood (Q(max_date))). In 1985, 2000, 2015, and 2019, the lakes, wetlands, and forests were investigated in 11 catchment areas using satellite images and semi-automatic classification. The highest correlation coefficients were for the average of q(max) (0.97-0.98) during the calibration. The validation of Q(max_date) revealed a weaker relationship (0.67 to 0.83) with the selected geographical factors. Based on regression models, forests and river network densities were the most influential geographical parameters. The findings of this study can be used to assess spring floods and geographical factors in ungauged catchments.

AB In this study, advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture data is employed to compute the basin water index (BWI) over six river basins of India for 10 years (2007-2016). The BWI time series is assessed for the development of its relationship with observed streamflow. Further, a popular ensemble learning technique, random forest, is employed to compute the 10-d streamflow using the BWI time series. Moreover, the results are compared with the classical rainfall-runoff model forced with satellite-based precipitation and evapotranspiration, BWI-rainfall-runoff model, and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of multiple efficiency measures, viz. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results reveal the BWI-rainfall-runoff model is the most accurate model for prediction of discharge. The performance of the BWI-rainfall-runoff model is very good over four of six catchments and good to satisfactory over the remaining two catchments.

AB Prediction of flood quantiles at ungauged sites is investigated using several nonparametric regression methods including: local regression and generalized additive models (GAM). These methods are used to describe the relationship between runoff variables and catchment descriptors to predict flood quantiles. Previous work reported the presence of spatial correlation in the residuals for these models. To this end, this study proposes and investigates ways of incorporating spatial components. An L-moments regression technique (LRT) is developed to predict L-moments of target sites and flood quantiles are derived by aggregating quantiles from multiple candidate distributions. The predictive power of the proposed methods is evaluated on a large database of Canadian rivers using cross-validation. The results are examined inside different hydrological regions to assess the behaviour of the methods. The results show that GAM and local regression using, respectively, thin plate spline and kriging provide the best predictive powers among the considered methods.

AB Broad disagreement between modelled and observed trends of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) over the north-central part of the Indian subcontinent (NCI) implies a gap in understanding of the relationship between the forcing factors and monsoonal precipitation. Although the strength of the land-sea thermal gradient (LSG) is believed to dictate monsoon intensity, its state and fate under continuous warming over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and part of the NCI (23-28 degrees N, 80-95 degrees E) are less explored. Precipitation (1901-2017) and temperature data (1948-2017) at different vertical heights are used to understand the impact of warming in the ISM. In NCI, surface air temperature increased by 0.1-0.2 degrees C decade(-1), comparable to the global warming rate. The ISM precipitation prominently weakened and seasonality reduced after 1950, which is caused by a decrease in the LSG at the depth of the troposphere. Warming-induced increase in local convection over the BoB further reduced ISM precipitation over NCI.

AB This study theoretically analyzes the concept of apparent saturation hysteresis, combined with the Scott et al. (1983) scaling approach, as suggested by Parker and Lenhard (1987), to account for the effect of air entrapment and release on the soil water hysteresis. We found that the theory of Parker and Lenhard (1987) is comprised of some mutually canceling mathematical operations, and when cleared of the superfluous intermediate calculations, their model reduces to the original Scott et al.'s (1983) scaling method, supplemented with the requirement of closure of scanning loops. Our analysis reveals that actually there is no effect of their technique of accounting for the entrapped air on the final prediction of the effective saturation (or water content) scanning curves.
   Our consideration indicates that the use of the Land (1968) formula for assessing the amount of entrapped air is in disaccord with the apparent saturation concept as introduced by Parker and Lenhard (1987).
   In this paper, a proper routine is suggested for predicting hysteretic scanning curves of any order, given the two measured main curves, in the complete hysteretic domain and some verification tests are carried out versus measured results. Accordingly, explicit closed-form formulae for direct prediction (with no need of intermediate calculation) of scanning curves up to the third order are derived to sustain our analysis.

AB Handling uncertainties in a conceptual rainfall runoff model is approached as an error modelling problem. The approach is based on the application of a parallel data-driven model that uses available measured data and previous model errors at specific time steps to forecast the errors of the conceptual model. The average mutual information technique is used to study the relationship between the different variables and the model errors at varying lag times. The resulting information is used to select the most related input data and the lead time at which they can be best applied in the error-forecast model. The method is applied to a conceptual rainfall-runoff model of the Sieve basin in Tuscany, Italy. Artificial neural network models trained to forecast the residuals of the conceptual model at lead times of 1-6 h are applied to forecast the errors and improve the subsequent flow forecasts. The research shows that using a parallel data-driven model to complement the conceptual model produces much better runoff predictions in comparison to using the conceptual model alone.

AB Mineral precipitations are a common feature and limitation of initially open, permeable rock fractures by forming sealing structures or secondary roughness in open voids. Hence, the objective of this numerical study is the evaluation of hydraulic properties of fractures sealed by hydrothermally induced needle and compact quartz growth. Phase-field models of progressive syntaxial and idiomorphic quartz growth are implemented into a fluid flow simulation solving the Navier-Stokes equation. Flow simulations for both quartz types indicate an obvious correlation between changes in permeability, fracture properties (e.g. aperture, relative roughness and porosity) and crystal growth behavior, which also forms distinct flow paths. Thus, at lower sealing stages initial fracture permeability significantly drops down for the 'needle fracture' forming highly tortuous flow paths, while the 'compact fracture' records a considerably smaller loss. Fluid flow in both sealing fractures most widely is governed by a "parallel plate"-like cubic law behavior. However, the 'needle fracture' also reveals flow characteristics of a porous media. A semi-theoretical equation is introduced that links geometrical (a(m)) with hydraulically effective apertures (a(h)) and the relative fracture roughness. For this purpose, a geometry factor ais introduced being alpha = 2.5 for needle quartz and alpha = 1.0 for compact quartz growth. In contrast to most common a(h)-a(m)-relationships this novel formulation not only reveals more precise predictions for the needle (RMSE = 1.5) and the compact fractures (RMSE = 3.2), but also exhibit a larger range of validity concerning the roughness of the 'needle' (sigma/a(m) = 0-2.4) and the ` compact fractures' (sigma/a(m) = 0-1.8).

AB Hillslope response has traditionally been studied by means of the hydraulic groundwater theory. Subsurface flow from a one-dimensional hillslope with a sloping aquifer can be described by the Boussinesq equation [Mem. Acad. Sci. Inst. Fr. 23 (1) (1877) 252-260]. Analytical solutions to Boussinesq's equation are very useful to understand the dynamics of subsurface flow processes along a hillslope. In order to extend our understanding of hillslope functioning, however, simple models that nonetheless account for the three-dimensional soil mantle in which the flow processes take place are needed. This three-dimensional soil mantle can be described by its plan shape and by the profile curvatures of terrain and bedrock. This plan shape and profile curvature are dominant topographic controls on flow processes along hillslopes. Fan and Bras [Water Resour. Res. 34 (4) (1998) 921-927] proposed a method to map the three-dimensional soil mantle into a one-dimensional storage capacity function. Continuity and a kinematic form of Darcy's law lead to quasi-linear wave equations for subsurface flow solvable with the method of characteristics. Adopting a power function of the form proposed by Stefano et al. [Water Resour. Res. 36 (2) (2000) 607-617] to describe the bedrock slope, we derive more general solutions to the hillslope-storage kinematic wave equation for subsurface flow, applicable to a wide range of complex hillslopes. Characteristic drainage response functions for nine distinct hillslope types are computed. These nine hillslope types are obtained by combining three plan curvatures (converging, uniform, diverging) with three bedrock profile curvatures (concave, straight, convex). We demonstrate that these nine hillslopes show quite different dynamic behaviour during free drainage and rainfall recharge events. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) is essential for better understanding the influences of climatic variability on hydrological cycles. Here we use Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)/GRACE Follow-on satellite data and meteorological observations to analyse the inter-annual trends of TWSA across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) during 2003-2020 and investigate the relationships between climatic variability and annual changes in TWSA. Results indicate that TWSA across the QTP generally decreased, at a rate of -0.5 +/- 1.4 mm/year during 2003-2020, which mainly arises from the coupled effects of Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation. In terms of the effects of climatic variability, annual changes in TWSA show a negative correlation coefficient (r = -0.76) with PET, which is greater than that with precipitation (r = 0.67). The cross-wavelet transformation analysis revealed that the evolution of TWSA across the QTP is closely associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Our conclusions can help decision makers to formulate appropriate policies for the assessment and management of water resources over the QTP.

AB We investigate high-Reynolds number gravity currents (GC) in a horizontal channel of circular cross-section. We focus on GC sustained by constant or time varying inflow (volume of injected fluid alpha t(alpha), with alpha = 1 and alpha > 1). The novelty of our work is in the type of the gravity currents: produced by influx/outflux boundary conditions, and propagation in circular (or semi-circular) channel. The objective is to elucidate the main propagation features and correlate them to the governing dimensionless parameters; to this end, we use experimental observations guided by shallow-water (SW) theoretical models. The system is of Boussinesq type with the denser fluid (salt water) injected into the ambient fluid (tap water) at one end section of a circular tube of 19 cm diameter and 605 cm long. The ambient fluid fills the channel of radius r* up to a given height H*= beta r*(0 < beta < 2) where it is open to the atmosphere. This fluid is displaced by the intruding current and outflows either at the same or at the opposite end-side of the channel. The two different configurations (with return and no-return flow) allow to analyze the impact of the motion of the ambient fluid on the front speed of the intruding current. For Q larger than some threshold value, the current is expected theoretically to undergo a choking process which limits the speed/thickness of propagation. Two series of experiments were conducted with constant and time varying inflow. The choking effect was observed, qualitatively, in both series. The theory correctly predicts the qualitative behavior, but systematically overestimates the front speed of the current (consistent with previously-published data concerning rectangular and non-rectangular cross-sections), with larger discrepancies for the no-return flow case. These discrepancies are mainly due to: (i) the variations of the free-surface of the ambient fluid with respect to its nominal value (the theoretical model assumes a fixed free-slip top of the ambient fluid), and (ii) mixing/entrainment effects, as shown by specific measurements of the open interface level and velocity profiles.

ID PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; STREAMFLOW; RIO
AB Changes in trend and quasi-periodicities are sought in the time series of river discharges in all major South American basins. The relationship between trends and quasi-periodicities found and climate variations on interannual and longer time scales are discussed. Consideration of multiple rivers gives insight into the geographical extent of hydrological signals and climate impacts. It is found that the streamflow of all major rivers of South America has experienced an increased trend since the early 1970s. It is suggested that this simultaneity may reflect the impact of a large-scale climate change. All the time series of river streamflows that were analysed show El Nino-like periodicities. Only for La Plata Basin do these explain a larger part of the total variance than the other quasi-periodicities. There are two other quasi-oscillations in the time series analysed: one of them with a longer period -around 17 years - and the other of about 9 years. Previous work has related these oscillations to sea-surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic Ocean.

ID FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS
AB Since droughts are natural phenomena, their occurrence cannot be predicted with certainty and thus it must be treated as a random variable. Once drought duration and magnitude have been found objectively, it is possible to plan for the transport of water in known quantities to drought-stricken areas either from alternative water resources or from water stored during wet periods. The summation of deficits over a particular period is referred to as the drought magnitude. Drought intensity is the ratio of drought magnitude to its duration. These drought properties at different truncation levels provide significant hydrological and hydrometeorological design quantities. In this study, the run analysis and z-score are used for determining drought properties of given hydrological series. In addition, kriging is used as a spatial drought analysis for mapping. This study is applied to precipitation records for Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag and Kirklareli in the Trakya region, Turkey and then the drought period, magnitude and standardized precipitation index (SPI) values are presented to depict the relationships between drought duration and magnitude.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; R-FACTOR
AB In this paper, using Sicilian and Australian rainfall intensity data, a comparison between different estimators (modified Fournier index F, F-F index) of the rainfall erosivity factor in the USLE was made. The relationship between the modified Fournier index and the mean annual rainfall, P, was theoretically derived. The K constant, linking the F-F index and P, and its cumulative distribution function (CDF) were used to establish hydrological similitude among different geographical regions of southern Italy and southeastern Australia. To predict the erasion risk for an event of given average recurrence interval, the probability distribution of the annual value E-aj of the Arnoldus index was studied. In order to establish the theoretical CDF to use as a regional parent distribution, the descriptive ability of LN2 and EV1 distributions was studied by both an at-site analysis and a hierarchical regional procedure. The analysis showed that for each sub-region of southern Italy and southeastern Australia, characterized by a constant coefficient of variation, the erosion risk index is constant.

AB The water permeability of natural fractures is highly related to their morphological characteristics. For fractures with irregular profiles and variable apertures, it is challenging to define an appropriate aperture to apply the traditional cubic law for evaluating permeability. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates the standard deviation and the Hurst exponent of a self-affine fracture profile to characterise the effects of fracture morphology on permeability using Cuckoo search algorithms. A modified local cubic law was derived to evaluate permeability, considering the roughness and Hurst exponent of fractures. The required number of segments for a fracture was obtained by comparing simulation results using Lattice Boltzmann methods. The proposed permeability model and segment strategy were validated by experiments on rough fractures. The results show that the number of segments required for the model can be directly derived from the dimensionless aperture (i.e., mechanical aperture/length of fracture media).

DE hydrometry; maximum entropy; rating curve; surface velocity; streamflow
AB We develop a maximum-entropy method for streamflow estimation from surface velocities. Entropy maximization, with mean and variance constraints, yields a mass and momentum conserving, error-function-type velocity profile. That sigmoidal profile's infinite branch shapes the hydrometrically critical free-surface region unphysically, so we derive approximate relationships of the ratio of the mean velocity V to the surface velocity v(surf), f(v)=V/v(surf), as function of beta = E[v(2)]/V-2 (E = expectation); beta is tightly estimable: beta approximate to 1.01-1.15, f(v) approximate to 0.9-0.72. f(v)(beta) is adaptable to the site geometry and roughness (i.e. to the local hydraulics, instead of the default f(v) = 0.86), improving the parsimonious discharge estimation from surface velocities. Laboratory data verify the concept. Tests at cross-sections of streams, with known variable bathymetry and roughness, demonstrate the method's ability to estimate the discharge solely from surface-velocity observations, with +/- 5% accuracy referenced to discharge determined from densely sampled in-stream velocities.

AB This work proposes an approach to automatically adjust the curve number (CN) to account for changes in vegetation density. Precipitation-runoff pairs from the MOdel Parameter Estimation EXperiment (MOPEX) dataset were used to estimate monthly simulated CNs (CNsim). Remotely sensed greenness fraction (GF) was used as a proxy for vegetation density. A relationship was established between CNsim and GF values, and an adjustment factor was introduced. The coefficients of determination (R-2) between the simulated and observed runoff when using the unadjusted and adjusted CNs were 0.63 and 0.80, respectively. Likewise, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of -0.17 and 0.67, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.22 and 2.75 were also obtained for the unadjusted and adjusted CNs, respectively. The results demonstrate how the adjustments compensate for the runoff overestimation when the standard CN (CNstd) is used, and also imply that the adjustment is crucial for improved hydrological modelling, particularly, for flood and flash flood monitoring and forecasting.

AB Theoretically, if the distribution of daily rainfall is known or justifiably assumed, then one could argue, based on extreme value theory, that the distribution of the annual maxima of daily rainfall would resemble one of the three limiting types: (a) type I, known as Gumbel; (b) type II, known as Frechet; and (c) type III, known as reversed Weibull. Yet, the parent distribution usually is not known and often only records of annual maxima are available. Thus, the question that naturally arises is which one of the three types better describes the annual maxima of daily rainfall. The question is of great importance as the naive adoption of a particular type may lead to serious underestimation or overestimation of the return period assigned to specific rainfall amounts. To answer this question, we analyze the annual maximum daily rainfall of 15,137 records from all over the world, with lengths varying from 40 to 163 years. We fit the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, which comprises the three limiting types as special cases for specific values of its shape parameter, and analyze the fitting results focusing on the behavior of the shape parameter. The analysis reveals that (a) the record length strongly affects the estimate of the GEV shape parameter and long records are needed for reliable estimates; (b) when the effect of the record length is corrected, the shape parameter varies in a narrow range; (c) the geographical location of the globe may affect the value of the shape parameter; and (d) the winner of this battle is the Frechet law.

AB This paper illustrates the importance of taking into account the potential errors in discharge estimation in the assessment of extreme floods. First, a summary of the main difficulties encountered in extrapolating rating curves for flood discharge is provided. Then a sensitivity analysis is carried out using a hydraulic modelling approach, applied to eight Mediterranean catchments, and yielding an envelope curve for the stage-discharge relationship, Q( H). To assess the influence of errors in the flood discharge on the uncertainty in estimating extreme floods, a Bayesian framework including a multiplicative error on the rating curve was applied. Its application on two catchments for which historical data are available for the period (1741-2004) shows that ignoring the rating curve errors may lead to an unduly optimistic reduction in the final uncertainty in estimation of flood discharge quantiles. Moreover, the quantile values are also affected by taking into account the rating curve errors.

AB Two-way interactions and feedback between hydrological and social processes in settled floodplains determine the complex human-flood system and change vulnerability over time. To focus on the dynamic role of individual and governmental decision making on flood-risk management, we developed and implemented a coupled agent-based and hydraulic modelling framework. Within this framework, household agents are located in a floodplain protected by a levee system. Individual behaviour is based on Protection Motivation Theory and includes the options to (1) not react to flood risk; (2) implement individual flood protection measures; or (3) file a complaint to the government. The government decides about reinforcing the levee system, compromising between a cost-benefit analysis and filed complaints from households. We found that individual decision making can significantly influence flood risk. In addition, the coupled agent-based and hydraulic modelling framework approach captures commonly observed socio-hydrological dynamics, namely levee and adaptation effects. It provides an explanatory tool for assessing spatial and temporal dynamics of flood risk in a socio-hydrological system.

AB The novel research paradigm, dubbed the "court of miracles of hydrological modelling", focuses on achieving scientific progress in circumstances which traditionally would be called model failures. Many of the associated modelling issues can be addressed systematically and coherently within the mathematical framework of Bayesian forecast-decision theory. Five of them are addressed herein: (a) choosing a criterion function for making rational decisions under uncertainty (a meta-decision problem); (b) modelling stochastic dependence between variates to quantify uncertainty and predict realizations; (c) fusing data from asymmetric samples to cope with unrepresentativeness of small samples and corruptive effects of outliers; (d) calibrating probabilistic predictions against a prior distribution; and (e) ordering predictors, or models, in terms of their informativeness (equivalently, in terms of their economic value to a decider). It is suggested that communication between hydrologists and deciders (planners, engineers, operators of hydrosystems) would benefit if hydrologists adopted, at least on some issues, the perspective of deciders, who must act in a timely and rational manner, and for whom hydrological estimates and predictions have economic consequences.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought could be increasing with global warming. When drought occurs, the runoff generation process and the precipitation-runoff relationship might change. In this study, the precipitation runoff relationship in drought years was systematically investigated in the largest freshwater lake basin of China, namely, the Poyang Lake Basin. The results showed that the precipitation-runoff relationship changed significantly (p < 0.05) in drought years. The annual runoff coefficient in drought years decreased by 24.1% compared with that in non-drought years. The decreased magnitude of runoff coefficient had a significant positive relationship (p < 0.01) with the drought severity, i.e., the standardized precipitation index of the year. Two hydrological models calibrated by the objective function Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency significantly overestimated runoff in drought years. Three additional objective functions that are sensitive to low flow simulations significantly improved the accuracy of runoff simulation in drought years. Therefore, we recommend that the selected objective functions for runoff simulation in drought years should be sensitive to low flow simulations. Otherwise, the water resources availability will be overestimated in drought years.

AB In hydrological terms, raised bogs are often approximated by simple models as in the acrotelm-catotelm concept. However, raised bogs are often characterized by a pronounced surface topography, causing large changes in connectivity of contributing areas on the bog. In this study, daily regression of measured discharges versus catchment areas is used to quantify the impact of surface topography on catchment connectivity within a raised bog. The resulting coefficient of determination shows the strength of the relationship between the discharge and catchment area over time under different hydrological conditions. Monitoring of discharge, water table, transmissivity, and basic weather data on a raised bog (1.9km(2)) in eastern central Estonia took place from May 2008 to June 2010. Contributing areas, calculated based on the outlet's discharge volume (V-Q) divided by the net precipitation volume ( VPnet), of the outlet containing the central pool-ridge system varied between 1x10(-3) and 0.7km(2), suggesting significant differences in connectivity between hydrological events. Correlation between discharge and theoretical catchment size was high (R-2>0.75) when the water table was close to the surface (less than 5cm below peat surface), and consequently, transmissivities were also high (up to 1,030m(2)d(-1)), which led to connectivity of local storage elements, such as pools and hollows. However, a water table below this threshold resulted in large parts of the catchment being disconnected. The importance of water table depths on catchment connectivity suggests the need to reconsider the hydrological concept of raised bogs; to incorporate these shallow flow components and better understand residence time and consequently transport of solutes, such as DOC, from patterned peatlands.

AB This paper experimentally investigates the role of shear processes on the variation of critical Reynolds number and nonlinear flow through rough-walled rock fractures. A quantitative criterion was developed to quantify the onset of nonlinear flow by comprehensive combination of Forchheimer's law and Reynolds number. At each shear displacement, several high-precision water flow tests were carried out with different hydraulic gradients then the critical Reynolds number was determined based on the developed criterion. The results show that (i) the Forchheimer's law was fitted very well to experimental results of nonlinear fluid flow through rough-walled fractures, (ii) the coefficients of viscous and inertial pressure drops experience 4 and 7 orders of magnitude reduction during shear displacement, respectively, and (iii) the critical Reynolds number varies from 0.001 to 25 and experiences 4 orders of magnitude enlargement by increasing shear displacement from 0 to 20 mm. These findings may prove useful in proper understanding of fluid flow through rock fractures, or inclusions in computational studies of large-scale nonlinear flow in fractured rocks.

AB The uncertain relationship between data length and evaluation of hydrological alteration has perplexed researchers. In this study, the length of record (LOR) method is applied to analyse the uncertainty in the impact of different data lengths on the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) evaluation in the Jinsha River. The results indicate: (1) For the pre-impact period, a daily streamflow data length of 20 years should be required to meet all the indicators, but 5-10 years of data could be sufficient when analysing some specific indicators. (2) A logarithmic correlation was found between the LOR results and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the IHA statistics, which can be considered reference factors to reduce the computational complexity when we expect to obtain LOR results from other nearby hydrological stations. (3) For the post-impact period, using a data length of 10 years is sufficient to evaluate the impact of large reservoirs on the river hydrological regime, and the actual alteration of hydrological regime would be overestimated by using a shorter data length.

AB [ 1] This study explores the link between spatial variability within fluvial sedimentary strata and river channel geometry. This link is then used to determine the macrodispersion coefficients for solute transport in groundwater flow in river deposits. In doing that we combine concepts from sedimentology, geostatistics, and the stochastic-Lagrangian theory of subsurface transport. It is proposed to analyze the spatial variability of river sediments in terms of transition probabilities. The transition probabilities can be determined from the averages and variances of the lengths of stratasets and their volumetric fractions using concepts developed by Carle and Fogg ( 1996) and Ritzi ( 2000). Strataset length scales are shown to correlate well with the geometry of the river channel and its bed forms and can be determined indirectly from aerial photogrammetry, and, more directly, through surface ground penetrating radar surveys. Stratal dimensions can also be related, using Lagrangian transport analysis, to macrodispersivity of subsurface transport. This allows relationships between the geometry of river channels and subsurface transport parameters of associated fluvial deposits. For demonstration the longitudinal macrodispersivity in a compound bar deposit in the gravelly, braided Sagavanirktok River was investigated.

AB Relatively few studies have addressed water management and adaptation measures in the face of changing water balances due to climate change. The current work studies climate change impact on a multipurpose reservoir performance and derives adaptive policies for possible future scenarios. The method developed in this work is illustrated with a case study of Hirakud reservoir on the Mahanadi river in Orissa, India, which is a multipurpose reservoir serving flood control, irrigation and power generation. Climate change effects on annual hydropower generation and four performance indices (reliability with respect to three reservoir functions, viz. hydropower, irrigation and flood control, resiliency, vulnerability and deficit ratio with respect to hydropower) are studied. Outputs from three general circulation models (GCMs) for three scenarios each are downscaled to monsoon streamflow in the Mahanadi river for two future time slices, 2045-65 and 2075-95. Increased irrigation demands, rule curves dictated by increased need for flood storage and downscaled projections of streamflow from the ensemble of GCMs and scenarios are used for projecting future hydrologic scenarios. It is seen that hydropower generation and reliability with respect to hydropower and irrigation are likely to show a decrease in future in most scenarios, whereas the deficit ratio and vulnerability are likely to increase as a result of climate change if the standard operating policy (SOP) using current rule curves for flood protection is employed. An optimal monthly operating policy is then derived using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) as an adaptive policy for mitigating impacts of climate change on reservoir operation. The objective of this policy is to maximize reliabilities with respect to multiple reservoir functions of hydropower, irrigation and flood control. In variations to this adaptive policy, increasingly more weightage is given to the purpose of maximizing reliability with respect to hydropower for two extreme scenarios. It is seen that by marginally sacrificing reliability with respect to irrigation and flood control, hydropower reliability and generation can be increased for future scenarios. This suggests that reservoir rules for flood control may have to be revised in basins where climate change projects an increasing probability of droughts. However, it is also seen that power generation is unable to be restored to current levels, due in part to the large projected increases in irrigation demand. This suggests that future water balance deficits may limit the success of adaptive policy options. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most Latin American glaciers are located in the tropical Andes. The melting processes of Glacier 15 on Antisana volcano were studied to understand the relationship between glacier retreat and natural climate variability and global climate change. Glaciers on the Antisana volcano are crucial sources of water as they feed the headwater rivers that supply Quito with potable water. The aim of this study was to build empirical models based on multiple correlations to reconstruct the mass loss of glaciers over a period of 10 years at three scales: local (data recorded by meteorological stations located around the volcano), regional (data from stations located around the country) and global (re-analysis data). Data quality was checked using graphical and statistical methods. Several empirical models based on multiple correlations were created to generate longer time series (42 and 115 years) of the mass balance for the glacier ablation zone. The long mass balance series were compared with the temperature variation series of the Earth's surface in the Southern Hemisphere to estimate the relation between the mass balance and global warming. Our results suggest that the meteorological factors that best correlate with mass balance are temperature and wind.

AB [1] The paper develops and applies a game theoretic model of upstream and downstream countries to examine cooperative and noncooperative strategies of a common watershed. The application to the Tijuana River watershed shared by the United States and Mexico provides quantification of the strategies for internalizing water quality externalities to upstream and downstream originating from sedimentation. Results show that different transfer payments, such as the Chander/Tulkens cost sharing rule and the Shapley value, imply the size of the existing transfer from downstream to upstream could increase the amount currently allocated.

AB Dynamic capillary pressure (DCP) is the capillary pressure defined under transient flow condition during displacement, and it is vital for predicting two-phase behavior in porous media. This article studies the effect of pore scale force and interfacial area by using captivating Lattice Boltzmann method based on a pseudo-potential model developed for simulating incompressible multiphase flow in porous media. We analyze the relationship between pore scale forces and DCP based on the energy conservation law and define DCP as a function of energy rate of pressure and viscosity of each phase. We present two-phase displacement simulations on a computed tomography (CT) image-based porous model and analyze the effects of injection rate and wettability on DCP based on the proposed upscaling method, where the wettability is defined as the contact angle of the nonwetting phase. The primary results show that (1) the DCP curves are higher than that of the quasi-static capillary pressure, and a higher injection rate leads to a larger DCP and a faster saturation change. (2) Significant effects of wettability on DCP and the DCP coefficients are observed, where the DCP coefficient is defined as the ratio of the difference between DCP and static capillary pressure over the rate of change of saturation. A larger contact angle results in a higher DCP and a lower change rate of saturation, and consequently induces a larger DCP coefficient. The average DCP coefficient is found to vary from 4.56 x 10(6) to 3.55 x 10(5) Pa center dot ms when the nonwetting phase contact angle changes from 140 degrees to 105 degrees in the saturation range of 0.3 to 0.8. This study indicates that the proposed upscaling method is valid to investigate the DCP of two-phase flow in sandstone.

   Boussinesq equation; Approximate solution
AB For certain initial and boundary conditions the Boussinesq equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation describing the flow of water in unconfined aquifers, can be reduced to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Using Song et al.'s (2007) [7] approach, we show that for zero head initial condition and power-law flux boundary condition at the inlet boundary, the solution in the form of power series can be obtained with Barenblatt's (1990) [2] rescaling procedure applied to the power series solution obtained in Song et al. (2007) [7] for the power-law head boundary condition. Polynomial approximations can then be obtained by taking terms from the power series. Although for a small number of terms the newly obtained approximations may be worse than polynomial approximations obtained by other techniques, any desired accuracy can be achieved by taking more terms from the power series.

AB Temporal resolution of rainfall plays an important role in determining the hydrological response of river basins. Rainfall temporal variability can be considered as one of the most critical elements when dealing with input data of rainfall-runoff models. In this paper, a typical lumped rainfall-runoff model is applied to long- and short-term runoff prediction using rainfall data sets with different temporal resolution, including daily, hourly and 10-min interval data, and the dependency of model performance on the time interval of the rainfall data is discussed. Furthermore, the effect of temporal resolution on model parameter values is analysed. As results, rainfall data with shorter temporal resolution provide better performance in short-term river discharge estimation, especially for storm discharge estimation. The most accurate results are obtained on the peak discharge and recession part of the hydrograph by using 10-min interval rainfall data. It is concluded that model parameter values are influenced not only by the temporal resolution of calculation but also by the rainfall intensity-duration relationship. This study provides useful information about determination of hydrological model parameters using data of different temporal resolutions.

AB Observations of non-Fickian transport in sandbox experiments [Levy M, Berkowitz B. Measurement and analysis of non-Fickian dispersion in heterogeneous porous media. J Contam Hydrol 2003;64:203-26] were analyzed previously using a power law tail psi(t) similar to t(-1-beta) with 0 < beta < 2 for the spectrum of transition times comprising a tracer plume migration. For each sandbox medium a choice of beta resulted in an excellent fit to the breakthrough curve (BTC) data, and the value of beta decreased slowly with increasing flow velocity. Here, the data are reanalyzed with the full spectrum of psi(t) gleaned from analytical calculations [Cortis A, Chen Y, Scher H, Berkowitz B. Quantitative characterization of pore-scale disorder effects on transport in "homogeneous" granular media. Phys Rev E 2004:10(70):041108. doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.70.0411081, numerical simulations [Bijeljic B, Blunt MJ. Pore-scale modeling and continuous time random walk analysis of dispersion in porous media.

Anomalous transport in heterogeneous media demonstrated by streamline-based simulation. Geophys Res Lett 2003;30:1608-12s. doi: 10.1029/2003GL017196]. We represent the main features of the full spectrum of transition times with a truncated power law (TPL), psi(t) similar to (t(1) + t)(-1-beta) exp(-t/t(2)), where t(1) and t(2) are the limits of the power law spectrum. An excellent fit to the entire BTC data set, including the changes in flow velocity, for each sandbox medium is obtained with a single set of values of t(1), beta, t(2). The influence of the cutoff time t(2) is apparent even in the regime t < t(2). Significantly, we demonstrate that the previous apparent velocity dependence of beta is a result of choosing a pure power law tail for psi(t). The key is the change in the log-log slope of the TPL form of psi(t) with a shifting observational time window caused by the change in the mean velocity. Hence, the use of the full spectrum of psi(t) is not only necessary for the transition to Fickian behavior, but also to account for the dynamics of these laboratory observations of non-Fickian transport.

AB Groundwater microorganisms hardly ever cover the solid matrix uniformly-instead they form micro-scale colonies. To which extent such colony formation limits the bioavailability and biodegradation of a substrate is poorly understood. We used a high-resolution numerical model of a single pore channel inhabited by bacterial colonies to simulate the transport and biodegradation of organic substrates. These high-resolution 2D simulation results were compared to 1D simulations that were based on effective rate laws for bioavailability-limited biodegradation. We (i) quantified the observed bioavailability limitations and (ii) evaluated the applicability of previously established effective rate concepts if microorganisms are heterogeneously distributed. Effective bioavailability reductions of up to more than one order of magnitude were observed, showing that the microscale aggregation of bacterial cells into colonies can severely restrict the bioavailability of a substrate and reduce in sins degradation rates. Effective rate laws proved applicable for upscaling when using the introduced effective colony sizes.

AB With global climate change and impacts of human activity, the water cycle, which has a close relationship with local water resources, has changed rapidly. Based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, five relatively independent global climate models are selected from 47 CMIP5 models to simulate future climatic conditions. Data are downscaled to the local projection, with bias neutralized before applying them to the hydrological models, by which availability of future water resources are calculated for the Dongting Lake basin. The results show that the water resources of the Dongting Lake basin are likely to increase in the future, but be distributed more unevenly. All scenarios indicate that water availability will increase during the flood season and decrease during the dry season, with a prominent increase in annual discharge. The scenarios also predict that the greater the greenhouse gas emissions, the more uneven the water distribution becomes. Overall, the water resources of the Dongting Lake catchment show the same increasing and unevenly distributed trend in the future, which could be further accelerated by human activities.

AB The 1911-2010 variability in monthly runoff and the effect of 1995-2005 summer water temperatures in a highly productive salmon system, the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, Canada are explored. Hydrometric data from 141 FRB gauges provide variations in monthly runoff including their extremes and months of occurrences, as well as trends in their variability. Stream temperatures and their relationships to runoff are also assessed. There is a gradual increase of monthly runoff ranges from the central plateau of the FRB towards higher altitudes with maxima in glacier-fed alpine streams. Maximum and minimum monthly runoff across the FRB typically occur during May-June and February, respectively. There is a tendency towards greater FRB variability in July runoff. Water temperatures show high variability in the unregulated North and South Thompson rivers and low variability in the regulated Nechako River. FRB low flows are associated with higher water temperatures, while high flows are associated with cooler ones, both of which may have a negative impact on salmon.

DE alluvial rivers; field data; mean flow velocity; Nile River
AB This study presents a formula for estimating the mean flow velocity of the Nile River, Egypt. The proposed formula is presented in the form of the commonly used Manning equation. The derived relationship can be directly incorporated into numerical models and used by hydraulic professionals. The formula is developed using a large database of field measurements from the Nile River and its canals. Its accuracy is assessed using both collected field and laboratory data. The collected field data were used for testing the prediction performance of several equations, and the predictive skill of Karim's formula is adapted for the Nile River conditions. Despite the complexity of the water flow of the Nile River, which has been significantly altered by humans, and the river's small energy slopes and very high relative flow depths, the predictions obtained using the proposed formula are consistent with the measurements. The mean normalized error and root mean square error for the predicted mean velocities of the Nile River are 11.455% and 0.0945 m s(-1), respectively.

AB The effect of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on rainfall characteristics in the tropical peatland areas of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, is demonstrated. This research used rainfall data collected between 1978 and 2008. The results suggest a relationship between ENSO events and the trend in rainfall observed in the study area. Further analyses show that El Nino events have a stronger effect on the rainfall compared to La Nina events. El Nino events were also correlated to the increase in the number of days with less than 1 mm of rainfall in the dry season. The analysis reveals that the impact of El Nino events on rainfall in dry seasons is intensifying annually. Furthermore, ENSO events are not the only factors affecting rainfall trends in the observed area. Other factors, such as deforestation, may also affect the trend.

AB Clay-shales largely outcrop in the Northern Apennines of Italy, where they are associated with frequent and widespread landslide activity. The paper presents the results of monitoring activities carried out in two field-sites and focused on the hydrology of clay-shales prone to landsliding. In the monitored slopes, the water table is close to the ground surface throughout the year, with seasonal fluctuations of tens of centimetres to a couple of metres. Shallow weathered soils, or clay cover, and unaltered material exhibit a much different behaviour. Although responses to single rainfalls are clearly identifiable as pressure pulses in the clay cover, they are never observed in the underlying parental clay-shales where downward gradients indicate recharge and only long-term seasonal fluctuations are recorded. Short-term variations of pressure head in the clay cover are ruled by downward propagation of a pressure wave in saturated conditions. More than 400 pore-pressure responses collected in the two sites are analysed in terms of lag time, rate and amount of pressure increase and timing of pressure peaking. It emerges that the linear diffusion theory can satisfactorily explain the observed behaviour. In deeper unaltered material, the barometric effect influences the measures similarly to what is observed in confined aquifers. After its removal, the corrected data exhibit regular seasonal fluctuations which are used to estimate the diffusivity of the material based on phase-lag and attenuation of the downward propagating long-term periodic pulse.

AB Local values of surface shear stress measured by eddy correlation devices were compared to regional ones generated by Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) theory in the atmospheric surface layer over the cooperative atmosphere-surface exchange study (CASES) area in eastern Kansas. For this comparison, minisodar average wind speed profiles were used to implement MOS. The local surface shear stress values were found to be representative of the regional ones only under free convective conditions. For weak to strongly neutral atmospheric conditions, regional values of the surface shear stress were underpredicted by a factor of two by the locally measured ones. Empirical interpolation equations are proposed to describe the relationship in the intermediate range. The surface roughness values of 0.12 and 0.40 m, respectively, were determined for the two locations of the minisodar sounders by regional analysis of their mean wind speed measurements under neutral atmospheric conditions. The roughness values found in this present study compared well to past investigations conducted in this region. Minisodar roughness values were found in this present study to be a good alternative to radiosonde determined ones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current design of bioretention systems is intended to intercept and retain stormwater, enhance infiltration, and remove organic particulates, nutrients, pathogens, metals, and other contaminants using natural processes that derive from the interactions of water, soil, microbes, plants, and animals. Most bioretention systems function as isolated patches of various shapes and sizes surrounded by impervious surface. A significant body of ecological theory has been developed that addresses the relationships among species composition, diversity, and ecosystem function, and how these vary with spatial structure. Here we highlight how such theories may be applied to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of bioretention systems. We consider (1) the role of plant and animal species that function as ecosystem engineers, (2) biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships, (3) complexity and stability, (4) disturbance and succession, and (5) spatial theory. Future testing of the utility of these theories may occur through incorporation of experiments into the design of bioretention systems or through meta-analysis of systems that span a range of configurations and biotic features.

AB The single-fracture seepage model is important for fracture network seepage models and underground engineering, but the existing knowledge is insufficient for the roles of the high hydraulic pressure, joint surface destruction, gouge material, and the anisotropy of flow regime in the single-fracture seepage model during shear process. In this study, coupled shear-flow tests were conducted at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 MPa hydraulic pressure with radial fluid flow, and then 3D simulation models were established by using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes k-epsilon turbulence model for initial and peak shear conditions. Results showed that the radial flow cubic law diverged from experimental results seriously, and non-Darcy flow behaviour was remarkable during tests. High hydraulic pressure decreased the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law dramatically by increasing the influence of inertia force, and the accuracy was sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure. The flow regime and velocity were varied and influenced by the anisotropic tortuosity ratio, maximum inclination angle, and the uneven distribution of aperture. The absolute values of velocity vertical to the radial distance reduced with decreasing roughness. The roughness, tortuosity ratio, and maximum inclination angle of the fracture joint reduced dynamically with destruction of the joint surface and formation of gouge material, leading to a significant change in the relationship between mechanical and hydraulic apertures. Moreover, the radial flow cubic law was modified on the basis of the relationship of mechanical and hydraulic aperture with hydraulic gradient. This study may serve as a basis to establish fracture network seepage model and other similar tests.

AB This paper investigates why the measured velocity profiles in combined wave-current flows deviate from the log-law. Most of previous researchers attributed the velocity deviation to the wave Reynolds stress-p (uv) over bar only. However, this study shows that both the wave Reynolds stress and the momentum (u) over bar(v) over bar driven by secondary flow and/or non-uniformity are responsible to the velocity deviation from the log-law. The theoretical investigation starts from the Reynolds equations and uses the simplified mixing-length hypothesis. The theoretical equation which describes the interaction of velocity distribution and (v) over bar in combined wave and current conditions from the bottom to the free surface is obtained, and the equation states that the non-zero wall-normal velocity (v) over bar that has been ignored in previous studies also plays an important role as the wave Reynolds stress to the velocity profile. By comparing the model with the available experimental data, it is seen that the model predicted the essential features of the experimental results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of the relationship between rainfall intensity and kinetic energy and its variations in time and space is important for the prediction of erosion hazard. Kinetic energy and erosivity are also strongly controlled by raindrop size. However, studies on raindrop measurement and different practical techniques have been rarely documented. The current study therefore aimed to apply existing raindrop-size measurement techniquesthe photographic, flour-pellet and stain methods, as well as an innovative flour-stain methodand to evaluate their applicability at several intensities in Mazandaran Province, Iran. The distribution of raindrop size obtained by the different methods was recorded and compared with those obtained through applying a high-speed imaging technique. All the analyses were made with the help of a SPSS software package. The results showed that the raindrop diameters ranged from 0.2 to 5.16 mm at different rainfall intensities. Statistical comparison of the methods using the Duncan test showed that the flour-pellet method presented similar results to the photographic technique; it was concluded that this can be used as a practical and inexpensive method to estimate a wide range of raindrop sizes.

AB Employing long-range correlation, complexity features and clustering, this study investigated the influence of dam and lake-river systems on the Yangtze River flow. The impact of the Gezhouba Dam and the lake systems on streamflow was evaluated by analysing daily streamflow records at the Cuntan, the Yichang and the Datong station. Results indicated no evident influence of the Gezhouba Dam on streamflow changes. Distinct differences in scaling behaviour, long-range correlation and clustering of streamflow at the Datong station when compared with those at the Cuntan and Yichang stations undoubtedly showed the influence of water storage and the buffering effect of the lake systems between the Datong station and other two hydrological stations on streamflow in the lower Yangtze River basin. Decreased regularity, enhanced long-range correlation and increased clustering of streamflow in the lower Yangtze River basin due to the effect of water storage of the lake systems were corroborated.

AB This study investigates rainfall characteristics in the Upper Zambezi River Basin and implications for rain-fed agriculture. Seventeen indices describing the character of each rainy season were calculated using a bias-corrected version of TRMM-B42 v6 rainfall estimate for 1998-2010. These were correlated with maize yields obtained by applying a SVATmodel. Finally, a self-organizing map (SOM) was trained to examine multivariate relationships. The results reveal a significant spatio-temporal variability of rainfall indices and yields, with a gradient from north to south. Yields greater than 1t/ha are found to be only achievable with rainy seasons longer than 160days. For shorter durations, the interplay of total rainfall, dry spell frequency and maximum dry/wet spell durations determines agricultural success. Using total rainfall alone or wet day frequency as estimators for yields is insufficient. Alternating wet and dry spells affect yields most negatively. The results have significance in the context of agricultural planning under changing climatic conditions and agricultural planning, as well as for the development of forecasting mechanisms.

AB In this final part of our study [Fagherazzi et al., this issue; Rinaldo et al., this issue] we propose a simple model for predicting the local peak ebb and flood discharges throughout a tidal network and use this model to investigate scaling relationships between channel morphology and discharge in the Venice Lagoon. The model assumes that the peak flows are driven by spring (astronomical) tidal fluctuations (rather than precipitation-induced runoff or seiche, sea surge, or storm-induced tidal currents) and exploits the procedure presented by Fagherazzi et al. [this issue] for delineating a time-invariant drainage area to any channel cross section. The discharge is estimated using the Fagherazzi et al. model to predict water surface topography, and hence flow directions throughout the channel network and across unchanneled regions, and the assumption of flow continuity. Water surface elevation adjustment, not assumed to be instantaneous throughout the network, is defined by a suitable solution of the flow equations where significant morphological information is used and is reduced to depending on just one parameter, the Chezy resistance coefficient. For the Venice Lagoon, peak discharges are well predicted by our model. We also document well-defined power law relationships between channel width and peak discharge, watershed area, and flow, whereas curved, nonscaling relationships were found for channel cross-sectional area as a function of peak discharge. Hence our model supports the use of a power law dependency of peak discharge with drainage area in the Venice Lagoon and provides a simple means to explore aspects of morphodynamic adjustments in tidal systems.

AB Wet ecosystems are important in terms of global greenhouse gas emissions, where a high soil water content is one of the most typical features. However, the roles of hydrogeological properties in sediment during the emission process of methane and carbon dioxide remain to be researched, especially in lake ecosystems. In this study, through investigating the layered sediment in Chaohu Lake, we discovered that strong correlations exist between the water content and microbial gas emissions (methane and carbon dioxide). To further examine these correlations, a systematic analysis of the hydrogeological properties in sediment, gas emission features, methane bubble emission theories and microbiomics was conducted. The results revealed that microbial methane emissions can influence sediment structure and the interstitial water content. Differently, the similar distributions in different layers probably lead to the correlations between microbial carbon dioxide emission and the water content. This research also discusses the connections with other hydrogeological parameters (particle features, interstitial space, etc.) during the emission process. In addition, this study addresses the significance of methane emissions for the material exchange between overlying water and sediment. The effect of microbial gas emissions on sediment physical-chemical properties also provides meaningful information for researching the relationships among environmental factors and microbial ecology.

AB To solve the contradiction between regulation and protection of the water ecological environment in a dam-controlled river, it is necessary to identify the main influencing factors of that environment and the interactions between the water quantity, quality and ecology. In this paper, the redundancy analysis (RDA) technique is used to identify the key influencing factors of water eco-environment in the Shaying River, China. The multivariate nonlinear quantization method is used to quantify the interactive relationship between water quantity, water quality and water ecology, and a quantitative model of the dam-controlled river eco-environment is constructed. The results show the relative importance of the various environmental factors. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index is used to assess phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos (P-SWI, Z-SWI and B-SWI, respectively). The R-2 of the quantization models for P-SWI, Z-SWI and B-SWI in the fitting phase were 0.81, 0.72 and 0.66, respectively, and, in the validation phase, they were 0.36, 0.31 and 0.41, respectively. The results of this study can provide reference and support for the environmental regulation of dam-controlled rivers.

This allows for a more precise targeting of best management practices than analysis at the coarser sub-basin level. It also provides the opportunity to validate simulated surface runoff and sediment yield by evaluating the plausibility of their spatial variation within the watershed. The results indicate that satisfactory model performance at a gauge does not guarantee plausible results at HRU level. Both surface runoff and sediment yields were found to vary reasonably with land use and soil types, but not with slope. The credibility of simulated surface runoff was increased by modifying selected SWAT algorithms and parameters. However, these modifications had only a marginal effect on sediment yield, which can be explained by the nonlinear relationship between sediment yield and HRU area in the modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. This study demonstrates that evaluation of model output at HRU level is highly recommended.

AB Measurements of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity were taken in a saline gypsiferous soil collected from southern Tunisia. Both time domain reflectometry (TDR) and the new WET sensor based on frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) were used. Seven different moistening solutions were used with electrical conductivities of 0.0053-14 dS m(-1). Different models for describing the observed relationships between dielectric permittivity (K-a) and water content (theta), and bulk electrical conductivity (ECa) and pore water electrical conductivity (ECp) were tested and evaluated. The commonly used K-a-theta models by Topp et al. (1980) and Ledieu et al. (1986) cannot be recommended for the WET sensor. With these models, the RMSE and the mean relative error of the predicted theta were about 0.04 m(3) m(-3) and 19% for TDR and 0.08 m(3) m(-3) and 54% for WET sensor measurements, respectively. Using the Hilhorst (2000) model for ECp predictions, the RMSE was 1.16 dS m(-1) and 4.15 dS m(-1) using TDR and the WET sensor, respectively. The WET sensor could give similar accuracy to TDR if calibrated values of the soil parameter were used instead of standard values.

AB Straw mulching is a typical soil and water conservation measure for slope farms, and it plays an important role in preventing soil erosion. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of the length and coverage of wheat straw on infiltration, runoff and soil loss. In this study, an indoor simulated rainfall experiment was used to study the characteristics of infiltration, runoff and sediment yield under different straw lengths and coverage when the rainfall intensity was 90 mm h(-1). The results show that the straw mulch contributes more to the effect of infiltration, runoff and sediment yield than straw length. Increasing the straw coverage increases the average infiltration rate and reduces the cumulative runoff and sediment yield. An increase in straw length, however, reduces the average infiltration rate of the slope and increases the cumulative runoff and sediment yield. The benefits of straw mulch in increasing average infiltration and reducing runoff and sediment yield are consistent with the law of diminishing marginal returns. The marginal benefit of straw is optimal when the straw cover is 3.5 t center dot hm(-2). The sum of straw mulch and length multiplied by cover divided by length has a power function relationship with slope infiltration, while runoff and sediment yield have a power function relationship with its reciprocal. The average infiltration rate of the slope surface is significantly linearly related to the cumulative sediment yield. The simulation accuracy of the Horton model is higher than that of the Kostiakov model. In this study, when the straw length was 3-5 cm and the mulch rate was 4.5 t center dot hm(-2), the average slope infiltration was highest, and the runoff and sediment yield were lowest. Wheat straw surface mulch, when applied as an effective measure for controlling soil erosion and maintaining soil and water resources on sloped fields, can effectively increase infiltration and reduce runoff and sediment yield; wheat mulch is thus critical for the sustainable development of agriculture and ecology on sloping land.

AB When it comes to projecting the potential effects of climate change on hydro-climatic variables using time-series models, the conventional approach has been to examine correlations with exogenous variables. Establishing correlations among endogenous and exogenous variables, however, cannot guarantee that there is a cause-effect relationship among the variables. This study, therefore, used Granger-causality for a more accurate alternative to the exogenous variables needed to expand time-series models. To demonstrate this, Maharlou Lake, Iran was selected for a case study not only because this inland water body has been exhibiting unprecedented depletion patterns recently, but also because studies are projecting that a changing local climate could add pressure to the region's water resources. Both restricted and extended models reveal that shrinkage observed in the lake's time-series data is expected to continue in the near future. This depletion, however, is projected to be more pronounced in August, September, and October, and milder in February, March, and April. Furthermore, the results from the extended model hint at a more severe pattern of shrinkage rooted in the adverse impacts of projected climate change.

AB The water storage capacity (WSC) of dehiscent fruits that constitute a portion of litter on the forest floor is inadequately understood. This study has quantified the WSC of empty fruiting heads of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) in an effort to reduce the data gap on the WSC and interception of fruit litter. In a laboratory experiment, empty fruiting heads of sweetgum were found to have a mean WSC of 399% of their oven-dried weight. The maximum volume of water detained by fruiting heads in the field was 507 ml container(-1). Interception by the empty fruiting heads is considerable, ranging from 2.6 to 218.5% of the incident gross precipitation with a mean of 42.7%. The data indicate that the interception storage capacity of empty fruiting heads is reached at 2.5 cm depth equivalent of incident gross precipitation. A logarithmic relationship was observed between the volume of water detained by the fruiting heads and the length of time since precipitation. Results of the study suggest that fruit litter may have a considerable influence on the seasonal water balance and ecohydrology of plantations and forests with significant proportions of sweetgum.

AB Freshwater scarcity is already an urgent problem in some areas but may increase significantly in the future. To assess future developments, we need to understand how future population growth, agricultural production patterns, energy use, economic development, and climate change may impact the global freshwater cycle. Integrated models provide opportunities for quantitative assessment. In this paper, we further integrate models of hydrology and economics, using the models IMAGE and LPJmL, with explicit accounting for (1) electricity, industry, and municipal and irrigation water use; (2) intersectoral water allocation rules at the 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees grid scale; and (3) withdrawal, consumption, and return flows. With the integration between hydrology and economy we are able to understand competition dynamics between the different freshwater users at the basin and grid scale. We run model projections for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), more efficient water use, and no expansion of irrigated areas to understand the competition dynamics of these different allocation mechanisms. We conclude that (1) global water withdrawal is projected to increase by 12% in SSP-1, 26% in SSP-2, and 29% in SSP-3 during 2010-2050; (2) water deficits (demand minus allocated water) for nonagricultural uses are small in 2010 but become significant around 2050; (3) interannual variability of precipitation results in variability of water deficits; (4) water use efficiency improvements reduce water withdrawal but have little impact on water deficits; and (5) priority rules at the local level have a large effect on water deficits, whereas limiting the expansion of irrigation has virtually no effect.

AB How does hillslope structure (e.g., hillslope shape and permeability variation) regulate its hydro-geochemical functioning (flow paths, solute export, chemical weathering)? Numerical reactive transport experiments and particle tracking were used to answer this question. Results underscore the first-order control of permeability variations (with depth) on vertical connectivity (VC), defined as the fraction of water flowing into streams from below the soil zone. Where permeability decreases sharply and VC is low, >95% of water flows through the top 6 m of the subsurface, barely interacting with reactive rock at depth. High VC also elongates mean transit times (MTTs) and weathering rates. VC however is less of an influence under arid climates where long transit times drive weathering to equilibrium. The results lead to three working hypotheses that can be further tested. H1: The permeability variations with depth influence MTTs of stream water more strongly than hillslope shapes; hillslope shapes instead influence the younger fraction of stream water more. H2: High VC arising from high permeability at depths enhances weathering by promoting deeper water penetration and water-rock interactions; the influence of VC weakens under arid climates and larger hillslopes with longer MTTs. H3: VC regulates chemical contrasts between shallow and deep waters (C-ratio) and solute export patterns encapsulated in the power law slope b of concentration-discharge (CQ) relationships. Higher VC leads to similar shallow versus deep water chemistry (C-ratio similar to 1) and more chemostatic CQ patterns. Although supporting data already exist, these hypotheses can be further tested with carefully designed, co-located modeling and measurements of soil, rock, and waters. Broadly, the importance of hillslope subsurface structure (e.g., permeability variation) indicate it is essential in regulating earth surface hydrogeochemical response to changing climate and human activities.

Although the spatial variability of CNRs has been extensively explored, temporal variations of CNRs at the individual lake scale has rarely been discussed. The paucity of information about temporal dependence in CNRs may in part be due to the lack of a suitable statistical framework that helps guide such investigations. In order to reveal temporal dependence of CNR, this study develop a novel statistical framework. In the framework, we employ quantile regression to generate overall (the entire dataset), annual (subsets for each year), and accumulative (subsets collected before a certain year) CNRs. We aim to 1) show biases of annual relationships by comparing the overall and annual relationships and 2) determine whether or not data accumulation is enough to develop a reliable CNR. We use Lake Champlain and Lake Kasumigaura as case studies to illustrate the necessary steps needed to utilize this novel framework. Results show that large interannual variations exist for CNRs. Accumulative relationships tend to converge to the overall relationship, indicating that overall relationships are reliable for informing lake-specific eutrophication management in the two case study lakes. The novel statistical framework that we propose for a procedure to estimate reliable CNRs is important for informing lake-specific eutrophication control decision-making processes.

AB Cascades have been used as models of precipitation for nearly 25 years yet many basic questions remain unanswered and most applications have been to small or to regional scales. In this paper we revisit some of these issues and present an inter comparison of four global scale data sets each with exceptional characteristics: the hourly (and approximate to 200 km) resolution Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded precipitation over the continental US, the three hourly global ECMWF reanalysis stratiform precipitation product at 1.5 degrees resolution, the six hourly Twentieth Century reanalysis at 2 degrees (1871-2008) and an analysis of 5300 orbits (1 year) of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite rainfall over +/- 40 degrees latitude. The data were analysed zonally, meridionally and in time. Each showed cascade structures; in space up to planetary scales and in time up to 5-10 days. For each we estimated the moment scaling exponent (K(q)) as well as its characterisation near the mean (C-1) and the effective outer cascade scales. The comparison of the cascade structures in different directions indicate that although anomalies remain, they are relatively isotropic in (horizontal) space-time. For any given direction, the comparison of the different products indicates very similar but not identical scaling properties. In order to be properly inter calibrated at more than a unique resolution, the different products must have the same exponents and outer scales so that - while the similarities are encouraging - the remaining anomalies point to needed improvements in techniques for estimating areal rainfall. Our main conclusion is that the rain rate biases introduced by the measurement techniques are larger than the deviations from perfect log-log linearity (scaling) so that multifractal models will be needed for improving space-time precipitation measurements.
   Our analyses clarify various fundamental issues. For example, the CPC data show that at "weather" scales smaller than approximate to 2 days in time; H = 0.17 +/- 0.11 so that rain is apparently not the direct product of a cascade process (which would have H = 0). Similarly, for the low frequency weather regime (scales >approximate to 12 weeks) we find H approximate to -0.42 so that fluctuations tend to decrease rather than increase with scale and display long range statistical dependencies. Finally, we find power law probability tails with exponent tip q(D) approximate to 3 so that the orders of singularity are apparently not bounded, ruling out several model types including microcanonical and log-Poisson models.

AB Rainfall kinetic energy-intensity relationships for rainfall erosivity estimation were established on the basis of raindrop size distribution measurements performed in the Brkini hilly area in southwest Slovenia, a transitional area between the Mediterranean and continental climate conditions. A set of measurement instruments, an optical disdrometer coupled with a rain gauge, was installed on two locations: Koseze and Kozjane. The data set contained raindrop size distribution and rainfall intensity measurements of the rainfall events that occurred during a one-year period in the 2008/2009 season. The rainfall intensities obtained with the rain gauges were used for event rainfall depth control measured by the disdrometers and testing the established kinetic energy-intensity (KE-I) relationships. Two exponential KE-I relationships were established for each measuring site, for 1-min and 5-min rainfall intensity data, respectively. Their performances were tested and compared with the performances of other KE-I relationships proposed by authors throughout the world, which could be recognised as relatively suitable for kinetic energy estimation in the Mediterranean area. The comparison included 11 KE-I relationships expressed with linear, linear-log or exponential formulations. The analyses exposed the rainfall intensity overestimation by the disdrometers and the limited use of the tipping bucket rain gauge for kinetic energy estimation under such climate conditions. According to our results, the established KE-I relationship for 5-min intensity data in Koseze is recommended to be used while estimating rainfall kinetic energy in the Mediterranean part of Slovenia. As input data, rainfall intensities measured with precise weighing rain gauges, as those installed in the Slovenian meteorological network, should be used. However, when using rainfall intensity data obtained with a tipping bucket rain gauge of lower accuracy or insufficient intensity range, the exponential relationship of Coutinho and Tomas (1995) is expected to deliver better kinetic energy estimations.

ID EXTREME RAINFALL; FLOOD; STATISTICS; SIMULATION
AB Exceptional events may be declared exceptional due to underestimation of extreme values. We focus on the uncertainties associated with the transformation of extreme variables by a rainfall-runoff model, or by a catchment. Conditional probabilities provide a simple model that accounts for the modification of the extreme value index due to the rainfall-runoff transformation. In its original form, this model can only decrease the value of this index, but a modified form yields a family of distributions resilient to exponentially distributed perturbations, not subject to this restriction. The behaviour of these distributions in extreme values is related to the intensity of the perturbation versus the intensity of the relationship with the independent variable (rainfall). The tails of the rainfall and runoff distributions are not necessarily parallel. A case study is presented with positive - but not very different - values of the extreme value indexes. Complementary investigations are performed on synthetic data. As the model exhibits the same behaviour as a more detailed model, the transformation of the extreme value index clearly depends on the transfer function. Hydrological or hydraulic knowledge is therefore necessary to improve estimation of the upper tail of flood distributions.

ID POROUS-MEDIA; SLIP; COEFFICIENT; EQUATIONS; LIQUID; WATER
AB Flow through porous media takes place in diverse geological settings. The fluid motion through pores follows Darcy's Law (linear rate law) in many cases, but at high flows the Forchheimer (nonlinear) flow regime emerges, where fluid flux and the hydraulic gradient are no longer linearly related. The transition to the nonlinear flow regime has many possible causes, making the prediction of its onset nearly impossible. The Reynolds number has been used for identifying the onset of nonlinear flow, but its values span across a few orders of magnitude suggesting it might be an inappropriate or inadequate metric. Through the analysis and synthesis of 2852 singlephase flow experiments in different porous media and supporting numerical pore-scale flow simulations, we observed that the critical hydraulic gradient (I-c) which determines the onset of Forchheimer flow scales with permeability (k) via a power law for high k media (k = 10(-12)-10(-6) m(2)). However, when k is smaller (1 x 10(-12)-1 x 10(-18) m(2)), the Forchheimer flow regime emerges at an Ic that is orders of magnitude smaller than expected, which is possibly caused by the slippery solid surfaces. Other flow processes such as flow separation and recirculation might explain the uncertainties in the power law relationship here and these merit future investigations.

ID VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION; EFFICIENT METHOD
AB Discharge, especially during flood periods, is among the most important information necessary for flood control, water resources planning and management. Owing to the high flood velocities, flood discharge usually cannot be measured efficiently by conventional methods, which explains why records of flood discharge are scarce or do not exist for the watersheds in Taiwan. A fast method of flood discharge estimation is presented. The greatest advantage of the proposed method is its application to estimate flood discharge that cannot be measured by conventional methods. It has as its basis the regularity of open-channel flows, i.e. that nature maintains a constant ratio of mean to maximum velocities at a given channel section by adjusting the velocity distribution and the channel geometry. The maximum velocity at a given section can be determined easily over a single vertical profile, which tends to remain invariant with time and discharge, and can be converted to the mean velocity of the entire cross-section by multying by the constant ratio. Therefore the mean velocity is a common multiple of maximum velocity and the mean/maximum velocity ratio. The channel cross-sectional area can be determined from the gauge height, the water depth at the y-axis or the product of the channel width multiplied by the water depth at the y-axis. Then the most commonly used method, i.e. the velocity-area method, which determines discharge as the product of the cross-sectional area multiplied by mean velocity, is applied to estimate the flood discharge. Only a few velocity measurements on the y-axis are necessary to estimate flood discharge. Moreover the location of the y-axis will not vary with time and water stage. Once the relationship of mean and maximum velocities is established, the flood estimation can be determined efficiently. This method avoids exposure to hazardous environments and sharply reduces the measurement time and cost. The method can be applied in both high and low flows in rivers. Available laboratory flume and stream-flow data are used to illustrate accuracy and reliability, and results show that this method can quickly and accurately estimate flood discharges.

AB The complementary relationship between actual and potential evaporation provides evaporation (i.e. evapotranspiration) estimates from minimal data. Some versions that require a land surface temperature instead of a humidity measurement could potentially be used with routine remotely sensed surface temperature data. A comparison of alternative complementary approaches, including those that require land surface temperatures, was made at small (10-30 min) time scales with point measurements spatially, using data from the FIFE, CASES, SGP, and Sahel field experiments. The advection-aridity version and a related version based on the Penman and the Priestley-Taylor equations performed the best overall. One of the four versions that incorporated land surface temperature performed fairly well. The complementary approach appears to remain viable, especially in remote sensing applications with sparse data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electromagnetic induction measurements (EM) were taken in a saline gypsiferous soil of the Saharan-climate Fatnassa oasis (Tunisia) to predict the electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract (ECe) and shallow groundwater properties (depth, Dgw, and electrical conductivity, ECgw) using various models. The soil profile was sampled at 0.2 m depth intervals to 1.2 m for physical and chemical analysis. The best input to predict the log-transformed soil salinity (lnECe) in surface (0-0.2 m) soil was the EMh/EMv ratio. For the 0-0.6 m soil depth interval, the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR) models to predict lnECe was weaker using data collected over various seasons and years (R-a(2) = 0.66 and MSE = 0.083 dS m(-1)) as compared to those collected during the same period (R-a(2) = 0.97, MSE = 0.007 dS m(-1)). For similar seasonal conditions, for the Dgw-EMv relationship, R-2 was 0.88 and the MSE was 0.02 m for Dgw prediction. For a validation subset, the R-2 was 0.85 and the MSE was 0.03 m. Soil salinity was predicted more accurately when groundwater properties were used instead of soil moisture with EM variables as input in the MLR.

AB The fate of fluid-borne entities depends on flow and transport processes in geological environments. The classical theories for describing flow (Cubic Law) and transport (Taylor dispersion theory) processes within single fractures are based on the Poiseuille flow model (i.e., flow through the parallel plates) and its modifications with more complex surfaces. Nonetheless, the Poiseuille flow model assumes no-slip boundary condition while some natural environments show the otherwise, e.g., fracture walls are slippery with non-zero flow velocity. To better understand the effects of slippery boundaries on transport within Poiseuille flow, we develop a closed-form expression for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (D-L) based on the corrected flow field that considers homogeneous slip boundary condition. Moreover, the reliable direct numerical simulations were implemented to further validate our proposed theory on D-L. Both theory and numerical experiments suggest that homogeneous slip boundary condition unsignificantly alters D-L, although slippery boundaries can significantly change the mean velocity of Poiseuille flow. Our theory based on mechanistic, albeit simplified, model might shed light on predicting the fate of fluid-borne entities in complex geological environments.

AB The impact of changes in land-use/cover on streamflow at short time scales is evaluated by examining the changes in the flow duration curve (FDC) before and after land-use/cover change. The FDC characterizes the relationship between the magnitude and frequency and hence provides the complete range of streamflow over time. Two issues need to be considered in predicting the FDC due to land-use changes: (a) the appropriate parametric form of the FDC that enables application of the same expression of FDCs before and after the changes; and (b) the ability of parameters to capture and characterize the effect of land-use changes. In this paper, we propose a model which is a four-parameter double power form as a function of the FDC, where the two hydrological parameters represent the mean annual flow ((Q) over bar) and the cease-to-flow point (tau expressed as a percentage), while the other two parameters (alpha and beta) determine the shape of the FDC. The properties of this function are investigated in order to assign parameters to cope with the land-use changes. The model is used for several typical catchments in Australia for demonstration.

ID GRAVEL-BED RIVERS; CHANNEL GEOMETRY; EQUATIONS; VELOCITY
AB Using hydraulic geometry (HG) theory, we investigated three rivers typical of the Ecuadorian mountainous region with longitudinal slopes ranging from 0.8% to 10% and coarse bed material with d(50) ranging from 3 to 54 mm and values of d(90) up to 908 mm. Extensive field measurements were performed to characterize geometric and hydraulic properties at 33 sites. Using these field data, at-a-station HG relationships were obtained for top width, average flow depth, and average flow velocity. Dimensional and dimensionless downstream HG relations were obtained for these parameters as well as the channel bed slope using the bankfull discharge estimated with at-a-station HG. The correlation coefficients indicate that the dimensionless equations adequately represent the observed data for all quantities with the exception of slope. In addition to a low correlation coefficient, the exponent on non-dimensional discharge was small in the downstream HG relation for slope. This small exponent indicates that slope is not dependent on discharge. Based on this finding, the non-dimensional HG relations were reformulated using both dimensionless discharge and bed slope as independent variables. These new relations show improved correlation coefficients and demonstrate the role of slope in determining channel width, flow depth, and average velocity in high gradient rivers.

AB Fluid flow in porous media is very important in a wide range of science and engineering applications. The entire establishment of fluid flow application in porous media is based on the use of an experimental law proposed by Darcy (1856). There are evidences in the literature that the flow of a fluid in consolidated and unconsolidated porous media does not follow Darcy law at very low fluxes, which is called pre-Darcy flow. In this paper, the unsteady flow regimes of a slightly compressible fluid under the linear and radial pre-Darcy flow conditions are modeled and the corresponding highly nonlinear diffusivity equations are solved analytically by aid of a generalized Boltzmann transformation technique. The influence of pre-Darcy flow on the pressure diffusion for homogeneous porous media is studied in terms of the nonlinear exponent and the threshold pressure gradient. In addition, the pressure gradient, flux, and cumulative production per unit area are compared with the classical solution of the diffusivity equation based on Darcy flow. The presented results advance our understanding of fluid flow in low-permeability media such as shale and tight formations, where pre-Darcy is the dominant flow regime.

AB Knowledge of rainfall characteristics is important for estimating soil erosion in arid areas. We determined basic rainfall characteristics (raindrop size distribution, intensity and kinetic energy), evaluated the erosivity of rainfall events, and established a relationship between rainfall intensity I and volume-specific kinetic energy KEvol for the Central Rift Valley area of the Ethiopian highlands. We collected raindrops on dyed filter paper and calculated KEvol and erosivity values for each rainfall event. For most rainfall intensities the median volume drop diameter (D-50) was higher than expected, or reported in most studies. Rainfall intensity in the region was not high, with 8% of rain events exceeding 30 mm h(-1). We calculated soil erosion from storm energy and maximum 30-min intensity for soils of different erodibility under conditions of fallow (unprotected soil), steep slope (about 9%) and no cover and management practice on the surface, and determined that 3 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) is the threshold erosivity, while erosivity of > 7 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) could cause substantial erosion in all soil types in the area.

AB The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of the occurrence of flood-generating events in urban areas by analysing the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and extreme precipitation events, extreme sea water level events and their simultaneous occurrence, respectively. To describe the atmospheric circulation, we used the Lamb circulation type (LCT) classification and re-grouped it into Lamb circulation classes (LCC). The daily LCCs/LCTs were connected with rare precipitation and water-level events in Aarhus, a Danish coastal city. Westerly and cyclonic LCCs (W, C, SW and NW) showed a significantly high occurrence of extreme precipitation. Similarly, for extreme water-level events westerly LCCs (W and SW) showed a significantly high occurrence. Significantly low occurrence of extreme precipitation and water-level events was obtained in easterly LCCs (NE, E and SE). For concurrent events, significantly high occurrence was obtained in LCC W. We assessed the change in LCC occurrence frequency in the future based on two regional climate models (RCMs). The projections indicate that the westerly directions in LCCs are expected to increase in the future. Consequently, simultaneous occurrence of extreme water level and precipitation events is expected to increase in the future as a result of change in LCC frequencies. The RCM projections for LCC frequencies are uncertain because the representation of current LCCs is poor; a large number of days cannot be classified and the frequencies of the days that can be classified differ from the observed time series.

AB Pore-network models have been used to describe a wide range of properties from capillary pressure characteristics to interfacial area and mass transfer coefficients. The void space of a rock or soil is described as a network of pores connected by throats. The pores and throats are assigned some idealized geometry and rules are developed to determine the multiphase fluid configurations and transport in these elements. The rules are combined in the network to compute effective transport properties on a mesoscopic scale some tens of pores across. This approach is illustrated by describing a pore-scale model for two- and three-phase flow in media of arbitrary wettability. The appropriate pore-scale physics combined with a geologically representative description of the pore space gives a model that can predict average behavior, such as capillary pressure and relative permeability. This capability is demonstrated by successfully predicting primary drainage and waterflood relative permeabilities for Berea sandstone. The implications of this predictive power for improved characterization of subsurface simulation models are discussed. A simple example field study of waterflooding an oil-wet system near the oil/water contact shows how the assignment of physically-based multiphase flow properties based on pore-scale modeling gives significantly different predictions of oil recovery than using current empirical relative permeability models. Methods to incorporate pore-scale results directly into field-scale simulation are described. In principle, the same approach could be used to describe any type of process for which the behavior is understood at the pore scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   instability in porous media

ID WETTING FRONT INSTABILITY; FINGERED FLOW; 2 DIMENSIONS; FLUID
AB It has been known for decades that isothermal flow fields in porous media can become unstable, resulting in the growth of preferential flow paths and nonmonotonic moisture profiles. The standard approach to modeling isothermal fluid transport in a porous systems is to use Richards equation with equilibrium relationships for the driving potential and monotonic transport coefficients. However, it is well known that under these conditions, solutions to Richards' equation are unconditionally stable. This has left open the question of whether Richards' equation could predict the onset of flow field instability, and what is required to model it. Importantly, past work has shown that pore scale processes can actually cause nonequilibrium driving potentials to arise in unsaturated media. How these can lead to flow field instability can be understood using a form of spectral perturbation theory. Here the driving potential is represented using a Fourier expansion, which is then substituted into Richards equation. The result shows that the evolution of perturbations to the flow field are affected by the interaction between different wavelength components in the Fourier expansion. In particular, there are situations where nonequilibrium driving potentials can set up conditions that would allow the onset of instability in solutions to Richards' equation.

AB In lakes of the Northern Great Plains, algae blooms are of great concern due to the recent increase of streamflow resulting in influx of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P). The cold sub-humid climate and snowmelt hydrology exert strong controls on P concentration, export and supply in the basin. To date, few studies have explored the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions on P concentration, export and concentration-to-streamflow relationships in cold region agricultural basins, and particularly in the headwater catchments of the Devils Lake Basin. This study gains a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on concentration-tostreamflow relationships between two headwater catchments (Mauvais Coulee: 1032 km(2) and Tributary 3: 160 km(2)) draining to Devils Lake during the 2017-2018 period. High-resolution P observations during the first flush of snowmelt runoff are presented. The controlling factors of P exports using both field observations and hydroclimatic variability detected by physically-based hydrologic simulations are investigated. Total P is dominated by dissolved P, with little contribution from particulate P, which is presumed to be locked in an ice matrix in frozen soils. The Mauvais Coulee Basin expresses near chemostatic concentration-to-streamflow relationships in the rising limb of the hydrograph, while concentration correlates positively to streamflow in the descending limb. Our study period has two contrasting water years; a wet year (2016-17) and a dry year (2017-18). The wet year experienced high SWE, snowfall, maximum frozen soil conditions and a thick basal ice layer resulting in high snowmelt streamflow, while the dry year is characterized by lower SWE and absence of frozen soil/basal ice causing very little streamflow. During the wet year lower mean P concentration are observed compared to the dry year due to the presence of frozen soil/basal ice during melt period. However, the P export is much higher in wet year due to large snowmelt streamflow volume. Both chemostatic and flushing streamflow-to-concentration relationships are observed in both years. Thus, the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions to the concentration-to-streamflow relationship are inconclusive. Field observations of more extended time periods will be useful to better understand the influence of hydroclimatic variability on the concentrationto-streamflow relationship.

ID SOIL HYDROPHOBICITY; DEGRADATION; SEVERITY
AB Soil water wettability or water repellency is a phenomenon that can affect infiltration and, ultimately, runoff. Thus, there is a need to develop a model that can quantitatively capture the influence of water repellency on infiltration in a physically meaningful way and within the framework of existing infiltration theory. The analytical model developed in this study relates soil sorptivity (an infiltration parameter) with contact angle (a direct measure of water repellency) for variably saturated media. The model was validated with laboratory experiments using a silica sand of known properties treated to produce controlled degrees of water repellency. The measured contact angle and sorptivity values closely matched the model-predicted values. Further, the relationship between the frequently used water drop penetration time test (used to assess water repellency) and sorptivity was illustrated. Finally, the direct impact of water repellency on saturated hydraulic conductivity was investigated due to its role in infiltration equations and to shed light on inconsistent field observations. It was found that water repellency had minimal effect on the saturated hydraulic conductivity of structureless sand. A quantitative model for infiltration incorporating the effect of water repellency is particularly important for post-fire hydrologic modeling of burned areas exhibiting water repellent soils.

AB We present an experimental and theoretical analysis of non-Boussinesq inertial (large Reynolds number flow) gravity currents (GCs) flowing in rectangular cross-sections. Attention is focused on the effects of the open upper boundary, which become pronounced when the density contrast between the current and the ambient is significant (non-Boussinesq case). The study is conducted deriving first a two-layer shallow-water (SW) model for the release of a constant fluid volume into an ambient of given height with a free-surface boundary condition, with an arbitrary density ratio r between the ambient and the intruding fluid. The jump conditions at the front are provided by the novel extension of Benjamin (1968) analysis, subject to energy-dissipation and sub-critical speed requests, as detailed in Ungarish (2017). The resulting SW lock-release problem is solved via a finite difference approach. Lock-release experiments are then conducted in this configuration with r = 0. 837 -0. 950, full-depth and part-depth locks, and two different lock lengths. Experimental results obtained for the front position and speed of the intruding current, its thickness, and the free-surface depression of the ambient fluid (a signature of these experiments marking the position of the intruding front) agree, to various degrees, with their theoretical counterparts, with a better agreement for the front position and depression than for the other quantities, but demonstrating in all cases the consistency of the trend. Some of the experiments were repeated with a toplid boundary condition, to discern its effect on the current propagation. These effects turn out to be relatively minor except for the obvious absence of interface-height depression. The range of density ratio r examined is further extended by conducting a numerical simulations with r = 0. 7 using a numerical commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics code (CFD) based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). A comparison among SW theory, experiments, and the numerical simulations is conducted in terms of the trough behind the current nose, leading to an overestimation of theoretical results with respect to experiments. The length of the through adequately scales with the lock-length.

AB We propose a novel technique for improving a long-term multi-step-ahead streamflow forecast. A model based on wavelet decomposition and a multivariate Bayesian machine learning approach is developed for forecasting the streamflow 3, 6, 9, and 12months ahead simultaneously. The inputs of the model utilize only the past monthly streamflow records. They are decomposed into components formulated in terms of wavelet multiresolution analysis. It is shown that the model accuracy can be increased by using the wavelet boundary rule introduced in this study. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the effects of different wavelet boundary rules using synthetic and real streamflow data from the Yellowstone River in the Uinta Basin in Utah. The model based on the combination of wavelet and Bayesian machine learning regression techniques is compared with that of the wavelet and artificial neural networks-based model. The robustness of the models is evaluated. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study examines the performance of three hydrological models, namely the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning-D (HBV-D) model, and the Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM) over the upper reaches of the Huai River basin. The assessment is done by using databases of different temporal resolution and by further examining the applicability of SWIM for different catchment sizes. The results show that at monthly scale the performance of the ANN model is better than that of HBV-D and SWIM. The ANN model can be applied at any temporal scale as it establishes an artificial precipitation-runoff relationship for various time scales by only using monthly precipitation, temperature and runoff data. However, at daily scale the performance of both HBV-D and SWIM are similar or even better than the ANN model. In addition, the performance of SWIM at a small catchment size (less than 10000km(2)) is much better than at a larger catchment size. In view of climate change modelling, HBV-D and SWIM might be integrated in a dynamical atmosphere-water-cycle modelling rather than the ANN model due to their use of observed physical links instead of artificial relations within a black box

AB The lower Araguas catchment, central Pyrenees, is characterized by extensive badlands (25% of the total catchment), whereas the upper catchment is covered by dense plantation forest. The catchment (45 ha) has been monitored since October 2005 with the aim of studying its hydrological response. The 44 floods recorded over this period were analysed to identify the factors that control the rainfall-runoff relationship. The first relevant feature of the catchment was its responsiveness. The catchment reacted to all rainfall events, but the irregular nature of the hydrological response was the most characteristic feature of the response. No single variable could explain the response of the Araguas catchment. It was found that storm-flow coefficients mainly depend on the combination of rainfall volume and antecedent baseflow. A significant correlation was observed between maximum rainfall intensity and peak flow values. The shapes of the different hydrographs are very similar, regardless of the peak flow magnitude; they show a short time lag, relatively narrow peak flow, and steep recession limb. This indicates a large contribution by overland flow, resulting mainly from the generation of infiltration excess runoff in badland areas.

AB The problem of estimation of suspended load carried by a river is an important topic for many water resources projects. Conventional estimation methods are based on the assumption of exact observations. In practice, however, a major source of natural uncertainty is due to imprecise measurements and/or imprecise relationships between variables. In this paper, using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) technique, a novel fuzzy regression model for imprecise response and crisp explanatory variables is presented. The investigated fuzzy regression model is applied to forecast suspended load by discharge based on two real-world datasets. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with two well-known parametric fuzzy regression models, namely, the fuzzy least-absolutes model and the fuzzy least-squares model. The comparison results reveal that the MARS-fuzzy regression model performs better than the other models in suspended load estimation for the particular datasets. This comparison is done based on four goodness-of-fit criteria: the criterion based on similarity measure, the criterion based on absolute errors and the two objective functions of the fuzzy least-absolutes model and the fuzzy least-squares model. The proposed model is general and can be used for modelling natural phenomena whose available observations are reported as imprecise rather than crisp.

AB The concept of "catchment-scale storm velocity" quantifies the rate of storm motion up and down the basin accounting for the interaction between the rainfall space-time variability and the structure of the drainage network. It provides an assessment of the impact of storm motion on flood shape. We evaluate the catchment-scale storm velocity for the 29 August 2003 extreme storm that occurred on the 700 km(2)-wide Fella River basin in the eastern Italian Alps. The storm was characterized by the high rate of motion of convective cells across the basin. Analysis is carried out for a set of basins that range in area from 8 to 623 km(2) to: (a) determine velocity magnitudes for different sub-basins; (b) examine the relationship of velocity with basin scale and (c) assess the impact of storm motion on simulated flood response. Two spatially distributed hydrological models of varying degree of complexity in the representation of the runoff generation processes are used to evaluate the effects of the storm velocity on flood modelling and investigate model dependencies of the results. It is shown that catchment-scale storm velocity has a non-linear dependence on basin scale and generally exhibits rather moderate values, in spite of the strong kinematic characteristics of individual storm elements. Consistently with these observations and for both models, hydrological simulations show that storm motion has an almost negligible effect on the flood response modelling.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are very useful for hydrological studies because the dielectric properties of materials are generally dependent on the amount of liquid water in the material, and this affects the strength of the radar backscatter, sigma degrees. Additionally, the ability of microwaves to penetrate the surface of many materials often permits analysis of subsurface properties. Further, SAR sensors can image the Earth through both clouds and darkness which enables dynamic hydrological events, e.g. floods, to be captured. Both radar system parameters and surface characteristics affect sigma degrees. In the case of snow, sigma degrees is the sum of the surface scattering at the air/snow interface, volume scattering within the snowpack, scattering at the snow/soil interface and volumetric scattering from the underlying surface (if applicable). For glaciers, sigma degrees is dominated by scattering from the surface and is dependent upon the roughness of the glacier surface in relationship to the radar wavelength. Imaging radar is proving to be an important tool for measuring flooding beneath a variety of herbaceous and woody vegetation. Use of multi-frequency and multi-polarization sensors is necessary to improve the accuracy of mapping flooded vs non-flooded land in floodplains. SAR data have been shown to have potential for measuring stream discharge in braided rivers and for studying key characteristics of frozen lakes. Work with polarimetric SAR data is becoming increasingly significant in hydrological studies.

AB Steep streams with massive sediment supply are among the most complex systems to study, even in the laboratory. Their shallow sediment-laden flows create self-adjusting bed geometries that evolve rapidly. Often, morphological changes and flow processes cannot be dissociated. Because these very shallow and unstable flows cannot be equipped with measurement sensors, image analysis techniques, such as photogrammetry (e.g., structure-from-motion, SfM) and large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV), are interesting options for capturing the characteristics of these systems. The present work describes a complete procedure using both techniques to measure spatially distributed surface velocity and bed properties (deposit patterns, channel slope, and local roughness). The velocity data are used to assess the local flow directions along which the channel slope and roughness are extracted from the SfM digital elevation models. Fergusons variable power equation friction law, having been previously validated by comparison with approximately 100 local flow depth measurements, was used in a second step with the collected data to reconstruct a complete mapping of the depth-averaged flows, thereby enabling a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogeomorphic system where shallow water equations apply. The assumptions, details, use of the friction law with roughness standard deviation rather than diameter as parameter and limitations of the procedure as well as possible sources of errors are discussed here, along with possibilities for improvements. This affordable and simple-to-implement procedure can provide a large amount of data, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of complex hydraulic systems.
   Plain Language Summary Steep-slope stream hydraulics are complicated and insufficiently known because fast, active, mobile, and profoundly correlated with massive sediment transport processes. Capturing data on such flows is complicated, although necessary to develop and validate models. Here we propose a combination of two image analysis methods (SfM and LSPIV) and an inverse procedure using a friction law to acquire thousands of flow observations. This affordable and simple to use method gives promising perspectives for other application in the still widely used flume experiments.

AB Hydrological and land surface models require simple but accurate methods to predict the solar radiation transmitted through vegetation to snow, backed up by direct comparisons to data. Twenty shortwave pyranometers were deployed in forest plots of varying canopy structures and densities in sparse birch forest near Abisko, Sweden, in spring 2011 and mixed conifer forest near Sodankyla, Finland, in spring 2012. Above-canopy global and diffuse shortwave irradiances were also measured. These data were used to test a model that uses hemispherical photographs to explicitly estimate both diffuse radiation and direct beam transmission, as well as two models that apply bulk canopy parameters and versions of Beers Law. All three models predict canopy shortwave transmission similarly well for leafless birch forest, but for conifers, the bulk methods perform poorly. In addition, an existing model of multiple reflections between canopy and snow was found to be suitable for birch, but not conifers. A new bulk approach based on empirical relationships with hemisphere-averaged sky view fraction showed improved performance for both sites; this suggests benefits of avoiding the use of plant area index calculated from optical methods, which can introduce errors. Furthermore, tests using common empirical diffuse radiation models were shown to underestimate shortwave transmission by up to 7% relative to using the data, suggesting that new diffuse models are required for high latitudes.

AB Regional impacts of climate change remain subject to large uncertainties accumulating from various sources, including those due to choice of general circulation models (GCMs), scenarios, and downscaling methods. Objective constraints to reduce the uncertainty in regional predictions have proven elusive. In most studies to date the nature of the downscaling relationship (DSR) used for such regional predictions has been assumed to remain unchanged in a future climate. However, studies have shown that climate change may manifest in terms of changes in frequencies of occurrence of the leading modes of variability, and hence, stationarity of DSRs is not really a valid assumption in regional climate impact assessment. This work presents an uncertainty modeling framework where, in addition to GCM and scenario uncertainty, uncertainty in the nature of the DSR is explored by linking downscaling with changes in frequencies of such modes of natural variability. Future projections of the regional hydrologic variable obtained by training a conditional random field (CRF) model on each natural cluster are combined using the weighted Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of evidence combination. Each projection is weighted with the future projected frequency of occurrence of that cluster ("cluster linking") and scaled by the GCM performance with respect to the associated cluster for the present period ("frequency scaling"). The D-S theory was chosen for its ability to express beliefs in some hypotheses, describe uncertainty and ignorance in the system, and give a quantitative measurement of belief and plausibility in results. The methodology is tested for predicting monsoon streamflow of the Mahanadi River at Hirakud Reservoir in Orissa, India. The results show an increasing probability of extreme, severe, and moderate droughts due to climate change. Significantly improved agreement between GCM predictions owing to cluster linking and frequency scaling is seen, suggesting that by linking regional impacts to natural regime frequencies, uncertainty in regional predictions can be realistically quantified. Additionally, by using a measure of GCM performance in simulating natural regimes, this uncertainty can be effectively constrained.

AB We develop optimal conjunctive use water management strategies that balance two potentially conflicting objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture during droughts and minimizing unnecessary spills and resulting water losses from the reservoir during wet periods. Conjunctive use is specified by a linear operating rule, which determines the maximum surface water release as a function of initial reservoir storage. Optimal strategies are identified using multiobjective interannual optimization for sustainability and spill control, combined with gradient-based annual profit maximization. Application to historical conditions in the irrigated system of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico, yields a Pareto curve of solutions illustrating the trade-off between sustaining agriculture and minimizing spills and water losses. Minimal water losses are obtained by maximizing surface water use and limiting groundwater pumping, such that reservoir levels are kept sufficiently low. Maximum agricultural sustainability, on the other hand, results from increased groundwater use and keeping surface water reservoir levels high during wet periods. Selected optimal operating rules from the multiobjective optimization are tested over a large number of equally probable streamflow time series, generated with a stochastic time series model. In this manner, statistical properties, such as the mean sustainability and sustainability percentiles, are determined for each optimal rule. These statistical properties can be used to select rules for water management that are reliable over a wide range of streamflow conditions.

AB The uncertainty associated with a rainfall runoff and non-point source loading (NPS) model can be attributed to both the parameterization and model structure. An interesting implication of the areal nature of NPS models is the direct relationship between model structure (i.e. sub-watershed size) and sample size for the parameterization of spatial data. The approach of this research is to find structural limitations in scale for the use of the conceptual NPS model, then examine the scales at which suitable stochastic depictions of key parameter sets can be generated. The overlapping regions are optimal (and possibly the only suitable regions) for conducting meaningful stochastic analysis with a given NPS model. Previous work has sought to find optimal scales for deterministic analysis (where, in fact, calibration can be adjusted to compensate for sub-optimal scale selection); however, analysis of stochastic suitability and uncertainty associated with both the conceptual model and the parameter set, as presented here, is novel; as is the strategy of delineating a watershed based on the uncertainty distribution. The results of this paper demonstrate a narrow range of acceptable model structure for stochastic analysis in the chosen NPS model. In the case examined, the uncertainties associated with parameterization and parameter sensitivity are shown to be outweighed in significance by those resulting from structural and conceptual decisions.

TI IDF relationships using bivariate copula for storm events in Peninsular

ID RAINFALL INTENSITY; EXTREME RAINFALL; DURATION; DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are used in many hydrologic designs for the purpose of water managements and flood preventions. The IDF curves available in Malaysia are those obtained from univariate analysis approach which only considers the intensity of rainfalls at fixed time intervals. As several rainfall variables are correlated with each other such as intensity and duration, this paper aims to derive IDF points for storm events in Peninsular Malaysia by means of bivariate frequency analysis. This is achieved through utilizing the relationship between storm intensities and durations using the copula method. Four types of copulas; namely the Ali-Mikhail-Haq (AMH), Frank, Gaussian and Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copulas are considered because the correlation between storm intensity, I, and duration, D, are negative and these copulas are appropriate when the relationship between the variables are negative. The correlations are attained by means of Kendall's tau estimation. The analysis was performed on twenty rainfall stations with hourly data across Peninsular Malaysia. Using Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) for testing goodness-of-fit, both Frank and Gaussian copulas are found to be suitable to represent the relationship between land D. The IDF points found by the copula method are compared to the IDF curves yielded based on the typical IDF empirical formula of the univariate approach. This study indicates that storm intensities obtained from both methods are in agreement with each other for any given storm duration and for various return periods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Empirical relationships for the estimation of debris flow runout

AB The Wenchuan area has become highly susceptible to landslides and debris flows since the earthquake occurred on 2008. A detailed debris flow hazard assessment is necessary to provide information for future risk management. Debris flow runout on a depositional fan is an important factor for assessing debris flow hazard, and its estimate becomes essential for the planning of the mitigation works that must be built. We therefore developed two simple empirical relationships based both on univariate and multivariate approaches, which provide the runout distance using the data for 134 channelized debris flow events in 134 catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. We generated a correlation matrix of the debris flow runout distances and the relevant variables. Because of the high correlations, the independent variable debris flow volume (V-D) was selected for the univariate approach. Using a multicollinearity analysis and a stepwise regression technique, the catchment (basin) internal relief (H), and V-D were used to develop a multivariate runout relationship. The coefficients of the variables were obtained using 80% of the dataset (training dataset); the remaining 20% was used for test of estimated performance by comparing the computed runout distances with observed values. The validation demonstrated that the proposed relationships are suitable for estimating the runout distances of debris flows on depositional fans in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. The univariate runout relationship has the advantage of being simple, whereas the multivariate runout relationship provides higher accuracy. Additionally we rearranged and reformulated existing relationships using the same training dataset and compared the results with those from the relationships here proposed. The estimations provided by our relationships were the closest to the observed values. The presented approaches may be applied to estimate debris flow runout distances in other areas after they are retrained using local datasets.

AB Using 30 years (1979-2009) of data from 33 automatic rain gauges in the Netherlands, a study of the space-time variability of rainfall is performed. This study uses 90-day averaged semi-variograms to find seasonal signals in the fitted spherical semi-variogram parameters of rainrates in the Netherlands, for accumulation intervals between 1 and 24 h. These signals can be well-described by simple cosine functions. The dependence of these cosine functions on the accumulation interval is modeled in two different ways: (1) power-law relations between the variogram parameters and the accumulation interval, and (2) power-law relations between the parameters of the cosine functions and the accumulation interval. For the first method the cosine function at the 24-h accumulation interval is also needed. The second of these methods has more parameters, but is shown to model the temporal scaling best. The space-time scaling relations found in this paper are compared to those found by others for similar and contrasting climates. Seasonality is shown to play an important role in determining rainfall spatial variability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the great power of modern computers allows to develop computational models able to deal with simulations of several coupled phenomena over detailed complex topography. An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. In this work, we present a coupled surface-groundwater distributed flow model with hydrological (rainfall and infiltration) and geomorphological (suspended and bed load sediment transport) components. The coupled model is applied to well characterized experimental catchments that are used as realistic test cases. The calibration of the water flow model response to rainfall is performed by means of the fitting to experimental outlet hydrographs of the results supplied by a coupled formulation of 2D Shallow Water Equations and 2D Darcy's law for saturated porous media connected via suitable infiltration laws. The calibration of a suspended and bed load model is also addressed by means of the fitting to experimental outlet sedigraphs. The numerical results show a good agreement between numerical and observed hydrographs and sedigraphs, significantly improving previous published simulations. Additionally, the need to repeat the simulations in the calibration processes is no longer an unapproachable problem.

AB Connectivity of high/low-permeability areas has been recognized to significantly impact groundwater flow and solute transport. The task of defining a rigorous quantitative measure of connectivity for continuous variables has failed so far, and thus there exist a suite of connectivity indicators which are dependent on the specific hydrodynamic processes and the interpretation method. Amongst the many existing indicators, we concentrate on those characterizing connectivity between the points involved in a hydraulic or tracer test. The flow connectivity indicator used here is based on the time elapsed for hydraulic response in a pumping test (e.g., the storage coefficient estimated by the Cooper-Jacob method, S-est). Regarding transport, we select the estimated porosity from the breakthrough curve (phi(est)). According to Knudby and Carrera [Knudby C, Carrera J. On the relationship between indicators of geostatistical, flow and transport connectivity. Adv Water Resour 2005;28(4):405-21] these two indicators measure connectivity differently, and are poorly correlated. Here, we use perturbation theory to analytically investigate the intrinsic relationship between S-est and phi(est). We find that phi(est) can be expressed as a weighted line integral along the particle trajectory involving two parameters: the transmissivity point values, T, and the estimated values of S-est along the particle path. The weighting function is linear with the distance from the pumping well, thus the influence of the weighting function is maximum at the injection area, whereas the hydraulic information close to the pumping well becomes redundant (null weight). The relative importance of these two factors is explored using numerical simulations in a given synthetic aquifer and tested against intermediate-scale laboratory tracer experiments. We conclude that the degree of connectivity between two points of an aquifer (point-to-point connectivity) is a key issue for risk assessment studies aimed at predicting the travel time of a potential contaminant.

AB The SWAT model was tested to simulate the streamflow of two small Mediterranean catchments (the VSne and the Pallas) in southern France. Model calibration and prediction uncertainty were assessed simultaneously by using three different techniques (SUFI-2, GLUE and ParaSol). Initially, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the LH-OAT method. Subsequent sensitive parameter calibration and SWAT prediction uncertainty were analysed by considering, firstly, deterministic discharge data (assuming no uncertainty in discharge data) and secondly, uncertainty in discharge data through the development of a methodology that accounts explicitly for error in the rating curve (the stage-discharge relationship). To efficiently compare the different uncertainty methods and the effect of the uncertainty of the rating curve on model prediction uncertainty, common criteria were set for the likelihood function, the threshold value and the number of simulations. The results show that model prediction uncertainty is not only case-study specific, but also depends on the selected uncertainty analysis technique. It was also found that the 95% model prediction uncertainty interval is wider and more successful at encompassing the observations when uncertainty in the discharge data is considered explicitly. The latter source of uncertainty adds additional uncertainty to the total model prediction uncertainty.

AB Non-Fickian transport ubiquitously occurs across all scales within fractured geological media. Detailed characterization of non-Fickian transport through single fractures is thus critical for predicting the fate of solutes and other fluid-borne entities through fractured media. Our direct numerical simulations of solute transport through two-dimensional rough-walled fractures showed early arrival and heavy tailing in breakthrough curves (BTCs), which are salient characteristics of non-Fickian transport. Analyses for dispersion coefficients (D-ADE) using the standard advection-dispersion equation (ADE) led to errors which increased linearly with fracture heterogeneity. Estimated Taylor dispersion coefficients deviated from estimated D-ADE even at higher Peclet numbers. Alternatively, we used continuous time random walk (CTRW) model with truncated power law transition rate probability to characterize the non-Fickian transport. CTRW modeling markedly and consistently improved fits to the BTCs relative to those fitted with ADE solutions. The degree of deviation of transport from Fickian to non-Fickian is captured by the parameter of the truncated power law. We found that is proportional to fracture heterogeneity. We also found that the CTRW transport velocity can be predicted based on the flow velocity. Along with the ability to predict , this is a major step toward prediction of transport through CTRW using measurable physical properties.

AB Reliable estimation of river discharge to the ocean from large tidal rivers is vital for water resources management and climate analyses. Due to the difficulties inherent in measuring tidal-river discharge, flow records are often limited in length and/or quality and tidal records often predate discharge records. Tidal theory indicates that tides and river discharge interact through quadratic bed friction, which diminishes and distorts the tidal wave as discharge increases. We use this phenomenon to develop a method of estimating river discharge for time periods with tidal data but no flow record. Employing sequential 32 day harmonic analyses of tidal properties, we calibrate San Francisco (SF), CA tide data to the Sacramento River delta outflow index from 1930 to 1990, and use the resulting relationship to hindcast river flow from 1858 to 1929. The M-2 admittance (a ratio of the observed M-2 tidal constituent to its astronomical forcing) best reproduces high flows, while low-flow periods are better represented by amplitude ratios based on higher harmonics (e.g., M-4/M-2(2)). Results show that the annual inflow to SF Bay is now 30% less than before 1900 and confirm that the flood of January 1862 was the largest since 1858.

AB River discharges are typically derived from a single-valued stage-discharge relationship. However. there is Usually no one-to-one relationship between stage and discharge, and the use of a single-valued relationship may lead to uncertainties. This paper considers fuzzy set theory-based methods for analysis and propagation of uncertainties. The uncertainty analysis involves the application of fuzzy linear and nonlinear regression methods to define upper and lower bounds of the relationship, which expresses discharge values as fuzzy numbers. The resulting membership function of a peak discharge value is used for propagation Of uncertainties in river channels and flood plains. This involves an application of the fuzzy alpha-level cut method together with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The methods are demonstrated using data from the Lauffien gauging station on the River Neckar, Germany.

AB This research examines ways that climate change may alter the risk of flooding in cold regions focusing on changes in the flood regimes and changes and shifts in the dominant flood generating processes at 27 natural watersheds across Canada and the northern United States. Changes in flood regimes are examined using data from long term hydrometric reference streamflow gauging stations whose data record spans the past 100 years; stations included are considered to have good quality data and were screened to avoid the influences of regulation, diversions, or land use change. Changes in flood regimes are complex and require different approaches to properly characterize the variety of changes that have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Peaks over threshold data are used to explore changes to the magnitude, timing, volume and duration of threshold exceedences. Circular statistics are used to explore changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing and regularity of flood threshold exceedences. All flood regimes show an increased number of threshold exceeding events. An increased prevalence of rainfall flood responses is observed as flood events occur more often during the rainfall dominated portion of the seasonal cycle resulting in a shift for nival regime stations to a more mixed regime and for mixed regime stations towards a more pluvial regime. The results support viewing hydrologic regime as a continuum from nival to pluvial with several stations shifting towards the pluvial end.

AB This paper explores the use of entropy-based measures in catchment hydrology, and provides an importance-weighted numerical descriptor of the flow-duration curve. Although entropy theory is being applied in a wide spectrum of areas (including environmental and water resources), artefacts arising from the discrete, under-sampled and uncertain nature of hydrological data are rarely acknowledged, and have not been adequately explored. Here, we examine challenges to extracting hydrologically meaningful entropy measures from a flow signal; the effect of binning resolution on calculation of entropy is investigated, along with artefacts caused by (1) emphasis of information theoretic measures towards flow ranges having more data (statistically dominant information), and (2) effects of discharge measurement truncation errors. We introduce an importance-weighted entropy-based measure to counter the tendency of common binning approaches to over-emphasise information contained in the low flows which dominate the record. The measure uses a novel binning method, and overcomes artefacts due to data resolution and under-sampling. Our analysis reveals a fundamental problem with the extraction of information at high flows, due to the lack of statistically significant samples in this range. By separating the flow-duration curve into segments, our approach constrains the computed entropy to better respect distributional properties over the data range. When used as an objective function for model calibration, this approach constrains high flow predictions, as well as the commonly used Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, but provides much better predictions of low flow behaviour.

DE stream depletion model; well pumping; nonlinear captured evaporation;

AB A study was made to develop a model that can be used to predict the steady-state stream depletion rates caused by a continuous pumping well located in a water table aquifer. The effects of nonlinear variation of evaporation with the depth to water table on steady-state stream depletion rate were investigated using model results. Dimensional analysis was used to determine the relationship between the scaled steady-state stream depletion, the scaled pumping distance, the scaled hydraulic conductivity, and the scaled initial depth to the water table. A dimensionless graph was developed for a wide range of these parameters. Analysis of this graph showed that the steady-state stream depletion rate decreases as the pumping distance between the well and the stream increases. The dimensionless graph also showed that steady-state stream depletion rates strongly depended on the initial position of the water table. Analysis indicated that, as the saturated conductivity increased, the effect of the initial position of the water table on the magnitude of stream depletion rate was more influential. Analysis also showed that, as the value of saturated conductivity decreased, the relative error produced by the assumption that at steady state all the pumped water is captured from the evaporation, also decreased.

AB Sediment rating curves, which are fitted relationships between river discharge (Q) and suspended-sediment concentration (C), are commonly used to assess patterns and trends in river water quality. In many of these studies, it is assumed that rating curves have a power-law form (i.e. C=aQ(b), where a and b are fitted parameters). Two fundamental questions about the utility of these techniques are assessed in this paper: (i) how well to the parameters, a and b, characterize trends in the data, and (ii) are trends in rating curves diagnostic of changes to river water or sediment discharge? As noted in previous research, the offset parameter, a, is not an independent variable for most rivers but rather strongly dependent on b and Q. Here, it is shown that a is a poor metric for trends in the vertical offset of a rating curve, and a new parameter, a, as determined by the discharge-normalized power function [C=a (Q/Q(GM))(b)], where Q(GM) is the geometric mean of the Q-values sampled, provides a better characterization of trends. However, these techniques must be applied carefully, because curvature in the relationship between log(Q) and log(C), which exists for many rivers, can produce false trends in a and b. Also, it is shown that trends in a and b are not uniquely diagnostic of river water or sediment supply conditions. For example, an increase in a can be caused by an increase in sediment supply, a decrease in water supply or a combination of these conditions. Large changes in water and sediment supplies can occur without any change in the parameters, a and b. Thus, trend analyses using sediment rating curves must include additional assessments of the time-dependent rates and trends of river water, sediment concentrations and sediment discharge.

ID RULE-BASED APPROACH; UNSATURATED ZONE; DROUGHT; SYSTEM
AB Over the last decades, several data-driven techniques have been applied to model the rainfall-discharge dynamics of catchments. Among these techniques are fuzzy rule-based models, which attempt to describe the catchment response to rainfall input through fuzzy relationships. In this paper, we demonstrate three different methods for constructing fuzzy rule-based models of the Takagi-Sugeno type relating rainfall to catchment discharge. They correspond to the grid partitioning, subtractive clustering, and Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering identification methods. The data set used to parametrize and validate the models consists of hourly precipitation and discharge records. The models are parametrized using a 1-year identification data set and are then applied to a 4-year data set. Although the models show a similar performance, the best results are obtained for the GK method. A real-time flood forecasting algorithm is then developed, in which discharge measurements are assimilated into the model at either an hourly or a daily time step. The results suggest that the GK method can potentially be used as an operational flood forecasting tool with a low computational cost. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This review article shows that the occurrence of macroscopic flow configuration is a universal natural phenomenon that can be explained and predicted on the basis of a principle of physics (the constructal law): "For a flow system to persist in time (to survive) it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier and easier access to the currents that flow through it". The examples given in this article come from natural inanimate flow systems with configuration: duct cross-sections, open channel cross-sections, tree-shaped flow architectures, and turbulent flow structure (e.g., eddies, laminar lengths before transition). Other examples that are treated in the literature, and which support the constructal law, are the wedge-shape of turbulent shear layers, jets and plumes, the frequency of vortex shedding, Benard convection in fluids and fluid-saturated porous media, dendritic solidification, the coalescence of solid parcels suspended in a flow, global atmospheric and oceanic circulation and climate, and virtually all architectural features of animal design. The constructal law stresses the importance of reserving a place for pure theory in research, and for constantly searching for new physics - new summarizing principles that are general, hence useful.

   DERIVATION
AB Multi-objective flood control operation of cascade reservoirs is a vital issue in river basin management. However, traditional multi-objective approaches commonly provide one operation scheme only and fail to offer decision-makers with more Pareto-front options. This study explores a multi-objective cluster-decomposition framework for optimizing the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin. The proposed framework involves a multi-objective optimization module, a cluster-decomposition module, and an evaluation and sorting module. The multi-objective cluster-decomposition framework simultaneously deals with three objectives: to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points (O1); to minimize the reservoir capacity used for flood control (O2); and to minimize the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area (O3). The complex flood control system composed of two cascade reservoirs, four navigation-power junctions, one flood detection area, and three flood control points in the Ganjiang River basin of China constitutes the case study. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the comprehensive benefits of the cascade reservoirs, where the maximum reduction in objectives O1-O3 is 2071 m3/s (the improvement rate is 2.64 %), 219 million m3 (the improvement rate is 44.60 %), and 167 million m3 (the improvement rate is 78.13 %), respectively. Furthermore, in contrast to the traditional multi-attribute evaluation method, the proposed framework can effectively identify compromised decisions through a cluster-decomposition module, which provides beneficial trade-off guidance in making a sound decision upon Pareto-front options.

AB Regulation of streamflow by large reservoirs alters the characteristics of hydrological drought. However, few studies have focused on the impacts of regulation on the water required (WR) for hydrological drought recovery, nor on the response relationship between WR and drought characteristics (i.e., duration and severity). Therefore, we proposed a comparative approach that integrates reconstructing unregulated streamflow and a drought identification method using variable threshold levels (VTLs) to evaluate the impacts. Long-term (>40 years) observational datasets for streamflow at a hydrometric station and inflow and outflow at multiple large reservoirs in the Dongjiang River Basin were used. Using VTLs that accounted for seasonal differences in hydrological processes, our method performed well in identifying historical hydrological droughts and their characteristics in the study area. The WR mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration and there was a clear nonlinear response relationship (i.e., power function) between WR and drought severity. The performance indices (i.e., R-2 = 0.92, NSE = 0.97, PBIAS = 13.57%) indicated that the optimal nonlinear function model could accurately simulate the WR of hydrological drought events. Large reservoirs reduce the frequency of hydrological droughts, shorten drought duration, and reduce drought severity by storing water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season. The presence of reservoirs shifted the relationship between WR and drought severity from linear to nonlinear. These findings showed that the proposed methodology can help us to optimize the management of water resources for drought prevention and disaster reduction under changing environments.

AB Many water resource systems have been designed assuming that the statistical characteristics of future inflows are similar to those of the historical record. This assumption is no longer valid due to large-scale changes in the global climate, potentially causing declines in water resource system performance, or even complete system failure. Upgrading system infrastructure to cope with climate change can require substantial financial outlay, so it might be preferable to optimize existing system performance when possible. This paper builds on decision scaling theory by proposing a bottom-up approach to designing optimal feedback control policies for a water system exposed to a changing climate. This approach not only describes optimal operational policies for a range of potential climatic changes but also enables an assessment of a system's upper limit of its operational adaptive capacity, beyond which upgrades to infrastructure become unavoidable. The approach is illustrated using the Lake Como system in Northern Italya regulated system with a complex relationship between climate and system performance. By optimizing system operation under different hydrometeorological states, it is shown that the system can continue to meet its minimum performance requirements for more than three times as many states as it can under current operations. Importantly, a single management policy, no matter how robust, cannot fully utilize existing infrastructure as effectively as an ensemble of flexible management policies that are updated as the climate changes.

AB In this work we develop a new multiscale procedure to compute numerically the statistical moments of the stochastic variables which govern single phase flow in heterogeneous porous media. The technique explores the properties of the log-normally distributed hydraulic conductivity, characterized by power-law or exponential covariances, which shows invariance in its statistical structure upon a simultaneous change of the scale of observation and strength of heterogeneity. We construct a family of equivalent stochastic hydrodynamic variables satisfying the same flow equations at different scales and strengths of heterogeneity or correlation lengths. Within the new procedure the governing equations are solved in a scaled geology and the numerical results are mapped onto the original medium at coarser scales by a straightforward rescaling. The new procedure is implemented numerically within the Monte Carlo algorithm and also in conjunction with the discretization of the low-order effective equations derived from perturbation analysis. Numerical results obtained by the finite element method show the accuracy of the new procedure to approximated the two first moments of the pressure and velocity along with its potential in reducing drastically the computational cost involved in the numerical modeling of both power-law and exponential covariance functions.

TI Evaporation From Unsaturated Soils as a Function of the Air and Soil

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID WATER; GROUNDWATER; COLUMN; LAYER
AB A theoretical framework for computing the evaporation from unsaturated soils is presented and validated based on laboratory experiments that were conducted in an uncontrolled environment where forcing variables vary in time according to diurnal meteorological cycles. This theory introduces a dimensionless number that controls the ratio between the actual and potential evaporation from unsaturated soils. The dimensionless number depends on the transfer velocity, which characterizes evaporation into the atmosphere, the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in the soil, and the water table depth. We show that depending on the value of the dimensionless number, evaporation can be limited by either the air-side or the soil-side of the land surface. For large transfer velocity values, evaporation is controlled by water vapor diffusion in the soil, while for shallow water tables, evaporation is controlled by water vapor transport from the land surface into the atmosphere. Despite the good agreement between the shape of the observed and predicted evaporation rates, a fitted dimensionless parameter is required to match the predicted evaporation rates. Possible explanations for this disagreement are given in the discussion.
   Plain Language Summary This article seeks to understand and quantify the hydrological cycle in closed basins that are found in the Altiplano region of the Andes Cordillera of South America. These closed basins are found in the desert and, by definition, have no outflow rivers, so the water that precipitates in the catchment must be completely evaporated within the catchment. An important part of this evaporation occurs in the open wetlands (many of which are protected by both national and international laws), which are found in the central depression of the basin, as well as in from the surrounding desert, where groundwater is located at a certain depth below the land surface. In this article, we propose and validate a simple expression for computing soil water evaporation and conduct laboratory experiments in an uncontrolled environment where air and soil temperatures, air humidity, and wind speed vary over time according to diurnal meteorological cycles.

ID EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DEFINITIONS
AB Researchers have used various physical, chemical, or topographic features to define estuaries, based on the needs of their particular subject. The principal features of estuaries are the tides that influence their water stages; thus, the boundaries of an estuary can be determined based on whether the water stage is subject to tidal influence. However, the water stage is also influenced by the upstream river discharge. A hydrograph of water stage will therefore include both non-stationary and nonlinear features. Here, we use the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), which allows us to process such non-stationary and nonlinear signals, to decompose the water-stage hydrographs recorded at different gauging stations in an estuary into their intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and residuals. We then analyse the relationships between the frequencies of IMFs and known tidal components. A frequency correlation indicates that the water stage of the station is subject to tidal influences and is located within the estuary. The spatial distribution of the stations that are subject to tidal influences can then be used to define the estuary boundaries. We used data from gauging stations in the estuary region of Taiwan's Tanshui River to assess the feasibility of using the HHT to define an estuary. The results show that the HHT is a dependable and easy method for determining the boundaries of an estuary.

AB Severe drought events worldwide have considerably unfavorable effects on social and economic development. This paper proposes a hedging policy triggered by the seasonal drought prevention limiting water level (DPLWL) for reservoir operations during a drought event. By using this hedging policy, water resources managers can determine operating policies for drought emergence management according to specific drought conditions. A modeling framework that determines the seasonal DPLWL under different drought conditions is developed based on long-term hydrological and meteorological information and optimal reservoir operation schemes. In particular, Fisher's optimal partitioning algorithm is applied to identifying the seasonality of the DPLWL based on hydroclimatological factors and reservoir storage conditions. The multireservoir system in the Yellow River Basin is used as a case study to assess the performance of the hedging policy triggered by DPLWLs. The results show that DPLWL has a significant advantage over the standard reservoir operation rules when dealing with multireservoir operation for drought mitigation.

This paper first proposes a hedging policy triggered by the drought prevention limiting water level (DPLWL) for reservoir operations to mitigate drought impacts. Furthermore, a new framework is developed to determine seasonal DPLWLs. This framework is applied to the Yellow River Basin, of which the water flow is regulated by a series of large reservoirs. This study extends the literature on hedging rules for reservoir operation by proposing a new methodology coupled with the DPLWLs, the multivariate integrated drought index (MIDI), and a reservoir operation model. The proposed approach is of great significance for decision makers in water resources management during droughts, particularly in the context of global warming.

AB [1] Throughout the world, watershed modeling is undertaken using lumped parameter hydrologic models that represent real-world processes in a manner that is at once abstract, but nevertheless relies on algorithms that reflect real-world processes and parameters that reflect real-world hydraulic properties. In most cases, values are assigned to the parameters of such models through calibration against flows at watershed outlets. One criterion by which the utility of the model and the success of the calibration process are judged is that realistic values are assigned to parameters through this process. This study employs regularization theory to examine the relationship between lumped parameters and corresponding real-world hydraulic properties. It demonstrates that any kind of parameter lumping or averaging can induce a substantial amount of "structural noise,'' which devices such as Box-Cox transformation of flows and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling of residuals are unlikely to render homoscedastic and uncorrelated. Furthermore, values estimated for lumped parameters are unlikely to represent average values of the hydraulic properties after which they are named and are often contaminated to a greater or lesser degree by the values of hydraulic properties which they do not purport to represent at all. As a result, the question of how rigidly they should be bounded during the parameter estimation process is still an open one.

AB In 1965, Brutsaert proposed a model that predicted mean evaporation rate E from rough surfaces to scale with the 3/4 power law of the friction velocity (u ) and the square- root of molecular diffusivity (Dm) for water vapor. In arriving at these results, a number of assumptions were made regarding the surface renewal rate describing the contact durations between eddies and the evaporating surface, the diffusional mass process from the surface into eddies, and the cascade of turbulent kinetic energy sustaining the eddy renewal process itself. The working hypothesis explored here is that E ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Dm p u 3= 4 is a direct outcome of the Kolmogorov scaling for inertial subrange eddies modified to include viscous cutoff thereby bypassing the need for a surface renewal assumption. It is demonstrated that Brutsaert's model for E may be more general than its original derivation implied.
   Plain Language Summary The movement of water vapor molecules from rough surfaces such as soils by eddies into the atmosphere is of primary significance to a plethora of applications including hydrological and meteorological forecasting, irrigation planning, energy partitioning, and subsequent growth of the atmospheric boundary layer, to name a few. In 1965, W. Brutsaert proposed a general model that links the movement of water vapor molecules from the surface to the molecular diffusivity of water vapor in air and the wind- induced shear stress at the surface. The derivation considered air packets sweeping down and coming in contact with the wet surface. When in contact with the surface, these packets become enriched with water vapor molecules during a finite contact duration, after which these packets are ejected from the surface. Brutsaert made key restrictive assumptions about the statistical properties of the contact duration of these packets with the surface to arrive at the final form of the evaporation equation. The work here demonstrates that the same result can be derived by assuming a turnover velocity of these air packets to follow a universal form based on a widely accepted theory of turbulent flows proposed by A. N. Kolmogorov.

AB Hydraulic geometry (HG) is an important geomorphic concept that has played an indispensable role in hydrological analyses, physical studies of streams, ecosystem and aquatic habitat studies, and sedimentology research. More than 60 years after Leopold and Maddock (1953) first introduced the concept of HG, researchers have still not uncovered the physical principles underlying HG behavior. One impediment is the complexity of the natural river cross section. The current study presents a new way to simplify the cross section, namely, the hydraulic equivalent section, which is generalized from the cross section in the "gradually varied flow of an alluvial river" (GVFAR) and features hydrodynamic properties and bed-building laws similar to those of the GVFAR. Energy balance was used to derive the stage Z-discharge Q relationship in the GVFAR. The GVFAR in the Songhua River and the Yangtze River were selected as examples. The data, including measured discharge, river width, water stage, water depth, wet area, and cross section, were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of typical hydrological stations on the Songhua River and the Yangtze River from 1955 to 1987. The relationships between stage Z-discharge Q and cross-sectional area A-stage Z at various stations were analyzed, and "at-a-station hydraulic geometry" (AHG) relationships were obtained in power-law forms. Based on derived results and observational data analysis, the Z-Q and Z-A relationships of AHG were similar to rectangular weir flows, thus the cross section of the GVFAR was generalized as a compound rectangular, hydraulic equivalent cross section. As to bed-building characteristics, the bankfull discharge method and the stage discharge-relation method were used to calculate the dominant variables of the alluvial river. This hydraulic equivalent section has the same Z-Q relation, Z-A relation, dominant discharge, dominant river width, and dominant water depth as the cross section in the GVFAR. With the hydraulic equivalent section, the relationships between the discharge and river width, river depth, and width-to-depth ratio are easier to depict in DHG analysis. Replacement of the cross section in the GVFAR with the hydraulic equivalent section is expected to promote further development of HG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spontaneous imbibition in an angular tube with corner films is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering processes. In this study, a modified interacting capillary bundle model is developed to describe the liquid imbibition dynamics in a square tube with corner films. The square tube is decomposed into several interacting subcapillaries and the local capillary pressure in each subcapillary is derived based on the specific shape of its meniscus. The conductance of each subcapillary is calculated using single-phase lattice Boltzmann simulation. The modified interacting capillary bundle model and color-gradient lattice Boltzmann method are used to simulate the liquid imbibition dynamics in the square tube with different fluid properties. The predictions by the modified interacting capillary bundle model match well with the lattice Boltzmann simulation results for different conditions, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the interacting capillary bundle model to describe the imbibition dynamics with corner films. In addition, the interacting capillary bundle model is helpful to investigate the mechanisms during spontaneous imbibition and the influences of fluid viscosity, surface tension, wetting phase contact angle and gravity on imbibition dynamics. Finally, a universal scaling law of imbibition dynamics for the main meniscus is developed and the scaling law for arc meniscus is also analyzed.

AB The study aims to set and implement environmentally relevant limits for the exploitation of mountain streams in the Kura River basin of Azerbaijan. Such streams represent the preferred spawning grounds for valuable sturgeon of the Caspian Sea, but experience continuously increasing exploitation in the form of water withdrawals for industry and irrigation. Since no detailed environmental flow assessments have been conducted on any of the Kura basin streams, an interim approach is suggested based on minimum flow, referred to as "base environmental minimum". The latter may be estimated from the unregulated parts of observed or simulated daily flow records. Environmental flow requirements for individual months of an individual year may be calculated using correction factors related to monthly rainfall. Simple relationships are suggested for base environmental flow estimation at ungauged sites, and the implications of river pollution for monthly environmental requirements are examined. Further, definition of environmentally critical periods in a stream is proposed based on a ratio of observed to "environmental" flow as an indicator of environmental stress. It is illustrated that the conjunctive use of several closely located streams for water supply may significantly reduce the duration of, or completely eliminate, environmentally critical periods. The idea of environmentally acceptable areal water withdrawal is formulated, so that the overall approach may be applied for environmentally sustainable water withdrawal management in other small streams.

AB In this study, a hybrid factorial stepwise-cluster analysis (HFSA) method is developed for modelling hydrological processes. The HFSA method employs a cluster tree to represent the complex nonlinear relationship between inputs (predictors) and outputs (predictands) in hydrological processes. A real case of streamflow simulation for the Kaidu River basin is applied to demonstrate the efficiency of the HFSA method. After training a total of 24108 calibration samples, the cluster tree for daily streamflow is generated based on a stepwise-cluster analysis (SCA) approach and is then used to reproduce the daily streamflows for calibration (1995-2005) and validation (2008-2010) periods. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients for calibration and validation are 0.68 and 0.65, respectively, and the deviations of volume are 1.68% and 4.11%, respectively. Results show that: (i) the HFSA method can formulate a SCA-based hydrological modelling system for streamflow simulation with a satisfactory fitting; (ii) the variability and peak value of streamflow in the Kaidu River basin can be effectively captured by the SCA-based hydrological modelling system; (iii) results from 2(6) factorial experiments indicate that not only are minimum temperature and precipitation key drivers of system performance, but also the interaction between precipitation and minimum temperature significantly impacts on the streamflow. The findings are useful in indicating that the streamflow of the study basin is a mixture of snowmelt and rainfall water.

The Dead Sea is important to the economies of Israel and Jordan due to the extracted minerals (primarily potassium, also magnesium and bromide). It is also central to regional tourism. It is the lowest place on Earth and its endorheic, saline basin attracts international research in various disciplines. Additional to the Lower Jordan River, the discharge of which has been decreased to a small fraction of its original value, fresh to brackish springs are the main source of water to the rapidly dwindling Dead Sea. Although the existence of these springs has been known for decades, until recently estimates of spring water discharge into the Dead Sea were scarce. In this study, we developed a methodology of water discharge estimation for channels incising into a lacustrine bed using remotely sensed data and a single hydraulic geometry variable, water-surface width. Based on calibration of over 400 in situ measurements and simultaneous hydrometric data from aerial images, width-discharge rating curves were established, tested, and found suitable (r(2)=0.92, p=0.001) for the estimation of water discharge, with 5% uncertainty. Furthermore, we used these relationships to estimate retrospectively the temporal changes in water discharge of seven main channels traceable in historical aerial images. The reconstructed trend reveals a major (63%) reduction in average freshwater inflow between 1990 and 2006. Our results maximize the use of water-surface width information from aerial imagery, and suggest applicability to areas experiencing rapid exposure of sea/lake bed and consequent access difficulties in in situ discharge monitoring.

ID HYDROLOGIC TIME-SERIES; LONG POLLEN RECORD
AB Lake Urmia, the second largest hyper-saline lake on Earth, has recently experienced a dramatic water-level reduction. This could have been caused by climate change or other anthropogenic effects; however it could also be a part of natural climate variability. To explore the hydroclimate variability effect on the lake water level, two teleconnections were considered for analysis: the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Spectral and coherency analyses were used to recognize the frequency components and the relationship between the teleconnections and the lake water-level fluctuations. The results show that the recent water level fall and the rise of water level in 1994-1999 cannot be explained by the natural periodic behavior of Lake Urmia. The inter-decadal water-level oscillations are coherent with NAO and SOI components of such oscillations. The anthropogenic effect on the lake water level was also explored using non-parametric trend analysis. The results show that the lake water level has a positive trend between 1966 and 1995, but the trend is not significant at a 95% confidence level. However, the trend between 1995 and 2009 is negative and it is significant at a 99% confidence interval. This study shows that the very recent fall in water level is due to anthropogenic impacts rather than natural variability.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between expert judgement and numerical criteria when evaluating hydrological model performance by comparing simulated and observed hydrographs. Using a web-based survey, we collected the visual evaluations of 150 experts on a set of high- and low-flow hydrographs. We then compared these answers with results from 60 numerical criteria. Agreement between experts was found to be more frequent in absolute terms (when rating models) than in relative terms (when comparing models), and better for high flows than for low flows. When comparing the set of 150 expert judgements with numerical criteria, we found that most expert judgements were loosely correlated with a numerical criterion, and that the criterion that best reflects expert judgement varies from expert to expert. Overall, we identified two groups of 10 criteria yielding an equivalent match with the expertise of the 150 participants in low and high flows, respectively. A single criterion common to both groups (the Hydrograph Matching Algorithm with mean absolute error) may represent a good indicator for the overall evaluation of models based on hydrographs. We conclude that none of the numerical criteria examined here can fully replace expert judgement when rating hydrographs, and that both relative and absolute evaluations should be based on the judgement of multiple experts.

AB Droughts are an inevitable consequence of climate variability and are pervasive across many regions. Their effects can vary on an extensive scale, depending on the type of drought and people's vulnerability. Crucial characteristics of both hydrological (groundwater, streamflow) and meteorological (precipitation) droughts are related to their durations and severities, and these characteristics are typically correlated. While many studies have addressed the dependencies between these characteristics for either the meteorological or hydrological drought, the cross-dependence between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is barely investigated. The development of meteorological drought characteristics to hydrological drought characteristics is often hard to model and their connection is not definitively established. In order to better understand and explain this relationship, this study seeks to apply statistical tools and models. Drought characteristics data from areas in Europe with different climates are analysed. Two approaches of identifying related meteorological and hydrological drought are explored and compared. Classical linear correlation techniques do not provide promising results, indicating that any statistic of a hydrological drought is not a straightforward function of a preceding meteorological drought. Subsequently, the application of the concept of copulas to explore this dependence between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is investigated. The more comprehensive approach of copulas shows that the meteorological drought contains probability information of the successive hydrological drought.

AB The runoff-storage relationship for a runoff system in a steady-state is analyzed as an indicator of the buffering potential of rainfall-runoff responses. In this relationship, a large storage increase in response to a given runoff increase indicates high buffering potential in the water balance equation. The evaluation method is applied to a sloping permeable domain. A two-dimensional form of the Richards equation is used to calculate runoff and storage. Macropore existence is represented by an enlargement effect of hydraulic conductivity near saturation. The runoff-storage relationship is controlled by the distribution of hydraulic quantities. The distribution of a pressure-head value is approximately classified into the following three zones: the I zone with vertical unsaturated flow, the U zone with unsaturated downslope flow, and the S zone with saturated downslope flow. The runoff -buffering potential is systematically evaluated by dependencies of the runoff-storage relationship on the classification of the pressure-head distribution. The potential is generally high for soil with a high permeability, but rather small in the range of Low runoff rates where the S zone is not created. The macropore effect causes the range of high buffering potential to shift to high runoff rates through enlargement of the I zone. As a result, a moderate magnitude of the macropore effect gives the maximum increase in storage in response to a given increase in runoff. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All. rights reserved.

AB During the past several decades, numerous reservoirs have been built across the world for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation, municipal/industrial water supplies, and hydropower generation. Consequently, the timing and magnitude of natural streamflow have been altered significantly by reservoir operations. In addition, the hydrological cycle is also modified by land-use/land-cover change and by climate change. To understand the fine-scale feedback between hydrological processes and water management decisions, a distributed hydrological model embedded with a reservoir component is desired. In this study, a multi-purpose reservoir module with predefined complex operational rules was integrated into the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Conditional operating rules, which are designed to reduce flood risk and enhance water supply reliability, were adopted in this module. The performance of the integrated model was tested over the upper Brazos River Basin in Texas, where two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed reservoirs, Lake Whitney and Aquilla Lake, are located. The integrated model was calibrated and validated using observed reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage data. The error statistics were summarized for both reservoirs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Using the weekly reservoir storage for Lake Whitney as an example, the coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.85 and the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) was 0.75. These results suggest that this reservoir module holds promise for use in sub-monthly hydrological simulations. With the new reservoir component, the DHSVM provides a platform to support adaptive water resources management under the impacts of evolving anthropogenic activities and substantial environmental changes.

AB Direct measurements of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in rivers are surprisingly sparse. We present an approach for measuring these concentrations from space, tailored to fit rivers with limited records of flood-level SSC. Our approach requires knowledge of a typical particle-size distribution of sediment suspended during floods, the dominant mineralogy, and a calibration consisting of above-water reflectance field spectra with known SSC. Surface SSC values were derived for two Landsat images covering 70 km of the Feather and portions of the Sacramento, Yuba, and Bear Rivers in California in order to capture conditions during a large flood event. Using optical theory and radiative transfer modeling we modeled remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) for a number of three-component mixtures composed of color dissolved organic matter (CDOM), water, and montmorillonite particles. We then iteratively estimated CDOM by fitting modeled spectra for a range of absorption coefficients to field-measured spectra collected from the Sacramento River and matched to measured SSC values. Spectral mixture analysis with a two-end-member model yielded end-member fractions and SSC via a look-up table specific to the Landsat sensor. Model closure was within the error of measured SSC values, suggesting that this approach is promising for deriving SSC on rivers during flood conditions when empirical relationships established between low SSC values and R-rs are no longer valid.

AB The hydrological modeling community is aware that the validation of distributed hydrological models has to move beyond aggregated performance measures, like hydrograph assessment by means of Nash-Suitcliffe efficiency toward a true spatial model validation. Remote sensing facilitates continuous data and can be measured on a similar spatial scale as the predictive scale of the hydrological model thereby it can serve as suitable data for the spatial validation. The human perception is often described as a very reliable and well-trained source for pattern comparison, which this study wants to exploit. A web-based survey that is interpreted based on approximately 200 replies reflects the consensus of the human perception on map comparisons of a reference map and 12 synthetic perturbations. The resulting similarity ranking can be used as a reference to benchmark various spatial performance metrics. This study promotes Fuzzy theory as a suitable approach because it considers uncertainties related to both location and value in the simulated map. Additionally, an EOF-analysis (Empirical Orthogonal Function) is conducted to decompose the map comparison into its similarities and dissimilarities. A modeling case study serves to further examine the metrics capability to assess the goodness of fit between simulated and observed land surface temperature maps. The EOF-analysis unambiguously identifies a systematic depth to groundwater table-related model deficiency. Kappa statistic extended by Fuzziness is a suitable and commonly applied measure for map comparison. However, its apparent bias sensitivity limits it's capability as a diagnostic tool to detect the distinct deficiency.

TI Kinetic energy-rainfall intensity relationship for Central Cebu,

   soil erosion
ID DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTION; LOSS PREDICTION; DETACHMENT; IMPACT; MODEL
AB In the study of soil erosion, specifically on detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact, kinetic energy is a commonly suggested indicator of the raindrop's ability to detach soil particles from the soil mass. Since direct measurement of kinetic energy requires sophisticated and costly instruments, the alternative approach is to estimate it from rainfall intensity. The present study aims at establishing a relationship between rainfall intensity and kinetic energy for rainfalls in Central Cebu, Philippines as a preface of a wider regional investigation.
   Drop size distributions of rainfalls were measured using the disdrometer RD-80. There are two forms of kinetic energy considered here. One is kinetic energy per unit area per unit time (KER, J m(-2) h(-1)) and the other is kinetic energy per unit area per unit depth (KE, J m(-2) mm(-1)). Relationships between kinetic energy per unit area per unit time (KER) and rainfall intensity (I) were obtained using linear and power relations. The exponential model and the logarithmic model were fitted to the KE-I data to obtain corresponding relationships between kinetic energy per unit area per unit depth of rainfall (KE) and rainfall intensity (I). The equation obtained from the exponential model produced smaller standard error of estimates than the logarithmic model. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB Soil erosion on agricultural land has become a global environmental problem and information on rates of soil loss is an important requirement both for quantifying the problem and for developing improved land management and soil conservation practices. The use of fallout Cs-137 measurements overcomes many of the difficulties facing traditional approaches to erosion monitoring and affords an effective means for obtaining estimates of soil redistribution rates on cultivated land. A number of empirical functions and theoretical models have been developed to establish the relationship between the change in the soil. Cs-137 inventory relative to the local Cs-137 fallout input and the rate of soil redistribution. Of these approaches, physically-based mass balance models have received increasing emphasis, but their application may be hampered by their complexity and the need to specify values for a number of parameters. This paper presents a refined simplified point-based mass balance model for deriving estimates of soil redistribution rate from soil Cs-137 data for individual sampling points. This model incorporates at number of important factors which are included in more comprehensive mass balance models. A spatially-averaged mass balance approach is also presented. This can be used to estimate water-induced soil erosion rates at different spatial scales in situations where detailed information on within-field variation of soil redistribution rates is not needed but information on net erosion rates or sediment output from a field is required.

ID BOUSSINESQ EQUATION; GRAVITY CURRENTS; DRAINAGE
AB The porous medium equation (PME) is a generalization of the traditional Boussinesq equation for hydraulic conductivity as a power law function of height. We analyze the horizontal recharge of an initially dry unconfined aquifer of semi-infinite extent, as would be found in an aquifer adjacent a rising river. If the water level can be modeled as a power law function of time, similarity variables can be introduced and the original problem can be reduced to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. The position of the advancing front is not known ahead of time and must be found in the process of solution. We present an analytical solution in the form of a power series, with the coefficients of the series given by a recurrence relation. The analytical solution compares favorably with a highly accurate numerical solution, and only a small number of terms of the series are needed to achieve high accuracy in the scenarios considered here. We also conduct a series of physical experiments in an initially dry wedged Hele-Shaw cell, where flow is modeled by a special form of the PME. Our analytical solution closely matches the hydraulic head profiles in the Hele-Shaw cell experiment.

AB This study was carried out in the framework of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) programme of the French National Centre of Space Studies (CNES). Based on discharge measurements and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) determination of total water storage (TWS), we have investigated the hydrological variability of the main French drainage basins (Seine, Loire, Garonne and Rhone) using a wavelet approach (continuous wavelet analyses and wavelet coherence analyses). The results of this analysis have shown a coherence ranging between 82% and 90% for TWS and discharge, thus demonstrating the potential use of TWS for characterization of the hydrological variability of French rivers. Strong coherence between the four basin discharges (between 73% and 92%) and between their associated TWS data (from 82% to 98%) suggested a common external influence on hydrological variability. To determine this influence, we investigated the relationship between hydrological variability and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), considered as an index of prevailing climate in Europe. Basin discharges show strong coherence with NAO, ranging between 64% and 72% over the period 1959-2010. The coherence between NAO and TWS was 62% to 67% for 2003-2009. This is similar to the coherence between NAO and basin discharges detected for the same period. According to these results, strong influence of the NAO was clearly observed on the TWS and discharges of the major French river basins.

AB A generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) framework coupling with artificial neural network (ANN) models in two surrogate schemes (i.e. GAE-S1 and GAE-S2) was proposed to improve the efficiency of uncertainty assessment in flood inundation modelling. The GAE-S1 scheme was to construct an ANN to approximate the relationship between model likelihoods and uncertain parameters for facilitating sample acceptance/rejection instead of running the numerical model directly; thus, it could speed up the Monte Carlo simulation in stochastic sampling. The GAE-S2 scheme was to establish independent ANN models for water depth predictions to emulate the numerical models; it could facilitate efficient uncertainty analysis without additional model runs for locations concerned under various scenarios. The results from a study case showed that both GAE-S1 and GAE-S2 had comparable performances to GLUE in terms of estimation of posterior parameters, prediction intervals of water depth, and probabilistic inundation maps, but with reduced computational requirements. The results also revealed that GAE-S1 possessed a slightly better performance in accuracy (referencing to GLUE) than GAE-S2, but a lower flexibility in application. This study shed some light on how to apply different surrogate schemes in using numerical models for uncertainty assessment, and could help decision makers in choosing cost-effective ways of conducting flood risk analysis.

AB Terraces are a common feature of Mediterranean landscapes. In many places they are no longer maintained so that the number of intact terraces is in prolonged decline. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of terrace removal and failure on hydrological connectivity and peak discharge in an agricultural catchment (475 ha) in south-east Spain. The situation of 2006 is compared to that in 1956 and to a scenario without terraces (S2). The spatial distribution of concentrated flow was mapped after four storms in 2006. The degree of connectivity was quantified by means of connectivity functions and related to storm characteristics, land use and topography. For 1956, 2006 and scenario S2, connectivity functions and peak discharge to the river were determined for a storm with a return period of 8.2 years. The results show that the decrease in intact terraces has led to a strong increase in connectivity and discharge. The contributing area to the river system has increased by a factor 3.2 between 1956 and 2006. If all terraces were to be removed (scenario S2), the contributing area may further increase by a factor 6.0 compared to 2006. The spatial extent of concentrated flow and the degree of connectivity are related to storm magnitude as expressed by the erosivity index (EI30). Although a large part of the concentrated flow (25-50%) occurs on dirt roads, it appears that croplands become a major source of runoff with increasing rainfall. The results suggest that connectivity theory can be used to improve rainfall-runoff models in semi-arid areas. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A decadal-scale study to retrieve the spatio-temporal precipitation patterns of the Yangtze River basin, China, using the Tropical Rain Mapping Mission, Precipitation Radar (TRMM/PR) data is presented. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) based on monthly TRMM/PR data extracts several leading precipitation patterns, which are largely connected with physical implications at the basin scale. With the aid of gauge station data, the amplitudes of major principal components (PCs) were used to examine the generic relationships between precipitation variations and hydrological extremes (e. g. floods and droughts) during summer seasons over the past decade. The emergence of such major precipitation patterns clearly reveals the possible linkages with hydrological processes, and the oscillations in relation to the amplitude of major PCs are consistent with these observed hydrological extremes. Although the floods in some sections of the Yangtze River were, to some extent, tied to human activities, such as the removal of wetlands, the variations in major precipitation patterns are recognized as the primary driving force of the flow extremes associated with floods and droughts. The research findings indicate that long-distance hydro-meteorological signals of large-scale precipitation variations over such a large river basin can be successfully identified with the aid of EOF analysis. The retrieved precipitation patterns and their low-frequency jumps of amplitude in relation to PCs are valuable tools to help understand the association between the precipitation variations and the occurrence of hydrological extremes. Such a study can certainly aid in disaster mitigation and decision-making in water resource management.

AB To achieve social and economic sustainability in and and semi-arid areas under water scarce situations, it is vital to promote efficient use of water through improved management of water resources. This paper presents a swarm optimization based solution to a detailed operational model for short-term reservoir operation for irrigation of multiple crops. The model integrates the dynamics associated with the water released from a reservoir to the actual water utilized by crops at farm level. It takes into account the nonlinear relationship of root growth, soil heterogeneity, soil moisture dynamics for multiple crops, yield response to water deficit at various growth stages of the crops and economic benefits from the crops. As the developed model is a nonlinear one, it is solved using a novel global optimization technique, namely elitist-mutation particle swarm optimization (EMPSO). The model's applicability is demonstrated through a case study of Malaprabha Reservoir system in Southern India. The performance of the model is examined for different water deficit conditions and the sensitivity of the crop yield is analysed for water shortage at various growth stages. Also, the consideration of economic benefits in the objective function and its effect on the water allocation decisions for multiple crops are studied. Consequently, the output from the model includes initial storages, releases, overflows and evaporation losses for each 10-day period on the reservoir side; and allocation of water, actual evapotranspiration and initial soil moisture for each crop for each 10-day period on the field side, thus facilitating decision making for optimal utilization of the available water resources.

AB Several relationships exist for predicting unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K (psi) from saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s and the soil-water retention curve. These relationships are convenient for modeling of field scale system sensitivity to spatial variability in K (psi). It is, however, faster and simpler to measure air permeability k(a) at psi = -100 cm H2O, than K-s. This study explores the existence of a general prediction relationship between k(a), measured at -100 cm H2O, and K-s. Comparative analyses between k(a)-K-s relationships for nine Danish and Norwegian soils, six different soil treatments, and three horizons validated the establishment of a soil type, soil treatment, and depth/horizon independent log-log linear k(a)-K-s relationship. The general k(a)-K-s relationship is based on data from a total of 1614 undisturbed, 100-cm(3) core samples and displays general prediction accuracy better than +/-0.7 orders of magnitude. The accuracy and usefulness of the general relationship was evaluated through stochastic analyses of held scale infiltration and pending during a rainstorm event. These analyses showed possible prediction bias associated with the general k(a)-K-s relationship, but also revealed that sampling uncertainty associated with estimation of field scale variability in K-s from a limited number of samples could easily be larger than the possible prediction bias.

AB The generalized complementary function to estimate actual evaporation, namely, the ratio of actual evaporation to Penman potential evaporation (E/E-Pen) as a function of the proportion of the radiation term in E-Pen (E-rad/E-Pen), has been increasingly recognized. Existing analytical forms of this generalized function present deficiencies because they are limited by improper boundary conditions resulting from inadequate understanding of physical constraints. In this study, its zero- and first-order boundary conditions were rigorously derived by adopting the physical constraints for E in Penman's combination theory, and a sigmoid feature of relationship between E/E-Pen and E-rad/E-Pen was derived. Minimum and maximum limits of E-rad/E-Pen were introduced based on the derived boundary conditions, and accordingly, a new sigmoid function was developed. By restricting it to be approximately equivalent to the linear advection-aridity (Brutsaert & Stricker, 1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/WR015i002p00443) function under normal environments, the new sigmoid function satisfies the upper limits of Penman's open water evaporation and Priestley-Taylor'sminimal advection evaporation in parallel. The sigmoid feature and the new sigmoid function were validated by tower-based data from FLUXNET. This work improves our understanding of the three-stage pattern of the complementary behavior, and the new function demonstrates a favorable potential for use in evaporation estimation.

AB Knowledge on the determinants and patterns of water demand for different consumers supports the design of customized demand management strategies. Smart meters coupled with big data analytics tools create a unique opportunity to support such strategies. Yet, at present, the information content of smart meter data is not fully mined and usually needs to be complemented with water fixture inventory and survey data to achieve detailed customer segmentation based on end use water usage. In this paper, we developed a data-driven approach that extracts information on heterogeneous water end use routines, main end use components, and temporal characteristics, only via data mining existing smart meter readings at the scale of individual households. We tested our approach on data from 327 households in Australia, each monitored with smart meters logging water use readings every 5 s. As part of the approach, we first disaggregated the household-level water use time series into different end uses via Autoflow. We then adapted a customer segmentation based on eigenbehavior analysis to discriminate among heterogeneous water end use routines and identify clusters of consumers presenting similar routines. Results revealed three main water end use profile clusters, each characterized by a primary end use: shower, clothes washing, and irrigation. Time-of-use and intensity-of-use differences exist within each class, as well as different characteristics of regularity and periodicity over time. Our customer segmentation analysis approach provides utilities with a concise snapshot of recurrent water use routines from smart meter data and can be used to support customized demand management strategies.

AB The floods that have occurred in the upper valley of the Po river (northern Italy) were classified according to an index of strength on the basis of documentary sources available at the meteorological observatory of Moncalieri since 1780. The catalogue was ascertained to be complete only for events classified at least as moderate. Application of Cantor dust statistics and rank-ordering statistics to time-occurrences of floods provided significant evidence of scale-invariance laws that might be very helpful in assessing and reducing future hazards. The increase in the fractal dimension for floods occurring after 1890 is here related to the significant increase in the number of very heavy rainfall episodes measured all over Italy.

AB This paper quantifies the impacts of bushfire and climate variability on streamflow from three southeast Australian catchments where bushfires occurred in February 1983. Three hydrological models (AWRA-L, Xinanjiang and GR4J) were first calibrated against streamflow data from the pre-bushfire period and then used to simulate runoff for the post-bushfire period with the calibrated parameters. The difference in simulated streamflow between pre- and post-bushfire periods provides an estimate of the impact of climate variability on streamflow. The impact of bushfire on streamflow is quantified by removing the climate variability impact from the difference in mean annual observed streamflow between post- and pre-bushfire periods. For the first 15years after the 1983 bushfires, the results from hydrological models for the three catchments indicate that there is a substantial increase in streamflow; this is attributed to initial decreases in evapotranspiration and soil infiltration rates resulting from the fires, followed by logging activity. After 15years, streamflow dynamics are more heavily influenced by climate effects, although some impact from fire and logging regeneration may still occur. The results show that hydrological models provide reasonably consistent estimates of bushfire and climate impacts on streamflow for the three catchments. The models can be used to quantify relative contributions of forest disturbance (bushfire, logging and other forest management) and climate variability. The results presented can also help forest managers understand the relationship between bushfire and climate variability impacts on water yield in the context of climate variability.

AB On the basis of unsaturated Darcy's law, the Talbot-Ogden method provides a fast unconditional mass conservative algorithm to simulate groundwater infiltration in various unsaturated soil textures. Unlike advanced reservoir modelling methods that compute unsaturated flow in space, it only discretizes the moisture content domain into a suitable number of bins so that the vertical water movement is estimated piecewise in each bin. The dimensionality of the moisture content domain is extended from one dimensional to two dimensional in this study, which allows us to distinguish pore shapes within the same moisture content range. The vertical movement of water in the extended model imitates the infiltration phase in the Talbot-Ogden method. However, the difference in this extension is the directional redistribution, which represents the horizontal inter-bin flow and causes the water content distribution to have an effect on infiltration. Using this extension, we mathematically analyse the general relationship between infiltration and the moisture content distribution associated with wetting front depths in different bins. We show that a more negatively skewed moisture content distribution can produce a longer ponding time, whereas a higher overall flux cannot be guaranteed in this situation. It is proven on the basis of the water content probability distribution independent of soil textures. To illustrate this analysis, we also present numerical examples for both fine and coarse soil textures. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We use high-resolution tracer data from an experimental site to test theoretical approaches that integrate catchment-scale flow and transport processes in a unified framework centered on selective age sampling by streamflow and evapotranspiration fluxes. Transport processes operating at the catchment scale are reflected in the evolving residence time distribution of the catchment water storage and in the age selection operated by out-fluxes. Such processes are described here through StorAge Selection (SAS) functions parameterized as power laws of the normalized rank storage. Such functions are computed through appropriate solution of the master equation defining formally the evolution of residence and travel times. By representing the way in which catchment storage generates outflows composed by water of different ages, the main mechanism regulating the tracer composition of runoff is clearly identified and detailed comparison with empirical data sets are possible. Properly calibrated numerical tools provide simulations that convincingly reproduce complex measured signals of daily deuterium content in stream waters during wet and dry periods. Results for the catchment under consideration are consistent with other recent studies indicating a tendency for natural catchments to preferentially release younger available water. The study shows that power law SAS functions prove a powerful tool to explain catchment-scale transport processes that also has potential in less intensively monitored sites.

AB Complex flows in heterogeneous confined and unconfined aquifers is a phenomenon that continues to present difficulties in flow mapping and modelling in the field, laboratory, and through numerical simulations. It is often the case with complicated phenomena that transformative scaling and reduction of the problem through symmetry is of great efficacy in the formation of predictive models in both the laboratory and computational settings. A detailed a study of the application of a broad class of Lie scaling transformations on a set of equations representing the groundwater flows in heterogeneous confined and unconfined aquifers has produced a set of scaling relationships between the spatial variables, hydrologic variables, and parameters. The set of scaling transformations preserve the structure of the equations in the sense that the scaling transformations leave the initial-boundary value system representing the invariant groundwater flows. This theoretical approach elucidates not only the scaling relationships but also the properties that hydrologic variables and parameters must satisfy in order for calling to be possible. Validation of the theory developed is carried out through a series of four numerical simulations using the USGS modflow-2005 software package. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the derived scaling transformations can effectively form predictive models of large-scale phenomena at small scales with negligible error in many cases. Comments on the limitations of the approach and directions for future research are made in the closing sections. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Steep topography and land-use trails formations in Himalayan watersheds have a major impact oil hydrological characteristics and now regimes, and greatly affect the perenniality and sustainability of water resources in the region. To identify the appropriate conservation measures in a watershed properly, and, in particular, to augment flow during lean periods, accurate estimation of streamflow is essential. Due to the complexity of rainfall-runoff relationships in hilly watersheds and non-availability of reliable data, process-based models have limited applicability. In this Study, data-driven models, based upon the Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) technique, were employed to predict streamflow (surface runoff, baseflow and total runoff in three mid-Himalayan micro-watersheds. In addition, the effect of length of historical records on the performance of MARS models was critically evaluated. Though acceptable MARS models could be developed with a 2-year data set, their performance improved considerably with a 3-year data set. Various indicators of model performance, such as correlation coefficient, average deviation, average absolute deviation and modelling efficiency, showed significant improvement for simulation of surface runoff, baseflow and total flow. To further analyse the versatility and general applicability of the MARS approach, 2-year data sets were used to develop the model and test it on a third-year data set to assess its performance. The models simulated the surface runoff, baseflow and total flow reasonably well and call be reliably applied in ungauged small watersheds tinder identical agro-climatic settings.

AB In this work the numerical integration of 1D shallow water equations (SWE) over movable bed is performed using a well-balanced central weighted essentially non-oscillatory (CWENO) scheme, fourth-order accurate in space and in time. Time accuracy is obtained following a Runge-Kutta (RK) procedure, coupled with its natural continuous extension (NCE). Spatial accuracy is obtained using WENO reconstructions of conservative variables and of flux and bed derivatives. An original treatment for bed slope source term, which maintains the established order of accuracy and satisfies the property of exactly preserving the quiescent flow (C-property), is introduced in the scheme. This treatment consists of two procedures. The former involves the evaluation of the point-values of the flux derivative, considered as a whole with the bed slope source term. The latter involves the spatial integration of the source term, analytically manipulated to take advantage from the expected regularity of the free surface elevation. The high accuracy of the scheme allows to obtain good results using coarse grids, with consequent gain in terms of computational effort. The well-balancing of the scheme allows to reproduce small perturbations of the free surface and of the bottom otherwise of the same order of magnitude of the numerical errors induced by the non-balancing. The accuracy, the well-balancing and the good resolution of the model in reproducing free surface flow over movable bed are tested over analytical solutions and over numerical results available in literature.

AB Overland flow is an important component of peatland hydrology. Hydrological models of peatlands are being developed that require estimates of flow velocity and its controls. However, surprisingly little is known about overland flow velocities in peatlands. Some peatlands have also been drained using open ditches, and these need to be incorporated into flow models. This paper presents field data on the velocity of overland flow and drain flow in upland peatlands. The relationships between flow velocity, vegetation cover, slope, and water depth are explored. Sphagnum provided a significantly greater effective hydraulic roughness to overland flow than peatland grasses. In all cases, a significant break in process occurred for flows with water depths of around 1 cm so that there were two components of the roughness curve. This is consistent with partial submergence theory for very shallow flows where resistance increases with depth as the soil surface first becomes fully submerged. While each surface cover type should be considered separately, the results also suggest that a first-order estimate of Darcy-Weisbach roughness and mean velocity can be based on a single parameter for each surface cover. This paper presents an empirical overland flow velocity forecasting model that can be applied to peatlands. The model combines the partially submerged component for flows with water depths below 1 cm with the fully submerged component for flows with depths up to 5 cm, which are representative of the depths of flows that occur across peatlands.

AB Physics-based models have been increasingly developed in recent years and applied to simulate the braiding process and evolution of channel units in braided rivers. However, limited attention is given to lowland braided rivers where the transport of suspended sediment plays a dominant role. In the present study, a numerical model based on the basic physics laws of hydrodynamics and sediment transport is used to simulate the evolution process of a braided river dominated by suspended load transport. The model employs a fractional method to simulate the transport of graded sediments and uses a multiple-bed-layer approach to represent the sediment sorting process. An idealized braided river has been produced, with the hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological processes being analysed. In particular, the formation process of local pool-bar units in the predicted river has been investigated. A sensitivity analysis has also been undertaken to investigate the effects of grid resolution and an upstream perturbation on the model prediction. A variety of methods are applied to analyse the geometrical and topographical properties of the modelled river. Self-organizing characteristics related to river geometry and topography are analysed by state-space plots, which indicate a close relationship with the periodical erosion and deposition cycles of braiding. Cross-sectional topography and slope frequency display similar geometries to natural rivers. Scaling characteristics are found by correlation analysis of bar parameters.

AB Low-frequency (periodicities lower than 20 years) hydrologic variability in the western United States over the past 500 years is studied using available tree-ring reconstructions of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), streamflow, and climate indices. Leading rotated principal component (RPC) scores of a gridded tree-ring reconstruction of the PDSI from 1525 to 1975 are significantly correlated with indices representing large-scale climate variations from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. RPC1 (31%) is related to the influence of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variations, indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). RPC2 (24%) is apparently related to North Atlantic SST variations, indexed by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). RPC3 (19%) is moderately correlated with a smoothed version of the Southern Oscillation Index. Consistent with recent studies of instrumental data, RPC1 (PDO) and RPC2 (AMO) explain a large part of the multidecadal hydrologic variability of the interior western United States. Western U. S. PDSI variability exhibits significant pentadecadal (and longer) oscillations in the epochs from circa 1525 to 1650 and 1850 to 1975, while bidecadal oscillations are prevalent in the middle epoch from circa 1650 to 1850. The changes in spectral characteristics of western U. S. PDSI were related to similar changes in the PDO (and therefore in RPC1). In contrast, RPC2 had a regular periodicity of 51 years for the past similar to500 years. This regularity is intriguing, and although RPC2 was primarily related to the AMO in this study, the influence from Pacific climate cannot be discarded.

AB A relatively simple process-oriented, physically-based distributed (PBD) hydrological model, the distributed runoff and erosion assessment model (DREAM), is described, and a validation study conducted in the semi-forested watershed of Pathri Rao, in the Garhwal Himalayas, India, is reported. DREAM takes account of watershed heterogeneity as reflected by land use, soil type, topography and rainfall, measured in the field or estimated through remote sensing, and generates estimates of runoff and sediment yield in spatial and temporal domains. The model is based on simultaneous solution of flow dynamics, based on kinematic wave theory, followed by solution of soil erosion dynamics. As the storm rainfall proceeds, the process of overland flow generation is dependent on the interception storage and infiltration rates. The components of the soil erosion model have been modified to provide better prediction of sediment flow rates and sediment yields. The validation study conducted to test the performance of the model in simulating soil erosion and sediment yield during different storm events monitored in the study watershed showed that the model outputs are satisfactory. Details of a sensitivity analysis, model calibration and the statistical evaluation of the results obtained are also presented and discussed. It is noteworthy that the distributed nature of the model combined with the use of geographical information system (GIS) techniques permits the computation and representation of the spatial distribution of sediment yield for simulated storm events, and a map of the spatial distribution of sediment yield for a simulated storm event is presented to highlight this capability.

AB Turbidity currents may feature active sediment transport and rapid bed deformation, such as those responsible for the erosion of many submarine canyons. Yet previous mathematical models are built upon simplified governing equations and involve steady flow and weak sediment transport assumptions, which are not in complete accordance with rigorous conservation laws. It so far remains unknown if these could have considerable impacts on the evolution of turbidity currents. Here a fully coupled modeling study is presented to gain new insights into the evolution of turbidity currents. The recent analysis of the multiple time scales of subaerial sediment-laden flows over erodible bed [Cao Z, Li Y, Yue Z. Multiple time scales of alluvial rivers carrying suspended sediment and their implications for mathematical modeling. Adv Water Resour 2007;30(4):715-29] is extended to subaqueous turbidity currents to complement the fully coupled modeling. Results from numerical simulations show the ability of the present coupled model to reproduce self-accelerating turbidity currents. Comparison among the fully and partially coupled and decoupled models along with the analysis of the relative time scale of bed deformation explicitly demonstrate that fully coupled modeling is essential for refined resolution of those turbidity currents featuring active sediment transport and rapid bed deformation, and existing models based on simplified conservation laws need to be reformulated.

TI Random self-similar river networks and derivations of generalized Horton
   laws in terms of statistical simple scaling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ELEVATION
AB Recent data analyses of a dozen or so large networks support the presence of simple scaling in the probability distributions of many topologic, geometric, and hydraulic-geometric variables. We have labeled them "generalized Horton laws" in contrast to traditional Horton laws which are stated only in terms of means. These data sets also show that Horton's bifurcation ratios are significantly larger than 4, which can not be predicted by the well-known random model. Motivated by the need to understand these data analyses of large river networks within a common theoretical framework, a new class of models with statistically self-similar network topology is introduced. The network construction process can be viewed as a statistical generalization of the type of a recursive process which generates many fractal geometrical objects. Unlike the well-known random model, our random channel networks do not belong to the class of binary Galton-Watson stochastic branching processes. The generalized Horton laws are predicted in the limit of large Horton-Strahler order as a scale parameter for a subclass of random self-similar network models. A derivation of Horton's law of stream numbers as a consequence of the simple scaling of distributions of basin magnitude gives it a new theoretical significance. A further subclass also exhibits Tokunga self-similarity, which is an average. property of the side tributary structure in river networks. Comparisons with empirical observations for three large basins analyzed here show that the generalized Horton laws are well predicted by this new class of random self-similar network models, and analytically predicted relationships between topologic and geometric Horton ratios are also seen in data.

AB The Hargreaves method provides reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimates when only air temperature data are available, although it requires previous local calibration for an acceptable performance. This method was evaluated using the data from 71 meteorological stations in the Seolma-cheon basin (8.48 km(2)), South Korea, comparing daily estimates against those from the Penman-Monteith (PM) method, which was used as the standard. To estimate reference ETo more exactly, considering the climatological characteristics in South Korea, parameter regionalization of the Hargreaves equation is carried out. First, the modified Hargreaves equation is presented after an analysis of the relationship between solar radiation and temperature. Second, parameter (K-ET) optimization of the regional calibration of the Hargreaves equation (RCH) is performed using the PM method and the modified equation at 71 meteorological stations. Next, an application was carried out to evaluate the evapotranspiration methods (PM, original Hargreaves and RCH) in the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model by comparing these with the measured actual evapotranspiration (AET) in the basin. The SWAT model was calibrated using 3 years (2007-2009) of daily streamflow at the watershed outlet and 3 years (2007-2009) of daily AET measured at a mixed forest. The model was validated with 3 years (2010-2012) of streamflow and AET. RCH will contribute to a better understanding of evapotranspiration of an ungauged watershed in areas where meteorological information is scarce.

AB Cementitious porous pavement (CPP) is a structural low-impact development material for rainfallrunoff management. Both infiltration and filtration are critical functions for CPP stormwater quality and quantity control. In this study, three groups of CPP specimens exposed to rainfallrunoff for 4 years and experienced with different maintenance intervals (6, 12 and 48?months, respectively) were used to examine CPP infiltration and filtration performance. Particle mass strained on CPP surface, saturated infiltration rate If, temporal infiltration rate I(t), suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and turbidity (t) were measured to evaluate the process of filtration/infiltration. I(t), SSC and t were examined less than 50?mg/l of the suspended particle loading. It was found that the CPP surface cleaning methods used in the past 4 years, namely, high pressure wash followed by vacuuming with one atmosphere (100 kPa), were effective, and a 12-month maintenance interval was verified suitable to maintain the pore structure an acceptable infiltration rate for stormwater management. It was also found that CPP infiltration and filtration process affect each other, and the two properties are coupled in urban stormwater quality and quantity control. On the basis of the experimental measurements, the temporal infiltration rate of the cleaned CPP under a certain particle loading could be simulated by a first-order nonlinear rational model, and effluent turbiditySSC relationship was found following a power law.

AB Ecosystem water and carbon fluxes are inherently coupled through stomata. A deep understanding of the watercarbon relationship contributes to model development, water and carbon management, and decision-making. This study investigated the pattern of the water-carbon relationship, the difference in water-carbon relationship at both the ecosystem and canopy scales in different growth stages in a vineyard in arid northwest China for three consecutive years (2017-2019) via an eddy covariance system combined with sap flow sensors and microlysimeters. The results showed that the significant increase in soil evaporation (E) controlled by high surface soil water content (SWC, 10 cm) led to a transformation from a linear to nonlinear relationship between daily water and carbon fluxes from the canopy to ecosystem scale. Moreover, the water-carbon relationship varied with growth stages at both the ecosystem and canopy scales. The water-carbon coupling strength (the determination coefficient of the water-carbon correlation) was higher in the early and late growing seasons than in the middle growing season. Additionally, water use efficiency (WUE) was more dependent on the carbon flux in the early and late growing seasons. However, WUE was mainly determined by water flux in the middle growing season, and the control of E surpassed that of transpiration (T) in ecosystem WUE. The results of the structural equation model (SEM) indicated that canopy development in the early and late growing seasons together with the water and radiation conditions in the middle growing season played vital roles in controlling the water-carbon relationship. This study highlighted the critical role of SWC in controlling the water-carbon relationship and the differences in the coupling in various growth stages of an irrigated vineyard in the arid northwest China.

AB Empirical or theoretical extensions of Darcy's law for immiscible two-phase flow have shown significant limitations in properly modeling the flow at the continuum scale. We tackle this problem by proposing a set of upscaled equations based on pore-scale flow regimes, that is, the topology of flowing phases. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is upscaled by means of multiple-scale expansions and its closures derived from the mechanical energy balance for different flow regimes at the pore scale. We also derive the applicability conditions of the upscaled equations based on the order of magnitude of relevant dimensionless numbers, that is, Eotvos, Reynolds, capillary, Froude numbers, and the viscosity and density ratio of the system, as well as a set of closures valid for the basic flow regimes of low Eotvos number systems, that is, core-annular and plug and drop traffic flows. We provide analytical expressions for the relative permeability of the wetting and nonwetting phases in different flow regimes and demonstrate that the effect of the flowing-phases topology on the relative permeabilities is significant. Finally, we show that the classical two-phase Darcy law is recovered for a limited range of operative conditions, while specific terms accounting for interfacial and wall interactions should be incorporated to accurately model ganglia or drop traffic flow.

AB Water retention characteristic or water retention curve (WRC) is an important constitutive feature of porous media, and also meanwhile is an indispensable requirement in hydraulic transport modelling. Previous experiments have indicated that the specific surface area of porous media has effects on the WRC. It has also been observed that a linear relationship generally exists between the air-water interface area and the water saturation within unsaturated porous media. However it seems that no detailed study on their internal linkage with the WRC has been reported yet. This paper, at first gives a review of the development of WRC modelling, then it tries to explain the water retention characteristic according to the physical and chemical behaviours of the phases involved in unsaturated porous media. Using the traditional capillary theory, the volume averaging theorem and the advances in physical chemistry of interfacial surfaces, this paper then derives out a formula which represents the water retention characteristic of porous media. This formula demonstrates the internal linkage of the WRC to the specific surface area of porosities. It also shows agreements with the experimental observations mathematically. Based on this formula, a fitting model is proposed for the static WRC of porous media. Finally, this model is tested to fit the WRC measurements of a wide range of porous materials. Comparison with other main models is presented. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Deep learning; Dynamic subsurface flow; Theory-guided; Generative
   adversarial network
AB Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been shown to be useful in various applications, such as image recognition, text processing and scientific computing, due its strong ability to learn complex data distributions. However, the ability of standard GAN to process dynamic data is limited. In this study, a theory-guided generative adversarial network (TgGAN) is proposed to solve dynamic partial differential equations (PDEs). Different from standard GANs, the training term is no longer the true data and the generated data, but rather their residuals. In addition, such theories as governing equations and other physical constraints are encoded into the loss function of the generator to ensure that the prediction does not only honor the training data, but also obey these theories. TgGAN is proposed for dynamic subsurface flow with heterogeneous model parameters, and the data at each time step are treated as a two-dimensional image. In this study, several numerical cases are introduced to test the performance of the TgGAN. Predicting the future response, label-free learning and learning from noisy data can be realized easily by the TgGAN model, and the effects of the number of training data and the collocation points are also discussed. In order to improve the efficiency of TgGAN, the transfer learning algorithm is also employed. Moreover, the sensitivity of TgGAN to the hydraulic conductivity field is studied. Numerical results demonstrate that the TgGAN model is both robust and reliable for deep learning of dynamic PDEs.

AB Under the European Union Water Framework Directive, Member States must put in place a river basin planning framework to determine what measures are necessary to maintain and improve the ecological status for all surface water bodies. The governmental organisations legally responsible for implementing the Directive in the UK have recognised that all appropriate river flow regime is fundamental to maintain a healthy river and, as a result, they need to regulate abstractions and effluent discharges and ensure Sufficient water is released From impoundments. This paper reports on the process of producing environmental standards that define the maximum abstraction allowable from UK rivers, to leave sufficient flow to maintain a healthy river ecosystem. As there are currently insufficient data available to determine the relationships between river flow and ecological status empirically, expert knowledge was Captured through a series of workshops at which leading UK freshwater scientists defined maximum levels of river flow regime alteration that would achieve ecological objectives for different river water body types. For the least ecologically sensitive rivers, maximum abstractions in the range 15-35% of the natural flow were proposed, depending on the flow magnitude and time of year. For the most sensitive rivers, the maximum abstraction proposed was in the ran, 7.5-25%. The knowledge was used by the responsible UK authorities to develop environmental standards. The authorities subsequently used the environmental standards to determine regulatory standards that could be implemented within practical constraints and current licensing policies.

AB The effect of elevated dissolved CO2 concentrations on compositionally and structurally distinct carbonate sample cores from the Weyburn-Midale CO2-enhanced oil recovery and storage site (Canada) was measured from analysis of 3-D sample characterization and fluid chemistry data from core-flood experiments. Experimental conditions (60 degrees C; 24.8 MPa confining pressure) and brine composition were chosen to mimic in situ reservoir conditions. Mineralogy and pore space distributions within the eight individual cores were characterized with X-ray computed microtomography and scanning electron microscopy both before and after exposure to brine with 0.5 <= pCO(2) <= 3 MPa, while solution chemistry and differential fluid pressures were monitored during experiments.
   Our experimental study aimed to quantify the relationship between fluid flow, heterogeneity, and reaction specific to carbon storage at the Weyburn-Midale field by integrating characterization imaging, pressure data, and solution chemistry. Through the use of non-invasive microtomographic imaging, a variety of dissolution behaviors were observed, with variable effects on the evolution of solution chemistry and permeability as a result of heterogeneity within these two relatively low permeability carbonate samples. Similar-sized, evenly distributed pores, and steadily advancing dissolution fronts suggested that uniform flow velocities were maintained throughout the duration of the higher permeability "Marly" dolostone core experiments. The development of unstable dissolution fronts and fast pathways occurred in the "Vuggy" sample experiments when fluid velocities varied widely within the sample (as a result of increased pore structure heterogeneity). The overall effect of fast pathway development was to increase bulk permeability values by several orders of magnitude, allowing CO2-acidified fluids to travel through the cores largely unmodified by carbonate mineral reaction, as indicated by a lack of change in later-time solution pH levels at the core outlet. Given the impact of heterogeneity within low permeability cores, effort should be taken to incorporate smaller-scale heterogeneity into predictive models and such an averaging approach (utilizing the data and observations discussed here) is the topic of our companion manuscript (see Hao et al., 2013).
   Solution chemistry results indicated that steady-state carbonate mass transfer conditions were attained in the Marly dolostone experiments and during the earlier (pre-pressure breakthrough) portions of the Vuggy limestone experiments. Steady-state calcium and magnesium concentrations coincided with outlet solutions that were calculated to be at or very near to equilibrium with respect to both calcite and dolomite, relative to available thermodynamic data and considering experimental data scatter. Carbonate mass transfer data were evaluated against a variety of proposed carbonate dissolution mechanisms, including both pH-and pCO(2)-dependent expressions as well as a simplified pH-independent formulation. Based on this analysis, the calcite reaction rate coefficient was estimated to be similar to 17 times faster than that for dolomite dissolution under our experimental conditions. This ratio is consistent with the use of rate equations that depend on carbonate mineral saturation without specifying additional dependence on solution pH or CO2 levels, and may be a result of the narrow experimental pH range. In addition, solution chemistry data were combined with time-dependent pressure data to constrain the exponent in a power-law expression describing the relationship between evolving porosity and permeability within the Vuggy limestones. This relationship as well as proposed carbonate kinetic expressions are further evaluated in our companion paper (see Hao et al., 2013). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study experimentally and numerically investigated the influence of the inertial effect of fluid flow on the non-Darcy coefficient (beta). The results showed that the non-Darcy coefficient (beta), apparent permeability (k(a)), and hydraulic aperture (e(h)) decreased with the increase of Reynolds number (Re), which indicated that the non-Darcy coefficient depended on the geometric properties of a single fracture and the fluid inertial effect. The quantification model of the non-Darcy coefficient was improved. Under the guidance of fluid inertial effect, the beta performed a positive power-law relationship with e(h); under the coupling effect of fluid inertial effect and fracture geometric properties, the beta behaved negative power-law relationship with e(h), which was similar to the non-Darcy coefficient quantitative model that ignored the fluid inertial effect in the previous study. Therefore, the geometric properties were the dominant ones for fracture flow when it was affected by the coupling effect of geometric properties and inertial effects. Then, the quantitative model of the non-Darcy coefficient was improved. Based on the improved non-Darcy coefficient quantitative model, a new critical Reynolds number prediction model (CRN model) was constructed. Compared with other CRN models, the new CRN model considering the coupling effect of fluid and media properties could more accurately predict the critical Reynolds number (Re-c) in rough single fractures, which further proved the existence and importance of the inertial dependence of the non-Darcy coefficient.

AB Streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required to effectively manage water and land resources. However, developing robust stage - discharge relationships called rating curves, from which streamflow discharge is derived, is time consuming and costly, particularly in remote areas and especially at high stage levels. As a result stage - discharge relationships are often heavily extrapolated. Hydrodynamic (HD) models are physically based models used to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains. In this paper we demonstrate a method by which a HD model can be used to generate a 'synthetic' stage - discharge relationship at high stages. The method uses a both-side Box-Cox transformation to calibrate the synthetic rating curve such that the regression residuals are as close to the normal distribution as possible. By doing this both-side transformation, the statistical uncertainty in the synthetically derived stage - discharge relationship can be calculated. This enables people trying to make decisions to determine whether the uncertainty in the synthetically generated rating curve at high stage levels is acceptable for their decision. The proposed method is demonstrated in two streamflow gauging stations in north Queensland, Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB River science and management often require a design or reference discharge. The common (and sometimes unavoidable) use of such discharges may, however, obscure the fact that the magnitude and frequency of critical flows can differ due to various hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological criteria. Threshold stages and discharges were identified for six lower Brazos River, Texas gaging stations corresponding to thalweg connectivity, bed inundation, high sub-banktop flows, channel-floodplain connectivity (CFC), and overbank flooding. Critical flows were also identified for estimated thresholds for sandy bedform and medium gravel mobility, critical specific stream power for potential channel modifications, and cohesive-bank channel erosion. These thresholds have variable relationships to mean, median, and maximum flows. For four of the six stations, daily recurrence probabilities for all but flood flows are at least 1%, and as high as 11%. All stations achieve channel-floodplain connectivity at stages less than banktop. Estimated threshold flows for sediment mobility and channel erosion occur relatively frequently, with daily probabilities of 2-77%. Critical flows for bank erosion occur least often, and for sandy bedform and gravel mobility most often. Thalweg connectivity is always maintained at all sites, while bed inundation flows have a daily probability of about 80% or more. Overall, results suggest that no single flow level is dominant in hydrological or geomorphic dynamics, and that the frequency of a given threshold varies considerably even along a single river. The results support the idea that multiple flow levels and ranges are necessary to create and maintain the hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological characteristics of rivers, and that no single flow level is a reliable determinant of fluvial state.

AB The Xiaolangdi Reservoir, which was constructed in the trunk of the Yellow River, has controlled the flow process into the mouth of the Yellow River to a significant degree since it began fully operating in late 2002. To evaluate the relationship between the new hydrological process and the evolution of the Yellow River estuary, this study presents a detailed investigation of the morphodynamic adjustment in the river mouth using remote sensing satellite images. It was shown that the mouth channel rapidly extended in length from 2002 to 2004, although it was shrinking during 1999-2001, and then it expanded very slowly with considerable shifts at the place where the river flow mixes with seawater. In late 2007, an avulsion occurred on the northern bank of the mouth channel, far upstream from where the river water mixes with seawater. During 2008-2012, the new mouth channel extended its length into the sea at a slow pace, whereas since late 2013, it has divided into two branches that alternately discharge the main flow into the sea. Although both the water and the sediment input in the new hydrological process are much smaller in quantity than before, the geomorphic adjustments still manifest an excessive input of both. Moreover, after the avulsion, the seasonal pattern of land accretion in the river mouth has been characterized, with erosion occurring mostly in the wet seasons and accretion mostly occurring in the dry seasons.

AB Estimating river flows at ungauged sites is generally recognised as an important area of research. In countries or regions with rapid land development and sparse hydrological gauging networks, three particular challenges may arise-data scarcity, data quality, and hydrological non-stationarity. Using data from 44 gauged sub-catchments of the upper Ping catchment in northern Thailand from the period 1995-2006, three relevant flow response indices (runoff coefficient, base flow index and seasonal elasticity of flow) were regionalised by regression against available catchment properties. The runoff coefficient was the most successfully regionalised, followed by base flow index and lastly the seasonal elasticity. The non-stationarity (represented by the differences between two 6-year sub-periods) was significant both in the flow response indices and in land use indices; however relationships between the two sets of indices were weak. The regression equations derived from regionalisation were not helpful in predicting the non-stationarity in the flow indices except somewhat for the runoff coefficient. A partly subjective data quality scoring system was devised, and showed the clear influence of rainfall and flow data quality on regionalisation uncertainty. Recommendations towards improving data support for hydrological regionalisation in Thailand include more relevant soils databases, improved records of abstractions and investment in the gauge network. Widening of the regionalisation beyond the upper Ping and renewed efforts at using remotely sensed rainfall data are other possible ways forward.

AB When a single model is used for hydrologic prediction, it must be capable of estimating system behavior accurately at all times. Multiple-model approaches integrate several model behaviors and, when effective, they can provide better estimates than that of any single model alone. This paper discusses a sequential model fusion strategy that uses the Bayes rule. This approach calculates each model's transient posterior distribution at each time when a new observation is available and merges all model estimates on the basis of each model's posterior probability. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of this approach through case studies that fuse three hydrologic models, auto regressive with exogenous inputs, Sacramento soil moisture accounting, and artificial neural network models, to predict daily watershed streamflow.

AB Fourier and wavelet analyses were used to reveal the dominant trends and coherence of a more than one-century-long time series of precipitation and discharge in several watersheds in Sweden, two of which were subjected to hydropower and intensive agriculture. During the 20th century, there was a gradual, significant drift of the dominant discharge periodicity in agricultural watersheds. This study shows that the steepness of the Fourier spectrum of runoff from the May to October period each year increased gradually during the century, which suggests a more predictable intra-annual runoff pattern (more apart from white-noise). In the agricultural watershed, the coherence spectrum of precipitation and runoff is generally high with a consistent white-noise relationship for precipitation during the 20th century, indicating that precipitation is not controlling the drift of the discharge spectrum. In the hydropower regulated watershed, there was a sudden decrease of the discharge spectrum slope when regulation commenced in the 1920s. This study develops a new theory in which the runoff spectrum is related to the hydraulic and hydro-morphological characteristics of the watershed. Using this theory, we explain the changes in runoff spectra in the two watersheds by the anthropogenic change in surface water volume and, hence, changes in kinematic wave celerity and water transit times. The reduced water volume in the agricultural watershed would also contribute to decreasing evaporation, which could explain a slightly increasing mean discharge during the 20th century despite the fact that precipitation was statistically constant in the area.

AB The effect of warmer climate on the depletion of snow-covered area has been evaluated for the Satluj River basin located in the western Himalayan region in India. Snowmelt runoff contributes substantially to the annual streamflow of this river. In order to study the impact of three warming scenarios (T+1, T+2 and T+3degreesC), more than 160 new snow depletion curves were prepared for different elevation zones of the basin over a study period of nine years (1985/86-1990/91 and 1996/97-1998/99). For each zone, the relationship between the cumulative melt and snow-covered area was established and used to obtain the snow depletion curves under warmer climate. Projected snow depletion curves at the basin scale were derived by synthesizing the effect of warming for all zones. Warmer climatic conditions accelerate the melting of snow resulting in faster disappearance of seasonal snow cover from the basin. For the study basin, acceleration in depletion of snow-covered area is computed to be 20, 31 and 40 days for T+1, T+2 and T+3degreesC scenarios, respectively, by the end of the ablation season. The impact of warmer climate on accelerating the depletion of snow-covered area is found to be higher in the early and late parts of the ablation season. The consequences of faster disappearance of snow from the basin are discussed in terms of the hydrology and climatology of the basin.

AB We present results from laboratory experiments of the downslope propagation of a finite volume released gravity current by means of combined PIV/PLIF measurements. The experimental data were used to estimate the global characteristics of the current, such as the propagation speed, the lateral surface and the buoyancy, revealing that thermal theory is a robust model that can predict such quantities properly, especially the models of Beghin et al. (1981), Maxworthy (2010) and the theoretical model of Dai (2013a). The collected data allowed also for the determination of the entrainment rates based on the turbulent fluxes instead using the variation of the volume flux, and the regions of entrainment/detrainment have been identified. The results support previous observations of the mechanism responsible for the buoyancy loss of the cloud and its consequent deceleration down the slope, as a large scale recirculation vortex at the back of the cloud. A very complex interior structure of the cloud is observed, with a large variety of turbulent processes taking place, such as the large-scale convectively unstable recirculation vortex at the scale of the current itself, the small-scale convectively unstable motions inside the head of the cloud and close to the bottom boundary and shear (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instabilities at the boundary between the current and the ambient water. The synoptic velocity and density measurements allowed also to test existent parametrizations of turbulent fluxes, that have been quantified in 2D fields with a high spatial resolution. Results confirm that parametrization laws based on the assumption of a constant turbulent diffusivity or mixing length do not apply for buoyancy clouds due to their high spatial heterogeneity. Hence, the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities in such flows should be based on scalar quantities that avoid the problem of spatial heterogeneity and takes into account the different sources of turbulence production, e.g. using energetic considerations that compare the terms having a definite exchange of energy and acts as a source or a sink.

AB Intensive forest management is one of the main land cover changes over the last century in Central Europe, resulting in forest monoculture. It has been proposed that these monoculture stands impact hydrological processes, water yield, water quality and ecosystem services. At the Lysina Critical Zone Observatory, a forest catchment in the western Czech Republic, a distributed physics-based hydrologic model, Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), was used to simulate long-term hydrological change under different forest management practices, and to evaluate the comparative scenarios of the hydrological consequences of changing land cover. Stand-age-adjusted LAI (leaf area index) curves were generated from an empirical relationship to represent changes in seasonal tree growth. By consideration of age-adjusted LAI, the spatially-distributed model was able to successfully simulate the integrated hydrological response from snowmelt, recharge, evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, soil moisture and streamflow, as well as spatial patterns of each state and flux. Simulation scenarios of forest management (historical management, unmanaged, clear cutting to cropland) were compared. One of the critical findings of the study indicates that selective (patch) forest cutting results in a modest increase in runoff (water yield) as compared to the simulated unmanaged (no cutting) scenario over a 29-year period at Lysina, suggesting the model is sensitive to selective cutting practices. A simulation scenario of cropland or complete forest cutting leads to extreme increases in annual water yield and peak flow. The model sensitivity to forest management practices examined here suggests the utility of models and scenario development to future management strategies for assessing sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.

AB The constraints on the different fitting parameters used in the water retention equation, h(theta), and hydraulic conductivity, K(theta), are analyzed using the infiltration equation as a testing tool. The following characteristic equations are considered: those of Gardner; Brooks and Corey; Brutsaert; Van Genuchten subject to both Mualem's and Burdine's condition; Van Genuchten combined with Brooks and Corey; and Fujita. It is shown that most combinations of h(theta) and K(theta) or K(h) break down, when tested over the large range of soil types encountered in field situations. For clay soils, especially, the best-fit parameter values often become inconsistent with the infiltration theory. The best combination is the Van Genuchten equation for h(theta) with the Burdine condition m = 1 - 2/n and the Brooks and Corey equation for K(theta). This combination satisfies the infiltration condition for all soil types, even when applied to the two extreme cases used by Green and Ampt and Talsma and Parlange. The interdependence of h(theta) and K(theta) parameters is discussed.

AB Quantifying fluid flow through porous media hinges on the description of permeability, a property of considerable importance in many fields ranging from oil and gas exploration to hydrology. A common building block for modeling porous media permeability is consideration of fluid flow through tubes with circular cross section described by Poiseuille's law in which flow discharge is proportional to the fourth power of the tube's radius. In most natural porous media, pores are neither cylindrical nor smooth; they often have an irregular cross section and rough surfaces. This study presents a theoretical scaling of Poiseuille's approximation for flow in pores with irregular rough cross section quantified by a surface fractal dimension D-s2. The flow rate is a function of the average pore radius to the power 2(3-D-s2) instead of 4 in the original Poiseuille's law. Values of D-s2 range from 1 to 2, hence, the power in the modified Poiseuille's approximation varies between 4 and 2, indicating that flow rate decreases as pore surface roughness (and surface fractal dimension D-s2) increases. We also proposed pore length-radius relations for isotropic and anisotropic fractal porous media. The new theoretical derivations are compared with standard approximations and with experimental values of relative permeability. The new approach results in substantially improved prediction of relative permeability of natural porous media relative to the original Poiseuille equation.

AB Though rainfall intensity is the most important parameter for the investigation and prediction of flood generation and soil erosion, only limited information on this characteristic is available in the Nepal Himalaya. The People and Resources Dynamics of Mountain Watersheds in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya Project (PARDYP) is maintaining several high-density raingauge networks in mesoscale catchments of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan middle mountains. The first results from the network in the Jhikhu Khola catchment (JKC), where the longest data series is available, are presented here. In general, the catchment experiences monsoon type rainfall with about 78% of the annual rainfall occurring during the monsoon season. During the remainder of the year, rainfall is variable and erratic. The highest rainfall intensity occurs in the pre-monsoon season followed by the monsoon season and the same pattern is observed in the case of the erosivity. About 90% of the total annual rainfall has the potential to contribute to runoff generation and about 87% contributes towards sediment mobilization. Spatially, there is no distinct difference between the rainfall event parameters visible during the events, which cause the largest flood events at the outlet of the catchment. Rainfall in the lower lying JKC is generally lower. For extrapolation of the intensity information the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships were calculated. It is showed that the IDFs used to date heavily underestimate the short-duration intensities and their recurrence.

AB Previous "fraction of young water" (F-yw) estimates based on relative annual isotopic amplitudes in precipitation (A(p)) and streamflow (A(s)) produced lowF(yw)values in mountain catchments, which is contrary to extensive research that reports rapid water transmission in mountains. This study investigated this discrepancy by testing the effect of snow accumulation on the model that underpins theF(yw)method. A Monte-Carlo analysis of simulations for 20,000 randomly-generated catchment model configurations used 10 years of precipitation inputs for the Upper Elbow River catchment in the Rocky Mountains (Alberta, Canada) to model discharge with and without snowpack storage of winter precipitation. Neither direct nor modified precipitation input produced a 1:1 relationship betweenA(s)/A(p)andF(yw), undermining the applicability of the originalF(yw)method in mountain watersheds with large seasonal snow accumulation. With snowpack-modified input a givenA(s)/A(p)ratio corresponds to a range ofF(yw)values, which can still provide semi-quantitative information. In the small (435 km(2)) Elbow River catchment aF(yw)range of 7-23% supports previous findings of rapid transmission in mountain catchments. Further analysis showed that the improved discharge prediction (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.9) correlates with higherF(yw)values and demonstrated that the interannual shifts in delta O-18 can be used to estimate of new water (<1 year) fraction in winter streamflow, and the estimate of 20% for the Elbow River further supports rapid transmission in mountain catchments.

AB Transmissivity is often estimated using specific capacity data when standard pumping test data are not available or the drawdown is stabilized early, as in this study. Previous researchers studied the relationship between transmissivity and specific capacity in the leaky aquifer system of volcanic rocks on Jeju Island, Korea, using the Cooper-Jacob equation. The current study utilizes the Moench leaky aquifer model. The linear relationship between transmissivity and specific capacity on a log-log scale for volcanic aquifers on Jeju Island is remarkably strong, with a correlation coefficient of 0.94. The width of the 90% prediction interval is about 0.89 log cycles, indicating a +/-0.44 order of magnitude uncertainty when transmissivity is estimated using specific capacity. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effects of uncertainty in hydrological laws are studied on subsurface flows modeled by Richards' equation. The empirical parameters of the water content and the hydraulic conductivity are considered as uncertain inputs of the model. One-dimensional infiltration problems are treated and the influence of the variability of the input parameters on the position and the spreading of the wetting front is evaluated. A Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion is used to represent the output quantities and permits to significantly reduce the number of simulations in comparison with a classical Monte-Carlo method. A non-intrusive spectral projection supplies the coefficients of the PC decomposition. Three test cases with different hydrological laws are presented and demonstrate that second order PC expansions are sufficient to represent our quantities of interest owing to smooth dependences for the considered problems. Our results show a correlation between the position and the spreading of the wetting front and an amplification of the input uncertainty for all models. For each test case, five configurations with variable initial saturation state are investigated. The global sensitivity analysis indicates that the relative influence of an input parameter changes according to the output quantity considered and the initial saturation of the soil. The impact of the assumed distributions for the parameters is also briefly illustrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Downstream hydraulic geometry relationships describe the shape of alluvial channels in terms of bankfull width, flow depth, flow velocity, and channel slope. Recent investigations have stressed the difference in spatial scales associated with these variables and thus the time span required for their adjustment after a disturbance. The aim of this study is to explore the consequences in regime models considering the hypothesis that while channel width and depth adjust quickly to changes in water and sediment supply, reach slope requires a longer time span. Three theoretical models were applied. One model incorporates an extremal hypothesis (Millar RG. 2005. Theoretical regime equations for mobile gravel-bed rivers with stable banks. Geomorphology64: 207-220), and the other two are fully physically based (Ikeda S, Parker G, Kimura Y. 1988. Stable width and depth of straight gravel rivers with heterogeneous bed materials. Water Resources Research24: 713-722; Parker G, Wilcock PR, Paola C, Dietrich W, Pitlick J. 2007. Physical basis for quasi universal relations describing bankfull hydraulic geometry of single-thread gravel-bed rivers. Journal of Geophysical Research112, DOI: 10.1029/2006JF000549). In order to evaluate the performance of models introducing the slope as an independent variable, we propose two modifications to previous models. The performance of regime models was tested against published data from 142 river reaches and new hydraulic geometry data from gravel-bed rivers in Patagonia (Argentina) and north-eastern Italy. Models that assume slope as a control (Ikeda et al., 1988; or Millar, 2005) predict channel depth and width reasonably well. Parker et al.'s (2007) model improved predictions because it filters the scatter in slope data with a relation slope-discharge. The extremal hypothesis model of Millar (2005) predicts comparably to the other physically based models. Millar's model was chosen to describe the recent changes in the Piave and Brenta rivers due to human intervention - mainly in-channel gravel mining. The change in sediment supply and recovery was estimated for these rivers. This study supports the interpretation that sediment supply is the key factor guiding morphological changes in these rivers.

   UNCERTAINTY; INFERENCE
AB What is the "best'' model? The answer to this question lies in part in the eyes of the beholder, nevertheless a good model must blend rigorous theory with redeeming qualities such as parsimony and quality of fit. Model selection is used to make inferences, via weighted averaging, from a set of K candidate models, M-k; k = (1, ..., K), and help identify which model is most supported by the observed data, (gamma) over tilde = ((gamma) over tilde (1), ... (gamma) over tilde (n)), Here, we introduce a new and robust estimator of the model evidence, p((gamma) over tilde vertical bar M-k), which acts as normalizing constant in the denominator of Bayes' theorem and provides a single quantitative measure of relative support for each hypothesis that integrates model accuracy, uncertainty, and complexity. However, p((gamma) over tilde vertical bar M-k) is analytically intractable for most practical modeling problems. Our method, coined GAussian Mixture importancE (GAME) sampling, uses bridge sampling of a mixture distribution fitted to samples of the posterior model parameter distribution derived from MCMC simulation. We benchmark the accuracy and reliability of GAME sampling by application to a diverse set of multivariate target distributions (up to 100 dimensions) with known values of p((gamma) over tilde vertical bar M-k) and to hypothesis testing using numerical modeling of the rainfall-runoff transformation of the Leaf River watershed in Mississippi, USA. These case studies demonstrate that GAME sampling provides robust and unbiased estimates of the evidence at a relatively small computational cost outperforming commonly used estimators. The GAME sampler is implemented in the MATLAB package of DREAM and simplifies considerably scientific inquiry through hypothesis testing and model selection.
   Plain Language Summary Science is an iterative process for learning and discovery in which competing ideas about how nature works are evaluated against observations. The translation of each hypothesis to a computational model requires specification of system boundaries, inputs and outputs, state variables, physical/behavioral laws, and material properties; this is difficult and subjective, particularly in the face of incomplete knowledge of the governing spatiotemporal processes and insufficient observed data. To guard against the use of an inadequate model, statisticians advise selecting the `` best'' model among a set of candidate ones where each might be equally plausible and justifiable a priori. Bayesian model selection uses probability theory to select among competing hypotheses; the key variable is the Bayesian model evidence, which provides a single quantitative measure of relative support for each hypothesis that integrates model accuracy, uncertainty, and complexity. Bayesian model selection has not entered into mainstream use in Earth systems modeling due to the lack of general-purpose methods to reliably estimate the evidence. Here, we introduce a new method, called GAussian Mixture importancE (GAME) sampling. We demonstrate GAME power and usefulness for hypothesis testing using benchmark experiments with known target and numerical modeling of the rainfall-runoff transformation of the Leaf River watershed (Mississippi, USA).

AB This paper proposes and tests a model which couples the description of hydrologic flow and transport of herbicides at catchment scales. The model accounts for streamflow components' age to characterize short and long term fluctuations of herbicide flux concentrations in stream waters, whose peaks exceeding a toxic threshold are key to exposure risk of aquatic ecosystems. The model is based on a travel time formulation of transport embedding a source zone that describes near surface herbicide dynamics. To this aim we generalize a recently proposed scheme for the analytical derivation of travel time distributions to the case of solutes that can be partially taken up by transpiration and undergo chemical degradation. The framework developed is evaluated by comparing modeled hydrographs and atrazine chemographs with those measured in the Aabach agricultural catchment (Switzerland). The model proves reliable in defining complex transport features shaped by the interplay of long term processes, related to the persistence of solute components in soils, and short term dynamics related to storm inter-arrivals. The effects of stochasticity in rainfall patterns and application dates on concentrations and loads in runoff are assessed via Monte Carlo simulations, highlighting the crucial role played by the first rainfall event occurring after herbicide application. A probabilistic framework for critical determinants of exposure risk to aquatic communities is defined. Modeling of herbicides circulation at catchment scale thus emerges as essential tools for ecological risk assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowing how actual evaporation is down-regulated from potential evaporation during periods with soil moisture deficits is one of the greatest challenges towards computing evaporation everywhere on a regular basis. We propose the hypothesis that vegetated landscapes transmit information on soil moisture deficits through its down-regulation of evaporation, which in turn affects the humidification and growth of the planetary boundary layer. To test this hypothesis, we examined how the evaporative fraction, defined as the ratio between actual and potential evaporation, corresponds with the soil moisture stress index, defined as the relative humidity with a power law dependence on vapor pressure deficit times a parameter, beta.
   We tested the parameterized soil moisture stress index with direct eddy covariance measurements of actual evaporation and computations of potential evaporation based on meteorological conditions, averaged on monthly time steps. The analysis was conducted on a dataset obtained from 144 FLUXNET sites. These sites spanned much of the world's climates and biomes and contained over 5900 months of observations.
   Observations of the evaporative fraction fit the model of the soil moisture stress index best for semi-arid and arid ecosystems, and least for the humid and wet ecosystems. Consequently, a significant relationship between measurements of the evaporative fraction and soil moisture stress index held for about one-half of the population of sites. Under this condition, the median value of the parameter, beta, was 1.41.
   To investigate the mechanism of this empirical soil moisture stress index, we diagnosed it with a coupled evaporation-planetary boundary layer model. The soil moisture stress index is strongly related to surface resistance, as defined by inverting Penman-Monteith equation. Consequently, this index provides an independent estimate of surface resistance based on easy to measure mean monthly weather conditions like relative humidity and temperature. Thereby, this soil moisture stress index has potential to be applied to weather, climate and biogeochemical models and the interpretation of satellite derived evaporation products, like the one provided by the ECOSTRESS mission.

AB The non-Fickian particle dispersion model was developed in this study to model two-dimensional pollutant mixing in open channel flows. The proposed model represents shear dispersion using step-by-step arithmetic calculations, which consist of horizontal transport and vertical mixing steps, instead of using Fick's law. In the sequential calculations, the model directly applied the effect of vertical variations of both longitudinal and transverse velocities, whereas the Fickian dispersion model incorporates the effect of shear flow in the dispersion coefficients. Furthermore, in order to avoid the numerical diffusion errors induced by the grid tracking method of previously developed non-Fickian dispersion models, this model adopted the particle tracking technique to trace each particle. The simulation results in the straight channel show that the proposed model reproduced the anomalous mixing, which shows a non-linear increase of variance with time and large skewness coefficient in the initial period. However, in the Taylor period, the variance and skewness of the concentration curves approached the Fickian mixing. The simulation results in the meandering channel reveal that the proposed model adequately reproduced the skewed concentration-time curves of the experimental results whereas the Fickian dispersion model, CTM-2D, generated symmetrical curves. Further comparison between the simulation results and the tracer test results conducted in the Hongcheon River shows that the proposed model properly demonstrated the two-dimensional mixing without adopting Fick's law.

AB Dominant processes in a watershed are those that most strongly control hydrologic function and response. Estimating dominant processes enables hydrologists to design physically realistic streamflow generation models, design management interventions, and understand how climate and landscape features control hydrologic function. A recent approach to estimating dominant processes is through their link to hydrologic signatures, which are metrics that characterize the streamflow timeseries. Previous authors have used results from experimental watersheds to link signature values to underlying processes, but these links have not been tested on large scales. This paper fills that gap by testing signatures in large sample data sets from the U.S., Great Britain, Australia, and Brazil, and in Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) watersheds. We found that most inter-signature correlations are consistent with process interpretations, that is, signatures that are supposed to represent the same process are correlated, and most signature values are consistent with process knowledge in CZO watersheds. Some exceptions occurred, such as infiltration and saturation excess processes that were often misidentified by signatures. Signature distributions vary by country, emphasizing the importance of regional context in understanding signature-process links and in classifying signature values as "high" or "low." Not all signatures were easily transferable from single, small watersheds to large sample studies, showing that visual or process-based assessment of signatures is important before large-scale use. We provide a summary table with information on the reliability of each signature for process identification. Overall, our results provide a reference for future studies that seek to use signatures to identify hydrological processes.

AB Trends in high and low flows are valuable indicators of hydrological change because they highlight changes in various parts of the frequency distribution of streamflow series. This enables improved assessment of water availability in regions with high seasonal and inter-annual variability. There has been a substantial reduction in water resources in the Duero basin (Iberian Peninsula, Spain) and other areas of the Mediterranean region during the last 50 years, and this is likely to continue because of climate change. In this study, we investigated the evolution and trends in high and low flows in the Spanish part of the Duero basin, and in equivalent or closely-related precipitation indices for the period 1961-2005. The results showed a general trend of decrease in the frequency and magnitude of high flows throughout most of the basin. Moreover, the number of days with low flows significantly increased over this period. No clear relationship was evident between the evolution of high/low flows and changes in the distribution frequencies of the precipitation series. In contrast to what was expected, the number of days with heavy precipitation and the mean annual precipitation did not show significant trends across the basin, and the number of days without rainfall decreased slightly. The divergence between precipitation and runoff evolution was more accentuated in spring and summer. In the absence of trends in precipitation, it is possible that reforestation processes in the region, and increasing temperatures in recent decades, could be related to the decreasing frequency of high flows and the increasing frequency of low flows.

AB Flow regimes play an important role in sustaining biodiversity in river ecosystems. However, the effects of flow regimes on riverine fish have not been clearly described. Therefore, we propose a new methodology to quantitatively link habitat conditions (such as flow indices and physical habitat conditions) to the occurrence probability (OP) of fish species. We developed a basin-scale fish distribution model by integrating the concept of habitat suitability assessment with a distributed hydrological model in order to estimate the OP of fish, with particular attention to flow regime. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate the relationship between the probabilities of fish occurrence and major environmental factors in river sections. A geomorphology-based hydrological model was adopted to simulate river discharge, which was used to calculate 10 flow indices. The occurrence probabilities of 50 fish species in the Sagami River in Japan were modelled. For the prediction accuracy, field survey results that included at least five observations of both the presence and the absence of each species were required to obtain relatively reliable prediction (accuracy > 60%). Using the developed model, important habitat conditions for each species were identified, which showed the importance of low-flow events for more than 10 species, including Hypomesus nipponensis and Rhinogobius fluviatilis. The model also confirmed the positive effects of natural flow and the negative effect of river-crossing structures, such as dams and weirs, on the OP of most species. The suggested approach enables us to evaluate and project the ecological consequences of water resource management policy. The results demonstrate the applicability of the fish distribution model to provide quantitative information on the flow required to maintain fish communities.

TI Sea water intrusion in coastal karst springs: Example of the Blaz spring
   (Croatia)
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Brackish karst springs are common along every karstic sea shore consisting of limestone and dolomite. On the Croatian sea coast there are more than 300 permanent or temporary brackish karst springs. From the standpoint of water supply, the problem of karst spring water salinization is quite significant because large quantities of high quality fresh water are not available to be used either as drinking water or for industrial and agricultural purposes. The salinity of brackish karst springs situated along the Adriatic coast varies from 10 to more than 18 000 mg Cl 1(-1) with an unfavourable distribution during the year. In the wet winter period, when water quantities in the region are abundant, the salinity is exceedingly low. In the warm and dry summer period the chloride concentration is high. At that season, when a shortage of flesh water in the region occurs, especially due to tourism, karst spring water is so salty that it cannot be used at all. The mechanism of sea water intrusion is relatively well known but the problem of karst springs desalinization has not been solved in practice. The Ghyben-Herzberg relationship is formulated exclusively on the basis of hydrostatic equilibrium, and its use under dynamic conditions is limited. The dynamics of fresh water circulation towards karst spring exits are very specific for each individual spring. Using numerous hydrological, hydrometric, hydrogeological and speleological investigations of the brackish Blaz (Croatia) karst spring, this paper gives the plausible position and dimensions of the main karst conduits through which sea water penetrates into the spring exit.

AB Unfrozen water content significantly affects the thermal-hydro-mechanical characteristics of frozen soil. Currently, theoretical explanations for the presence of unfrozen water include capillary action, surface effects, adsorption forces, and the electrical double layer. However, the relationships between unfrozen water and these actions are not well explained, except for capillary forces. In addition, although frost heave experiments indicate that the electrical double-layer solution on a clay particle contains the main portion of unfrozen water, the electrical double-layer theory which produces a cation solution has not previously been used to calculate unfrozen water content. In this paper, it is assumed that the residual unfrozen water at very low temperatures (below -18 degrees C) is held within the adsorption-layer solution and that the remaining unfrozen water within the influence of surface effects is the cationic solution in the diffuse layer. Based on these assumptions, a theoretical model of unfrozen water is established with independent variables of temperature, specific surface area, and electrical double-layer parameters. While the input parameters of the theoretical model are numerous and difficult to obtain, the theoretical model is simplified as a parametric model. Results of the parametric model are strongly consistent with experimental data within a certain temperature range, supporting the hypothetical conditions. The similarity in the underlying mathematical structure of the derived theoretical and parametric models to current semi-empirical models further suggests that the surface effects of clay are the main causes of unfrozen water in frozen soil.

TI Second-order two-dimensional solution for the drainage of recharge based

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID WATER-TABLE HEIGHTS; FLOW; SURFACE
AB Aquifer recharge is one of the most important problems in hydrology from both theoretical and practical points of view. One of the most widely accepted methods to deal with this problem is the use of the Dupuit-Forchheimer theory. This theory assumes that the water table is almost horizontal, the vertical velocity is zero, and the horizontal velocity is uniform with depth. Surfaces of seepage are not considered. Despite these strong limitations the theory is applied, and success is frequently found in many cases despite its fundamental assumptions being violated. In this work an approximate 2-D solution to the problem is sought on the basis of Picard's iteration technique, from which a second-order differential equation for recharge problems is found. On the basis of this solution, a modified, analytical Dupuit-Forchheimer (DF) ellipse is found which compares favorably with the full 2-D solution of the problem. The analytical developments of this theory provide a generalized DF theory which permits as an outcome the analytical determination of the surface of seepage.

AB Clays and claystones are used as backfill and barrier materials in the design of waste repositories, because they act as hydraulic barriers and retain contaminants. Transport through such barriers occurs mainly by molecular diffusion. There is thus an interest to relate the diffusion properties of clays to their structural properties. In previous work, we have developed a concept for up-scaling pore-scale molecular diffusion coefficients using a grid-based model for the sample pore structure. Here we present an operational algorithm which can generate such model pore structures of polymineral materials. The obtained pore maps match the rock's mineralogical components and its macroscopic properties such as porosity, grain and pore size distributions. Representative ensembles of grains in 2D or 3D are created by a lattice Monte Carlo (MC) method, which minimizes the interfacial energy of grains starting from an initial grain distribution. Pores are generated at grain boundaries and/or within grains. The method is general and allows to generate anisotropic structures with grains of approximately predetermined shapes, or with mixtures of different grain types. A specific focus of this study was on the simulation of clay-like materials. The generated clay pore maps were then used to derive upscaled effective diffusion coefficients for non-sorbing tracers using a homogenization technique. The large number of generated maps allowed to check the relations between micro-structural features of clays and their effective transport parameters, as is required to explain and extrapolate experimental diffusion results. As examples, we present a set of 2D and 3D simulations and investigated the effects of nanopores within particles (interlayer pores) and micropores between particles. Archie's simple power law is followed in systems with only micropores. When nanopores are present, additional parameters are required; the data reveal that effective diffusion coefficients could be described by a sum of two power functions, related to the micro- and nanoporosity. We further used the model to investigate the relationships between particle orientation and effective transport properties of the sample. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Streamflow is the major factor influencing the evolution of solute concentration in river water and different modelling approaches exist to characterize the dependency of ion concentration to discharge: the simplest are based on measurable quantities (stream discharge and stream ion concentration) but do not allow for an explicit, physical, flow-path interpretation; the more complex are based on mixing assumptions with different end-members sources, but require the knowledge of (unmeasurable) flow components. We present here a new concentration-discharge model, which associates a classical concentration-discharge relationship with a classical two-component mixing equation. The originality of our approach lies in the fact that we do not proceed in the usual way to perform the hydrograph separation: we use an a priori assumption of the baseflow-quickflow separation to infer the source concentration values, contrarily to the usual (inverse) approach. The other notable originality is that all the parameters of this model depend on the temporal variation of the stream discharge. This combined model was tested on high-frequency ion concentration series from the ORACLE-Orgeval observatory (France). This work demonstrates that high temporal resolution data allows for explicit testing of model performance across different hydrologic scales. Results show that the combined mixing model allows a better estimation of streamflow solute concentration series for most ions tested at inter-annual scale, except for nitrate (which do not exhibit a clear C - Q relationship). Our results also confirm the advantage of coupling a time dynamic hydrological model with static C - Q relations for each of the flow components.

AB Equations which describe single phase fluid flow and transport through an elastic porous media are obtained by applying constitutive theory to a set of general multiphase mass, momentum, energy, and entropy equations. Linearization of these equations yields a set of equations solvable upon specification of the material coefficients which arise. Further restriction of the flow to small velocities proves that Darcy's law is a special case of the general momentum balance.

AB The shear flow generated by natural convection in porous media considerably influences the dispersion of contaminants in various geological formations. Previous studies have revealed that the dispersion coefficient depends on the Pe acute accent clet number (Pe), shear rate, and complex pore structures. In this study, the dispersion behavior of a NaI tracer cloud was investigated under different shear rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.04 s-1 and Pe ranging from 10 to 200 using an innovative experimental apparatus via an X-ray technique. In contrast to uniform flow, a considerably enhanced dispersion was observed in shear flow along the longitudinal direction, and spreading in the longitudinal and transverse directions grew with time as -t3 and -t, respectively. In the power-law regime, the dispersion behaviors in the transverse and longitudinal directions were strengthened by shear action, with a larger dependence of the power law on the shear rates and Pe compared with that in the uniform flow. The strengthened dispersion promoted the formation of a hyper-mixing state, which was evaluated using the temporal evolution of the maximum concentration of the tracer plume, dilution index, and scalar dissipation rate. The results indicate that the dispersion behavior in a two-dimensional shear flow is quantita-tively equivalent to that in a four-dimensional uniform-flow field. The findings of this study can provide a deeper understanding of the influence of shear flow on the hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media.

AB This study explores the relationship between low flows and large-scale climate variability in France. To this aim, a national low flow reference network of near-natural catchments, consisting of 236 gauging stations, was set up. A subset of 220 daily streamflow records for the period 1968-2008 was used to detect trends in a number of severity and timing drought indices. In addition to testing temporal trends, correlations with four climate indices were also evaluated: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the frequency of two Weather Patterns corresponding to circulation types associated to wet (WP2) and dry (WP8) conditions over France. Due to their specific dynamics, NAO and WPs were also analyzed seasonally.
   Results show a consistent increase of drought severity in southern France. Correlations with NAO and AMO show a similar spatial pattern. Additionally, significant relationships with WPs were found throughout France, with the exception of the Mediterranean coast. Timing indices appear to be less related to large-scale climate indices, whereas some evidence of negative temporal trends was found (e.g. earlier drought start).
   To assess the robustness of the above relationships, a subset of 28 stations with longer records was studied over a 60 year period (1948-2008). The results show that, when shifting the time window of the analysis, the correlations between low flow indices and climate indices remain stable, whereas those with respect to time do not.
   Seasonal climate indices appear to have stronger links with low flow indices than their annual counterparts. For instance, the summer NAO shows a strong link with severity indices in the northern half of the country. This link is found again for the winter WP2.
   The above results indicate that temporal trends should only be used for descriptive purposes, whereas seasonally lagged climate indices are potential candidates as predictors of summer low flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macroscopic differential equations of mass and momentum balance for two immiscible fluids in a deformable porous medium are derived in an Eulerian framework using the continuum theory of mixtures. After inclusion of constitutive relationships, the resulting momentum balance equations feature terms characterizing the coupling among the fluid phases and the solid matrix caused by their relative accelerations. These terms, which imply a number of interesting phenomena, do not appear in current hydrologic models of subsurface multiphase flow. Our equations of momentum balance are shown to reduce to the Berryman-Thigpen-Chen model of bulk elastic wave propagation through unsaturated porous media after simplification (e.g., isothermal conditions, neglect of gravity, etc.) and under the assumption of constant volume fractions and material densities. When specialized to the case of a porous medium containing a single fluid and an elastic solid, our momentum balance equations reduce to the well-known Biot model of poroelasticity. We also show that mass balance alone is sufficient to derive the Biot model stress-strain relations, provided that a closure condition for porosity change suggested by de la Cruz and Spanos is invoked. Finally, a relation between elastic parameters and inertial coupling coefficients is derived that permits the partial differential equations of the Biot model to be decoupled into a telegraph equation and a wave equation whose respective dependent variables are two different linear combinations of the dilatations of the solid and the fluid.

AB The traditional conservation of mass equation is derived using a first-order Taylor series to represent flux change in a control volume, which is valid strictly for cases of linear changes in flux through the control volume. We show that using higher-order Taylor series approximations for the mass flux results in mass conservation equations that are intractable. We then show that a fractional Taylor series has the advantage of being able to exactly represent non-linear flux in a control volume with only two terms, analogous to using a first-order traditional Taylor series. We replace the integer-order Taylor series approximation for flux with the fractional-order Taylor series approximation, and remove the restriction that the flux has to be linear, or piece-wise linear, and remove the restriction that the control volume must be infinitesimal. As long as the flux can be approximated by a power-law function, the fractional-order conservation of mass equation will be exact when the fractional order of differentiation matches the flux power-law. There are two important distinctions between the traditional mass conservation, and its fractional equivalent. The first is that the divergence term in the fractional mass conservation equation is the fractional divergence, and the second is the appearance of a scaling term in the fractional conservation of mass equation that may eliminate scale effects in parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) that should be scale-invariant.

AB The transport dynamics of a solute plume in porous media are strictly related to the hydrogeological properties. Despite progress in simulation techniques, quantifying transport in strongly heterogeneous geological formations is still a challenge. It is well established that the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity (K) field is one of the main factors controlling solute transport phenomena. Increasing the heterogeneity level of the K-field will enhance the probability of having preferential paths, that are fundamental in predicting the first time arrivals. In this work, we focus on the relationship between the connectivity structure of the K-field to transport quantities. We compute connectivity based on the concept of hydraulic resistance and the corresponding least resistance paths. We present a new efficient algorithm based on graph theory that enables us to extract useful information from the K-field without resorting to the solution of the governing equations for flow and transport. For this reason, an exhaustive and fast analysis can be carried out using a Monte Carlo framework for randomly generated K-fields which allows the computation of the least resistance path and its uncertainty. We examine the minimum hydraulic resistance for both multi-Gaussian (MG) and non-MG log K-fields. The analysis carried out indicates that the expected value of the minimum hydraulic resistance between two points scales exponentially with the standard deviation of the log K-field. Given the strong correlation with plume's first time arrival, our results illustrate how hydraulic resistance and least resistance path can be used as a computationally efficient risk metric.

AB In soil respiration studies the diffusive gas fluxes are often calculated using Fick's law. However, results obtained with Fick's law deviate from those obtained with the theoretically sound Stefan-Maxwell equations. In the present study a numerical model based on an adapted form of Fick's law is applied to soil respiration. A pressure adjustment flux to maintain isobaric equilibrium in the system is employed to correct errors related to the usage of Fick's law. The results of the above-mentioned model are compared with those of analytical solutions of Fick's law and the Stefan-Maxwell equations to check the model's accuracy. The analytical solutions are derived for steady state transport at constant respiration rates in a hypothetical ternary system with N-2, O-2, and CO2. Calculations are performed at various constant rates of CO2 production and O-2 consumption throughout the soil. Differences between the mole fraction gradients calculated with Fick's law and the Stefan-Maxwell equations are substantial. If Fick's law is combined with the isobaric equilibrium correction procedure, the similarity with the Stefan-Maxwell equations is much better. The numerical model employing the adapted Fick's law is subsequently tested against field measurements. Field measurements were carried out in large outdoor lysimeters filled with oil-contaminated soil containing nonvolatile hydrocarbons. Nonsteady gas transport due to dynamic soil respiration during biodegradation of the hydrocarbons in the lysimeters is modeled at known boundary conditions. The result of the model agree with measurements of CO2 fluxes and O-2 and CO2 concentration profiles in the lysimeters.

AB Remote sensing of discharge and river stage from space provides us with a promising alternative approach to monitor watersheds, no matter if they are ungauged, poorly gauged, or fully gauged. One approach is to estimate river stage from satellite measured inundation area based on the inundation area - river stage relationship (IARSR). However, this approach is not easy to implement because of a lack of data for constructing the IARSR. In this study, an innovative and robust approach to construct the IARSR from digital elevation model (DEM) data was developed and tested. It was shown that the constructed IARSR from DEM data could be used to retrieve water level or river stage from satellite-measured inundation area. To reduce the uncertainty in the estimated inundation area, a dual-thresholding method was proposed. The first threshold is the lower limit of pixel value for classifying water body pixels with a relatively high-level certainty. The second threshold is the upper limit of pixel value for classifying potentially flooded pixels. All pixels with values between the first threshold and the second threshold and adjacent to the classified water body pixels may be partially flooded. A linear interpolation method was used to estimate the wetted area of each partially flooded pixel. In applying the constructed IARSR to the estimated inundation areas from 11 Landsat TM images, 11 water levels were obtained. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated water levels compared with the observed water levels at the US Geological Survey (USGS) gauging station on the Trinity River at Liberty in Liberty County, Texas, is about 0.38m.

ID SEEPAGE
AB Small-scale heterogeneities and large changes in hydraulic gradient over short distances can create preferential groundwater flow paths that discharge to lakes. A 170 m 2 and within an area of springs and seeps along the shore of Shingobee Lake, Minnesota, was intensively instrumented to characterize groundwater-lake interaction within underlying organic-rich soil and sandy glacial sediments. Seepage meters in the lake and piezometer nests, installed at depths of 0.5 and 1.0 m below the ground surface and lakebed, were used to estimate groundwater flow. Statistical analysis of hydraulic conductivity estimated from slug tests indicated a range from 21 to 4.8 x 10(-3) m day(-1) and small spatial correlation. Although hydraulic gradients are overall upward and toward the lake, surface water that flows onto an area about 2 m onshore results in downward flow and localized recharge. Most flow occurred within 3 m of the shore through more permeable pathways. Seepage meter and Darcy law estimates of groundwater discharge agreed well within error limits. In the small area examined, discharge decreases irregularly with distance into the lake, indicating that sediment heterogeneity plays an important role in the distribution of groundwater discharge. Temperature gradients showed some relationship to discharge, but neither temperature profiles nor specific electrical conductance could provide a more convenient method to map groundwater-lake interaction. These results suggest that site-specific data may be needed to evaluate local water budget and to protect the water quality and quantity of discharge-dominated lakes.

ID URBAN DRAINAGE; IMPACTS; QUALITY
AB Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) has been recognized as a major environmental issue in many countries. In Canada, the proposed reinforcement of the CSO frequency regulations will result in new constraints on municipal development. Municipalities will have to demonstrate that new developments do not increase CSO frequency above a reference level based on historical CSO records. Governmental agencies will also have to define a framework to assess the impact of new developments on CSO frequency and the efficiency of the various proposed measures to maintain CSO frequency at its historic level. In such a context, it is important to correctly assess the average number of days with CSO and to define relationships between CSO frequency and rainfall characteristics. This paper investigates such relationships using available CSO and rainfall datasets for Quebec. CSO records for 4285 overflow structures (OS) were analyzed. A simple model based on rainfall thresholds was developed to forecast the occurrence of CSO on a given day based on daily rainfall values. The estimated probability of days with CSO have been used to estimate the rainfall threshold value at each OS by imposing that the probability of exceeding this rainfall value for a given day be equal to the estimated probability of days with CSO. The forecast skill of this model was assessed for 3437 OS using contingency tables. The statistical significance of the forecast skill could be assessed for 64.2% of these OS. The threshold model has demonstrated significant forecast skill for 91.3% of these OS confirming that for most OS a simple threshold model can be used to assess the occurrence of CSO.

AB In river basin systems, power asymmetry is often responsible of inefficient and unbalanced water allocations. Climate change and anthropogenic pressure will possibly exacerbate such disparities as the dominant party controls an increasingly limited shared resource. In this context, the deployment of cooperation mechanisms giving greater consideration to a balanced distribution of the benefits, while improving system-wide efficiency, may be desirable. This often implies the intervention of a third party (e.g., the river basin water authority) imposing normative constraints (e.g., a minimum release) on the party in the dominant position. However, this imposition will be more acceptable to the dominant party if coupled with some form of compensation. For a public agency, compensation may be burdensome, especially when the allowance is triggered by natural events whose timing and magnitude are highly uncertain. In this context, index-based insurance contracts may represent a viable alternative and reduce the cost of achieving socially desirable outcomes. In this paper, we develop a hybrid cooperation mechanism composed of i) a direct normative constraint imposed by a regulator, and ii) an indirect financial tool, an index-based insurance contract, to be used as a compensation measure. The approach is developed for the Lake Como multi-purpose water system, Italy: a complex Alpine river basin, supporting several hydropower reservoirs and finally flowing into a regulated lake which supplies water to several downstream uses, mostly irrigated agriculture. The system is characterized by a manifest geographic power asymmetry: the upstream hydropower companies are free to release their stored water in time irrespective of the timing of the downstream demands. This situation can lead to financial losses by the downstream users and undesirable social outcomes. Results suggest that financial instruments may offer a reliable and relatively inexpensive alternative to other forms of compensation, and thereby favor more balanced management of multipurpose water systems characterized by power asymmetry. This finding is especially relevant in times when granting of licenses to use/withdrawal water are often being reviewed with attention to environmental protection and equity issues.

AB Understanding the mechanisms and controls on contaminant removal in streams is essential in managing human and ecosystem health. The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays a key role in the removal of contaminants from streams. Often, tracer tests are implemented in conjunction with measurements of compounds to assess the removal rates of contaminants in streams. The predicted removal rates largely rely on the estimated hyporheic residence time, and hence, the chosen conceptual model of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) will influence the predicted removal rate. Despite this, different HEF models are generally not considered when assessing contaminant removal rates. In this paper, we present a numerical modeling approach for interpreting tracer tests to determine contaminant removal rates that allows for multiple conceptual models of HEF to be considered. We demonstrate this method by interpreting data from a conservative tracer test in conjunction with grab samples of trace organic compounds using two commonly used models of HEF: one that assumes first-order exchange between the stream and the HZ and one that considers a power law weighting of first-order exchange coefficients. For the three degrading compounds measured, guanylurea, valsartan, and diclofenac, we observed that the power law model consistently predicted higher removal rates in the stream compared to the first-order model. Variations were also observed between the removal rates estimated in the HZ. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple conceptualizations of the HEF when assessing contaminant removal rates.

AB Many natural phenomena in geophysics and hydrogeology involve the flow of non-Newtonian fluids through natural rough-walled fractures. Therefore, there is considerable interest in predicting the pressure drop generated by complex flow in these media under a given set of boundary conditions. However, this task is markedly more challenging than the Newtonian case given the coupling of geometrical and rheological parameters in the flow law. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a simple method to predict the flow of commonly used Carreau and yield stress fluids through fractures. To do so, an expression relating the "in situ'' shear viscosity of the fluid to the bulk shear-viscosity parameters is obtained. Then, this "in situ'' viscosity is entered in the macroscopic laws to predict the flow rate-pressure gradient relations. Experiments with yield stress and Carreau fluids in two replicas of natural fractures covering a wide range of injection flow rates are presented and compared to the predictions of the proposed method. Our results show that the use of a constant shift parameter to relate "in situ'' and bulk shear viscosity is no longer valid in the presence of a yield stress or a plateau viscosity. Consequently, properly representing the dependence of the shift parameter on the flow rate is crucial to obtain accurate predictions. The proposed method predicts the pressure drop in a rough-walled fracture at a given injection flow rate by only using the shear rheology of the fluid, the hydraulic aperture of the fracture, and the inertial coefficients as inputs.

AB Key theoretical and empirical results from the past two decades have established that peak discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event in a nested watershed exhibit a power law, or scaling, relation to drainage area and that the parameters of the power law relation, henceforth referred to as the flood scaling exponent and intercept, change from event to event. To date, only two studies have been conducted using empirical data, both using data from the 21 km(2) Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed that is located in Mississippi, in an effort to uncover the physical processes that control the event-to-event variability of the flood scaling parameters. Our study expands the analysis to the mesoscale Iowa River basin (A=32,400 km(2)), which is located in eastern Iowa, and provides additional insights into the physical processes that control the flood scaling parameters. Using 51 rainfall-runoff events that we identified over the 12 year period since 2002, we show how the duration and depth of excess rainfall, which is the portion of rainfall that contributes to direct runoff, control the flood scaling exponent and intercept. Moreover, using a diagnostic simulation study that is guided by evidence found in empirical data, we show that the temporal structure of excess rainfall has a significant effect on the scaling structure of peak discharges. These insights will contribute toward ongoing efforts to provide a framework for flood prediction in ungauged basins.

AB One of the key challenges in hydrology is to accurately measure and predict the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall. Rain gauges measuring at point locations are often considered as the "ground truth" for grid based radar rainfall calibration. Usually, no consideration is given to the uncertainty in the measurement that varies depending on the number of rain gauges that fall within each grid cell. If this uncertainty in the rain gauge network measurements is ignored, the Z-R relationship used to convert reflectivity (Z) to rainfall (R) will be biased. We investigate the effects of point gauge rainfall uncertainty on parameter bias in the Z-R relationship. An error model is developed to compute point gauge rainfall uncertainty at the radar grid resolution. This error model has two components: (1) the error in the gauge measurement itself, and (2) the error introduced by the gauge not capturing the spatial variability within a radar pixel. The Simulation Extrapolation method (SIMEX) is used to determine the extent of parameter bias present in the rainfall-reflectivity relationship as a result of this uncertainty. When considering the point gauge rainfall uncertainty a 4% decrease in the average radar rainfall estimates is found. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A soil property may be related to another and the relationships may change depending on the scale and location. Understanding these scale- and location-dependent relationships is important for prediction of one soil property based on another. The objective of this study is to use wavelet coherency analysis to examine whether the relationship between hydraulic properties and soil physical properties are scale- and location-dependent. Undisturbed cores were collected along a transect from the sandy loam soil of a farm field in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), sand content, and organic carbon content (OC) were measured on these cores, and their relationships as a function of scale and location were analyzed using wavelets. Results indicated that the wavelet coherency between K-s and sand content is only significantly different from that of red noises at the scales around 48 m. The cross-wavelet spectrum and wavelet coherency are predominantly in phase, suggesting a positive correlation between K-s and sand. For K-s and OC, significant coherency exists at scales from 30 to 48 and around 80 m. At the scales of 30-48 and around 80 m the relationships are predominantly out of phase, suggesting negative correlation. Therefore relationships between K-s and sand or K-s and OC are not only scale- dependent but also location-dependent. Scale and location dependence have an important implication for understanding the scaling relationships between K-s and sand and OC and for the prediction of K-s from sand and OC.

AB Flood frequency estimation is crucial in both engineering practice and hydrological research. Regional analysis of flood peak discharges is used for more accurate estimates of flood quantiles in ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. This is based on the identification of homogeneous zones, where the probability distribution of annual maximum peak flows is invariant, except for a scale factor represented by an index flood. The numerous applications of this method have highlighted obtaining accurate estimates of index flood as a critical step, especially in ungauged or poorly gauged sections, where direct estimation by sample mean of annual flood series (AFS) is not possible, or inaccurate. Therein indirect methods have to be used. Most indirect methods are based upon empirical relationships that link index flood to hydrological, climatological and morphological catchment characteristics, developed by means of multi-regression analysis, or simplified lumped representation of rainfall-runoff processes. The limits of these approaches are increasingly evident as the size and spatial variability of the catchment increases. In these cases, the use of a spatially-distributed, physically-based hydrological model, and time continuous simulation of discharge can improve estimation of the index flood. This work presents an application of the FEST-WB model for the reconstruction of 29 years of hourly streamflows for an Alpine snow-fed catchment in northern Italy, to be used for index flood estimation. To extend the length of the simulated discharge time series, meteorological forcings given by daily precipitation and temperature at ground automatic weather stations are disaggregated hourly, and then fed to FEST-WB. The accuracy of the method in estimating index flood depending upon length of the simulated series is discussed, and suggestions for use of the methodology provided.

AB Soil properties are determined by a complex arrangement of pores, particles, and aggregates, which may change in time as a result of both ecohydrological dynamics and land management processes. The soil pore size distribution (PSD), which typically is treated as a static component, is a key determinant of soil properties, and its accurate representation has the potential to improve hydrological and crop models. Following previous work by Or a al. (2000), a modeling framework is proposed for the time evolution of the PSD which takes into account processes such as tillage, consolidation, and changes in organic matter. A time-varying power law PSD is obtained as the solution of a special form of transport equation for the PSD, parameterized using data from the literature to capture, in a parsimonious and efficient manner, the changes in the PSD as a result of the soil processes considered. Alterations in soil properties brought about by tillage, consolidation, and organic matter are then discussed. The potential benefit of this method for determining soil properties over the more widely used pedotransfer functions (PTF) is that it allows for the history of the soil, rather than only its present state, to be taken into account when estimating soil properties, and it does so in a physically consistent manner, leading to the widely used power law expression for soil properties with few parameters.

AB Relationships between stream water and air temperatures are often modeled using linear or nonlinear regression methods. Despite a strong relationship between water and air temperatures and a variety of models that are effective for data summarized on a weekly basis, such models did not yield consistently good predictions for summaries such as daily maximum temperature. A good predictive model for daily maximum temperature is required because daily maximum temperature is an important measure for predicting survival of temperature sensitive fish. To appropriately model the strong relationship between water and air temperatures at a daily time step, it is important to incorporate information related to the time of the year into the modeling. In this work, a time-varying coefficient model is used to study the relationship between air temperature and water temperature. The time-varying coefficient model enables dynamic modeling of the relationship, and can be used to understand how the air-water temperature relationship varies over time. The proposed model is applied to 10 streams in Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia using daily maximum temperatures. It provides a better fit and better predictions than those produced by a simple linear regression model or a nonlinear logistic model.

AB The strong wet and dry seasons of tropical monsoon hydrology in India necessitate development of storage and flow diversion schemes for utilization of water to meet various social and economic needs. However, the river valley schemes may cause adverse flow-related impacts due to storage, flow diversion, tunnelling and spoil disposal. There may be critical reaches in which altered flows are not able to sustain the river channel ecology and riparian environment that existed prior to implementation of the storage and diversion schemes. In the past, environmental flows in India have usually been understood as the minimum flow to be released downstream from a dam as compensation for riparian rights, without considering the impacts on the river ecosystem. Rivers in India have been significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities over the past 60 years and have great social and religious significance to the vast population. This paper explores various aspects of past, present and future environmental flow assessment (EFA) in India highlighted by case studies from rivers across the nation. It demonstrates that multidisciplinary studies requiring expertise from a range of fields are needed for EFA, and that environmental flows are necessary for aquatic ecosystems to remain in a healthy state and for the sustainable use of water resources. The major focus areas for the development of EFA research in India are the creation of a shareable database for hydrological, ecological and socioeconomic data, developing hydrology-ecology relationships, evaluation of ecosystem services, addressing pollution due to anthropogenic activities and promotion of research on EFA. At the same time, efforts will be needed to develop new methods or refine existing methods for India.

   COMPONENTS AND TEMPERATURES OF A BARE SOIL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID EVAPORATION; MOISTURE; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; MODELS
AB A periodic analytical theory previously tested only against diurnal variations is applied to a 66-day springtime period at Agassiz, British Columbia. Comparison is made with daily average values of the surface energy balance components, soil temperatures, and near-surface atmospheric potential temperatures and water vapor densities measured throughout this period. It is shown that the inability of the periodic theory to predict the measured warming trend at the 0.5 m depth in the soil can be overcome by applying the theory to the whole of 1978, i.e., by imbedding the period of interest in a longer period. A new analytical theory that accounts for aperiodic transient effects is also described and compared with measured soil temperatures. This theory can also account for the observed soil warming trend but is sensitive to small errors in the prescribed soil surface heat flux density. Additional analytical calculations show that advection of heat within the soil associated with evaporation and rainfall could have significantly influenced the long-term temperature trends observed at Agassiz. The poorer success with the analytical approach when applied to long-term rather than diurnal variations suggests that to predict the former accurately a numerical model is required.

ID FLOW; MODEL
AB We develop a model to grasp the combined effect of rheology and spatial stratifications on two-dimensional non-Newtonian gravity-driven flow in porous media. We consider a power-law constitutive equation for the fluid, and a monomial variation of permeability and porosity along the vertical direction (transverse to the flow) or horizontal direction (parallel to the flow). Under these assumptions, similarity solutions are derived in semi-analytical form for thin gravity currents injected into a two-dimensional porous medium and having constant or time-varying volume. The extent and shape of the porous domain affected by the injection is significantly influenced by the interplay of model parameters. These describe the fluid (flow behaviour index n), the spatial heterogeneity (coefficients beta, gamma, delta, omega for variations of permeability and porosity in the horizontal or vertical direction), and the type of release (volume exponent alpha). Theoretical results are validated against two sets of experiments with alpha=1 (constant inflow) conducted with a stratified porous medium (simulated by superimposing layers of glass beads of different diameter) and a Hele-Shaw analogue for power-law fluid flow, respectively. In the latter case, a recently established Hele-Shaw analogy is extended to the variation of properties parallel to the flow direction. Comparison with experimental results shows that the proposed model is able to capture the propagation of the current front and the current profile. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores multi-scale variability in the relationship between turbidity (T-n) and flow (Q) in 162 watersheds across the contiguous United States. Sites are selected where T-n acts as a good surrogate for suspended sediment concentration. We use dynamic linear models (DLMs) to infer time-varying parameters of T-n-Q rating curves at each site, and calibrate a hyper-parameter of the DLM model (delta $\delta $) to quantify the degree of dynamicity in the rating curve relationship. The DLM can capture dynamics in the T-n-Q relationship at the resolution of the data (daily in this study), enabling an analysis of the dynamics across time scales. Regional multivariate regressions are used to identify physiographic features that relate to the magnitude of delta $\delta $ and spectral signatures in the DLM parameters across sites. Results show that watersheds in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest tend to exhibit more variable T-n-Q relationships, while these relationships are more stable in watersheds in the humid east and Lower Mississippi River basin. Stream network complexity, soil composition, perennial snow coverage, saturation-excess overland flow, and modifications to the stream network are associated with the dynamicity in the T-n-Q relationship. DLM parameters exhibit cyclic behavior at sub-monthly, sub-annual, and annual time scales at sites across the country, with annual cycling associated with basin features that reflect watershed sediment availability and the erosive power of rivers. Overall, our analysis highlights significant multi-scale variability in T-n-Q relationships across the nation, with important implications for how sediment dynamics should be measured and managed at the watershed-scale.

AB This Study presents the results of a three-dimensional variable-density numerical modelling of the Motril-Salobrena coastal aquifer and the possible effects of the entry into service in May 2005 of the Rules Dam, located just 17 kin from the coast. Present parameters of the Motril-Salobrena aquifer show that the system's conditions are very similar to a natural regime. The dam will substantially alter aquifer recharge, as the entry flow through the alluvial sediments of the Guadalfeo River will be entirely cut off or drastically reduced. Different scenarios reproducing the possible evolution of the aquifer under operation of the Rules Dam have been modelled. In most cases, results indicate that the conditions of the aquifer would worsen, with a general advance of the freshwater-saltwater interface. The area with most risk of saltwater intrusion is the old mouth of the Guadalfeo River, where the mixing zone could advance 1200 in inland. It is proposed that maintaining a 5-6 Mm(3) year(-1) 'ecological flow' in the Guadalfeo River could prevent this saline advance. This application demonstrates that variable-density models are potentially useful tools for estimating the effects of dams on the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions of a coastal aquifer.

AB We aim at testing and validating a mobile-immobile mass transfer model from a set of single-well injection withdrawal tracer tests in a heterogeneous porous aquifer. By varying the duration of the injection phase, different volumes of aquifer are investigated by the tracer. Hence, we focus the transport model validation not only on reproducing a single breakthrough curve (BTC) but also on the model's capacity to predict the amount of mixing as a function of the volume visited by the tracer. All the BTCs are strongly asymmetric, as expected when dispersion is controlled by diffusive mass transfers between the mobile water and the immobile water part of the porosity. However, the BTC cannot be modeled by a conventional mobile-immobile mass transfer model with a simple power law memory function. To account for that, we implement a continuous time random walk model in which the transition time distribution psi (t), which is related to the excursion time probability of the tracer in the immobile domain, is a dual-slope power law distribution. The model best fits the BTC data set with a transitional regime controlled by psi(t) similar to t(-2) and an asymptotic regime characteristic of the conventional double-porosity model with psi(t) similar to t(-1.5). This work emphasizes that high-resolution concentration measurement and multiple-scale tracer tests are required for assessing solute dispersion models in heterogeneous reservoirs and for subsequently obtaining reliable predictions.

AB How precipitation (P) is translated into streamflow (Q) and over what timescales (i.e., "memory") is difficult to predict without calibration of site-specific models or using geochemical approaches, posing barriers to prediction in ungauged basins or advancement of general theories. Here, we used a data-driven approach to identify regional patterns and exogenous controls on P-Q interactions. We applied an information flow analysis, which quantifies uncertainty reduction, to a daily time series of P and Q from 671 watersheds across the conterminous United States. We first demonstrated that information transfer from P to Q primarily reflects the quickflow component of water-budgets, based on a watershed model. Readily quantifiable information flows show a functional relationship with model parameters, suggesting utility for model calibration. Second, applied to real watersheds, P-Q information flows exhibit seasonally varying behavior within regions in a manner consistent with dominant runoff generation mechanisms. However, the timing and the magnitude of information flows also reflect considerable subregional heterogeneity, likely attributable to differences in watershed size, baseflow contributions, and variation in aerial coverage of preferential flow paths. A regression analysis showed that a combination of climate and watershed characteristics are predictive of P-Q information flows. Though information flows cannot, in most cases, uniquely determine dominant runoff mechanisms, they provide a means to quantify the heterogeneous outcomes of those mechanisms within regions, thereby serving as a benchmarking tool for models developed at the regional scale. Last, information flows characterize regionally specific ways in which catchment connectivity changes from the wet to dry season.

AB In recent years, a large body of the literature has been devoted to study reactive transport of solutes in porous media based on pure Lagrangian formulations. Such approaches have also been extended to accommodate second-order bimolecular reactions, in which the reaction rate is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants. Rather, in some cases, chemical reactions involving two reactants follow more complicated rate laws. Some examples are (1) reaction rate laws written in terms of powers of concentrations, (2) redox reactions incorporating a limiting term (e.g., Michaelis-Menten), or (3) any reaction where the activity coefficients vary with the concentration of the reactants, just to name a few. We provide a methodology to account for complex kinetic bimolecular reactions in a fully Lagrangian framework where each particle represents a fraction of the total mass of a specific solute. The method, built as an extension to the second-order case, is based on the concept of optimal Kernel Density Estimator, which allows the concentrations to be written in terms of particle locations, hence transferring the concept of reaction rate to that of particle location distribution. By doing so, we can update the probability of particles reacting without the need to fully reconstruct the concentration maps. The performance and convergence of the method is tested for several illustrative examples that simulate the Advection-Dispersion-Reaction Equation in a 1-D homogeneous column. Finally, a 2-D application example is presented evaluating the need of fully describing non-bilinear chemical kinetics in a randomly heterogeneous porous medium.

AB Frameworks for optimal reservoir operation play an important role in the management of water resources and delivery of economic benefits. Effective utilization and conservation of water from reservoirs helps to manage water deficit periods. The main challenge in reservoir optimization is to design operating rules that can be used to inform real-time decisions on reservoir release. We develop a bio-inspired framework for the optimization of reservoir release to satisfy the diverse needs of various stakeholders. In this work, single-objective optimization and multiobjective optimization problems are formulated using an algorithm known as "strawberry optimization" and tested with actual reservoir data. Results indicate that well planned reservoir operations lead to efficient deployment of the reservoir water with the help of optimal release patterns.

ID EXTREME PRECIPITATION; INFERENCE; CURVES; MODELS
AB Rainfall intensity duration frequency (IDF) curves are one of the most commonly used tools in water resources engineering. They give an idea of how return levels of extreme rainfall intensities vary with duration over a range of return periods. It is assumed that the annual maximum intensity follows the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution. Conventional methods of estimating IDF relationships do not provide estimates of uncertainty. We propose a Bayesian framework for handling uncertainties in IDF models. Firstly, we collect annual maximum intensity data over a relevant range of rainfall durations. Secondly, we define an approximate likelihood, the "independence" likelihood, in which the correlations have been ignored between maximum intensity data of different durations. Finally, we apply Bayesian inference to obtain the adjusted posterior, which accounts for likelihood misspecification. A comparison with earlier methods, without any adjustment amongst others, shows that the adjusted posteriors are considerably wider. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aims to develop a hybrid multi-model using the soft computing approach. The model is a combination of a fuzzy logic, artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). While neural networks are low-level Computational structures that perform well dealing with raw data, fuzzy logic deal with reasoning on a higher level by using linguistic information acquired from domain experts. However, fuzzy systems lack the ability to learn and cannot adjust themselves to a new environment. Moreover, experts occasionally make mistakes and thus some rules used in a system may be false. A network type structure of the present hybrid model is a multi-layer feed-forward network, the main part is a fuzzy system based on the first-order Sugeno fuzzy model with a fuzzification and a defuzzification processes. The consequent parameters are determined by least square method. The back-propagation is applied to adjust weights of network. Then, the antecedent parameters of the membership function are updated accordingly by the gradient descent method. The GA was applied to select the fuzzy rule. The hybrid multi-model was used to forecast the flood level at Chiang Mai (under the big flood 2005) and the Koriyama flood (2003) in Japan. The forecasting results are evaluated using standard global goodness of fit statistic, efficient index (EI), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the peak flood error. Moreover, the results are compared to the results of a neuro-genetic model (NGO) and ANFIS model using the same input and output variables. It was found that the hybrid multi-model can be used successfully with an efficiency index (EI) more than 0.95 (for Chiang Mai flood up to 12 h ahead forecasting) and more than 0.90 (for Koriyama flood up to 8 h ahead forecasting). In general, all of three models can predict the water level with satisfactory results. However, the hybrid model gave the best flood peak estimation among the three models. Therefore, the use of fuzzy rule base, which is selected by GA in the hybrid multi-model helps to improve the accuracy of flood peak. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID POST-BLACKENING APPROACH; DISAGGREGATION
AB A nonparametric method for resampling multiseason hydrologic time series is presented. It is based on the idea of rank matching, for simulating univariate time series with strong and/or long-range dependence. The rank matching rule suggests concatenating with higher likelihood those blocks that match at their ends. In the proposed method, termed 'multiseason matched block bootstrap', nonoverlapping within-year blocks of hydrologic data (formed from the observed time series) are conditionally resampled using the rank matching rule. The effectiveness of the method in recovering various statistical attributes, including the dependence structure from finite samples generated from a known population, is demonstrated through a two-level hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation experiment. The method offers enough flexibility to the modeller and is shown to be appropriate for modelling hydrologic data that display strong dependence, nonlinearity and/or multimodality in the time series depicting the hydrologic process. The method is shown to be more efficient than the nonparametric 'k-nearest neighbor bootstrap' method in simulating the monthly streamflows that exhibit a complex dependence structure and bimodal marginal probability density. Even with short block sizes, this bootstrap method is able to predict the drought characteristics reasonably accurately. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper compares a theory for immiscible displacement based on distinguishing percolating and nonpercolating fluid parts with experimental observations from multistep outflow experiments. The theory was published in 2006 in Physica A, volume 371, pages 209-225; the experiments were published in 1991 in Water Resources Research, volume 27, pages 2113. The present paper focuses on hysteretic phenomena resulting from repeated cycling between drainage and imbibition processes in multistep pressure experiments. Taking into account, the hydraulic differences between percolating and nonpercolating fluid parts provides a physical basis to predict quantitatively the hysteretic phenomena observed in the experiment. While standard hysteretic extensions of the traditional theory are nonlocal in time the theory used in this paper is local in time. Instead of storing the pressure and saturation history, it requires only the current state of the system to reach the same quantitative agreement.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PERMEABILITY; MEDIA
AB F. J. Cornaton et al. ( 2008) introduced the concept of lifetime expectancy as a performance measure of the safety of subsurface repositories, on the basis of the travel time for contaminants released at a certain point in the subsurface to reach the biosphere or compliance area. The methodologies are applied to a hypothetical but realistic Canadian Shield crystalline rock environment, which is considered to be one of the most geologically stable areas on Earth. In an approximately 10 x 10 x 1.5 km(3) hypothetical study area, up to 1000 major and intermediate fracture zones are generated from surface lineament analyses and subsurface surveys. In the study area, mean and probability density of lifetime expectancy are analyzed with realistic geologic and hydrologic shield settings in order to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and the numerical model for optimally locating a deep subsurface repository for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. The results demonstrate that, in general, groundwater lifetime expectancy increases with depth and it is greatest inside major matrix blocks. Various sources and aspects of uncertainty are considered, specifically geometric and hydraulic parameters of permeable fracture zones. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the existence and location of permeable fracture zones and the relationship between fracture zone permeability and depth from ground surface are the most significant factors for lifetime expectancy distribution in such a crystalline rock environment. As a consequence, it is successfully demonstrated that the concept of lifetime expectancy can be applied to siting and performance assessment studies for deep geologic repositories in crystalline fractured rock settings.

AB According to the Peruvian agricultural ministry, the Pacific watersheds where the great cities and intense farming are located only benefit from 1% of the available freshwater in Peru. Hence a thorough knowledge of the hydrology of this region is of particular importance. In the paper, analysis of this region and of the two other main Peruvian drainages, the Titicaca and Amazonas are reported. Rainfall and runoff data collected by the Peruvian National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology (SENAMHI) and controlled under the Hydrogeodynamics of the Amazon Basin (HyBAm) project is the basis of this basin-scale study that covers the 1969-2004 period. Beyond the strong contrasting rainfall conditions that differentiate the dry coastal basins and the wet eastern lowlands, details are given about in situ runoff and per basin rainfall distribution in these regions, and about their different altitude-rainfall relationships. Rainfall and runoff variability is strong in the coastal basins at seasonal and inter-annual time scales, and related to extreme El Nino events in the Pacific Ocean. However, rainfall and runoff are more regular in the Andes and Amazonas at the inter-annual time scale. Warm sea-surface temperatures in the northern tropical Atlantic tend to produce drought in the southern Andes basins. Moreover, significant trends and change-points are observed in the runoff data of Amazonas basins where rainfall and runoff decrease, especially after the mid-1980s and during the low-stage season. Almost all the coastal basins show some change in minimum runoff during the last 35 years while no change is observed in rainfall. This means that human activity may have changed runoff in this region of Peru, but this hypothesis deserves more study.

AB The 150-year time series of ice duration in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin was analysed to investigate possible effects of climate variability, and a non-parametric test confirmed a significant, decreasing trend. Singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) and the multi-taper method (MTM) of spectral analysis revealed a nonlinear trend and quasi-periodic oscillations. Analysis of the linearly detrended series showed significant frequencies ranging from quasi biennial to >100 years. The interannual and interdecadal signals detected are within the range of periodicity of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modes of variability. A smoothing procedure was used to separate low frequencies, or trend, and higher frequencies. Four reconstructed components of the low-pass-filtered time series were sufficient to explain 95% of the filtered series variance. The reconstruction showed signals with periods longer than 20 years that could be associated with the PDO. The series showed a relatively constant trend between approximately 1895 and 1965, and a steep declining trend in the last 40 years. Twenty four reconstructed components of the high-frequency residuals were required to explain 90% of the variance in the residual series. The reconstruction showed interdecadal signals that could be associated with the PDO and signals with periods between two and seven years that could be associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Results of a coherence analysis showed that ice-cover duration is significantly correlated with the PDO for periods longer than about 20 years, and with the SOI for periods between two and seven years. The results suggest a relationship between the decreasing ice duration since about 1970 and the accompanying increase in Northern Hemisphere mean annual surface temperature. This interpretation agrees with previous descriptions of observed historic changes that appear to be related to anthropogenic activity.

AB The study of single streamflow recession events is receiving increasing attention following the presentation of novel theoretical explanations for the emergence of power law forms of the recession relationship, and drivers of its variability. Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely used power law recession model. Results are relevant to water-sheds that are relatively steep, forested, and rain-dominated. The highly seasonal mediterranean climate of northern California and southern Oregon ensures study catchments explore a wide range of recession behaviors and wetness states, ideal for a sensitivity analysis. In such catchments, we show the following: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness of fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power-law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices. Considering study results, we recommend a combination of four key methodological decisions to maximize the quality of fitted recession curves, and to minimize bias in the related populations of fitted recession parameters.

AB Aquatic vegetation in fluvial systems is often characterized by spatial patterning of the plant patches. To investigate the conditions for the formation of vegetation patches, we explore the stability of a uniform flow over a non-erodible bed with a uniform vegetation cover of submerged plants. The flow model consists of the two-dimensional shallow water and continuity equations. The hydrodynamic equations are coupled firstly to the classic formulation for vegetation dynamics, and secondly to a modified version of the equation. The revised relationship for vegetation dynamics accounts for the influence of removal, transport, and resettlement of propagules on the growth rate of aquatic vegetation. Linear stability analysis of the eco-hydrodynamic problem is performed by enforcing the quasi-steady approximation. We obtain a dispersion relation disclosing the growth rate and the migration rate of the perturbations of vegetation density as a function of the wavenumber and the relevant flow and vegetation parameters. The present theory predicts the onset of vegetation patterns and includes an adequate wavelength selection mechanism. While uprooting initially reduces plant density, the analysis demonstrates that resettled propagules after removal are fundamental for further plant population increases and the development of vegetation patterns. The proposed framework is then validated against data available in the literature. Additionally, the presence of an upper threshold in terms of vegetation density, above which uniform vegetation cover is stable, might explain the absence of any spatial pattern and thus the extremely dense vegetation cover induced by climate change and invasive species in altered ecosystems.

AB Multi-decadal prediction of estuarine sedimentation with high-fidelity hydromorphodynamic models presents high computation costs, especially when accounting for stochasticity and uncertainty. A StochAstic model for Multi-decadaL Estuarine Sedimentation (SeAMLESS) is formulated here to support a specific decision-need related to resilience planning and coastal management: estimating future sedimentation and dredging within a sedimentation basin for different scenarios of sea level rise and rules for dredging. SeAMLESS combines a reduced dimension process model and a response-surface surrogate model to yield an ordinary differential equation that can be integrated over stochastic time series of storm events. Applications show that SeAMLESS can predict probabilities and amounts of future basin sedimentation and dredging with minimal loss of accuracy, compared to a high-fidelity model, while delivering O(10(4) - 10(5)) reduction in computational costs.

AB The spatial-temporal variation of runoff in an inland basin is very sensitive to climate change. Investigation of runoff change in arid areas is typically limited by lack of meteorological and hydrogeological data. This study focused on runoff change in the Yarkand River source area of the Tarim Basin, China, with the aim of analysing the influence of climate change on the response characteristics of discharge. Sensitivity analysis was introduced to reflect the degree of influence of climate on runoff. Based on the sensitivity factors, over 30 sets of schemes including the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report were simulated using the MIKE 11/NAM rainfall-runoff model and the response of runoff was analysed. The results indicate that there are significant correlations and synchronous fluctuations between runoff and precipitation, evaporation and temperature. The characteristics of the sensitivity of runoff can be fitted well by Bi-Gaussian functions. The functions show that high sensitivity indexes mainly appear in the interval of 165 +/- 100 m(3) s(-1). The influence of precipitation on runoff is greater than that of other climate factors. Through simulation using the NAM model, we found that change of annual runoff was related to the initial climate condition. Annual runoff will have an increasing trend if it has a strong sensitivity to the initial meteorological condition. Moreover, the runoff decreases linearly with evaporation. Also it has a positive relationship with temperature and precipitation. Across the four seasons, the impact in summer and winter is greater than that in spring and autumn. Estimation of the spatial-temporal influence of climate on runoff could provide insight for water resource development in arid areas.

AB Current and forthcoming altimetry satellites provide increasing hydraulic visibility of river surface variabilities. However, due to unobservable river bathymetry and friction, as well as the sampling and quality of remote sensing data, discharge estimation remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new rigorous methodology to estimate stage-fall-discharge laws at any point of a hydrographic network including backwater affected reaches. This methodology is adapted to operational estimation of discharge from multi-mission satellite altimetry data. The cornerstone of the method is to take advantage of meaningful hydraulic signatures, including water surface slopes, simulated by a river network model optimally combined with multi-satellite noisy observations. This optimal combination of heterogeneous multi-source data with a river network model is achieved through variational data assimilation performed using the DassFlow-HiVDI hydraulic model inflowed by MGB regional hydrological model. It is newly applied to the large and complex Negro-Branco River network in the Amazon basin. An effective model is obtained by variational calibration using Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A and -3B altimetry observations between February 2016 and May 2019. A fairly good fit bellow 1 m for 80% of the altimetric observations is obtained. Using this hydrodynamic model as a fine spatio-temporal extrapolator of hydraulic quantities, and in particular of multi-scale water surface slope signatures, the parameters of a general SFD law, as well as the uncertainties estimations, can be constrained at any location within the river network domain using a Bayesian optimization method. This methodology is tested over 4 virtual stations representing various hydraulic complexities. Accurate discharge estimates and meaningful SFD parameters are obtained compared to those of the reference low Froude model at these locations. Analyses are also performed on a reference case with fine-scale bathymetry data of the Garonne River, France. The strength of the method lies in its applicability to noisy multi-satellite data while ensuring physical consistency. It should be applicable in real time to any river basin, using nadir altimetry only or combined to the forthcoming SWOT satellite data. Moreover, the method allows to take full advantage, via the hydrodynamic model, of variable water masks observations and physical segmentations of river networks. The method is implemented in the open source hydrodynamic data assimilation platform DassFlow.

AB The effect of channel size on residence time distributions (RTDs) of solute in rivers is investigated in this paper using tracer test data and the variable residence time (VART) model. Specifically, the investigation focuses on the influence of shear dispersion and hyporheic exchange on the shape of solute RID, and how these two transport processes prevail in larger and smaller streams, respectively, leading to distinct tails of RID. Simulation results show that (1) RTDs are dispersion-dependent and thereby channel-size (scale) dependent. RTDs increasing longitudinal dispersion coefficient. Small streams with negligible dispersion coefficient may display various types of RID from upward curving patterns to a straight line (power-law distributions) and further to downward curving lognormal distributions when plotted in log-log coordinates. Moderate-sized rivers are transitional in terms of RTDs and commonly exhibit lognormal and power-law RTDs; (2) the incorporation of water and solute losses/gains in the VART model can improve simulation results and make parameter values more reasonable; (3) the ratio of time to peak concentration to the minimum mean residence time is equal to the recovery ratio of tracer. The relation provides a simple method for determining the minimum mean residence time; and (4) the VART model is able to reproduce various RTDs observed in rivers with 3-4 fitting parameters while no user-specified RID functions are needed.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID NMC
AB Rational decision making (for flood warning, navigation, or reservoir systems) requires that the total uncertainty about a hydrologic predictand (such as river stage, discharge, or runoff volume) be quantified in terms of a probability distribution, conditional on ail available information and knowledge. Hydrologic knowledge is typically embodied in a deterministic catchment model. Fundamentals are presented of a Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) for producing a probabilistic forecast of a hydrologic predictand via any deterministic catchment model. The BFS decomposes the total uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty, which are quantified independently and then integrated into a predictive (Bayes) distribution. This distribution results from a revision of a prior (climatic) distribution, is well calibrated, and has a nonnegative ex ante economic value. The BFS is compared with Monte Carlo simulation and "ensemble forecasting" technique, none of which can alone produce a probabilistic forecast that meets requirements of rational decision making, but each can serve as a component of the BFS.

AB We aimed to quantify the delayed effects of flows on aquatic ecosystems using 33 years of monitoring data on macroinvertebrates and water quality and 51 years of hydrological data, spanning 2,300 km of the Murray River, Australia. By incorporating the delayed effects of hydrological indices, along with physicochemical variables, into generalized additive models to form distributed lag nonlinear models for macroinvertebrate richness and abundance, we found that the effects of floods on macroinvertebrates could last up to 32 years, depending on their magnitude. The models indicated that a large flood can cause an initial depression in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness, followed by a sustained increase persisting for over 25 years before returning to preflood levels. Twelve hydrological indices representing the magnitude of flow events were evaluated, with the q90/med (the 6-monthly flow exceeded 10% of time, divided by the long-term median) performing (slightly) better than other indices. Competing hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying the apparent long-term effect of floods were considered, with the most plausible explanation being the flood-mediated influx of allochthonous organic matter, especially coarse and large woody debris, that might drive the persistent change in the aquatic community. It is generally believed that macroinvertebrate communities recover quickly after floods, but our findings suggest that we may need to reconceptualize the effects that floods can have on aquatic macroinvertebrates and the communities they support, especially in the context of flow restoration and climate change.
   Plain Language Summary Research is being done around the world to understand how much water is required to sustain river ecosystems, and therefore, how much can be extracted for consumptive uses such as irrigated agriculture. We used long-term monitoring data (1980-2012) on aquatic macroinvertebrates-which includes insects, crustaceans, mussels, snails, and worms that spend all or part of their life in water-collected along 2,300 km of the Murray River, Australia, to investigate the relationship between river flow and the health of aquatic ecosystems. These data indicate that small to medium flows might have an immediate effect through improvements in water quality, but large floods may have sizeable delayed impacts on macroinvertebrates lasting more than three decades. The number of species and overall abundance of macroinvertebrates initially decreased, due to washout, but then increased for a period of about 25 years after the historic flood of 1993, persisting throughout the Millennium drought (1996-2010). The positive legacy of floods might be due to an influx of woody debris during the event, which can provide habitat and food for macroinvertebrates until decomposition of the woody material is complete.

AB Dongjiang water has been the key source of water supplies for Hong Kong and its neighbouring cities in the Pearl River Delta in South China since the mid-1960s. Rapid economic development and population growth in this region have caused serious concerns over the adequacy of the quantity and quality of water withdrawn from the Dongjiang River in the future. Information on the magnitude and frequency of low flows in the basin is needed for planning of water resources at present and in the near future. The L-moment method is used to analyse the regional frequency of low flows, since recent studies have shown that it is superior to other methods that have been used previously, and is now being adopted by many organizations worldwide. In this study, basin-wide analysis of low flows is conducted for Dongjiang basin using five distributions: generalized logistic, generalized extreme value, lognormal, Pearson type III and generalized Pareto. Each of these has three parameters estimated by the L-moment method. The discordancy index and homogeneity testing show that 14 out of the 16 study sites belong to a homogenous region; these are used for further analysis. Based on the L-moment ratios diagram, the Husking and Wallis goodness-of-fit statistical criterion and the L-kurtosis criterion, the three-parameter lognormal distribution is identified as the most appropriate distribution for the homogeneous study region. The regional low-flow estimates for each return period are obtained using the index flood procedure. Examination of the observed and simulated low flows by regional frequency analysis shows a good agreement in general, and the results may satisfy practical application. Furthermore, the regional low-flow relationship between mean annual 7-day low flows and basin area is developed using linear regression, providing a simple and effective method for estimation of low flows of desired return periods for ungauged catchments.

AB Models used for data interpretation of constant-rate tests (CRTs) are commonly derived with the assumption of Darcian flow in an idealized integer flow dimension, where the non-Darcian nature of fluid flow and the complexity of flow geometry are disregarded. In this study, a Forchheimer's law-based analytical model is proposed with the assumption of buildup or drawdown) decomposition for characterizing the non-Darcian flow in a generalized radial formation where the flow dimension n may become non-integer. The proposed model immediately reduces to Barker's 1988) model for Darcian flow in the generalized radial formation and to Mathias et al.' s 2008) model for non-Darcian flow in a two-dimensional confined aquifer. A comparison with numerical simulations shows that the proposed model behaves well at late times for flow dimension n > 1.5. The proposed model is finally applied for data interpretation of the constant-rate pumping tests performed at Ploemeur Le Borgne et al., 2004), showing that the intrinsic hydraulic conductivity of formations will be underestimated and the specific storage will be overestimated if the non-Darcian effect is ignored. The proposed model is an extension of the generalized radial flow GRF) model based on Forchheimer's law, which would be of significance for data interpretation of CRTs in aquifers of complex flow geometry in which non-Darcian flow occurs.

AB The process of burial and exhumation of bedload particles within a certain depth of the riverbed leads to vertical exchange of particles, which significantly affects the characteristics of streamwise bedload transport. In this paper, we revisit the classic active layer formulation and extend it by incorporating the burial and exhumation through conceptualizing the fluctuations of bed surface as the relative vertical movement of buried tracer particles in the substrate layer (i.e., we change the static reference system to the fluctuating riverbed surface). We theoretically demonstrate, for the first time, the emergence of the transient anomalous diffusion (both superdiffusion and subdiffusion) and power-law advective slowdown at the intermediate timescales, which are induced by the nonequilibrium transport as characterized by the inhomogeneous vertical mixing of tracers due to particle burial and exhumation. Neglecting the ballistic regime at extremely short times, at small and large timescales, the transport regimes show normal diffusion. This result further implies that for the most typical fluvial riverbed with finite vertical exchange depth (i.e. nonaggrading or nondegrading bed), the subdiffusion of bedload tracers for large timescale transport may still be transient, which will eventually converge to the normal diffusion as time increases. Comparing the obtained analytical solutions with available numerical results as well as field observations, we show that the proposed formulation can capture well anomalous diffusion and the power-law slowdown of the advective velocity of bedload tracers at intermediate timescales, and more importantly the transition from anomalous to normal diffusion at large timescales.

AB The current theory for defining the occurrence of riparian lenses (i.e., buoyant, lenticular-shaped fresh groundwater bodies overlying saline groundwater in riparian zones) is largely based on steady-state analyses, which neglect the transient dynamics expected in real-world settings. In this study, the transience of riparian lens movement is investigated for the first time, considering a fully penetrating, gaining river (i.e., the river receives groundwater influxes), and rapid variations in hydraulic boundary conditions. Controlled laboratory experiments and numerical modeling are used to determine the timescales associated with lens movements. Both numerical and experimental timescales show asymmetric behavior in the growth and decline of lenses, whereby growing lenses involve longer timescales than those of shrinking lenses. Inverse relationships between timescales and final hydraulic gradients are observed, such that higher final hydraulic gradients involved shorter timescales. Results also revealed a time lag in the movement of the lens tip (i.e., where the lens and water table intersect) relative to the lens toe (i.e., intersection of the lens with the riverbank). Riparian lenses have near-identical timescales regardless of whether the river water or aquifer hydraulic head varies, and rather, timescales are more sensitive to the final hydraulic gradient. Application of typical parameter ranges for the River Murray (South Australia) floodplains reveals timescales of years to more than a decade to expand the riparian lens by tens of meters. Insights into riparian lenses transience attained from the current study build on the understanding of transience obtained for other mixed-convective hydrogeological processes, such as seawater intrusion and retreat.

AB Most past experimental investigations of flow over river dunes have focused on conditions that match semiempirical flow-depth scaling laws, yet such equilibrium conditions are of limited value because they rarely occur in natural channels. This paper quantifies the structure of mean and turbulent flow over fixed 2-D laboratory dunes across a range of nonequilibrium conditions within the dune flow regime. The flow field was quantified using 2-D particle imaging velocimetry for 12 conditions, including flows that are too deep, too shallow, too fast, or too slow for the size of the fixed dunes. The results demonstrate major departures in the patterns of the mean flow and structure of turbulence when compared to dunes formed under equilibrium flow conditions. The length of flow reattachment scales linearly with the ratio of mean depth-averaged streamwise velocity to shear velocity at the dune crest ((U) over bar (c) / u*c), which provides a new predictive measure for flow reattachment length. Depth-averaged vertical velocities at the dune crest ((V) over bar (c)) show a parabolic relationship with (U) over bar (c), peaking at (U) over bar (c) similar to 0.60 m/s, which matches the relationship of dune aspect ratio with transport stage present in mobile bed conditions. The spatial location of the turbulent wake was found to vary with flow depth and velocity, with lower Uc and greater flow depths causing the wake to rise toward the free surface. Deeper flows are likely to show less flow convergence over the crests of dunes due to reduced interaction of turbulence with the free surface, resulting in a reduction of transport stage. Plain Language Summary This piece of research expands our description of how rivers flow over dunes on a river bed. Most of the scientific communities' research to date has used unnaturally steady conditions to measure how water moves over dunes. Yet these flow conditions are not strictly true to the variety of conditions nature produces, most importantly during floods. This research is the first detailed description of a wide range of flow states over dunes and changes our present understanding of the structure of flow over dunes in rivers. Consequently, the scientific community will be able to use this new information to better model and simulate how rivers work, how they flood, and how they transport sediment toward the world's deltas.

AB The trends in hydrological and climatic time series data of Urmia Lake basin in Iran were examined using the four different versions of the Mann-Kendall (MK) approach: (i) the original MK test; (ii) the MK test considering the effect of lag-1 autocorrelation; (iii) the MK test considering the effect of all autocorrelation or sample size; and (iv) the MK test considering the Hurst coefficient. Identification of hydrological and climatic data trends was carried out at monthly and annual time scales for 25 temperature, 35 precipitation and 35 streamflow gauging stations selected from the Urmia Lake basin. Mann-Kendall and Pearson tests were also applied to explore the relationships between temperature, precipitation and streamflow trends. The results show statistically significant upward and downward trends in the annual and monthly hydrological and climatic variables. The upward trends in temperature, unlike streamflow, are much more pronounced than the downward trends, but for precipitation the behaviour of trend is different on monthly and annual time scales. Furthermore, the trend results were affected by the different approaches. Specifically, the number of stations showing trends in hydrological and climatic variables decreased significantly (up to 50%) when the fourth test was considered instead of the first and the absolute value of the Z statistic for most of the time series was reduced. The results of correlations between streamflow and climatic variables showed that the streamflow in Urmia Lake basin is more sensitive to changes in temperature than those of precipitation. The observed decreases in streamflow and increases in temperature in the Urmia Lake basin in recent decades may thus have serious implications for water resources management under the warming climate with the expected population growth and increased freshwater consumption in this region.

AB Typically the spreading length-scale in a diffusion process increases in time as approximate to tn,n=12. In the presence of spatial heterogeneities, however, so-called anomalous diffusion can occur, here the time exponent n12. The objective of this paper is to present a numerical simulation that directly demonstrates the link between spacial heterogeneity and anomalous diffusion. The simulation is of the infiltration of a fluid into a horizontal unit area Hele-Shaw cell in which the permeability at specified locations, laid out as a Sierpinski fractal carpet pattern, can differ from the nominal value K=1. When there is no permeability contrast, the fluid infiltration has a diffusion-like behavior, i.e., the filled plan-form area increases in time as F=Atn,n=12. When there is a permeability contrast, however, although the evolution of infiltration still follows a power law, anomalous behavior is observed; subdiffusive (n<12) when K<1 and superdiffusive (n>12) when K>1. These anomalous behaviors persist, even when the permeability contrast is only imposed over the largest sized fractal pattern element. But, if the pattern over which the permeability contrast is imposed has a subdomain length scale (obtained by filling in the largest sized element in the Sierpinski carpet with the smaller sized elements), normal diffusion n=12 behavior is recovered. In the special case that the imposed permeability in the pattern elements is K<<1, an approximate model, directly relating the coefficient and exponent in the infiltration power law to the porosity and fractal dimension of the carpet pattern, is derived and validated.

AB In this Commentary, we argue that it is possible to improve the physical realism of hydrologic models by making better use of existing hydrologic theory. We address the following questions: (1) what are some key elements of current hydrologic theory; (2) how can those elements best be incorporated where they may be missing in current models; and (3) how can we evaluate competing hydrologic theories across scales and locations? We propose that hydrologic science would benefit from a model-based community synthesis effort to reframe, integrate, and evaluate different explanations of hydrologic behavior, and provide a controlled avenue to find where understanding falls short.

AB In the semi-arid Mediterranean climate of the Maghreb region, Algeria, the intensity and high variability of rainfall contribute to soil erosion that feeds the sediment load of the wadis, which, in turn, is a factor in the rapid silting-up of reservoirs. The temporal variability of solid and liquid flows, an important characteristic in Mediterranean regions, is the subject of this research, which focuses on the Wadi Bouhamdane in eastern Algeria. Since December 1987, the wadi flowsrecorded by the gauging station (1105 km(2)) since September 1969have been regulated by the Hammam Debagh Dam, located immediately upstream of the station (1070 km(2)). The study involved the treatment of a long time series of suspended sediment concentration and water flow data, together with daily water discharge data recorded at the dam site. A power function describing the relationship between the instantaneous suspended sediment loads and the instantaneous water flow was used to estimate daily suspended sediment discharge of two series (1969-1987 and 1995-2010), recorded, respectively, at the outlet of the basin (gauging station) and at the dam site. The results show a moderate mean annual specific suspended sediment flux (257 t km(-2) year(-1)), but high inter-annual variability characterizes the specific suspended sediment (TSS = 0.5 and 1396 t km(-2) year(-1) in 1996/97 and 2004/05, respectively), which increases significantly in the season of high streamflow. Thus, floods generate large quantities of sediment that represent a significant proportion of the annual total and monthly specific degradation throughout the basin. The comparative approach shows that the sediment flux estimated by concentration measurements at the wadi gauging station (0.22-0.29 hm(3) year(-1)) does not represent the entire volume of silting of the dam (0.98 hm(3) year(-1) on average), identified using bathymetry. This second method includes bedload and other inputs of sediment that are very difficult to measure.

ID SATURATION RELATIONSHIPS; INFILTRATION
AB Causes and effects of non-uniqueness in capillary pressure and saturation (P-c-S) relationship in porous media are of considerable concern to researchers of two-phase flow. In particular, a significant amounts of discussion have been generated regarding a parameter termed as dynamic coefficient (tau) which has been proposed for inclusion in the functional dependence of P-c-S relationship to quantify dynamic P-c and its relation with time derivative of saturation. While the dependence of the coefficient on fluid and porous media properties is less controversial, its relation to domain scale appears to be dependent on artefacts of experiments, mathematical models and the intra-domain averaging techniques. In an attempt to establish the reality of the scale dependency of the tau-S relationships, we carry out a series of well-defined laboratory experiments to determine tau-S relationships using three different sizes of cylindrical porous domains of silica sand. In this paper, we present our findings on the scale dependence of tau and its relation to high viscosity ratio (mu(r)) silicone oil-water system, where mu(r) is defined as the viscosity of non-wetting phase over that of the wetting phase. An order of magnitude increase in the value of tau was observed across various mu(r) and domain scales. Also, an order of magnitude increase in tau is observed when tau at the top and the bottom sections in a domain are compared. Viscosity ratio and domain scales are found to have similar effects on the trend in tau-S relationship. We carry out a dimensional analysis of tau which shows how different variables, e.g., dimensionless tau and dimensionless domain volume (scale), may be correlated and provides a means to determine the influences of relevant variables on tau. A scaling relationship for tau was derived from the dimensionless analysis which was then validated against independent literature data. This showed that the tau-S relationships obtained from the literature and the scaling relationship match reasonably well. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intercomparison of surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) exchange fluxes at the regional scale is rarely undertaken, mainly because estimates are method and scale-dependent and usually associated with large errors. In the present study, we compare SW-GW exchange fluxes calculated from a multitracer mass balance in the river, an application of Darcy's law using near-river piezometers and a surface-subsurface flow model calibrated at the catchment scale. SW-GW exchange fluxes are estimated for 7 km long reaches along the 140 km long Campaspe River, a tributary of the Murray River, Australia. Differences are found in the directions and magnitudes of the exchange fluxes estimated by the different methods. The application of Darcy's law in near-river piezometers seems the most appropriate method to infer SW-GW flow directions and temporal variability. The tracer mass balance is limited to gaining reaches but gives quantitative estimates of the fluxes. While numerical models should overcome deficiencies associated with some of the intrinsic assumptions of the two field-methods, the regional-scale calibration is subject to high uncertainties in the simulated heads near the river, resulting in uncertainty of SW-GW exchange fluxes. In particular, we show that loosely quantified river abstractions and irrigation patterns directly impact the simulated SW-GW fluxes. In gaining reaches, additional river chemistry data improved model calibration and SW-GW flux estimates. While numerical models are crucial for water management, their reliability to estimate SW-GW fluxes can be limited by their complexity and lacking data availability. Therefore, we recommend comparing numerical model results with easily implemented field-based methods.

AB To reflect the uncertainties of a hydrological model in simulating and forecasting observed discharges according to rainfall inputs, the estimated result for each time step should not be just a point estimate (a single numerical value), but should be expressed as a prediction interval, i.e. a band defined by the prediction bounds of a particular confidence level a. How best to assess the quality of the prediction bounds thus becomes very important for understanding the modelling uncertainty in a comprehensive and objective way. This paper focuses on seven indices for characterizing the prediction bounds from different perspectives. For the three case-study catchments presented, these indices are calculated for the prediction bounds generated by the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method for various threshold values. In addition, the relationships among these indices are investigated, particularly that of the containing ratio (CR) to the other indices. In this context, three main findings are obtained for the prediction bounds estimated by GLUE. Firstly, both the average band-width and the average relative band-width are seen to have very strong linear correlations with the CR index. Secondly, a high CR value, a narrow band-width, and a high degree of symmetry with respect to the observed hydrograph, all of which are clearly desirable properties of the prediction bounds estimated by the uncertainty assessment methods, cannot all be achieved simultaneously. Thirdly, for the prediction bounds considered, the higher CR values and the higher degrees of symmetry with respect to the observed hydrograph are found to be associated with both the larger band-widths and the larger deviation amplitudes. It is recommended that a set of different indices, such as those considered in this study, be employed for assessing and comparing the prediction bounds in a more comprehensive and objective way.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component in terrestrial climate and vegetation interactions. A generalized complementary relationship proposed by Brutsaert (2015); Brutsaert et al. (2020) has been shown to be a powerful tool for ET estimation. As the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship, it is generally accepted that alpha(c) has high spatial variability and is closely correlated to the land-surface conditions. However, understanding of the temporal variability in alpha(c) is also important in a changing environment. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change and revegetation on ET by establishing the relationship between alpha(c) and the climatic-vegetation factors in 14 catchments of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that alpha(c) presented both spatial and temporal variability, where the aridity index (AI) and the average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the growing season are two dominant factors that control the variability in alpha(c). Furthermore, combing the generalized complementary relationship and the empirical model of alpha(c) proposed in this study, the impacts of climate change and revegetation on the ET increase were quantified in the Loess Plateau. The results show that climate change (mainly expressed by an increase in precipitation) contributed the most to the ET increase (approximately 68% on average), whereas revegetation (quantified by the NDVI increase) also played a dominant role (approximately 32% on average) in the ET increase, which suggests that revegetation planning management should pay more attention to the increased water consumption by evapotranspiration in the sustainable economic and ecological development of the Loess Plateau.

AB In this paper, we study the influence of sample geometry on the measurement of pressure-saturation relationships, by analyzing the drainage of a two-phase flow from a quasi-2-D random porous medium. The medium is transparent, which allows for the direct visualization of the invasion pattern during flow, and is initially saturated with a viscous liquid (a dyed glycerol-water mix). As the pressure in the liquid is gradually reduced, air penetrates from an open inlet, displacing the liquid which leaves the system from an outlet on the opposite side. Pressure measurements and images of the flow are recorded and the pressure-saturation relationship is computed. We show that this relationship depends on the system size and aspect ratio. The effects of the system's boundaries on this relationship are measured experimentally and compared with simulations produced using an invasion percolation algorithm. The pressure build up at the beginning and end of the invasion process are particularly affected by the boundaries of the system whereas at the central part of the model (when the air front progresses far from these boundaries), the invasion happens at a statistically constant capillary pressure. These observations have led us to propose a much simplified pressure-saturation relationship, valid for systems that are large enough such that the invasion is not influenced by boundary effects. The properties of this relationship depend on the capillary pressure thresholds distribution, sample dimensions, and average pore connectivity and its applications may be of particular interest for simulations of two-phase flow in large porous media.

AB Drought prediction for in many regions of the world has critical importance for strategic planning agriculture and water management. The occurrence of droughts cannot be predicted with certainty and thus must be treated as random variables. It is the main purpose of this paper to develop a new concept of drought features assessments based on triple drought related hydrometeorological and meteorological variables, namely, rainfall, solar irradiation and sunshine duration. Equal standard rainfall lines are drawn as a map with two reference variables as solar irradiation and sunshine duration. These are referred to as the triple graphical method (TGM) approach. It furnishes rich features of drought behaviour variation based on the rainfall, solar irradiation and sunshine duration. This analysis and the solar irradiation estimation method are applied to seven climatologically different stations in the Republic of Turkey for the monthly data period 1982-1991. The linear relations between drought and the variables of the Angstrom equation are found between 55% and 94% without Trabzon. Drought and Angstrom equation parameters are estimated by the proposed methodology. Relations between monthly drought and Angstrom equation variables are presented by the triple solar-drought graphical method. TGM provides information about the drought occurrences for different combinations of solar irradiation and sunshine duration. TGM graphs help to identify not only precipitation surplus (wet spells) or deficits (dry spells droughts) but also their variations with two more meteorological variables as solar irradiation and sunshine duration.

AB This paper develops the one-dimensional large-deformation consolidation theory for the porous medium under alternating saturated-unsaturated conditions, through a former generalization of the well-established Gibson's nonlinear theory from saturated to unsaturated regime. With the differential relations between the coordinate systems, the equations governing the momentum\mass balances in the unsaturated porous stratum are transported from the moving current to the initial Lagrangian coordinate system. Without loss of generality, the collective forms of various incremental constitutive laws are then incorporated for unsaturated materials, indicating that any particular constitutive law has been embraced. Two forms of final governing equations are derived depending on the primary independents: sigma v - uw (total vertical stress - pore fluid pressure) and w (gravimetric water content); which are solved by two distinct finite-element codes on the initial fixed configuration. Numerical examples demonstrate that the two resulting Total Lagrangian formulations are equivalent, yield virtually identical predictions and agrees well with an existing finite-differential code that solves the equations in the convective configuration. The dynamical consolidation process evolving from a weight-driven saturated stage to an evaporation-driven unsaturated stage is quantitatively captured very well by the predictions. The impacts of evaporation, material's compressibility, and permeability in these two distinct stages are independently explored through several parametric analyses on the consolidation/dewatering rates and the penetration of drying front. Through one factor must affect, in concert with the others, such a hydro-mechanical coupling process, these results can provide a profound understanding of the entire consolidation process of a porous stratum under large deformations.

AB Many processes lead to variability of catchment concentration-discharge relationships, but exports of geogenic (weathering derived) solutes and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus species) from agricultural basins display relatively constant concentrations despite large variations in streamflow. These "chemostatic" responses are hypothesized to arise when a large mass store, the parent material for geogenics or chemically recalcitrant legacies of fertilization in agricultural catchments, buffers concentration variability. This hypothesis implies that (1) chemostatic behavior should be a general response to elevated external inputs to a catchment and (2) chemostatic behavior should be predictable from theory. Data- and model-based analyses were used to explore these hypotheses. We evaluated concentration variability relative to discharge (expressed as the ratio of the coefficients of variation of concentration and flow, or CVC/CVQ) across a gradient of increasing exported load, as a proxy for an external impact gradient. The CVC/CVQ of multiple solutes declined with increasing exported load. Exceptions included the geogenic solutes, which showed chemostatic responses for all sites, phosphorus, and some nitrogen species. Nitrate showed a suggestive pattern in CVC/CVQ with export, but further data are needed to confirm its generality. A simple model of runoff generation and solute export suggested that the decline in CVC/CVQ arises if the internal mass store is distributed homogeneously in space and there is sufficient time for mass transfer to reach steady state between runoff events. Export from catchments may become more predictable in impacted watersheds, simplifying water quality prediction but inducing strong hysteresis in recovery and making restoration efforts challenging.

AB Hydro-mechanical properties of rock fractures are core issues for many geoscience and geo-engineering practices. Previous experimental and numerical studies have revealed that shear processes could greatly enhance the permeability of single rock fractures, yet the shear effects on hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses have received little attention. In most previous fracture network models, single fractures are typically presumed to be formed by parallel plates and flow is presumed to obey the cubic law. However, related studies have suggested that the parallel plate model cannot realistically represent the surface characters of natural rock fractures, and the relationship between flow rate and pressure drop will no longer be linear at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In the present study, a numerical approach was established to assess the effects of shear on the hydraulic properties of 2-D discrete fracture networks (DFNs) in both linear and nonlinear regimes. DFNs considering fracture surface roughness and variation of aperture in space were generated using an originally developed code DFNGEN. Numerical simulations by solving Navier-Stokes equations were performed to simulate the fluid flow through these DFNs. A fracture that cuts through each model was sheared and by varying the shear and normal displacements, effects of shear on equivalent permeability and nonlinear flow characteristics of DFNs were estimated. The results show that the critical condition of quantifying the transition from a linear flow regime to a nonlinear flow regime is: 10(-4) < J < 10(-3), where J is the hydraulic gradient. When the fluid flow is in a linear regime (i. e., J < 10(-4)), the relative deviation of equivalent permeability induced by shear, delta(2), is linearly correlated with J with small variations, while for fluid flow in the nonlinear regime (J > 10(-3)), delta(2) is nonlinearly correlated with J. A shear process would reduce the equivalent permeability significantly in the orientation perpendicular to the sheared fracture as much as 53.86% when J = 1, shear displacement D-s = 7 mm, and normal displacement D-n = 1 mm. By fitting the calculated results, the mathematical expression for delta(2) is established to help choose proper governing equations when solving fluid flow problems in fracture networks.

AB Annual patterns in climate parameters were studied to evaluate how these influence the quality of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimates obtained from the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) equation, since the method only uses the measured temperature directly. The work evaluates how these patterns can be used to improve the HS ETo estimates. Ten-year moving averages from a set of California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) stations were used to evaluate the relationships between solar radiation (R-s), temperature (T) and ETo. The results indicate that T treads behind solar radiation and its value peaks some 25 days later. Thus, the main irrigation season in the Mediterranean climate (1 May-30 September) can be divided into three phases: increasing R-s and T; decreasing R-s with increasing T; and decreasing R-s and T. Non-univocal annual cycles were observed between R-s and T, ETo and R-s, and ETo and T. These annual patterns result in important seasonal changes in the ratio between the HS and Penman-Monteith (FAO PM) ETo estimates. The changes are particularly important during the irrigation season, where the FAO PM initially calculates greater ETo values than the HS methodology, and from the end of May to early September, where the HS equation overestimates the ETo values (by 17mm, or 3%). These patterns obtained from 2000-2009 data were used to calibrate and improve HS ETo estimates at new sites for the 2010-2011 period. Calibration based on the proposed seasonal region-wide FAO PM/HS ETo ratios improved both the bias (decreased from 0.40 to 0.36mm d(-1)) and r(2) (increased from 0.67 to 0.87) of the ETo estimates for the irrigation season. The proposed methodology can be easily applied to other regions, even when the existing weather stations are sparse.

AB An understanding soil moisture spatio-temporal variability is essential for hydrological and meteorological research. This work aims at evaluating the spatio-temporal variability of near surface soil moisture and assessing dominant meteorological factors that influence spatial variability over the Korean peninsula from May 1 to September 29, 2011. The results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for goodness of fit showed that all applied distributions (normal, log-normal and generalized extreme value: GEV) were appropriate for the datasets and the GEV distribution described best spatial soil moisture patterns. The relationship between the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of soil moisture with mean soil moisture contents showed an upper convex shape and an exponentially negative pattern, respectively. Skewness exhibited a decreasing pattern with increasing mean soil moisture contents and kurtosis exhibited the U-shaped relationship. In this regional scale (99,720 km(2)), we found that precipitation indicated temporally stable features through an ANOVA test considering the meteorological (i.e. precipitation, insolation, air temperature, ground temperature and wind speed) and physical (i.e. soil texture, elevation, topography, and land use) factors. Spatial variability of soil moisture affected by the meteorological forcing is shown as result of the relationship between the meteorological factors (precipitation, insolation, air temperature and ground temperature) and the standard deviation of relative difference of soil moisture contents (SDRDt) which implied the spatial variability of soil moisture. The SDRDt showed a positive relationship with the daily mean precipitation, while a negative relationship with insolation, air temperature and ground temperature. The variation of spatial soil moisture pattern is more sensitive to change in ground temperature rather than air temperature changes. Therefore, spatial variability of soil moisture is greatly affected by meteorological factors and each of the meteorological factors has certain duration of effect on soil moisture spatial variability in regional scale.
   The results provide an insight into the soil moisture spatio-temporal patterns affected by meteorological and physical factors simultaneously, as well as the design criteria of regional soil moisture monitoring network at regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous time random walk (CTRW) has both an elegant mathematical theory and a successful record at modeling solute transport in the subsurface. However, there are some interpretation ambiguities relating to the relationship between the discrete CTRW transition distributions and the underlying continuous movement of solute that have not been addressed in existing literature. These include the exact definition of "transition'', and the extent to which transition probability distributions are unique/quantifiable from data. Here, we present some theoretical results which address these uncertainties in systems with an advective bias. Simultaneously, we present an alternative, reduced parameter CTRW formulation for general advective transport in heterogeneous porous media, which models early- and late-time transport by use of random transition times between sparse, imaginary planes normal to flow. We show that even in the context of this reduced-parameter formulation there is nonuniqueness in the definitions of both transition lengths and waiting time distributions, and that neither may be uniquely determined from experimental data. For practical use of this formulation, we suggest Pareto transition time distributions, leading to a two-degree-of-freedom modeling approach. We then demonstrate the power of this approach in fitting two sets of existing experimental data. While the primary focus is the presentation of new results, the discussion is designed to be pedagogical and to provide a good entry point into practical modeling of solute transport with the CTRW.

   Times Versus Residence Times

AB The rate of biogeochemical processing associated with natural degradation and transformation processes in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is one of the largest uncertainties in predicting nutrient fluxes. We present a lumped parameter model that can be used to quantify the mass loss for nitrate in the HZ operating at the scale of river reaches to the entire catchments. The model is based on using exposure times (ET) to account for the effective timescales of reactive transport in the HZ. Reach scale ET distributions are derived by removing the portion of hyporheic residence times (RT) associated with flow through the oxic zone. The model was used to quantify nitrate removal for two scenarios: (1) a 100 m generic river reach and (2) a small agricultural catchment in Brittany (France). For the field site, hyporheic RT were derived from measured in-stream 222Rn activities and mass balance modeling. Simulations were carried out using different types of RT distributions (exponential, power law, and gamma-type) for which ET were derived. Mass loss of nitrate in the HZ for the field site ranged from 0 to 0.45 kg day-1 depending on the RT distribution and the availability of oxygen in the streambed sediments. Simulations with power law ET distribution models only show very little removal of nitrate due to the heavy weighting toward shorter flow paths that are confined to the oxic sediments. Based on the simulation results, we suggest that using ET will likely lead to more realistic estimates for nutrient removal in river and stream networks.

AB Water rights law and corresponding markets exist to promote economic water resource use efficiency by permitting water rights holders to trade allocations. In some regions, hydrologic uncertainty drives annual assignment of per-water right allocation values. Water rights holders, specifically those involved in agricultural production, may use collaborative water resource decision making to mitigate allocation uncertainty and promote economic and social efficiency. Such is the case in semi-arid North Chile, where interactions between representative farmer groups, treated as resource competitive growers' cooperatives, and modeled at water market-scale, can provide both price and water right allocation distribution signals for unregulated, temporary water right markets. For the range of feasible per-water right allocation values, a coupled agricultural-economic model is developed to describe the equilibrium distribution of water, the corresponding market price of water rights, and the net surplus generated by collaboration between competing agricultural uses. A static, demand-based allocation redistribution ruleset is generated by which the cooperatives are constrained to abide. Water right supply and demand inequality impacts at the market-scale are used to characterize market performance under existing water rights law, and to evaluate the efficacy of intercooperative collaboration over the period 2000-2015. Exclusive intercooperative water trading, following a demand-based ruleset, produces joint mean annual expected profits 24%-122% larger than a case of no-interaction, depending on initial rights distribution. The broader insights of this research suggest that water rights holders engaged in agriculture can achieve enhanced benefits by forming crop-type cooperatives and implementing demand-based allocation redistribution rulesets.

AB The relationship between evaporative fraction (EF) and soil moisture (SM) has traditionally been used in atmospheric and land-surface modeling communities to determine the coupling strength between land surfaces and the atmosphere in the context of the dominant evaporation regime (energy or moisture limited). However, observation-based analyses suggest that EF-SM relationship in a given region can shift subject to other environmental factors, potentially influencing the determination of the dominant evaporation regime. This implies more complex dependencies embedded in the conventional EF-SM relationship and that in fact it is a multidimensional function. In this study, we develop a generalized EF framework that explicitly accounts for dependencies on other environmental conditions. We show that large scatter in observed EF-SM relationships is primarily due to the projection of variations in other dimensions and propose a normalization of the EF-SM relationship accounting for the dimensions and dependencies not included in the conventional relationship. In this first study, we focus on bare soil conditions in order to establish the basic theoretical framework. The new generalized EF framework provides new insights into the origin of transition between energy-limited and moisture-limited evaporation regimes (marked by a critical SM), linked to soil type and meteorological input data (primarily wind speed and air temperature, but not solar radiation) dominating the evolution of land surface temperature and thus the relative efficiency of surface energy balance components during surface drying. Our results offer new opportunities to advance predictive capabilities quantifying land-atmosphere coupling for a wide range of present and projected meteorological input data.

AB A power-law extension of the gamma distribution is proposed as a general memory function for capturing rate limitations of retention in groundwater transport. Using moments, we show how the new memory function can be reduced to most other forms available in the literature, exactly or approximately. The proposed formulation is suitable for field scale or laboratory scale transport modeling. Rate limitation effects are illustrated for solute transport by considering the fractional mass release over a given transport scale. The equilibrium and no-retention cases set bounds for contaminant attenuation, between which the impact of rate limitations is clearly exposed.

AB Incorporating hysteresis into models is important to accurately capture the two phase flow behavior when porous media systems undergo cycles of drainage and imbibition such as in the cases of injection and post-injection redistribution of CO2 during geological CO2 storage (GCS). In the traditional model of two-phase flow, existing constitutive models that parameterize the hysteresis associated with these processes are generally based on the empirical relationships. This manuscript presents development and testing of mathematical hysteretic capillary pressuresaturationrelative permeability models with the objective of more accurately representing the redistribution of the fluids after injection. The constitutive models are developed by relating macroscopic variables to basic physics of two-phase capillary displacements at pore-scale and void space distribution properties. The modeling approach with the developed constitutive models with and without hysteresis as input is tested against some intermediate-scale flow cell experiments to test the ability of the models to represent movement and capillary trapping of immiscible fluids under macroscopically homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. The hysteretic two-phase flow model predicted the overall plume migration and distribution during and post injection reasonably well and represented the postinjection behavior of the plume more accurately than the nonhysteretic models. Based on the results in this study, neglecting hysteresis in the constitutive models of the traditional two-phase flow theory can seriously overpredict or underpredict the injected fluid distribution during post-injection under both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions, depending on the selected value of the residual saturation in the nonhysteretic models.

AB The relationship between leaf water potential, transpiration rate and soil water potential is complex, particularly when the soil water potential in the root zone is not uniform, which is the rule rather than the exception in soils. Our objectives were: 1) to measure the effect of heterogeneous soil water potentials on the relation between leaf water potential and transpiration rate and 2) to test whether root water uptake models could predict this relation. To this end, we combined the root pressure chamber technique, which allows measuring the suction in the leaves of transpiring plants, with two models of root water uptake, a simple one where soil and roots are presented as resistances in series and a more detailed 3D root architecture model. The experiments were carried out with lupines grown in sandy soil, for which the root architecture and root hydraulic properties had been previously estimated. The soil was partitioned in two layers separated by a coarse sand layer that allowed the roots to grow through but limited the water redistribution between the layers. Three scenarios (wet-wet, dry-wet, dry-dry) were tested. The results showed that the relation between transpiration and leaf water potential was linear in all scenarios. As the upper soil layer severely dried, the conductance of the soil-plant system decreased by ca. 1.65 times compared to the conductance of the plant-soil system in a uniform wet soil. As both layers dried, the conductivity was 8.26 times lower compared to the uniform-wet case. The combination of the experiment and modelling showed that a simple model is capable to reproduce the relation between transpiration, leaf water potential and soil water potential (despite an offset in the leaf water potential). Both simplified and the 3D root architecture models were capable of reproducing the measured changes in hydraulic conductance of the plantsoil system due to the soil drying. However, both models overestimated the measured leaf water potential by 0.1 MPa, probably because of a gradient in osmotic potential between the xylem and the soil. The simulations predicted the occurrence of hydraulic lift, even at day time conditions, although the hydraulic lift was relatively more important at low transpiration rates. The simulation suggested that a root architecture model is needed to estimate the variations of water uptake along the individual roots and this might be crucial to properly model hydraulic lift.

AB [ 1] Current stream tracer techniques do not allow separation of in-channel dead zone ( e. g., eddies) and out-of-channel ( hyporheic) transient storage, yet this separation is important to understanding stream biogeochemical processes. We characterize in-channel transient storage with a rhodamine WT solute tracer experiment in a 304 m cascade-pool-type bedrock reach with no hyporheic zone. We compare the solute breakthrough curve ( BTC) from this reach to that of an adjacent 367 m alluvial reach with significant hyporheic exchange. In the bedrock reach, transient storage has an exponential residence time distribution with a mean residence time of 3.0 hours and a ratio of transient storage to stream volume of 0.14, demonstrating that at moderate discharge, bedrock in-channel storage zones provide a small volume of transient storage with substantial residence time. In the alluvial reach, though pools are similar in size to those in the bedrock reach, transient storage has a power law residence time distribution with a mean residence time of > 100 hours ( estimated at nearly 1200 hours) and a ratio of storage to stream volume of 105. Because the in-channel hydraulics of bedrock reaches are simpler than alluvial step-pool reaches, the bedrock results are probably a lower end-member with respect to volume and residence time, though they demonstrate that in-channel storage may be appreciable in some reaches. These results suggest that in-stream dead zone transient storage may be accurately simulated by exponential RTDs but that hyporheic exchange is better simulated with a power law RTD as a consequence of more complicated flow path and exchange dynamics.

AB Groundwater and accompanying heat fluxes are particularly relevant for aquatic habitats as they influence living conditions both within the river and streambed. This study focuses on the theory and the development of new equations to estimate conduction and advection heat fluxes into and out of the bed, correcting some earlier misunderstandings and adding parameterizations that extend our understanding of timing of heat fluxes. The new heat flux equations are illustrated using Catamaran Brook (New Brunswick, Canada) stream/streambed temperature data. We show important relationships between fluxes when the surface water temperature (1) follows a sinusoidal function superimposed on a steady state condition (constant deep streambed temperature) and (2) when sinusoidal variations in stream temperature at two frequencies (annual and diel) are superimposed. When the stream temperature is used as a prescribed boundary condition, the contribution of bed fluid fluxes to stream temperature occurs through the effects of conductive thermal gradients, not through direct contribution/mixing of cold/warm water. Boundary conditions can be modified, however, to account for direct contribution of cold/warm water (e.g., localized upwelling) and consequences for the conduction heat flux. Equations developed allow for prediction of conductive fluxes to the bed during summer driven by diel and annual temperature fluctuations of the stream water and good agreement was observed between analytic solutions and field data. Results from this study provide a better insight into groundwater and heat fluxes which will ultimately result in better stream temperature models and a better management of fisheries resources.

AB This study attempts to identify relationships between suitable conceptual rainfall-runoff model structures and catchment types, and demonstrates an objective procedure for selection of model structures for use in model regionalisation studies. 12 conceptual model structures have been tested on 28 UK catchments. The model structures are combinations of three soil moisture accounting modules (the catchment wetness index model structure, a modified Penman model structure, and a probability distributed soil moisture model), and four routing models (two linear reservoirs in parallel, an adaptation that represents macropore flow, three linear reservoirs in parallel, and a model that includes leakage from the groundwater store). The 28 catchments were selected to cover a range of hydrological types based on known catchment characteristics (designed combinations of catchment size, baseflow index, and annual rainfall are used). The important points in objectively selecting model structures for regionalisation are proposed as: performance in calibration and validation, trade-off between high and low flow performance, and model complexity (here represented as the number of parameters). Although, the results in this study provide no evidence of relationships between catchment type and preferred model structure, the study indicates that out of the 12 trial model structures, the following four may be the most suitable for regionalisation across UK catchments: the modified Penman model with two parallel linear routing reservoirs, and the probability distributed soil moisture model with two parallel linear routing reservoirs, three parallel linear routing reservoirs, or the macropore adaptation.

AB A variety of two-phase flow experiments, currently available in the literature, are compared to study the effect of fluid relaxation on interfacial area generation. Interfacial area is an important parameter that controls mass transfer in many engineered multiphase systems, so it is important to develop accurate predictive tools describing multiphase flow to engineer efficient processes. An empirical predictive relationship was developed describing a specific interfacial area-wetting saturation relationship that depends on the number of quasi-equilibrium relaxation points obtained during a drainage or imbibition experiment. The empirical expression was tested and verified using a number of existing datasets. We found that different relationships were needed depending on the fluid properties as well as the porous medium. However, clear trends were observed that can, once a predictive relationship is established for the system, allow us to design multiphase flow systems to produce a desired amount of interfacial area tailored to a particular application.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Field data on drainage basin response have a characteristic scale which is determined by the size of the basin investigated. As a rule, information obtained at one particular scale can be extrapolated over a limited scale range only. This study identifies the nature of constraints on spatial scale transference in a series of semiarid badland drainage basins ranging in area from < 1 to 202 260 m2. Research focussed on the rainfall-runoff relationship during a single rainstorm so that the temporal scale was kept constant. Spatial scale transference between systems of differing scale was restricted by morphological and functional constraints. Morphological constraints are caused by morphological elements present. in large scale systems but absent in small scale ones. Functional constraints arise solely from the characteristics of the matter and energy flows in the systems of interest. Limits imposed upon spatial scale transferences by morphological and functional constraints are fuzzy rather than sharp in character.

AB We develop a nonlinear asymptotic theory of flow and bed topography in meandering channels able to describe finite amplitude perturbations of bottom topography and account for arbitrary, yet slow, variations of channel curvature. This approach then allows us to formulate a nonlinear bend instability theory, which predicts several characteristic features of the actual meandering process and extends results obtained by classical linear bend theories. In particular, in agreement with previous weakly nonlinear findings and consistently with field observations, the bend growth rate is found to peak at some value of the meander wave number, reminiscent of the resonant value of linear stability theory. Moreover, a feature typical of nonlinear waves arises: the selected wave number depends on the amplitude of the initial perturbation (for given values of the relevant dimensionless parameters), and in particular, larger wavelengths are associated with larger amplitudes. Meanders are found to migrate preferentially downstream, though upstream migration is found to be possible for relatively large values of the aspect ratio of the channel, a finding in agreement with the picture provided by linear theory. Meanders are found to slow down as their amplitude increases, again a feature typical of nonlinear waves, driven in the present case by flow rather than geometric nonlinearities. The model is substantiated by comparing predictions with field observations obtained for a test case. The potential use of the present approach to investigate a number of as yet unexplored aspects of meander evolution (e. g., chute cutoff) is finally discussed.

AB An extensive programme of commercial afforestation in south-central Chile provides a unique opportunity to extend the field-based understanding of forest impact on floods to the large catchment scale (100-1000 km(2)). Until now, much of that understanding has been limited to small catchments (<10 km(2)). Data for an approximately 50-year period are analysed systematically for four catchments (434-1545 km(2)) with 18%-54% increases in forest cover. For each catchment, the forest impact is quantified by pairing annual maximum flood frequency curves and peak discharge/storm rainfall relationships for the pre- and post-afforestation periods. These periods are themselves defined using land use surveys and cumulative double mass curves for runoff and rainfall. Scaling the frequency curves with a discharge corresponding to mean annual rainfall normalizes for rainfall differences and thus isolates the effect of forest cover. Partial afforestation rates of up to 50%, while markedly affecting annual evapotranspiration and runoff, have less certain effects on peak discharges. Downward shifts in the flood frequency curves occur following afforestation but appear more readily explained by changes in rainfall regime. These changes include a small decline in annual rainfall and a downward shift in some of the frequency curves for the storm rainfall totals corresponding to the annual maximum discharges. Nevertheless, some forest impact cannot be ruled out and the effect of a 100% change in forest cover on flood response remains unknown. The results suggest complexity in large catchment flood response and provide only weak support for afforestation with the sole purpose of reducing flood peaks at the large catchment scale. This is a significant conclusion, given that it challenges the largely uncritical view among the public, governments and development agencies worldwide that forests prevent floods.

AB An approach is presented which enables the quantification, in integrative form, of the preferential flow and the heterogeneity in water transport through the unsaturated zone under natural atmospheric conditions. For these purposes, deuterium transport was estimated in seven lysimeters filled with different sediment materials by applying a conceptual model, which consists of preferential and matrix flow paths for each using the lumped parameter approach. The piston flow and dispersion transit time distribution functions were assumed, for preferential and matrix flow paths, respectively. Weekly 2 H data measured in precipitation (1984-1991) were taken as the input function. Combining modelling of isotopes and hydrological data enabled the quantification of preferential flow rates. The fraction of preferential flow directly appearing in the outflow within one week varied between 17 and 30%. The fraction of preferential flow was practically independent of the soil texture and flow rates. The crucial parameter influencing the fraction of direct flow was found to be the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K,). In the matrix flow, it was found that the apparent dispersion parameter (P-D)* is indirectly proportional to the mean water content ( 0). This relationship shows that the heterogeneity of the water flux in the matrix is higher for lower water contents. Finally, the transit time distribution functions, determined for both flow paths and the fractions of preferential flow, were used to construct vulnerability diagrams. Such a diagram gives the amounts of tracer mass (conservative pollutant), which appear weekly in the outflow between 0 and 60 weeks. The vulnerability diagrams showed different patterns for different soils, depending on the saturated conductivity and mean water content. Coarser material with low 0 and high K-s, showed a short mean transit time for the matrix flow (about 10 weeks) and mean preferential flow equal to or higher than 20%. Finer sand, with lower K, and higher 0, resulted in mean transit times of approximately 30 weeks and preferential flow of 17-21 %. These diagrams can be used to estimate the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution for different soil materials of the unsaturated zone.

AB The Bowen ratio energy balance method often produces extremely inaccurate magnitudes of the flux due to resolution limits of the instruments. We analysed the criteria used for rejecting inaccurate data observed using a Bowen ratio system and the resolution limit of the sensors to analytically determine the reliable values of the Bowen ratio (beta) and the latent and sensible heat fluxes. The formula used to calculate the error limit of the Bowen ratio (beta) was corrected based on the theory of error analysis. An example was proposed for the common case with 0.2 degrees C resolution limit of temperature measurement and 0.08 kP(a) resolution limit of water vapour pressure measurement, to show the steps of accepting or rejecting data observed by a Bowen ratio system. The acceptance or rejection of data observed by a Bowen ratio system is a dynamic process, which should be performed based on the excluded interval of the Bowen ratio and the qualitative relationships among the data observed by a Bowen ratio system. The excluded interval of the Bowen ratio can be structured based on the accuracy of the sensors used. Data are excluded first if they do not satisfy the qualitative relationships between the vapour pressure difference, the temperature difference, Bowen ratio, and the available energy, whereas the data in the rejection region range of the Bowen ratio are excluded second. It is necessary to improve the accuracy of the temperature and humidity probes to improve the acceptance rate for data collected using the Bowen ratio system, apart from improving the observed precision of available energy.

AB In this work, a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH) multiphase model is developed. The model is able to deal with soil-water interactions coupled in a strong and natural form. A Regularized Bingham Plastic constitutive law including a pressure-dependent Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion (RBPMC-alpha(mu)) is proposed to model fluids, soils and their interaction. Since the proposed rheology model is pressure-sensitive, we propose a multiphase diffusive term to reduce the spurious pressure resulting from the weakly compressible flow hypothesis. Several numerical benchmarks are investigated to assess the robustness and accuracy of the proposed multiphase SPH model.

AB High-frequency (5 Hz) atmospheric surface layer (ASL) turbulent velocity (u') and infrared skin temperature perturbations (T-s') were measured above a grass-covered forest clearing and analyzed for cloud free conditions. These measurements were used to investigate mechanisms responsible for the production of large short-lived T-s' perturbations caused by rapid excursions in u'. To quantify the effects of u' on rapid surface cooling, wavelet spectra of u' and T-s' and cospectra of u' T-s' were computed. The u' wavelet power spectra were then analyzed using Townsend's [1961, 1976] hypothesis. Townsend's hypothesis states that ASL eddy motion can be decomposed into an active component, which is a function of the ground shear stress (u*) and height (z) above the zero plane displacement, and an inactive component, which is produced in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) outer region. A -1 power law in the u' power spectrum was used as a signature for inactive eddy motion. Therefore the -1 power law was used to identify wavenumber ranges (about 1.5 decades) associated with inactive eddy motion. The measured T-s', wavelet spectra and u' T-s' cospectra identified with this wavenumber range demonstrate that much of the T-s' energy and [u'T-s'] are due to inactive eddy motion, where the angle brackets indicate time averaging. Hence, in contrast to the laboratory experiments of Owen and Thomson [1963], it is argued that skin temperature perturbations at the canopy-atmosphere interface of a grass-covered surface (small thermal inertia) are strongly dependent on the inactive eddy motion produced in the outer layer of the ABL.

AB Specific yield (Sy) is defined as the average volume of water that can be drained, per unit surface of aquifer per unit drop of head. This parameter is of critical relevance for groundwater resources assessment, but its estimation suffers from numerous difficulties, including spatial variability, hysteresis, dependence on depth to water table, or delayed drainage. As a result, no widely accepted method is available for its estimation. Here we show that most of these difficulties can be overcome by using time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to map water content variations in response to phreatic level fluctuations. We applied the method to a synthetic example and to a real site in Argentina. Results demonstrate that the approach is robust and provides a picture of how, how much and where water is being released from the soil when aquifer heads drop, which is the ultimate goal of Sy concept. ERT produced some oscillations in estimated water contents, which we attribute to inversion artifacts. Still, the error analysis and the synthetic example suggest that the impact of spurious oscillations tends to cancel out during estimation of Sy, which supports the robustness of the method. Estimated Sy is sensitive to the petrophysical law. If the slope of this law is inadequate, calculated values of Sy may be biased, but their variability patterns are well captured by the method. What is clear is that Sy is a spatially and temporally variable parameter, whose estimation is difficult. ERT represents a possible avenue to evaluate Sy and its variability.

AB Density-driven convection has been identified to accelerate the rate of CO2 solubility trapping during geological CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers. In this paper, we present an experimental method using the refractive properties of fluids (their impact on light transmission), and an analogous system design, which enables the study of transport mechanisms in saturated porous media. The method is used to investigate solutally induced density-driven convective mixing under conditions relevant to geological CO2 storage. The analogous system design allows us by choice of initial solute concentration and bead size to duplicate a wide range of conditions (Ra-values), making it possible to study the convective process in general, and as a laboratory analogue for systems found in the field. We show that the method accurately determines the solute concentration in the system with high spatial and temporal resolution. The onset time of convection (t(c)), mass flux (F), and flow dynamics are quantified and compared with experimental and numerical findings in the literature. Our data yield a scaling law for tc which gives new insight into its dependence on Ra, indicating t(c) to be more sensitive to large Ra than previously thought. Furthermore, our data show and explain why F is described equally well by a Ra-dependent or a Ra-independent scaling law. These findings improve the understanding of the physical process of convective mixing in saturated porous media in general and help to assess the CO2 solubility trapping rate under certain field conditions.

AB We analyze drawdown reciprocity gaps emerging in interference tests performed in a confined fissured karstic formation. Modeling the system as a dual porosity continuum allows characterizing the dynamics of the relative contribution of the connected fractures and the rock matrix to the total flow rate extracted at the pumping wells. Observed lack of reciprocity of drawdowns can then be linked to the occurrence of processes that are not accounted for in the classical flow models based on a single-continuum representation of the system through flow equations grounded on Darcy's law only. We show that interpreting the system as a dual porosity continuum can cause drawdown reciprocity gaps to emerge as a consequence of local effects associated with an identifiable contribution of the matrix to the total fluid extracted at the well location during pumping. These theoretical results are then employed to identify the contribution to the flow being supplied to the pumping well by the low conductivity matrix constituting the host rock formation, in contrast to that provided by the fractures. An application to data from two interference tests performed at the Hydrogeological Experimental Site (HES) in Poitiers, France, illustrates the approach. We show that, whenever the matrix is assumed to provide a contribution to the total flow rate extracted, nonreciprocity is expected, the latter being linked to the occurrence of a differential drawdown between fracture and matrix at the pumping well. This difference decreases with time in the example presented, displaying a power law late time behavior, with nonreciprocity effects persisting up to remarkably long times.

AB We present a concise and general mathematical formulation for reactive transport in groundwater for general applications; By means of linear algebraic manipulations of the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reactions we are able to reduce the number of unknowns of the equations to be solved to the number of degrees of freedom according to thermodynamic rules. We present six formulations that differ from each other by number and type of unknowns and discuss their advantages and disadvantages with respect to the two most important numerical solution methods, the Sequential Iteration Approach (SIA) and the Direct Substitution Approach (DSA). Our conclusion is that the proposed reduction of the number of variables is of special interest for the DSA. We have applied one of these formulations to an example of the flushing of saline water by fresh water.

AB Soil moisture is an important drought index in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) and understanding its relationships with oceanic-atmospheric patterns provides valuable information for sustainable water management. To begin with, this study generated 50 years (1950-2000) of soil moisture data in the UCRB using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. This was followed by a temporal evaluation of Pacific Ocean Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and soil moisture in the UCRB during drought, normal, and wet years. Besides in-phase analysis, lead time analysis was also performed in which the previous year's SSTs were evaluated with the current year soil moisture. Furthermore, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis revealed strong correlation between the first temporal expansion series of SSTs and soil moisture in the UCRB. Finally, this study examined the relationships between multiple oceanic-atmospheric patterns and soil moisture in the UCRB in drought, normal, and wet years. Both in-phase and lead time analyses indicated that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) strongly influenced soil moisture by displaying positive coupled regions (significance >95%). In drought and wet years, the lead time analysis showed a positive correlation between the El Nit-lop-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and soil moisture but the in-phase analysis resulted in a negative correlation. The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) displayed similar coupled regions for both in-phase and lead time analyses in drought and wet years. Understanding the relationships between soil moisture and oceanic-atmospheric patterns has increasingly important implications for the water resources management in the UCRB since soil moisture plays a key role in predicting the runoff and streamflow.

AB We analyze and simulate laboratory data on flow and solute transport in a submeter scale sample of Massillon sandstone and we re-evaluate studies that have stated that these data indicate a failure of the advection-dispersion, and that nonlocal modeling approaches are necessary. Our examination reveals experimental issues including artificial edge effects in the data, as well as inconsistency in the measured solute injection rates. When the edge effects are removed the data no longer exhibit power-law tailing. Our simulations show that failure of the advection-dispersion equation has not been demonstrated and that nonlocal approaches are not necessary.

AB In this study, LIDAR snow depths, bare ground elevations (topography), and elevations filtered to the top of vegetation (topography + vegetation) in five 1- km(2) areas are used to determine whether the spatial distribution of snow depth exhibits scale invariance, and the control that vegetation, topography, and winds exert on such behavior. The one- dimensional and mean two- dimensional power spectra of snow depth exhibit power law behavior in two frequency intervals separated by a scale break located between 7 m and 45 m. The spectral exponents for the low- frequency range vary between 0.1 and 1.2 for the one- dimensional spectra, and between 1.3 and 2.2 for the mean two-dimensional power spectra. The spectral exponents for the high- frequency range vary between 3.3 and 3.6 for the one- dimensional spectra, and between 4.0 and 4.5 for the mean two- dimensional spectra. Such spectral exponents indicate the existence of two distinct scaling regimes, with significantly larger variations occurring in the larger- scale regime. Similar bilinear power law spectra were obtained for the fields of vegetation height, with crossover wavelengths between 7 m and 14 m. Further analysis of the snow depth and vegetation fields, together with wind data, support the conclusion that the break in the scaling behavior of snow depth is controlled by the scaling characteristics of the spatial distribution of vegetation height when snow redistribution by wind is minimal and canopy interception is dominant, and by the interaction of winds with features such as surface concavities and vegetation when snow redistribution by wind is dominant.

AB Air temperature is correlated with precipitation oxygen isotope (delta O-18(prcp)) variability for much of the eastern and central United States, but the nature of this delta O-18(prcp)-temperature relationship is largely based on data coarsely aggregated at a monthly resolution. We constructed a database of 6177 weeks of isotope and precipitation-day air temperature data from 25 sites to determine how more precise data change our understanding of this classic relationship. Because the delta O-18(prcp)-temperature relationship is not perfectly linear, trends in the regression residuals suggest the influence of additional environmental factors such as moisture recycling and extratropical cyclone interactions. Additionally, the temporal relationships between delta O-18(prcp) and temperature observed in the weekly data at individual sites can explain broader spatial patterns observed across the study region. For 20 of 25 sites, the delta O-18(prcp)-temperature relationship slope is higher for colder precipitation than for warmer precipitation. Accordingly, northern and western sites with relatively more cold precipitation events have steeper overall relationships with higher slope values than southeastern sites that have more warm precipitation events. Although the magnitude of delta O-18(prcp) variability increases to the north and west, the fraction of delta O-18(prcp) variability explained by temperature increases due to wider annual temperature ranges, producing stronger relationships in these regions. When our delta O-18(prcp)-temperature data are grouped by month, we observe significant variations in the relationship from month to month. This argues against a principal causative role for temperature and suggests the existence of an alternative environmental control on delta O-18(prcp) values that simply covaries seasonally with temperature.
   Plain Language Summary In the eastern and central United States, the oxygen isotope ratio of rain or snow is linked to the air temperature while it rains or snows: warmer temperatures have higher isotope ratios and colder temperatures have lower isotope ratios. If we have a record of these isotope ratios dating back into the past, we can estimate how the weather has changed for a given location over time. However, we need a solid understanding of how isotope ratios are controlled in the present day in order to make any estimations about the past. Previous research studying the present day effect of air temperature on isotope ratios have used databases that average an entire month of weather and isotope ratios. This blurs out any possible effects from short-term weather changes. Our study uses a newly-created database with nearly 6200 weekly precipitation samples that better capture rapid weather changes and any resulting effects on isotope ratios. The high number of samples in this database also lets us learn why different sites have different relationships between temperature and isotope ratios depending on their geography and season. Our improved understanding of these relationships can now help produce better estimates of past weather changes.

AB Although changes in bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(b)) in aquifers have been attributed to microbial activity, sigma(b) has never been used to infer biogeochemical reaction rates quantitatively. To explore the use of electrical conductivity to measure reaction rates, we conducted iron oxide reduction experiments of increasing biological complexity. To quantify reaction rates, we propose composite reactions that incorporate the stoichiometry of five different types of reactions: redox, acid-base, sorption, dissolution/precipitation, and biosynthesis. In batch experiments and the early stages of a column experiment, such reaction stoichiometries inferred from a few chemical measurements allowed quantification of the Fe oxide reduction rate based on changes in electrical conductivity. The relationship between electrical conductivity and fluid chemistry did not hold during the latter stages of the column experiment when sigma(b) increased while fluid chemistry remained constant. Growth of an electrically conductive biofilm could possibly explain this late stage sigma(b) increase. The measured sigma(b) increase is consistent with a model proposed by analogy from percolation theory that attributes the increased conductivity to growth of biofilms with conductivity of similar to 5.5 S m(-1) in at least 3% of the column pore space. This work demonstrates that measurements of sigma(b) and flow rate, combined with a few direct chemical measurements, can be used to quantify biogeochemical reaction rates in controlled laboratory situations and may be able to detect the presence of biofilms. This approach may help in designing future field experiments to interpret biogeochemical reactivity from conductivity measurements.

AB Connectivity of high conductivity (K) paths is important because it can lead to channeling, i.e. flow along preferential paths, which can reduce travel times very significantly. Nevertheless, limited effort has been devoted to defining the concept quantitatively. We propose and evaluate nine indicators of connectivity. Three account for the presence of flow connectivity, that is, the flow rate increase caused by preferential flow paths. Two account for the presence of transport connectivity, that is, the existence of fast paths allowing early solute arrival. The remaining four are statistical indicators based on two- and multiple-point statistics. We test these indicators on heterogeneous conductivity fields with different visual connectivity. The indicators of flow connectivity and one of the transport connectivity indicators succeed in identifying the increased presence of connected high-K features. The two-point statistical indicators fail to do so. The directional multi-point statistical indicator performs better. None of the statistical indicators correlate with the flow and transport indicators. We find only weak dependence between the flow and transport indicators. Our results suggest that transport connectivity is much less sensitive to barriers, which control flow connectivity. Instead, transport connectivity appears to be controlled by the existence of narrow, possibly discontinuous high-K paths. Therefore, we conclude that connectivity is a process-dependent concept.

AB Demand for reducing mental health impacts from flooding through collective flood defence is elicited using a contingent valuation method with a sequential hypothetical scenario, which accounts for human resilience and experience. A two-step model fits the survey data: it combines a binary sample selection rule to distinguish protesters and participants with a Tobit model to accommodate true zero responses among participants. Results show that non-symptoms-specific information on mental health risk may bias the willingness to pay downward. Risk-averse individuals who have taken self-insurance protection measures are willing to pay for additional protection through collective defence. Feelings, such as worries and anxiety related to flooding, drive the demand, which supports the risk-as-feelings hypothesis for mental health protection from flooding. Inexperience rather than experience of flooding is found to increase demand, which indicates that individual mental resilience to flooding may increase after an event as posited by the inoculation hypothesis.

AB Simulation of river flow processes including sediment transport is usually conducted using the shallow water flow equations, which are based on a hydrostatic pressure distribution. To increase the accuracy of predictions in a variety of scenarios involving horizontal length scales of the order of vertical length scales, an improved representation of the vertical flow structure is necessary. The mathematical approximation to field variables like the velocity and fluid pressure must be enhanced during the depth-integrating process. Therefore, this paper presents a 1D non-hydrostatic flow and sediment transport model developed by using the method of the weighted residuals into the RANS equations. Using continuity, momentum, and moment equations, the fluid pressure distribution is modelled using a quadratic predictor with perturbation parameters to deviate the vertical momentum balance from the hydrostatic law. The flow equations are a generalized non-hydrostatic flow solver, where the fluid density variation due to suspension of sediments and the bed deformation due to erosion-sedimentation processes are accounted for. A hybrid semi-implicit finite volume-finite difference numerical scheme is developed to solve the system of conservation laws. Two different approaches are used to model the sediment transport processes: (i) Unified computation of the total-load transport and (H) separate computation of suspended and bed loads. The accuracy of the non-hydrostatic model is demonstrated by comparison with experimental data, highlighting better results accounting for separate determinations of the suspended and bed loads in highly erosive flows.

AB The characterization of aleatory hydrogeological parameter uncertainty has traditionally been accomplished using probability theory. However, when consideration is given to epistemic as well as aleatory uncertainty, probability theory is not necessarily appropriate. This is especially the case where expert opinion is regarded as a suitable source of information. When experts opine upon the uncertainty of a parameter value, both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are introduced and must be modeled appropriately. A novel approach to expert-provided parameter uncertainty characterization can be defined that bridges an historical gap between probability theory and fuzzy set theory. Herein, a random set, a generalization of a random variable is employed to formalize expert knowledge, and fuzzy sets are used to propagate this uncertainty to model estimates of contaminant transport. The resultant random set-based concentration estimates are shown to be more general than the corresponding random variable estimates. In some cases, the random set-based results are shown as upper and lower probabilities that bound the corresponding random variable's cumulative distribution function.

AB This study seeks to explore the relationship between rainfall and river discharge within a large river basin flowing into the waters surrounding the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and to investigate the best method of measuring the relationship. This aim is addressed by focusing on three specific research questions: (A) Has there been any evidence that global climate change has impacted on either rainfall or river discharge resulting in any change to the relationship between these variables over time? (B) What is the best measure of rainfall to be used to quantify the rainfall discharge relationship, including the optimal number of rain stations to be included in the sample? (C) What is the optimal temporal scale for measuring the relationship (ranging from fine scale monthly data, medium scale quarterly data, and coarse scale annual data)?
   Modern econometric time series techniques are utilised, and compared with results using an alternate technique developed by researchers from the bio-physical sciences; the widely used Thiessen Polygon method.
   Firstly, stationarity testing, using econometric unit root tests, did not find evidence to suggest that the data are non-stationary. Evidently, climate change has not had a measurable impact on rainfall or river discharge in the region during the period covered by this study.
   Secondly, the analysis shows that the when dealing with fairly simple models with a fairly small number of explanatory variables, those which best represent the river discharge relationship are those using the coarser scales (both geographic and temporal). In other words, stronger and more robust results are derived from models using fewer rain stations, and annual data (rather than quarterly or monthly data), This approach provides a viable alternative that may be very useful in data-poor environments when it is not possible to use other more data-hungry modelling approaches. The econometric models provided a better explanation of the relationship than the Thiessen Polygon approach, whilst utilising data from a smaller number of rain stations. The most appropriate functional form was that using the natural logs of discharge as the dependent variable, and the relationship appears to be a fairly simple one, with the inclusion of lagged data from previous years not significantly improving the explanation provided by current year models. The approach demonstrates that simple time series models can be enriched by the incorporation of additional variables beyond rainfall levels; both temperatures and rainfall concentration were considered with the inclusion of a rainfall concentration index proving to significantly improve the explanatory power of the model for this study region.

AB Fuzzy inference systems have been successfully applied in numerous fields since they can effectively model human knowledge and adaptively make decision processes. In this paper we present an innovative fuzzy exemplar-based inference system (FEIS) for flood forecasting. The FEIS is based on a fuzzy inference system, with its clustering ability enhanced through the Exemplar-Aided Constructor of Hyper-rectangles algorithm, which can effectively simulate human intelligence by learning from experience. The FEIS exhibits three important properties: knowledge extraction from numerical data, knowledge ( rule) modeling, and fuzzy reasoning processes. The proposed model is employed to predict streamflow 1 hour ahead during flood events in the Lan-Yang River, Taiwan. For the purpose of comparison the back propagation neural network (BPNN) is also performed. The results show that the FEIS model performs better than the BPNN. The FEIS provides a great learning ability, robustness, and high predictive accuracy for flood forecasting.

ID FRESH-WATER; BEHAVIOR; CURVES; AIR
AB Spills of diluted bitumen (dilbit) to rivers by rail or pipeline accidents can have serious long-term impacts on environment and ecology due to the submergence and trapping of oil within the river bed sediment. The extent of this problem is dictated by the amount of immobile oil available for mass transfer into the water flowing through the sediment pores. An understanding of multiphase (oil and water) flow in the sediment, including oil trapping by hysteretic drainage and imbibition, is important for the development of spill response and risk assessment strategies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S-w) relationships for dilbit and water, and air and water in gravel using a custom-made pressure cell. The P-c-S-w relationships obtained using standard procedures in coarse porous media are height-averaged and often require correction. By developing and comparing air-water and dilbit-water P-c-S-w curves, it was found that correction was less important in dilbit-water systems due to the smaller difference in density between the fluids. In both systems, small displacement pressures were needed for the entry of non-wetting fluid in gravel. Approximately 14% of the pore space was occupied by trapped dilbit after imbibition, which can serve as a source of long-term contamination. While air-water data can be scaled to reasonably predict dilbit-water behaviour, it cannot be used to determine the trapped amount. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hydrogeochemical investigations of recharge and subsequent salinization
   processes at Al-Raudhatain depression in Kuwait

AB Fresh groundwater is uniquely present in the northern parts of Kuwait at Al-Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish depressions, where it occurs in the form of lenses floating on top of Kuwait Group's brackish water. Earlier studies have provided a wealth of data on these depressions. Nonetheless, information on the recharge process is both scarce and scattered among different studies. Based on existing information, chemical and isotopic investigations, and geochemical modelling, a coherent description of the recharge and salinity evolution processes at Al-Raudhatain freshwater lenses is presented. Radioactive isotope (C-14, C-13 and H-3) results indicate that the groundwater sampled at the depression and its vicinity contain significant portions of recharge from recent (less than 500 years) rainfall events. Furthermore, the results of stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) specify that recharging rainfall events took place during the last three to four decades. Examining the relationship of O-18/H-2 along with the Emirates meteoric water line (i.e. the nearest available meteoric water line) reveals that samples are showing sings of insignificant evaporation, which indicates rapid infiltration. Given the established low infiltration rates at the depression and the lack of surface runoff at the wadis, it was concluded that most of the recharge comes from infiltration outside the depression, followed by subsurface runoff to the depression where recharge takes place. Reverse geochemical modelling showed that the main processes controlling the geochemistry of the water in the depression are halite, albite, illite dissolution, as well as K-feldspar weathering and calcite precipitation. These processes take place during infiltration, subsurface runoff and percolation to the groundwater. The contribution of the recharge water in the makeup of the body of the lens versus the regional brackish groundwater was estimated according to their contribution in total dissolved solids concentrations using the salinity stratification and the results of O-18.

AB [1] Considerable research suggests that colloid deposition in porous media is frequently not consistent with filtration theory predictions under unfavorable attachment conditions. Filtration theory was developed from an analysis of colloid attachment to the solid-water interface of a single spherical grain collector and therefore does not include the potential influence of pore structure, grain-grain junctions, and surface roughness on straining deposition. This work highlights recent experimental evidence that indicates that straining can play an important role in colloid deposition under unfavorable attachment conditions and may explain many of the reported limitations of filtration theory. This conclusion is based upon pore size distribution information, size exclusion, time- and concentration-dependent deposition behavior, colloid size distribution information, hyperexponential deposition profiles, the dependence of deposition on colloid and porous medium size, batch release rates, micromodel observations, and deposition at textural interfaces. The implications of straining in unsaturated and heterogeneous systems are also discussed, as well as the potential influence of system solution chemistry and hydrodynamics. The inability of attachment theory predictions to describe experimental colloid transport data under unfavorable conditions is demonstrated. Specific tests to identify the occurrence and/or absence of straining and attachment are proposed.

DT Article
ID WATER; UNIFORMITY
AB Optimal decision rules and dynamics are characterized for the irrigation management model in the previous paper (Knapp, this issue (a)). For a constant crop and irrigation system, the decision rules are concave in E[s] and SD[s]. That is, seasonal water applications first increase as these variables increase, and then possibly decrease. Optimal water applications are observed to be decreasing in the correlation coefficient, although the effect is small. Optimal water applications and soil salinity follow a cyclical time path with a multicrop rotation. The decision rules for applied water are also found to vary for the same crop depending on place within the crop rotation. A range of irrigation systems are efficient depending on prices and other parameters. Investment dynamics are generally a constant type of irrigation system with possibly an initial transition period of another system type. More complex investment behavior is observed with constrained water supplies.

AB The application of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) to the direct three-dimensional measurement of flow in rough-walled water-saturated rock fractures is presented for the first time. The study demonstrates the abilities of NMRI to noninvasively measure rock-water interfaces and water flow velocities in these fractures and investigates the effects of wall morphology on flow patterns inside a typical rock fracture. Two- and three-dimensional flow-encoded spin-echo pulse sequences were applied. The stability and reproducibility of the water flow patterns were confirmed by analyzing two-dimensional velocity images. A variety of geometrical and hydraulic features were determined from three-dimensional velocity images, including the rock-water interfaces, the fracture aperture distribution, and the critical aperture path; velocity profiles and volumetric flow rates; flow and stagnant regions; and the critical velocity path. In particular, the effects of a sharp step discontinuity of the fracture walls and the applicability of the cubic law were examined. As a result of the complex three-dimensional geometry, velocity profiles are generally parabolic but often highly asymmetric, with respect to the fracture walls. These asymmetric velocity profiles are clustered together, with significant correlations; they are not just local random phenomena. However, theoretical considerations indicate that the effects of the measured asymmetry on volumetric flow rates and hydraulic conductivities are insignificant, in that the overall flow inside rough fractures still obeys the cubic law. The features discussed in this study emphasize the strong heterogeneity and the highly three-dimensional nature of the flow patterns in natural rock fractures and consequently the need for three-dimensional flow analysis.

AB We present an approach to infer mass transfer parameters based on (1) an analytical model that relates the temporal moments of mobile and bulk concentration and (2) a bicontinuum modification to Archie's law. Whereas conventional geochemical measurements preferentially sample from the mobile domain, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is sensitive to bulk electrical conductivity and, thus, electrolytic solute in both the mobile and immobile domains. We demonstrate the new approach, in which temporal moments of collocated mobile domain conductivity (i.e., conventional sampling) and ERT-estimated bulk conductivity are used to calculate heterogeneous mass transfer rate and immobile porosity fractions in a series of numerical column experiments.

AB We consider a porous medium containing a single fracture, and identify the aperture to length ratio as the small parameter epsilon. with the fracture permeability and the fracture porosity scaled as exponents of epsilon. We consider a two-phase flow where the flow is governed by the mass balance and the Darcy law. Using formal asymptotic approach, we derive a catalogue of reduced models as the vanishing limit of epsilon. Our derivation provides new models in a hybrid-dimensional setting as well as models which exhibit two-scale behaviour. Several numerical examples confirm the theoretical derivations and provide additional insight.

AB Biogeochemical and ecological transformations in hyporheic zones are dependent on the timing of hyporheic exchange. We show through linked modeling of open channel turbulent flow, groundwater flow, and solute transport that the residence time distributions of solutes advected by hyporheic flow induced by current-bedform interaction follow power-laws. This tailing behavior of solutes exiting the sediments is explained by the presence of multiple path lengths coupled with very large variability in Darcy flow velocity, both occurring without heterogeneity in sediment permeability. Hyporheic exchange through bedforms will result in short-time fractal scaling of stream water chemistry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The transport property of natural fissured reservoir is highly related to the fracture permeability. The composite topography of natural fractures is always rough, with self-affine surfaces and non-uniform aperture field. All these would affect the transport properties significantly. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to clarify the control mechanism on fluid flow through rough fractures with self-affine and mismatched surfaces. In this work, four controlling factors, namely local rough geometry, hydraulic tortuosity, surface tortuosity, and non-uniform aperture distribution were identified for the mismatched and rough fracture flows. Afterwards, the implications of these factors on fluid flow were specified by analytical derivation. Combined with the cubic law and the tripleeffect model, a quadruple-effect permeability model was established to characterize the comprehensive effects from the composite topography of rough fractures. Moreover, the semi-empirical coefficient and index in surface roughness factor were determined by Lattice Boltzmann simulations, and provide fundamental support to define the effective hydraulic aperture which is a key parameter in the quadruple-effect model. Theoretical analysis denoted that the quadruple-effect model could generalize other models in the literature, and its performance was approved by numerical validation.

AB The stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18) are useful conservative tracers for tracking the movement of water in soil. But although the tracking of water infiltrating through the soil profile and its movement as run-off and groundwater recharge are well developed, water movement through the soil can also include evaporative fractionation. Soil water fractionation factors have, until now, been largely empirical. Unlike open water evaporation where temperature, humidity, and vapour pressure gradient define fractionation, soil water evaporation includes fractionation by soil matrix effects. These effects are still poorly characterized. Here, we present preliminary results from a simple laboratory experiment with four soil admixtures with grain sizes that range from sand to silt and clay. Our results show that soil tension seems to control the isotope fractionation of resident soil water. The relationship between soil tension and equilibrium fractionation appears to be independent of soil texture and appears well supported by thermodynamic theory. Although these results are preliminary, they suggest that future work should go after soil tension effects as a possible explanatory factor of soil water and water vapour fractionation.

AB Reservoirs impose many negative impacts on riverine ecosystems. To balance human and ecosystem needs, we propose a reservoir operation method that combines reservoir operating rule curves with the regulated minimum water release policy to meet the environmental flow requirements of riverine ecosystems. Based on the relative positions of the reservoir and the water intakes, we consider three scenarios: water used for human needs (including industrial, domestic and agricultural) is directly withdrawn from (1) the reservoir; (2) both reservoirs and downstream river channels and (3) downstream river. The proposed method offers two advantages over traditional methods: First, it can be applied to finding the optimal reservoir operating rule curves with the consideration of environmental flow requirement, which is beneficial to the sustainable water uses. Second, it avoids a problem with traditional approaches, which prescribe the minimum environmental flow requirements as the regulated minimum environmental flow releases from reservoirs, implicitly giving lower priority to the riverine ecosystem. Our method instead determines the optimal regulated minimum releases of water to sustain environmental flows while more effectively balancing human and ecosystem needs. To demonstrate practical use of the model, we present a case study for operation of the Tanghe reservoir in China's Tang river basin for the three above-mentioned scenarios. The results demonstrate that this approach will help the reservoir's managers satisfy both human and environmental requirements. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB [1] Aggradation and degradation in one-dimensional channels are often modeled with a simplified nonlinear diffusion equation. Different degrees of nonlinearity are obtained using the Chezy and Manning/Gauckler-Strickler laws for the friction coefficient combined with a sediment transport equation having a generalized form of the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula. Analytical self-similar solutions for the "dam break'' and the base-level lowering are presented. While the linear case corresponds to the classic diffusion equation, the main effect of the nonlinearity appears to be the presence of singularities in the self-similar solutions, related to the finite speed of propagation of perturbations.

AB We first upscale the local transport (Stokes and Nernst-Planck) equations to the scale of a single capillary saturated by a binary 1: 1 electrolyte. These equations are then upscaled to the scale of a network of tortuous capillaries embedded in a homogeneous and continuous mineral matrix, including the influence of the distribution of pore sizes but excluding the effect of connectivity between the pores. One of the features of our theory is to account for transport along the mineral surface in the so-called Stern layer because of recent evidence that this mechanism is effective in describing frequency-dependent electrical conductivity. Real clay materials are, however, not described by a set of capillaries, so we have to modify the model to include the effect of transversal dispersivity, for example. We found no evidence for transport in the Stern layer because of the discontinuity of the solid phase at the scale of a representative elementary volume in clay materials. The effect of the diffuse layer is accounted for through the use of a Donnan equilibrium approach to determine the effective concentrations of the ions in the pore space, which are different from the ionic concentrations of an ionic reservoir in local equilibrium with the porous material. We found that the diffuse layer controls various transport properties, including, for example, the DC electrical conductivity, the osmotic efficiency coefficient, the streaming potential coupling coefficient, and the macroscopic Hittorf numbers. Comparison to a large data set of experimental data, mainly on clay materials, confirms the validity of the derived relationships used to describe the material properties entering into the constitutive equations.

AB The information regarding spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture in a catchment is of utmost importance in hydrological, as well as many other studies. Point measurements from gravimetric and other methods for soil moisture determination are insufficient to understand the spatial behaviour of soil moisture in a region. Microwave remote sensing data from active sensors on board various satellites are increasingly being used to map spatial distribution of soil moisture within the 0-10 cm top surface. The northern part of India has a network of large rivers and canals and, therefore, spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in this region has a significant hearing on the hydrology of the region. In this paper, results on estimation of soil Moisture from an ERS-2 SAR image in the catchment of the Solani River (a tributary to the River Ganga) in and around the town of Roorkee, India, have been presented. The radar backscatter coefficient for each pixel of the image has been modelled from the digital numbers of the SAR image. Gravimetric measurements have been made Simultaneously during the satellite pass to determine the concurrent value of volumetric soil moisture at a large number of sample points within the satellite sweep area. The backscatter coefficient is found to vary from -30 dB to -42 dB for a variation in soil moisture from 30 to 75%. Regression analyses between volumetric soil moisture and both the digital numbers and backscatter coefficients were performed. Strong correlations between volumetric soil moisture and digital number were observed with R-2 values of 0.84, 0.75 and 0.83 for bare soil, vegetative and combined surfaces, respectively. A similar trend was observed with the relationship between backscatter and volumetric soil moisture with R-2 values of 0.60, 0.89 and 0.67 for bare soil, vegetative and combined surfaces, respectively. These results demonstrate the utilization of SAR data for estimation of spatial distribution of soil moisture in the region of the present study.

AB We extend lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods to advection and anisotropic-dispersion equations (AADE). LB methods are advocated for the exactness of their conservation laws, the handling of different length and time scales for flow/transport problems, their locality and extreme simplicity. Their extension to anisotropic collision operators (L-model) and anisotropic equilibrium distributions (E-model) allows to apply them to generic diffusion forms. The AADE in a conventional form can be solved by the L-model. Based on a link-type collision operator, the L-model specifies the coefficients of the symmetric diffusion tensor as linear combination of its eigenvalue functions. For any type of collision operator, the E-model constructs the coefficients of the transformed diffusion tensors from linear combinations of the relevant equilibrium projections. The model is able to eliminate the second order tensor of its numerical diffusion. Both models rely on mass conserving equilibrium functions and may enhance the accuracy and stability of the isotropic convection-diffusion LB models.
   The link basis is introduced as an alternative to a polynomial collision basis. They coincide for one particular eigenvalue configuration, the two-relaxation-time (TRT) collision operator, suitable for both mass and momentum conservation laws. TRT operator is equivalent to the BGK collision in simplicity but the additional collision freedom relates it to multiple-relaxation-times (MRT) models. "Optimal convection" and "optimal diffusion" eigenvalue solutions for the TRT E-model allow to remove next order corrections to AADE. Numerical results confirm the Chapman-Enskog and dispersion analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting a small leak in a water-supply pipe with a wave scattering power of the order of noise or smaller is a challenging problem because its signature in a measured signal is weak. Experimental data show that multiple sensors enhance the evidence about a leak in a transient test and, thus, increase the possibility of successful leak detection in noisy environments. Therefore, a leakage localization scheme is proposed, which fuses multi-sensor measurements in the Dempster-Shafer evidence framework. The signature of a leak in each measurement is extracted and translated into a piece of evidence regarding its presence and location. Then, the pieces of evidence from different sensors are fused using the Dempster's rule of combination to form a unified leak location estimation. The proposed method is model-free and is thus insensitive to imprecise knowledge of pipe system. The gain of the multi-sensor fusion mechanism on the leakage localization accuracy is demonstrated via both numerical and experimental data.

AB Considerable debate revolves around the relative importance of rock type, tectonics, and climate in creating the architecture of the critical zone. We demonstrate the importance of climate and in particular the rate of water recharge to the subsurface, using numerical models that incorporate hydrologic flowpaths, chemical weathering, and geomorphic rules for soil production and transport. We track alterations in both solid phase (plagioclase to clay) and water chemistry along hydrologic flowpaths that include lateral flow beneath the water table. To isolate the role of recharge, we simulate dry and wet cases and prescribe identical landscape evolution rules. The weathering patterns that develop differ dramatically beneath the resulting parabolic interfluves. In the dry case, incomplete weathering is shallow and surface parallel, whereas in the wet case, intense weathering occurs to depths approximating the base of the bounding channels, well below the water table. Exploration of intermediate cases reveals that the weathering state of the subsurface is strongly governed by the ratio of the rate of advance of the weathering front itself controlled by the water input rate, and the rate of erosion of the landscape. The system transitions between these end-member behaviours rather abruptly at a weathering front speed - erosion rate ratio of approximately 1. Although there are undoubtedly direct roles for tectonics and rock type in critical zone architecture, and yet more likely feedbacks between these and climate, we show here that differences in hillslope-scale weathering patterns can be strongly controlled by climate.

AB The spatial representativeness of gauging stations was investigated in two low-mountainous river basins near the city of Trier, southwest Germany. Longitudinal profiles during low and high flow conditions were sampled in order to identify sources of solutes and to characterize the alteration of flood wave properties during its travel downstream. Numerous hydrographs and chemographs of natural flood events were analysed in detail. Additionally, artificial flood events were investigated to study in-channel transport processes.
   During dry weather conditions the gauging station was only representative for a short river segment upstream, owing to discharge and solute concentrations of sources contiguous to the measurement site. During artificial flood events the kinematic wave velocity was considerably faster than the movement of water body and solutes, refuting the idea of a simple mixing process of individual runoff components. Depending on hydrological boundary conditions, the wave at a specific gauge could be entirely composed of old in-channel water, which notably reduces the spatial representativeness of a sampling site. Natural flood events were characterized by a superimposition of local overland flow, riparian water and the kinematic wave process comprising the downstream conveyance of solutes. Summer floods in particular were marked by a chronological occurrence of distinct individual runoff components originating only from a few contributing areas adjacent to the stream and gauge. Thus, the representativeness of a gauge for processes in the whole basin depends on the distance of the nearest significant source to the station. The consequence of our study is that the assumptions of mixing models are not satisfied in river basins larger than 3 km(2). Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Groundwater recharge studies are essential for investigating the feasibility of using the reclaimed lands in Singapore for subsurface storage and recovery of water. Through time-series and spectral analyses, net recharge percentages and stress-filtering characteristics at the reclaimed land were found to depend strongly on the stress transfer velocity, which was a combined function of rainfall pattern and vadose zone thickness. Based on stress transfer velocity, a theory was established to provide logical explanations for the rainfall-recharge relationship, the observed stress-filtering characteristics and the recharge percentage characteristics at the unconfined sandy aquifer. Although the reclaimed land site has a lithollogically homogeneous soil profile, a non-uniform recharge pattern was observed to be influenced pronouncedly by the uneven density distribution of bush grasses. Under a bare soil condition, significantly lower recharge percentages were observed for areas under the influence of offshore tides. The unconfined sandy aquifer appears to dampen out the wave propagation of offshore tides rapidly within a short distance from the tidal source, though it has a fairly straight shoreline and is created from highly compacted sand fills.

AB [1] To represent a heterogeneous unsaturated medium by its homogeneous equivalent, stochastic theory-based analytical formulas and numerical Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain upscaled (effective) flow and transport properties. The Monte Carlo experiments simulate steady state flow and transient transport of nonreactive solute in two-dimensional heterogeneous media. Constitutive relations for unsaturated media at the mesh-size scale are based on the van Genuchten-Mualem relationships. A unit-mean-gradient approach is used to derive upscaled properties for flow parallel and perpendicular to bedding. Upscaled moisture retention and unsaturated conductivities (K) and longitudinal dispersivities are obtained by simulating steady gravity drainage conditions for a series of applied infiltration rates, characteristic of relatively dry conditions in coarse-textured sediments. Macrodispersivities are calculated on the basis of spatial moments of the ensemble-mean plume. Results show that the calculated effective unsaturated K based on the analytical formulas compare well with those based on Monte Carlo simulations. The macroscopic anisotropy (ratio of K parallel to bedding to K perpendicular to bedding) increases with increasing tension, although the increase is rather mild. The longitudinal macrodispersivity for the equivalent homogeneous medium also increases with increasing tension. A comparison of numerical results with stochastic solutions suggests that the computed dispersivities are of the same order of magnitude at low tensions. At higher tensions the dispersivity estimates deviate significantly. Nonetheless, both numerical and analytical results show that the longitudinal dispersivities for flow parallel to bedding are higher than those for flow perpendicular to bedding. In addition, our results suggest that the Fickian regime is reached much earlier for cases with flow perpendicular to bedding than for those with flow parallel to bedding.

AB Hydrological processes in the critical zone are closely related to the soil-bedrock structures. However, the effect of soil thickness on the rainfall-runoff relationship on the hillslope with complex topography remains unclear. Surface runoff, lateral subsurface runoff from soil-epikarst interface, and epikarst runoff from the epikarst-bedrock interface were monitored on two adjacent plots with deep and shallow (66.0 vs. 35.4 cm) soil thicknesses from June 2019 to December 2020 in the karst region of southwest China. During the monitoring period, surface and subsurface runoff account for 20% and 37% of the total runoff in the deep-soil plot (DSP), and 3% and 43% in the shallow-soil plot (SSP). This demonstrates that runoff from the soil-epikarst system is predominant compared to the relatively small contribution of surface runoff. In the SSP, the surface topography wetness index (TWI) was highly coupled with bedrock TWI, and the bedrock TWI had a significant negative linear relationship (p < 0.01) with subsurface runoff. Moreover, isotope hydrogen-separation results showed that subsurface and epikarst runoff were dominated by pre-event water, but a higher contribution of event water was observed in the SSP than in the DSP. These findings supported the hypothesis that rainwater could infiltrate the epikarst more easily in shallow soil slopes. Rainfall and surface runoff exhibited a linear relationship in the dry season and a non-linear relationship in the rainy season, indicating the occurrence of threshold rainfall-runoff behavior. The rainfall amount threshold for surface runoff was higher in DSP (44.7 mm) than in SSP (39.5 mm), and the corresponding variation of rainfall intensity interpretation was greater (54% vs. 38%). For subsurface runoff, the rainfall amount threshold was higher in the DSP than in the SSP (91.0 vs 79.4 mm), and the corresponding variation of soil moisture interpretation was higher (56% vs. 20%). This demonstrated that runoff can be better predicted at deeper soil hillslopes by rainfall and antecedent soil moisture. Accordingly, this study emphasizes the importance of evaluating the spatial heterogeneity of soil thickness in hydrological process research.

AB Oil contaminant migration in an aquifer is analyzed by applying some power law relationships between the porous medium parameters and oil saturation. Such an application generates a self-similar model whose solutions are used to analyze the effect of the porous structure and the oil properties on the oil migration in the aquifer. By using hypothetical saturation data, the model was used to find the characteristic length and time scales of the aquifer, and then to predict the temporal saturation distribution of the oil contamination in the aquifer.

AB This study investigates the terrestrial hydrological processes during a dry climate period in Southwest China by analysing the frequency-dependent runoff and soil moisture responses to precipitation variability. Two headwater sub-basins, the Nanpan and Guihe basins of the West River (Xijiang), are studied to compare and contrast the terrestrial responses. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model is used to simulate the hydrological processes. Using wavelets, the relationships between observed precipitation and simulated runoff/soil moisture are expressed quantitatively. The results indicate that: (a) the Guihe basin shows a greater degree of high-frequency runoff variability in response to regional precipitation; and (b) the Nanpan basin exhibits less capability in accommodating/smoothing extreme precipitation deficits, reflected in terms of both higher scale-averaged (for 3-6 months) and time-averaged (for the year 1963) wavelet power of soil moisture.Editor Z.W.

Deux sous-bassins en particulier, les bassins de Nanpan et de Guihe de la riviere de l'Ouest (Xijiang), ont ete etudies afin de comparer les reponses terrestres.

Les relations entre les precipitations observees et le ruissellement et l'humidite du sol simules ont ete exprimees quantitativement en utilisant des ondelettes. Les resultats indiquent que (a) le bassin de Guihe montre une plus grande variabilite du ruissellement haute frequence en reponse aux precipitations regionales, et (b) le bassin de Nanpan montre moins de capacite a integrer et a lisser des deficits de precipitations extremes, ce qui se traduit en termes de plus grande puissance de l'ondelette de l'humidite du sol moyennee en echelle (3-6 mois) ou en temps (pour l'annee 1963).

AB Given altimetry measurements, the identification capability of time varying inflow discharge Q(in)(t) and the Strickler coefficient K (defined as a power-law in h the water depth) of the 1D river Saint-Venant model is investigated. Various altimetry satellite missions provide water level elevation measurements of wide rivers, in particular the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. An original and synthetic reading of all the available information (data, wave propagation and the Manning-Strickler's law residual) are represented on the so-called identifiability map. The latter provides in the space-time plane a comprehensive overview of the inverse problem features. Inferences based on Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) are investigated at the limit of the data-model inversion capability : relatively short river portions, relatively infrequent observations, that is inverse problems presenting a low identifiability index. The inflow discharge Q(in)(t) is inferred simultaneously with the varying coefficient K(h). The bed level is either given or inferred from a lower complexity model. The experiments and analysis are conducted for different scenarios (SWOT-like or multi-sensors-like). The scenarios differ by the observation frequency and by the identifiability index. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the observation errors and to the first guess values demonstrate the robustness of the VDA inferences. Finally this study aiming at fusing relatively sparse altimetric data and the 1D Saint-Venant river flow model highlights the spatiotemporal resolution lower limit, also the great potential in terms of discharge inference including for a single river reach.

AB The movement of water in a large (3.5 m(3)) undisturbed sample of 22-year-old municipal solid waste has been modeled using a kinematic wave approximation for unsaturated infiltration and internal drainage. The model employs a two-parameter power expression as macroscopic flux law. The model parameters were determined and interpreted in terms of the internal geometry of the waste medium by fitting the model to one set of infiltration and drainage data. The model was validated using another set of data from a sequence of water input events. The results of the validation show that the model performs satisfactorily, but further development of the model to incorporate spatial variability would increase its capability.

AB We study the relationship between the spatial distribution of imperviousness and the space-time variability of rainfall, runoff generation, and hydrologic response. For this study we follow an analytical framework that is able to represent space-time variability and use it to determine relationships for quantities commonly used in hydrology, for example, the amount of rainfall excess, the total runoff from a storm, the runoff ratio of developed land use to undeveloped land use, and the mean time and variance of the runoff time. The relationships are derived such that the space-time variability of rainfall, runoff, and the hydrologic response, and their relative importance, can be identified and compared. In addition, the method allows the separation of pervious and impervious contributions to runoff and the estimation of their relative influence on the hydrologic response. We illustrate the estimation of the relationships from available data and apply them to two cases. In the first case, the space-time variability of rainfall and its interaction with impervious cover is investigated. In the second case, we examine the impacts of the imperviousness pattern on runoff relationships. We find that the imperviousness and rainfall pattern can interact to either increase or decrease the average amount of rainfall excess. We also find that the influence of pervious and impervious contributions on the response can depend on the form of the overall imperviousness pattern. The proposed framework can be a useful tool for identifying the importance of different space-time hydrologic components in mixed pervious-impervious landscapes.

AB Information theory metrics are applied to ascertain the spatial and temporal variability of daily precipitation over the continental United States. Entropy is computed of the daily precipitation records and of the precipitation event size distribution. In addition, relative entropy is also computed between the two records and the Hurst exponent is calculated for comparison purposes. These values show little correlation with mean annual precipitation, number of rain days or station elevation. However, there is a clear spatial pattern in the precipitation and relative entropy fields corresponding to a breakpoint at approximately -95 degrees longitude, which the Hurst exponent is not capable of resolving. Using wavelet multiresolution analysis and relative entropy, this breakpoint is shown to correspond to higher temporal variability (sub-monthly) in the western United States. In addition, scalewise mutual information content illustrates the general feature of three distinct scaling regions for precipitation: (1) synoptic (2-10 days), (2) monthly to annual times and (3) interannual variability. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of an information theory approach to assessing the dynamics of precipitation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) variability occurring over the Indian Ocean and winter rainfall variability in eastern Australia. Six indices of SST variability are compared and their relationship to rainfall over eastern Australia is determined. An analysis of historical rainfall data for Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria reveals that a strong relationship exists between a number of these indices and winter rainfall. In particular, anomalous SSTs over the Indonesian region provide a good indication of winter rainfall variability in eastern Australia. Additionally, this relationship is shown to hold true irrespective of potential impacts on rainfall by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A possible physical process by which the Indian Ocean SST anomalies may influence winter rainfall is proposed, involving their impact on the nature of the northwest Australian cloud band. This study demonstrates marked controls on winter climate variability comparable to that induced in summer by the better known ENSO processes and hence offers improved understanding of year-round seasonal climates.

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; SCALES
AB Groundwater level measurements from 3907 monitoring wells, distributed within 22 major river basins of India, are assessed to characterize their spatial and temporal variability. Groundwater storage (GWS) anomalies (relative to the long-term mean) exhibit strong seasonality, with annual maxima observed during the monsoon season and minima during pre-monsoon season. Spatial variability of GWS anomalies increases with the extent of measurements, following the power law relationship, i.e., log-(spatial variability) is linearly dependent on log-(spatial extent). In addition, the impact of well spacing on spatial variability and the power law relationship is investigated. We found that the mean GWS anomaly sampled at a 0.25 degree grid scale closes to unweighted average over all wells. The absolute error corresponding to each basin grows with increasing scale, i.e., from 0.25 degree to 1 degree. It was observed that small changes in extent could create very large changes in spatial variability at large grid scales. Spatial variability of GWS anomaly has been found to vary with climatic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the effects of well spacing on groundwater spatial variability. The results may be useful for interpreting large scale groundwater variations from unevenly spaced or sparse groundwater well observations or for siting and prioritizing wells in a network for groundwater management. The output of this study could be used to maintain a cost effective groundwater monitoring network in the study region and the approach can also be used in other parts of the globe.

AB Fuzzy theory appears to be extremely effective at handling dynamic, non-linear and noisy data, especially when the underlying physical relationships are not fully understood. Since hydrologists are still uncertain about many of the aspects of the physical processes in the watershed, fuzzy theory has proved to be a very attractive tool enabling them to investigate such problems. The effectiveness of the fuzzy model lies in the identification of the antecedent membership function (MF), which is generally addressed through a fuzzy clustering approach. Most of the applications of fuzzy computing in hydrology seem to have selected the clustering algorithm quite arbitrarily. However, it is apparent that, as the antecedent parameters are based solely on the identified clusters, the method used for clustering should certainly have an impact on the overall performance of the model. This paper presents the results of a study conducted to investigate the impact of choice of clustering algorithm on the overall performance of a fuzzy-based hydrologic model. The research is illustrated through a case study of developing a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model for reservoir inflow forecasting in the Narmada basin, India. The model was developed using two popular clustering techniques, namely Gustafson-Kessel (GK) and subtractive clustering (SC), and was extensively evaluated for performance based on various statistical indices. The results show that the model performance is comparable at a I h lead forecast. However, it is observed that the GK approach results in a better performance than the SC approach in computing forecasts at higher lead times. The analysis suggest that the GK method clusters the input space based on the actual pattern, since it uses a membership-grade weighted-distance measure as the measure of closeness, whereas the SC method classifies the input space more logically according to the magnitude of flow available in the data set.

AB In a series of earlier papers the authors have proposed a unique approach for watershed modelling, which is based on developing watershed-scale balance equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy by averaging the point-scale (microscale) equations over appropriate averaging regions or control volumes (megascale). The regions are referred to as Representative Elementary Watersheds (REWs), as they are considered to be invariant with respect to the spatial scale. Here, the REW-approach is generalized by developing balance equations and constitutive relationships for sub-REW units, referred to as Elements. Similar to an REW, Elements are divided into a series of zones to accommodate typical flow processes. The subdivision of an REW into Elements supports sub-REW-scale process representation. The proposed procedure yields exchange terms for mass, forces and thermal energy across phase and Element boundaries. These terms constitute unknowns and require a systematic closure. The closure is addressed within a thermodynamic approach, in which the Clausius-Duhem inequality formulated for a watershed serves as a mathematical and physical constraint. The present paper represents a clear extension of earlier work, as it includes non-isothermal processes in presence of the conservative gravitational field. The subdivision of an REW into Elements also provides means for including sub-REW variability due to landuse, geology or presence of infrastructure in the watershed. The paper also shows how an REW Element-scale unsaturated flow equation and non-linear reservoir equations for overland and channel flow can be consistently derived within the thermodynamic theory framework.

AB Four-stage single-well push-pull (SWPP) tracer tests, including injection, chasing, resting, and pumping, were conducted in a fractured aquifer at Newark basin. An anomalous transport phenomenon observed in the SWPP tests is the linear decline of breakthrough curves (BTCs) at late time with slope of -1.8 in log-log plots. A time-dependent fractional model is developed to interpret the anomalous transport behavior. This model considers a time-dependent power law memory function and a time-dependent fractional advection-dispersion operator. The fractional advection-dispersion equations (fADE) are solved in a radial coordinate system using the implicit Euler method. A semi-analytical solution of the first-order rate-limited mobile-immobile model (FORMIM) is derived for comparison. It is found that both the nonlocal transport in time and space can produce the long-tailed BTC. A smaller time-fractional or space-fractional index leads to a lower peak concentration and a larger late-time slope. The mass distribution of the fractional-in-space (FS) model exhibits power law decline at the leading plume edge. Early breakthrough during pumping is not observed because the mobile mass at the start of pumping is nonzero and more concentrated near the wellbore. The capacity ratio is an important factor that affects the peak concentration. A larger capacity ratio leads to greater peak concentration. A smaller time-fractional index in the injection, chasing, or resting stage will move the BTC downward and the slope of the late time BTC is determined by the space-fractional index over all stages and the time-fractional index in the pumping stage. The capability of the existing models to recover the BTC of the SWPP test is discussed and some guidelines for how to choose the appropriate model to interpret the SWPP test data are proposed.

AB Regional flood frequency analysis forms the basis for ascertaining design thresholds for extreme flow events for the purpose of resource management and design of hydraulic structures, especially at ungauged or partially gauged basins. A crucial step in this analysis is transferring available information from gauged sites to ungauged sites, which is achieved through delineation of homogeneous regions encompassing multiple catchment locations, followed by the formulation of a flood estimation model. While this process has been accomplished through a range of statistical homogenization alternatives, the present study offers a new approach rooted in the theory of complex networks, offering considerable advantages over what is traditionally followed. Data from 202 sites in Australia representing catchments of varying geographic, climatic, and vegetation attributes are used to assess the alternative proposed. The results are examined via (1) direct comparison of the location and number of homogeneous neighbors from network theory with results using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and (2) assessing the accuracy of estimated flood quantiles by applying a common model that estimates flood quantiles using information from the two alternate groups of homogeneous sites (from network theory and CCA). Results show that network theory offers merit in delineating homogenous regions, with resulting design flood estimates showing improvements across different return periods compared to the CCA alternative used.

The basin, which is located close to Rome (Italy) on the west side of the Apennine chain and just north of the Colli Albani volcano, subsided after development of a north-south fault system (about 115 000 y bp). The AAB experiences intense hydrothermal activity, which has produced a large travertine deposit (80-m thick). The travertine deposit constitutes a fractured aquifer that is the final destination of more than 5m(3)s(-1) of water and is strongly dewatered by quarry activities. The complex hydrogeology of this basin was investigated, revealing two main hydraulically connected aquifers, one thermalised and partly confined into the limestone bedrock and one unconfined in the travertine. The two aquifers are separated by a non-continuous clayey aquiclude. The hydrogeological survey and geological characterisation contributed to the development of the groundwater flow conceptual model. Analysis and comparison of the monitored levels highlighted the pattern of flow between the deep and shallow parts of the flow system. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To consider the non-Darcian nature of groundwater flow and the permeability reduction owing to well and aquifer clogging, an Izbash's law-based analytical model with a time-dependent hydraulic conductivity function is proposed for constant-rate recharge and constant-head recharge. By means of linearization approximations, variable substitutions and the Laplace transform, approximate analytical solutions for the model are derived. Comparison of developed approximate analytical solutions with numerical solutions indicates that the approximate solutions are highly accurate except during the short period of initial recharge stage. The proposed model provides a theoretical basis for managed aquifer recharge involving clogging-related permeability reduction and non-Darcian flow.

ID STUDYING CONNECTIVITY; RIVER
AB To sustainably manage water resources, we must understand how to control complex networked systems. In this paper, we study surface water networks from the perspective of structural controllability, a concept that integrates classical control theory with graph-theoretic formalism. We present structural controllability theory and compute four metrics: full and target controllability, control centrality and control profile (FTCP) that collectively determine the structural boundaries of the system's control space. We use these metrics to answer the following questions: How does the structure of a surface water network affect its controllability? How to efficiently control a preselected subset of the network? Which nodes have the highest control power? What types of topological structures dominate controllability? Finally, we demonstrate the structural controllability theory in the analysis of a wide range of surface water networks, such as tributary, deltaic, and braided river systems.

   SCALE
AB Although interannual streamflow variability is primarily a result of precipitation variability, temperature also plays a role. The relative weakness of the temperature effect at the annual time scale hinders understanding, but may belie substantial importance on climatic time scales. Here we develop and evaluate a simple theory relating variations of streamflow and evapotranspiration (E) to those of precipitation (P) and temperature. The theory is based on extensions of the Budyko water-balance hypothesis, the Priestley-Taylor theory for potential evapotranspiration (E-p), and a linear model of interannual basin storage. The theory implies that the temperature affects streamflow by modifying evapotranspiration through a Clausius-Clapeyron-like relation and through the sensitivity of net radiation to temperature. We apply and test (1) a previously introduced strong extension of the Budyko hypothesis, which requires that the function linking temporal variations of the evapotranspiration ratio (E/P) and the index of dryness (E-p/P) at an annual time scale is identical to that linking interbasin variations of the corresponding long-term means, and (2) a weak extension, which requires only that the annual evapotranspiration ratio depends uniquely on the annual index of dryness, and that the form of that dependence need not be known a priori nor be identical across basins. In application of the weak extension, the readily observed sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation contains crucial information about the sensitivity to potential evapotranspiration and, thence, to temperature. Implementation of the strong extension is problematic, whereas the weak extension appears to capture essential controls of the temperature effect efficiently.
   Plain Language Summary Human communities, economies, and natural ecosystems require a reliable supply of water, and this often is provided by rivers. It has at times been noted that rivers deliver less water in warm years than in cool years, even after adjustment for variations in precipitation. This dependence on temperature raises concerns about the effect of heat waves or climatic warming on water supply. Just why and how much the flow of rivers depends on temperature has not been well understood, but the answers to these questions are relevant for ensuring future water security. Here we present and evaluate a process-based theory that attempts to answer both questions. In those river basins where long-term observations of river flow, temperature, and precipitation data are available, the theory is consistent overall with observed sensitivities of river flows to temperature. This success implies potential applicability of the theory also where such observations are not available.

AB Shallow aquifers are an important source of water resources and provide base flow to streams; yet actual rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to estimate. While climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, the resulting impact on groundwater recharge remains poorly understood. We quantify empirical relations between precipitation characteristics and episodic groundwater recharge for a wide variety of geographic and land use types across North Carolina. We extract storm duration, magnitude, average rate, and hourly weighted intensity from long-term precipitation records over periods of 12-35 years at 10 locations. Using time series of water table fluctuations from nearby monitoring wells, we estimate relative recharge to precipitation ratios (RPR) to identify statistical trends. Increased RPR correlates with increased storm duration, whereas RPR decreases with increasing magnitude, average rate, and intensity of precipitation. Agricultural and urban areas exhibit the greatest decrease in RPR due to increasing storm magnitude, average rate, and intensity, while naturally vegetated areas exhibit a larger increase in RPR with increased storm duration. Though RPR is generally higher during the winter than the summer, this seasonal effect is magnified in the Appalachian and Piedmont regions. These statistical trends provide valuable insights into the likely consequences of climate and land use change for water resources in subtropical climates. If, as predicted, growing seasons lengthen and the intensity of storms increases with a warming climate, decreased recharge in Appalachia, the Piedmont, and rapidly growing urban areas of the American Southeast could further limit groundwater availability.

AB Quantitative hydrogeology often relies on numerical modeling of flow and transport processes in the earth subsurface. Despite the richness of numerical schemes proposed in the literature most applications are performed by using a few very popular codes based on classical finite volume or finite element techniques. An important limitation of these numerical schemes is that they lead to solutions that do not satisfy the refraction law of streamlines at element (or volume) edges. This is not of great concern when the hydraulic conductivity K is spatially homogeneous, or varies smoothly within the computational domain. However, the solution may deteriorate in heterogeneous formations with high contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of adjacent computational cells. We analyze the performance of four widely used classic numerical schemes for solving the flow equation when they are applied to heterogeneous porous media. We first analyze the convergence of the numerical schemes to a known analytical solution in a simple heterogeneous field composed by 4 blocks with contrasting hydraulic conductivities. Then we compare the numerical solutions obtained in both Gaussian and exponential weakly heterogeneous logconductivity fields with existing analytical first- and second-order solutions in the variance of the logconductivity field, sigma(2)(gamma). Our analysis highlights that postprocessing the velocity field to enforce a posteriori the refraction law leads to biased results and that the performance of the numerical scheme depends on how mass conservation is discretized on the computational grid. Numerical schemes using inter-block conductivities, based for example on the harmonic mean, modify the spatial structure of the conductivity, with a negative impact on the structure of the velocity field.

AB To understand mechanisms of long-term hydrological and biogeochemical recovery after forest disturbance, it is important to evaluate recovery times (i.e., time scales associated with the return to baseline or predisturbance conditions) of stream runoff and nitrate concentration. Previous studies have focused on either the response of runoff or nitrate concentration, and some have specifically addressed recovery times following disturbance. However, controlling factors have not yet been elucidated. Knowing these relationships will advance our understanding of each recovery process. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between runoff and nitrate recovery times and identify potential factors controlling each. We acquired long-term runoff and stream water nitrate concentration data from 20 sites in the USA and Japan. We then examined the relationship between runoff and nitrate recovery times at these multiple sites and use these relationships to discuss the ecosystem dynamics following forest disturbance. Nitrate response was detected at all study sites, while runoff responses were detected at all sites with disturbance intensities greater than 75% of the catchment area. The runoff recovery time was significantly correlated with the nitrate recovery time for catchments that had a runoff response. For these catchments, hydrological recovery times were slower than nitrate recovery times. The relationship between these two recovery times suggests that forest regeneration was a common control on both recovery times. However, the faster recovery time for nitrate suggests that nitrogen was less available or less mobile in these catchments than water.

AB Inverse modeling is widely used to assist with forecasting problems in the subsurface. However, full inverse modeling can be time-consuming requiring iteration over a high dimensional parameter space with computationally expensive forward models and complex spatial priors. In this paper, we investigate a prediction-focused approach (PFA) that aims at building a statistical relationship between data variables and forecast variables, avoiding the inversion of model parameters altogether. The statistical relationship is built by first applying the forward model related to the data variables and the forward model related to the prediction variables on a limited set of spatial prior models realizations, typically generated through geostatistical methods. The relationship observed between data and prediction is highly non-linear for many forecasting problems in the subsurface. In this paper we propose a Canonical Functional Component Analysis (CFCA) to map the data and forecast variables into a low-dimensional space where, if successful, the relationship is linear. CFCA consists of (1) functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for dimension reduction of time-series data and (2) canonical correlation analysis (CCA); the latter aiming to establish a linear relationship between data and forecast components. If such mapping is successful, then we illustrate with several cases that (1) simple regression techniques with a multi-Gaussian framework can be used to directly quantify uncertainty on the forecast without any model inversion and that (2) such uncertainty is a good approximation of uncertainty obtained from full posterior sampling with rejection sampling.

AB Fuzzy logic (FL) was applied to simulate latent heat fluxes of six coniferous forests. The goal was to test the application possibilities of fuzzy logic and to evaluate the information that could be derived from it. The data set consisted of five forests of the Euroflux project and a set of the Douglas fir Speulderbos, 1 year before and 1 year after a thinning. A set of models was compared to their performance and interpretability: a general FL model, FL models for the 2 years of the Speulderbos, and a forest growth model parameterized for Douglas fir. The performance of the FL models was close to optimal. The rules of the FL models made objective model comparison possible and showed a change in the sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit of the Speulderbos. Fuzzy logic proved to be a very promising method for top down modeling of forest gas exchange, systematic model evaluation, and model simplification.

AB This study formulates and analyzes continuous time random walk (CTRW) models in radial flow geometries for the quantification of non-local solute transport induced by heterogeneous flow distributions and by mobile-immobile mass transfer processes. To this end we derive a general CTRW framework in radial coordinates starting from the random walk equations for radial particle positions and times. The particle density, or solute concentration is governed by a non-local radial advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Unlike in CTRWs for uniform flow scenarios, particle transition times here depend on the radial particle position, which renders the CTRW non-stationary. As a consequence, the memory kernel characterizing the non-local ADE, is radially dependent. Based on this general formulation, we derive radial CTRW implementations that (i) emulate non-local radial transport due to heterogeneous advection, (ii) model multirate mass transfer (MRMT) between mobile and immobile continua, and (iii) quantify both heterogeneous advection in a mobile region and mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions. The expected solute breakthrough behavior is studied using numerical random walk particle tracking simulations. This behavior is analyzed by explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic solute breakthrough curves. We observe clear power-law tails of the solute breakthrough for broad (power-law) distributions of particle transit times (heterogeneous advection) and particle trapping times (MRMT model). The combined model displays two distinct time regimes. An intermediate regime, in which the solute breakthrough is dominated by the particle transit times in the mobile zones, and a late time regime that is governed by the distribution of particle trapping times in immobile zones. These radial CTRW formulations allow for the identification of heterogeneous advection and mobile-immobile processes as drivers of anomalous transport, under conditions relevant for field tracer tests.

AB Thresholds in precipitation-runoff relationships have been observed in numerous studies using scatter plots comparing meteorological factors and hydrologic response metrics. Most thresholds reported in the literature have been identified from relationships between meteorological factors that quantify volumes or depths of water (e.g., total event rainfall) and metrics capturing hydrologic response magnitude (e.g., runoff ratio), with a strong emphasis on hillslopes and catchments in temperate humid environments. Knowledge gaps, however, remain regarding the ubiquity of hydrologic thresholds across different climatic environments and different meteorological factors that affect different response metrics. This study therefore aimed to evaluate relationships for a wide range of meteorological factors and response metrics derived from event-scale rainfall-runoff analysis for 21 sites spanning seven contrasting geographic areas. Specifically, meteorological factors quantifying rainfall depth, rainfall intensity, and hydrologic abstractions related to evapotranspiration were considered, along with response metrics that describe response timing and response magnitude, leading to 4,557 relationships being evaluated. While rainfall depth thresholds were observed for most sites, rainfall intensity thresholds were also observed. Additionally, threshold behavior was shown to be sensitive to antecedent conditions over specific durations of time preceding a rainfall-runoff event. The large number of relationships evaluated in this study allowed for the development of a typology of threshold dynamics and the formulation of hypotheses about dominant hydrological processes. This typology may not only promote standardized threshold descriptions but also make intersite comparisons of nonlinear rainfall-runoff behavior easier.

ID UNSATURATED FLOW; WATER-CONTENT
AB A method based on an optimal nonlinear filtering technique is proposed and tested for the determination of the hydraulic conductivity function from a field drainage experiment. Simplifications to Richards's equation lead to a Langevin type differential equation to describe the redistribution of stored water as a function of drainage flux excited by a random initial condition and state forcing. The derived equation is then utilized in an optimal estimation scheme that explicitly accounts for the formulation and observation uncertainty in determining the hydraulic conductivity parameters. A field drainage experiment was carried out to study the usefulness of the proposed method for routine in situ hydraulic conductivity function estimation.

AB Understanding hillslope-scale surface runoff generation processes are challenging due to the non-linear interactions among the different hydro-meteorological variables. Often the complex connection between different hydrologic variables is little understood (i.e., the spatial-temporal connection among the same variable and between two different variables). Therefore, in this paper, we present a network theory-based approach to understand the complex connections of hydrological processes. The article mainly focuses on identifying runoff thresholds in grassed (GA) and agro-forested (AgF) hillslopes and on testing of suitability of network theory for explaining the hillslope hydrological processes. After analyzing 22 rainfall events of AgF and 37 events from GA hillslope, our findings highlight that the runoff generation is associated with the peak rainfall intensity, initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall duration. The runoff thresholds of GA hillslope are higher than the AgF hillslope due to its surface resistance and presence of extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity (<6 mm/h) at the upslope location. Further, from network analysis, we found that the network's topology was highly dependent on event characteristics and soil hydraulic conductivity. The strong network connectivity was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes during high runoff generating events as the runoff and infiltration take place simultaneously. However, during the low runoff generating events, a weak connection was observed between runoff and soil moisture nodes as most rainwater infiltrates over the hillslope. The outcomes of this study indicate the usefulness of network theory in hillslope-scale runoff process understanding to identify the significant connections.

AB There is a wide range of evidence to suggest that permeability can be constrained through of induced polarization measurements. For clean sands and sandstones, current mechanistic models of induced polarization predict a relationship between the low-frequency time constant inferred from induced polarization measurements and the grain diameter. A number of observations do, however, disagree with this and indicate that the observed relaxation behavior is rather governed by the so-called dynamic pore radius L. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a set of new scaling relationships, which allow the relaxation time to be computed from the pore size and the permeability to be computed from both the Cole-Cole time constant and the formation factor. Moreover, these new scaling relationships can be also used to predict the dependence of the Cole-Cole time constant as a function of the water saturation under unsaturated conditions. Comparative tests of the proposed new relationships with regard to various published experimental results for saturated clean sands and sandstones as well as for partially saturated clean sandstones, do indeed confirm that the dynamic pore radius L is a much more reliable indicator of the observed relaxation behavior than grain-size-based models.

AB [1] We derive scaling properties of the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves under the condition that temporal rainfall is a stationary multifractal process. We find that under limiting conditions (very short durations D or very long return periods T), the IDF values are simple scaling with a power law dependence on D and T. The exponents of D and T differ in the two limiting cases of very short D and very long T and can be calculated from the moment scaling function K(q) of the rainfall time series. These theoretical findings differ from those of previous studies. They are validated through direct calculation and analysis of an actual rainfall record.

AB Henry Darcy and Jules Dupuit were born 1 year apart, were classmates during their undergraduate and graduate education in civil engineering, and were colleagues in the French corps of civil engineers, with overlapping appointments as inspector general in the early 1850s. At that time Darcy turned over, to Dupuit, his position as Director of Water and Bridges in Paris and the research on pipe flow he had begun there in 1849. In these pipe flow experiments, Darcy discovered what he referred to as a "law'' of fluid mechanics, which is that above a certain velocity threshold, the head loss is proportional to velocity squared, and below that threshold, the head loss is linearly proportional to velocity. During the remainder of their careers, Darcy and Dupuit applied this law with their collective, extensive, prior knowledge of fluid mechanics, geology, aquifers, wells, and springs to quantitative studies of fluid flow in the subsurface ( and also in pipes, aqueducts, rivers, and sand filters). Two monographs by Darcy ( 1856) and Dupuit ( 1857) are mutually cited retrospectives on much of this research, submitted at nearly the same time, to the same Corps des Ponts et Chaussees publisher, near the end of their careers. Between these two monographs, many of the fundamentals of quantitative hydrogeology were established, including the equation for groundwater motion, average linear velocity, average travel time, effective hydraulic conductivity for layered heterogeneity, conservation of mass in confined and unconfined flow, the nature of the regional pieziometric surface, porous flow versus flow through discrete fractures and karst conduits, the equation for a cone of depression around flowing wells, superposition of the effects of multiple wells, and capture zone geometries of wells within a regional flow field.

AB Many earth and environmental (as well as a host of other) variables, Y, and their spatial (or temporal) increments, Y, exhibit non-Gaussian statistical scaling. Previously we were able to capture key aspects of such non-Gaussian scaling by treating Y and/or Y as sub-Gaussian random fields (or processes). This however left unaddressed the empirical finding that whereas sample frequency distributions of Y tend to display relatively mild non-Gaussian peaks and tails, those of Y often reveal peaks that grow sharper and tails that become heavier with decreasing separation distance or lag. Recently we proposed a generalized sub-Gaussian model (GSG) which resolves this apparent inconsistency between the statistical scaling behaviors of observed variables and their increments. We presented an algorithm to generate unconditional random realizations of statistically isotropic or anisotropic GSG functions and illustrated it in two dimensions. Most importantly, we demonstrated the feasibility of estimating all parameters of a GSG model underlying a single realization of Y by analyzing jointly spatial moments of Y data and corresponding increments, Y. Here, we extend our GSG model to account for noisy measurements of Y at a discrete set of points in space (or time), present an algorithm to generate conditional realizations of corresponding isotropic or anisotropic random fields, introduce two approximate versions of this algorithm to reduce CPU time, and explore them on one and two-dimensional synthetic test cases.

TI Bayesian analysis of input uncertainty in hydrological modeling: 1.
   Theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CALIBRATION
AB [1] Parameter estimation in rainfall-runoff models is affected by uncertainties in the measured input/output data (typically, rainfall and runoff, respectively), as well as model error. Despite advances in data collection and model construction, we expect input uncertainty to be particularly significant (because of the high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation) and to remain considerable in the foreseeable future. Ignoring this uncertainty compromises hydrological modeling, potentially yielding biased and misleading results. This paper develops a Bayesian total error analysis methodology for hydrological models that allows (indeed, requires) the modeler to directly and transparently incorporate, test, and refine existing understanding of all sources of data uncertainty in a specific application, including both rainfall and runoff uncertainties. The methodology employs additional (latent) variables to filter out the input corruption given the model hypothesis and the observed data. In this study, the input uncertainty is assumed to be multiplicative Gaussian and independent for each storm, but the general framework allows alternative uncertainty models. Several ways of incorporating vague prior knowledge of input corruption are discussed, contrasting Gaussian and inverse gamma assumptions; the latter method avoids degeneracies in the objective function. Although the general methodology is computationally intensive because of the additional latent variables, a range of modern numerical methods, particularly Monte Carlo analysis combined with fast Newton-type optimization methods and Hessian-based covariance analysis, can be employed to obtain practical solutions.

AB This research studies the perceptions of individuals concerning reused drinking water. Individuals' visceral responses may stigmatize reused water as the water's immediate origin is too clear. In this context, we show how individuals grow more accepting of reused water when their decisions consider others, as opposed to just themselves. First, differences between private and public decision making are quantified using willingness to accept (WTA) data collected in economic experiments. Adult participants first made decisions in a second-price auction (private rounds) followed by majority-rule voting (public rounds) on the median price collected in the private rounds. Our results show that participants in the public rounds significantly reduce their WTA. Moreover, a communication treatment using chat boxes further reduced participants' WTA. The recorded chat indicated that particularly messages related to humor and persuasion were powerful influences on participants' voting decisions. The results have applications for sustainable, cost-effective recycled water projects.

AB An iterative method was applied to daily crop reference evaporation ETo. The method correctly evaluated the slope of the saturation water vapour pressure vs temperature relationship between surface temperature and air temperature. Using daily meterological data spanning several decades from four selected locations in Australia, South Africa and USA, differences in ETo estimates were noted with and without the iteration method applied. The largest difference, which occurred under high water vapour pressure deficit conditions, ranged from 1.65 mm/day for Griffith, Australia to 0.51 mm/day for Pretoria, South Africa. The aerodynamic component of the ETo equation was more affected by not applying the spreadsheet iterative procedure compared to the radiative component. Other spreadsheet examples of the iterative method employed included obtaining the roots of a depressed cubic polynomial in the air temperature surface renewal (SR) ramp. This value was used for the measurement of sensible heat flux using surface renewal. An iterative method, together with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and surface-layer scintillometer (SLS) measurements in a mesic grassland, was also used to calculate the sensible heat flux, The simple iterative method is quick, accurate and convenient, easy to repeat following changes to equations or data, allows easy manipulation and allows convenient visual inspection of data and graphics. Sub-hourly measurements of sensible heat flux for the mesic grassland using SR and SLS MOST iterative methods compared favourably with Bowen ratio and eddy covariance measurements.

AB [1] Large-scale capillary pressure [(P) over barc((S) over barw)] and effective permeability-saturation [k(nw)((S) over barw)] constitutive relationships for an incompressible, two-phase system have been developed for a two-dimensional, nonorthogonal fracture network utilizing numerical simulation. The simulations account for capillary, viscous, and gravity effects consistent with the Darcian approach adopted for this study, and were performed within the scale of the REV of the system which was consistent for both single and multiphase flow behavior. The large-scale (P) over barc((S) over barw) relationship for steady state flow conditions was found to be sensitive to the mean and the variance of the underlying aperture distribution as well as the nonwetting phase density. The overall effects of varying the aperture statistics on the relationships were found to be analogous to porous media, with an increased mean aperture leading to lower capillary pressures and an increased aperture variance leading to steeper curves. The large-scale k(nw)((S) over barw) curves representative of flow in the vertical direction followed the general form of the underlying local-scale Brooks-Corey constitutive relationship and were relatively insensitive to a change in variance of the aperture distribution. The large-scale k(nw)((S) over barw) curves representing flow in the horizontal direction due to an imposed gradient in the vertical direction, however, are significantly different than the underlying local-scale relationships, showing maximum values at intermediate saturations. The ratio of vertical to horizontal effective permeability is saturation dependent.

AB The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) has been widely used and thoroughly tested in many places in the world. The application of the SWAT model has pointed out that 2 of the major weaknesses of SWAT are related to the nonspatial reference of the hydrologic response unit concept and to the simplified groundwater concept, which contribute to its low performance in baseflow simulation and its inability to simulate regional groundwater flow. This study modified the groundwater module of SWAT to overcome the above limitations. The modified groundwater module has 2 aquifers. The local aquifer, which is the shallow aquifer in the original SWAT, represents a local groundwater flow system. The regional aquifer, which replaces the deep aquifer of the original SWAT, represents intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems. Groundwater recharge is partitioned into local and regional aquifer recharges. The regional aquifer is represented by a multicell aquifer (MCA) model. The regional aquifer is discretized into cells using the Thiessen polygon method, where centres of the cells are locations of groundwater observation wells. Groundwater flow between cells is modelled using Darcy's law. Return flow from cell to stream is conceptualized using a non-linear storage-discharge relationship. The SWAT model with the modified aquifer module, the so-called SWAT-MCA, was tested in 2 basins (Wipperau and Neetze) with porous aquifers in a lowland area in Lower Saxony, Germany. Results from the Wipperau basin show that the SWAT-MCA model is able (a) to simulate baseflow in a lowland area (where baseflow is a dominant source of streamflow) better than the original model and (b) to simulate regional groundwater flow, shown by the simulated groundwater levels in cells, quite well.

AB We have developed a methodology for inverting tracer test data using zonation information obtained from two-dimensional radar tomograms to improve the (typically overly smooth) hydraulic conductivity fields obtained from conventional inversion of tracer test data. The method simultaneously yields two-dimensional estimates of hydraulic conductivity as well as petrophysical relationships that relate hydraulic conductivity to radar velocity; these relationships can be assumed to be stationary throughout the area of investigation or to vary as a function of zonation. Using a synthetic three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field, we apply the developed inversion methodology and explore the impact of the strength and stationarity of the petrophysical relationship as well as the impact of errors that are often associated with radar data acquisition (such as unknown borehole deviation). We find that adding radar tomographic data to tracer test data improves hydrogeological site characterization, even in the presence of minor radar data errors. The results are contingent on the assumption that a relationship between radar velocity and hydraulic conductivity exists. Therefore the applicability of the proposed method may be limited to field sites where this condition is partially or fully satisfied.

AB Projection of extreme rainfall under climate change remains an area of considerable uncertainty. In the absence of geographically consistent simulations of extreme rainfall for the future, alternatives relying on physical relationships between a warmer atmosphere and its moisture carrying capacity are projected, scaling with a known atmospheric covariate. The most common atmospheric covariate adopted is surface air temperature, as it exhibits great consistency across climate model simulations into the future and, as per the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, has a well-established link to atmospheric moisture capacity. However, empirical assessments of this relationship show that it varies with latitude, surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and other factors, suggesting there may be more stable "global" atmospheric covariates that could be used instead. We argue that a better-suited covariate would be one that captures the relationship between extreme rainfall and temperature but exhibits greater consistency in the relationship across regions as well as climatic zones. Our analysis identifies plausible atmospheric indicators of changes to future extreme rainfall, which now proliferate literature and compare their suitability based on the variability they exhibit across multiple geographical, topographic, and climatic zones within Australia. It is shown that surface air temperature exhibits a regionally inconsistent relationship with extreme rainfall and hence is not suitable for projecting to future conditions. The study identified integrated water vapor and surface dew point temperature as promising alternatives, with the former showing greater consistency in space but at the cost of reduced temporal coverage.
   Plain Language Summary Studies of extreme rainfall sensitivity to temperature (termed scaling) improve our understanding of how extreme rainfall can be expected to change under global warming. The widespread and intuitive use of surface air temperature in rainfall scaling studies is likely the result of its observational availability and its apparent physical relationship with extreme rainfall. This study investigates the reliability of surface air temperature, integrated water vapor, surface dew point temperature, and 850 hPa atmospheric temperature as possible covariates for rainfall projection. Consistent with observed increases in extreme rainfall, a covariate that exhibits consistency across varying climatic conditions will result in more robust projections of future extreme rainfall. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of each covariate to varying conditions exhibited by the broad climates found across Australia. Integrated water vapor, retrieved from satellites, is found to be the most suitable scaling covariate for extreme rainfall projection.

AB The proper placement of soil and water conservation measures cannot be designated due to lack of appropriate technical prioritization of different areas of a watershed. Therefore, quantifying soil erosion hazard and spatial prioritization of sub-watersheds would aid in better watershed management planning. Although, many approaches have been applied to prioritize sub-watersheds, but still the efficient techniques like game theory have not been practically applied to prioritize sub-watersheds. The present study therefore has used the game theory to prioritize sub-watersheds in Gorganroud and Qareh Sou watersheds in Golestan Province, northern Iran. Towards this goal, 38 independent factors were classified in seven components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method with one representative variable in each component. The Condorcet method used for prioritization of effective variables indicated that the percent of forestry lands (52 scores) and discharge with 10 years of return period (32 scores) were respectively the most and the least effective variables on sediment yield. The Fallback bargaining and the Borda Scoring algorithms were also selected to prioritize study sub-watersheds based on weighted grades of total score for each variable. Accordingly, the aforesaid algorithms classified sub-watersheds in three categories. Comparison of results similarly introduced Galikesh, QazaqIi, Gonbad, Siyah Ab and Tamar as first ranked sub-watersheds with the worth condition, Tangrah and Naharkhoran as second priority and eventually Pole Ordougah as sub-watershed with the lowest priority.

AB An Eulerian perturbation approach was applied to develop a method of moment for solute transport in a nonstationary, fractured medium. The conceptualized fractured medium is described through a dual-porosity model. Stochastic governing equations for mean concentration and concentration covariance were analytically derived to the first-order accuracy of log-conductivity variance and solved with a numerical method-a finite difference method. The developed method is called a numerical Eulerian method of moment (NEMM). This method was compared with the stationary transport theory [Water Resour. Res. 36(7) (2000) 1665] for predicting mean concentration and its spatial moments. The comparison indicated that the two methods matched very well in predicting first and second spatial moments. NEMM solutions were also compared with Monte Carlo simulations for solute transport in stationary fractured media. The results of the two methods were consistent for calculating small log conductivity variance. The theory was then used to study effects of various parameters and nonstationarity of the medium on flow and transport processes. Results indicated that medium nonstationarity would significantly influence the solute transport process. The nonstationary transport theory relaxes many assumptions adopted in stationary theories and paves the way for applying the NEMM to many environmental projects, especially in analyzing uncertainty of solute transport.

ID ENCODER-DECODER NETWORKS
AB Active researches are currently being performed to incorporate the wealth of scientific knowledge into data-driven approaches (e.g., neural networks) in order to improve the latter's effectiveness. In this study, the Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN) is proposed for deep learning of subsurface flow. In the TgNN, as supervised learning, the neural network is trained with available observations or simulation data while being simultaneously guided by theory (e.g., governing equations, other physical constraints, engineering controls, and expert knowledge) of the underlying problem. The TgNN can achieve higher accuracy than the ordinary Deep Neural Network (DNN) because the former provides physically feasible predictions and can be more readily generalized beyond the regimes covered with the training data. Furthermore, the TgNN model is proposed for subsurface flow with heterogeneous model parameters. Several numerical cases of two-dimensional transient saturated flow are introduced to test the performance of the TgNN. In the learning process, the loss function contains data mismatch, as well as PDE constraint, engineering control, and expert knowledge. After obtaining the parameters of the neural network by minimizing the loss function, a TgNN model is built that not only fits the data, but also adheres to physical/engineering constraints. Predicting the future response can be easily realized by the TgNN model. In addition, the TgNN model is tested in more complicated scenarios, such as prediction with changed boundary conditions, learning from noisy data or outliers, transfer learning, learning from sparse data, and engineering controls. Numerical results demonstrate that the TgNN model achieves much better predictability, reliability, and generalizability than DNN models due to the physical/engineering constraints in the former.

TI Significance of fracture rim zone heterogeneity for tracer transport in

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MATRIX DIFFUSION; POROSITY; FLOW
AB Conducting fractures of crystalline rock are typically altered over long periods of time. The fracture rim zone, a result of these alterations, will as a rule have different physical and chemical properties from the unaltered ("fresh'') rock, depending on various microscopic and macroscopic factors of the alterations. In this paper, we study the impact of rim zone heterogeneity, exemplified by a decreasing porosity trend as inferred from the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory site (Sweden), on short- and long-term tracer transport. Our main finding is that this particular rim zone structure will have a dominant effect on transport of moderately to strongly sorbing tracers on experimental time scales and a notable effect on application time scales. The findings of this work lend further support to the interpretation of the relatively strong retention reported by Cvetkovic et al. The fracture rim zone porosity structure may provide an additional safety margin for sorbing radionuclides in crystalline rock at sites where fracture alteration is prevalent.

AB The realistic representation of terrain in hydrological models of fluvial landscapes poses problems particularly for representing convergence and divergence of lateral flows. In this work we consider the topology of contour representation of surfaces. The networks of ridge and drainage lines are linked at critical points: peaks, saddles, confluences, and simple ridge junctions. The properties of these points are given, and from these, three topologic rules are derived. These are used to develop an automatic procedure for generating a catchment boundary and a modified flow net. Use of the flow net increases speed by 2 orders of magnitude over earlier contour-based topographic analyses, and the use of topology increases speed, accuracy, and sophistication over a recent flow net technique. Topology is used to evaluate simplifications of natural surfaces and, in particular, shows the unsuitability of the common ridge-to-stream rectangular flow strip. Finally, implications for the structure of distributed catchment models and for designing and interpreting field experiments are considered.

AB Colloid filtration theory (CFT) is a conceptual construct for predicting the characteristic rate of colloid-surface collisions during transport in granular porous media. A central product of this theory is the correlation equation for predicting collection-efficiency (eta), based exclusively on theoretical model development. Specifically, the eta-equation has terms combining dimensionless groups (of physicochemical properties) with unknown parameters that are usually fitted so that the predicted eta matches that determined by colloid-surface collisions simulated in idealized pore-scale models. In this study, we replace the simulated colloid-surface collisions in idealized models with experimental column-scale data on apparent colloid-surface collisions. A new correlation equation is obtained by minimizing the difference between eta determined by the correlation equation and that determined experimentally, using data from a collection of experiments for favorable conditions for colloid filtration. In this way, we parameterize a mechanistically based eta-equation with empirical evidence. The impact of different properties of colloids and porous media is studied by comparing experimental properties with different terms of the correlation equation. This comparison enables insight about the different processes that occur during colloid transport and retention in porous media, such as diffusion and interception, and provides directions for future CFT developments that will need to account for these processes differently than the current theory does. Additionally, we find that while most of the parameters of the presented eta-equation are only slightly different than those proposed in previous theoretical studies, the match between theory and observation is significantly improved. For the available experimental data, which provide a reasonable representation of property ranges for many applications of CFT, the proposed equation provides a closer match to the experimentally measured collection efficiencies compared to available theories to date.

AB The problem of groundwater contamination in an aquifer is one with many uncertainties. Properly quantifying these uncertainties is essential in order to make reliable probabilistic-based predictions and decisions regarding remediation strategies. In this work, a measure-theoretic framework is employed to quantify uncertainties in a simplified groundwater contamination transport model. Given uncertain data from observation wells, the stochastic inverse problem is solved numerically to obtain a probability measure on the space of unknown model parameters characterizing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in an aquifer, as well as unknown model boundary or source terms such as the contaminant source release into the environment. This probability measure is used to make predictions of future contaminant concentrations and to analyze possible remediation techniques. The ability to identify regions of small but nonzero probability using this method is illustrated.

AB Whathydraulic information can be gained from remotely sensed observations of a river's surface? In this study, weanalyze the relationship between river bed undulations and water surfaces for an ungauged reach of the Xingu River, a first-order tributary of the Amazon river. This braided reach is crosscut more than 10 times by a ENVISAT (ENVironmental SATellite) track that extends over 100 km. Rating curves based on a modeled discharge series and altimetric measurements are used, including the zero-flow depth Z(0) parameter, which describes river's bathymetry. River widths are determined from JERS (Japanese Earth Ressources Satellite) images. Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in the geometry of a river bed produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, as well as in its slope. Observation of these changes is a goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, which has a final objective of determining river discharge. First, the concept of hydraulic visibility is introduced, and the seasonality of water surface slope is highlighted along with different flow regimes and reach behaviors. Then, we propose a new single-thread effective hydraulic approach for modeling braided rivers flows, based on the observation scales of current satellite altimetry. The effective hydraulic model is able to reproduce water surface elevations derived by satellite altimetry, and it shows that hydrodynamical signatures are more visible in areas where the river bed morphology varies significantly and for reaches with strong downstream control. The results of this study suggest that longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the analysis of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission that will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevations, the slopes, and the reach widths.

TI Reservoir management to balance ecosystem and human needs: Incorporating
   the paradigm of the ecological flow regime
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; RIVER; OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION; MODEL; FISH
AB The history of environmental flow analysis shows a shift from an emphasis on a flat line minimum flow requirement to the development of a holistic, regime-based, approach to flow management. The ecological flow regime determines environmental flow by embracing the multitude of species within an ecosystem rather than emphasizing a single species. Moreover, this paradigm recognizes that flow magnitude, duration, frequency, timing, and predictability must be incorporated into any flow management strategy. In this study, the ecological flow regime paradigm is used to establish such comprehensive and complex management targets for operating a reservoir to satisfy a downstream aquatic ecosystem. The new paradigm incorporates the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which holds that ecosystems are healthier under disturbances that are neither too small nor too large. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to find the Pareto set of operating rules that provides decision makers with the optimal trade-off between human needs and ecological flow regime maintenance.

AB Applying physically based models that include preferential flow (PF) is still very challenging at the catchment scale. A gravity-driven film flow approach could be a promising concept for modeling PF as it only requires a small number of parameters. We tested if this approach can be used for different soils and land covers within a 247 km(2) catchment and if we can find generalizable relationships of the film flow parameters to site or rainfall properties. We used a unique data set from a soil moisture sensor network with 135 instrumented soil profiles in three different geologies (slate, marl, and sandstone) and two land covers (forest and grassland) and fitted the film flow model to around 1,700 infiltration events. The results demonstrate that the physical relationship of film flow was capable to predict wetting front velocity (v) and flow parameters from rainfall input (q(s)) alone. This relationship was pronounced in grassland sites but weaker for forest sites, probably due to heterogeneity of the rainfall input underneath the canopy. Incorporating the water content into the v-q(s) relationship did not improve the quality, but showed that for the film flow the rainfall input and hence gravity is in fact the dominant driver and not capillarity. Furthermore, abstraction of water into the soil matrix during film flow is an important process to be included into the framework with reasonable agreements for marl and sandstone using a multiple linear regression. Film flow and corresponding functional parameter relationships for other regions could improve catchment wide PF modeling in the future.

AB Laboratory analysis of single-phase water and airflow through a real rock joint under increasing confining pressure was carried out in order to assess the linearity or otherwise of the Reynolds number ( Re) versus pressure change relationship and to also test the applicability of Forchheimer's relation. These tests were conducted on a granitic specimen, 110 mm high and 55 mm in diameter, with a single natural fracture running the height of the specimen, which had a matrix permeability of approximately 10(-18) m(2). The single-phase Re versus pressure change relationship using water was confirmed as being quadratic in nature. This same relationship held for single-phase airflow but only for confining pressures below around 2.0 MPa. At confining pressures >= 3.0 MPa the relationship shifted in form to a cubic fit. In analyzing the application of Forchheimer's transmissivity relation to single-phase water flow it was concluded that the model was appropriate for all tested confining pressures ( 0.55-3.0 MPa). When assessing its applicability to single-phase airflow, the model was only accurate at low-confining pressures (< 1.0 MPa). Further, it was found that an increase in confining pressure shifted the Forchheimer's transmissivity curve downward.

AB This study explores the climatic controls of the long-term energy partitioning of net radiation into sensible heat and latent heat at watershed scale, by following a data-guided approach. Collected data shows that the relationship between the evaporative fraction (ratio of latent heat to net radiation) and the aridity index (ratio of energy supply to water supply), which represents the climatic conditions at watershed scale, follows a trend similar to the Budyko curve. To explore the physical basis of this relationship, we hypothesize that there are mediating factors connecting energy partitioning with climate. Two potential mediating factors are considered, namely the equilibrium root zone soil moisture and land-air temperature difference. We extract empirical relationships between the mediating factors and the partitioning fractions of water and energy fluxes based on observational data in 219 study watersheds across the contiguous US. With the obtained empirical relationships, we analytically derive two alternate Budyko-type equations for energy partitioning, for each of the two mediating factors separately. Both equations show similar trends as the Budyko curve. We also derive a function to relate energy partitioning to water partitioning Budyko-type equations, suggesting a close connection between the two. The study brings out the mediating roles of soil moisture and temperature gradient that connect water/energy partitioning with climate over long timescales in watersheds. In the process, the analysis results also provide useful insights about complex watershed system behavior. The observed relationships can be used to constrain hydrological and Earth system models and thus improve modeling performance.

AB Storms and the resultant floods have always been catastrophic disasters and raised increasing global concerns in the context of climate change. However, the relationships between storms and floods remain largely elusive. Here we examine the storm-flood relationship and its variations in the Upper Chao Phraya River Basin (UCPRB), a typical tropical monsoon basin in southeast Asia. The distributions of storms and floods are characterized by statistical models with the aid of climatic and land surface covariates. The storm-flood relationship is depicted by the concept of storm-flood elasticity, which represents the corresponding changes in flood peaks in response to changes in the storm peaks with the same return period. The storm-flood elasticity coefficients for 100-year return period events range from 0.61 to 1.20, and the values of storm-flood elasticity coefficients tend to be smaller for long-return period events than for short-return-period events, under high-typhoon-precipitation (high-TP), high-non-typhoon-precipitation (high-nTP), and low-forest (low -F) conditions, and in humid regions than in arid regions. The climatic covariates are shown to have stronger effects on the storm-flood elasticity coefficient than the land surface covariate in most basins. In the basins where deforestation shows strong impacts on the storm-flood relationship, afforestation can be an effective approach for flood control. In most basins in the UCPRB, the variation of typhoon precipitation has larger impacts than those of non-typhoon precipitation, indicating that typhoon precipitation should be paid more attention to when considering the future changes in floods. The findings help develop a better understanding of storm-flood relationships in tropical monsoon re-gions, and the methods of this study can also be applied in other climate regions.

AB Diverse linear and nonlinear statistical parameters of rainfall under aggregation in time and the kind of temporal memory are investigated. Data sets from the Andes of Colombia at different resolutions (15 min and 1-h), and record lengths (21 months and 8-40 years) are used. A mixture of two timescales is found in the autocorrelation and autoinformation functions, with short-term memory holding for time lags less than 15-30 min, and long-term memory onwards. Consistently, rainfall variance exhibits different temporal scaling regimes separated at 15-30 min and 24 h. Tests for the Hurst effect evidence the frailty of the R/S approach in discerning the kind of memory in high resolution rainfall, whereas rigorous statistical tests for short-memory processes do reject the existence of the Hurst effect.
   Rainfall information entropy grows as a power law of aggregation time, S(T) similar to T-beta with <beta > = 0.51, up to a timescale, T-maxEnt (70-202 h), at which entropy saturates, with beta = 0 onwards. Maximum entropy is reached through a dynamic Generalized Pareto distribution, consistently with the maximum information-entropy principle for heavy-tailed random variables, and with its asymptotically infinitely divisible property. The dynamics towards the limit distribution is quantified. Tsallis q-entropies also exhibit power laws with T, such that S-q(T) similar to T-beta(q), with beta(q) <= 0 for q <= 0, and beta(q) similar or equal to 0.5 for q >= 1. No clear patterns are found in the geographic distribution within and among the statistical parameters studied, confirming the strong variability of tropical Andean rainfall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large lake floodplains have important roles in mitigating floods and providing vital habitats for wetland biota. This paper explores the hydrology of the extensive floodplains of Poyang Lake (China) to highlight complex, hysteretic relationships in the inundation dynamics, which are controlled by the heterogeneity of the land surface and time-varying exchanges between the Lake, its catchment and the Yangtze River. A physics-based hydrodynamic model of the system was used to evaluate the development and degree of hysteresis in the relationships between the flooded area, the water storage volume and the water level elevation. The modeling results indicate that the degree of hysteresis varies spatially with point of reference within the Lake. It is noted that a clockwise hysteresis is present for the majority of the Lake, but a counter-clockwise hysteresis is present at the upstream boundary, similar to a river-floodplain behavior. Both the floodplain and the permanently inundated region contribute to Poyang Lake's volume-stage hysteretic effects. The time-varying inflow from rivers in the catchment is the major factor affecting hysteresis, rather than Yangtze River controls on Lake discharge. As expected, an increase in land surface roughness (representing denser vegetation cover) produced greater hysteresis, most notably in the storage curve and derived mainly from the floodplain region. Hysteresis is an important characteristic of the floodplain hydrology that needs to be incorporated in simpler models of the inundation dynamics to avoid errors of up to 50% in the floodplain water storage. The current study shows for the first time the hysteretic nature, and its major causal factors, of the hydrology of a large lake-floodplain system. An improved understanding of Poyang Lake floodplain behavior is offered to guide the future development of water management models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Using complexity science and negotiation theory to resolve

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Complexity; Water Diplomacy; Negotiation
ID IRRIGATION; POLICY
AB Many water governance and management issues are complex. The complexity of these issues is related to crossing of multiple boundaries: political, social and jurisdictional, as well as physical, ecological and biogeochemical. Resolution of these issues usually requires interactions of many parties with conflicting values and interests operating across multiple boundaries and scales to make decisions. The interdependence and feedback among interacting variables, processes, actors and institutions are hard to model and difficult to forecast. Thus, decision-making related to complex water problems needs be contingent and adaptive. This paper draws on a number of ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory that may make it easier to cope with the complexities and difficulties of managing boundary crossing water disputes. It begins with the Water Diplomacy Framework that was developed and tested over the past several years. Then, it uses three key ideas from complexity science (interdependence and interconnectedness; uncertainty and feedback; emergence and adaptation) and three from negotiation theory (stakeholder identification and engagement; joint fact finding; and value creation through option generation) to show how application of these ideas can help enhance effectiveness of water management.

TI Estimation of rain kinetic energy from radar reflectivity and/or rain
   rate based on a scaling formulation of the raindrop size distribution
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; SPECTRA; FRANCE
AB This study offers an approach to estimate the rainfall kinetic energy (KE) by rain intensity (R) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) separately or jointly on the basis of a one-or two-moment scaled raindrop size distribution (DSD) formulation, which contains (1) R and/or Z observations and (2) the dimensionless probability density function (pdf) of a scaled raindrop diameter. The key point is to explain all variability of the DSD by the evolution of the explaining moments (R and Z); hence the pdf is considered as constant. A robust method is proposed to estimate the climatological values of the parameters with a 28 month DSD data set collected in the Cevennes-Vivarais region of France. Three relationships (KE-R, KE-Z, and KE-RZ), which link the observations (R and/or Z) to rainfall kinetic energy (KE), are established. As expected, the assessment using the disdrometer data indicates that (1) because of the proximity of the moment orders, the KE-Z relationship exhibits less variability than the KE-R relationship and (2) the combination of R and Z yields a significant improvement of the estimation of KE compared to the single-moment formulations. Subsequently, a first attempt to spatialize the kinetic energy using radar and rain gauge measurements is presented for a convective event, showing a promising potential for erosion process studies. Different from the application with the disdrometer data, the performance of the KE-Z relationship degrades compared to the KE-R relationship as a result of a bias and/or the sampling characteristics of the radar data.

AB The catchment water-energy balance at the interannual scale remains a challenge for bridging the important gap in our knowledge of the hydrologic cycle. This study investigates interannual evapotranspiration (ET) variability and water-energy balance at over 547 catchments across the contiguous United States in different climate zones. The investigation is based on ET data estimated from satellite images and surface daily meteorological data during the period of 1983-2006 provided by the University of Montana. We find that the interannual relationship between annual potential ET to annual precipitation (PET/P) and ET/P, the energy, and water factors defined with the Budyko curve framework can be captured by a linear function, with an average goodness of fit of 0.928 over all the catchments. The linear relationship is validated by another independent remote sensing ET product generated by the University of Washington and is demonstrated to be rational using regression diagnostics. Additionally, a comparison study using a water balance method and the Budyko curve is undertaken to examine the linear relationship. In addition to water supply and energy supply, the primary controls on evapotranspiration, soil water storage, response of vegetation to climate variability, and human interference are also major factors of the interannual relationship between PET/P and ET/P.

AB Aquifers with quasi-linear flow pattern are frequently envisaged in fractured zones, in oil, gas or enhanced geothermal reservoirs, or in civil engineering where cut-off walls are constructed. The water flow towards a well in this linear aquifer system has been long investigated under Darcian flow condition, but remains an open issue for non-Darcian flow. In this study, a general linearization approximation strategy is suggested for the Forchheimer equation, and an analytical solution is proposed by using Laplace transform for non-Darcian flow towards a well in aquifers laterally bounded by no-flow barriers. Numerical simulations using the finite volume method prove that the linearization approximation performs best when it takes the mean of two commonly-used strategies, and the analytical model is sufficiently accurate at late times for observation wells located moderately far from the source. The proposed model was applied to data interpretation of the pumping tests at the Changheba dam foundation bounded by two cut-off walls in Southwest China, where the drawdown curves can be divided into 1D flow, transitional flow and 2D flow stages as a result of lateral flow through weathered bedrocks at late times. The proposed model provides a valuable tool for characterizing the hydraulic properties of aquifers and reservoirs with a linear flow pattern and for assessing the possible leakage through the lateral barriers by type curve matching.

ID FREE OVERFALL
AB Free overfall at the abrupt end of a channel offers a simple method for measurement of discharge from a single measurement of depth of flow at the brink. The theoretical procedure applied to compute discharge over a weir is applied to the free overfall to obtain end-depth-discharge relationship for subcritical and super critical flows. Pressure distribution at the brink, which is assumed a quadratic parabola, is incorporated in the analysis. A closed form equation for discharge in terms of end depth for subcritical flows was proposed and validated earlier with available experimental data in place of a derived implicit complex equation. Direct solution for discharge for known end depth is provided in the graphical form for super critical flows. Verification of this solution with available experimental data revealed that comparison is not as good as it is observed in subcritical flows. The difference in computed and observed results is attributed to the greater effect of streamline curvature and estimation of pressure factor in the supercritical flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Key Points <list list-type="bulleted"> Limited transverse mixing predicts discharge never reaches the opposite bank. Power-law decay of peak concentration can considerably reduce invasion risks. Distinct travels speeds occur across the wide channel due to velocity shear.
   Ballast-water-vectored biological invasions in water bodies are subject to physical mixing. To investigate how mixing influences ballast water dispersion, we conducted five trials of dye release in the 600-900 m wide St. Clair River (with a mean flow of 5100 m(3) s(-1)) in 2009. Dye-mixed ballast water was discharged from tankers in two nearshore trials, and dye solutions were directly released into the river in three offshore trials. Results confirm that dye was rapidly diluted by jet mixing during ballast water discharge (BWD) and became vertically homogeneous within 500 m downstream. Subsequently, there was two-dimensional mixing downstream with a longitudinal dispersion coefficient K-x approximate to 100 m(2) s(-1) and a transverse dispersion coefficient K-y approximate to 0.5 m(2) s(-1). The marked difference between K-x and K-y resulted in limited transverse mixing, implying that any nearshore BWD is unlikely to reach the opposite bank in the wide St. Clair River within its total length (approximate to 60 km). The peak concentration C-p showed a power-law decay over time t as C-p t(b) and b was close to -1, consistent with the Fickian diffusion model. Compared to the offshore trials, the nearshore trials were characterized by significantly slower travel speeds, because of velocity shear across the channel. This is the first field study on mixing of BWD in the context of biological invasions in a river that is large enough to reveal considerable differences in mixing across the channel. These findings shed light on the management of BWD and contaminant spills.

AB A one-dimensional mathematical model of mudflow dynamics is formulated assuming mud to behave rheologically as a Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Novel features of the present contribution regard the propagation of mudflows over a curvilinear bottom. A set of nonlinear partial differential equations is found to govern the unsteady, nonuniform flow of such fluids. Following the approach of Huang and Garcia (1998), a depth-integrated form of the continuity equation and shear-integrated and plug-integrated forms of the momentum equations are derived. A perturbation analysis is also carried out under the assumption of "slender'' flow. The leading-order problem takes the form of a kinematic wave equation. One straightforward application of this simplified model is the evaluation of the maximum run-out extension of a mud which flows over a bed with a variable topography. This solution is obtained by solving the steady state problem. Dynamics information are obtained by numerically solving the hyperbolic conservative equation by means of a free oscillating numerical method. The effects of bottom curvature either on the equilibrium solution or mudflow dynamics are analyzed. Experiments are also performed releasing a given volume of kaoline and water mixture from a reservoir into both a constant slope and an upward concave channel. Comparisons between the numerical solution and the experimental data are generally satisfactory, though suggesting limitations typical of any approach that neglects convective accelerations and assumes gradually varied flow.

AB General circulation models (GCMs) have been demonstrated to produce estimates of precipitation, including the frequency of extreme precipitation, with substantial bias and uncertainty relative to their representation of other fields. Thus, while theory predicts changes in the hydrologic cycle under anthropogenic warming, there is generally low confidence in future projections of extreme precipitation frequency for specific river basins. In this paper, we explore whether a GCM simulates large-scale atmospheric circulation indices that are associated with regional extreme precipitation (REP) days more accurately than it simulates REP days themselves, and thus whether conditional simulation of the precipitation events based on the circulation indices may improve the simulation of REP events. We show that a coupled Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCM simulates too many springtime REP days in the Ohio River Basin in historical (1950-2005) simulations. The GCM, however, does credibly simulate the distributional and persistence properties of several indices (which represent the large-scale atmospheric pressure features, local atmospheric moisture content, and local vertical velocity) that are shown to modulate the likelihood of REP occurrence in the reanalysis/observational record. We show that simulation of REP events based on the GCM-based atmospheric indices greatly reduces the bias of GCM REP frequency relative to the observed record. The simulation is conducted via a Bayesian regression model by imposing the empirical relationship between observed REP occurrence and the reanalysis-based atmospheric indices. Application of this model to future (2006-2100) representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario suggests an increasing trend in springtime REP incidence in the study region. The proposed approach of simulating precipitation events of interest, particularly those poorly represented in GCMs, with a statistical model based on climate indices that are reasonably simulated by GCMs could be applied to subseasonal to seasonal forecasts as well as future projections.

AB Evaluation of stream-aquifer interaction and water balance for a catchment often requires specific information on streambed parameters, such as streambed hydraulic conductivity, seepage flux across the streambed and so on. This paper describes a simple, inexpensive instrument that is used to measure these streambed parameters under the condition of a stream disconnected from groundwater. Our method includes a seepage cylinder for simulation of river water depth. The proposed method was applied to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity of a streambed and the changes in vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater with varied stream water depth in the Manasi River of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The vertical hydraulic conductivities of the streambed determined from 12 sites along the Manasi River vary from 1.01 to 29.m/day where the stream disconnects from the groundwater. The experimental results suggest that there are two kinds of relations between the vertical seepage rate and the simulated stream water depth. One is a linear relation between the two variables with low Reynolds numbers (less than 10); the other is a nonlinear relation (exponential relation) between the two variables with larger Reynolds numbers (greater than 10). This second relationship is quite different from the traditional model that usually calculates the vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater under the condition of disconnection using a linear relation (Darcy's Law). Our results suggest that a linear relation can only be used for a limited range of river water depth. This method gives a convenient tool for rapidly estimating the streambed hydraulic conductivity and the changes in the vertical seepage rate across streambed with varied stream water depths for the case of a stream disconnected from groundwater.

AB The aim of this paper is to test to what extent circulation patterns (CP) provide insights about groundwater recharge and soil moisture conditions in Switzerland. This is of special interest as climate change impact studies often suffer from the poor performance of climate models in representing precipitation behavior. CP-based downscaling procedures are very promising in increasing the reliability of such future precipitation projections. However, before applying such approaches to groundwater studies, the association between CP and groundwater dynamics has to be evaluated. Therefore, a Pearson chi(2) test is applied to data from 14 locations in Switzerland to assess the significance of this association and to identify CP promoting dry conditions. To evaluate whether and to what extent future risks can be directly estimated from CP, it is analyzed how the relationships and frequencies are changing with time. It was possible to identify circulation patterns promoting dry conditions and spatial differences among Swiss regions, which could be explained with topography-induced phenomena. Not surprisingly, central high pressure systems seem to be related to conditions which promote low recharge and low soil moisture. However, due to large uncertainties in the CP-precipitation relationship and its classification, no information about recharge and soil moisture changes can directly be derived from changes in CP frequencies.

ID RADAR RAINFALL; SIMULATION
AB Earlier research results have shown that the range of the ensemble flow simulations from a well-validated operational hydrologic model possesses a well-defined log-linear relationship to catchment area for which the ensembles are generated. The ensemble range is a function of both parametric and rainfall input uncertainty. In this paper the sensitivity of this scaling relationship for simulation uncertainty to the numerical discretization scale of the distributed model is quantified when the model. is driven by WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar data and for two catchments in the south-central United States. The distributed model. used is subcatchment (rather than pixel) based, has components that are based on operational models employed in the US National Weather Service, and has been validated for the two application catchments of this work as part of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP). The approach taken develops a new parsimonious model for spatially correlated radar-rainfall errors with radar-pixel error variance that depends on the magnitude of the observed rainfall. Monte Carlo methods are used to translate parametric and radar-rainfall input uncertainty to ensemble flow simulations at a number of subcatchments of varying size. Selected events in the period from May 1993 to July 1999 were analyzed. The results confirm that the ensemble flow range is dependent on subcatchment scale with a well-defined log-linear relationship for both application catchments. This finding holds for all uncertainty scenarios examined and across all the scales of distributed model discretization. It is further found that a higher model. discretization Leads to a shorter range of simulation uncertainty for subcatchment spatial scales that are substantially Larger than the average subcatchment size. Flow simulation uncertainty that is due to either parametric or input uncertainty atone scale in a way that is similar to the combined uncertainty scaling. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Observations of horizontal and vertical variations in piezometric head in a homogeneous, laboratory aquifer are presented and discussed. The observed fluctuations are induced by a simple harmonic oscillation in the clear water reservoir acting across a sloping boundary. The data qualitatively supports existing theories in that higher harmonics are generated in the active forcing zone and that a significant increase in the inland, asymptotic watertable over height (relative to that found for the vertical boundary case) is observed. The observed overheight is shown to be accurately reproduced by existing small-amplitude perturbation theory. Detailed measurements in the vicinity of the sloping boundary reveal that the signal of generated higher harmonics is strongest near the sand surface and that vertical flows are significant in this region. The aquifer is of finite-depth and is influenced by capillary effects, the experimental data therefore exposes limitations of theories which are based on the assumption of a shallow aquifer free of capillary effects. The dispersive properties of the measured pressure wave in the aquifer are comparable to those found from field observations and likewise do not agree with those predicted by the capillary free, shallow aquifer theory. Although some improvement is obtained, discrepancies between the data and theory persist even when a finite-depth aquifer and capillary effects are considered in the theoretical model. Further sand column experiments eliminate a truncated capillary fringe as a possible contributor to these discrepancies. However, the neglect of horizontal flows in the fringe may have caused the discrepancies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Snow cover depletion curves are required for several water management applications of snow hydrology and are often difficult to obtain automatically using optical remote sensing data owing to both frequent cloud cover and temporary snow cover. This study develops a methodology to produce accurate snow cover depletion curves automatically using high temporal resolution optical remote sensing data (e.g. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Aqua MODIS or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) by snow cover change trajectory analysis. The method consists of four major steps. The first is to reclassify both cloud-obscured land and snow into more distinct subclasses and to determine their snow cover status (seasonal snow cover or not) based on the snow cover change trajectories over the whole snowmelt season. The second step is to derive rules based on the analysis of snow cover change trajectories. These rules are subsequently used to determine for a given date, the snow cover status of a pixel based on snow cover maps from the beginning of the snowmelt season to that given date. The third step is to apply a decision-tree-like processing flow based on these rules to determine the snow cover status of a pixel for a given date and to create daily seasonal snow cover maps. The final step is to produce snow cover depletion curves using these maps. A case study using this method based on Terra MODIS snow cover map products (MOD10A1) was conducted in the lower and middle reaches of the Kaidu River Watershed (19000 km(2)) in the Chinese Tien Shan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. High resolution remote sensing data (charge coupled device (CCD) camera data with 19.5 m resolution of the China and Brazil Environmental and Resources Satellite (CBERS) data (19.5 m resolution), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data with 15 m resolution of the Terra) were used to validate the results. The study shows that the seasonal snow cover classification was consistent with that determined using a high spatial resolution dataset, with an accuracy of 87-91%. The snow cover depletion curves clearly reflected the impact of the variation of temperature and the appearance of temporary snow cover on seasonal snow cover. The findings from this case study suggest that the approach is successful in generating accurate snow cover depletion curves automatically under conditions of frequent cloud cover and temporary snow cover using high temporal resolution optical remote sensing data.

ID HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY
AB It is shown that the imbalance between the valley slope and the regime channel slope is the primary cause of river meandering when the sediment load is less than the load transporting capacity and if bank erodibility permits. When a river reach is confronted by a steep valley-slope it tries to maintain uniformity in energy-expenditure by expending the excess energy through channel curvature. Novel equations are analytically developed for the channel radius of curvature, sinuosity, wave length, arc length, initial arc angle, the meander path and a modified sine-generated curve based on width, depth, flow, sediment load, and roughness. These equations are more general than geometrical correlations between meander variables and width that were previously proposed in the literature. The developed channel sinuosity and wave length equations compare well with the available field data. Meandering in both alluvial and tidal channels, as well as in sediment-less environments (supraglacial channels) could be explained by the theory.

AB A new unsteady state laboratory displacement experiment has been developed to measure two-phase relative permeability, fluid saturation, and capillary head (k(r)-S-h(c)) relationships under moderate to low displacement rates and fluid pressures. The new technique maintains approximately uniform fluid saturation along the length of a core sample through the innovative use of a porous top disc to control internal pressure of the displacing fluid. Internal fluid pressure heads are measured in both phases at each end of the core, and permeabilities are calculated directly from Darcy's law. This approach avoids the bias inherent in other techniques that rely on assumptions related to inverse solution of unsteady state flow equations or a priori parameterization of k(r)-S-h(c) relationships.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; MODELS
AB Flushing sediment through a reservoir has been practiced successfully and found to be inexpensive in many cases. However, the great amount of water consumed in the flushing operation might affect the water supply. To satisfy the water demand and water consumed in the flushing operation, two models combining the reservoir simulation model and the sediment flushing model are established. In the reservoir simulation model, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize and determine the flushing operation rule curves. The sediment-flushing model is developed to estimate the amount of the flushed sediment volume, and the simulated results update the elevation-storage curve, which can be taken into account in the reservoir simulation model. The models are successfully applied to the Tapu reservoir, which has faced serious sedimentation problems. Based on 36 years historical sequential data, the results show that (i) the simulated flushing operation rule curves model has superior performance, in terms of lower shortage index (SI) and higher flushing efficiency (FE), than that by the original reservoir operation; (ii) the rational and riskless flushing schedule for the Tapu reservoir is suggested to be set within an interval of every 2 or 4 years in the months of May or June.

AB We evaluate flood magnitude and frequency trends across the Mid-Atlantic USA at stream gauges selected for long record lengths and climate sensitivity, and find field significant increases. Fifty-three of 75 study gauges show upward trends in annual flood magnitude, with 12 showing increases at p<0.05. We investigate trends in flood frequency using partial duration series data and document upward trends at 75% of gauges, with 27% increasing at p<0.05. Many study gauges show evidence for step increases in flood magnitude and/or frequency around 1970. Expanding our study area to include New England, we find evidence for lagged positive relationships between the winter North Atlantic Oscillation phase and flood magnitude and frequency. Our results suggest hydroclimatic changes in regional flood response that are related to a combination of factors, including cyclic atmospheric variability and secular trends related to climate warming affecting both antecedent conditions and event-scale processes.Editor Z.W.

AB Preferential flow is of high relevance for runoff generation, transport of chemicals and nutrients, and the transit time distribution of water in the soil or watershed. However, preferential flow effects are generally ignored in lumped hydrological models. And even most physically-based models ignore macropores and preferential flow features at the soil and hillslope scale. Keith Beven was never satisfied with this situation and he tried again and again to convince the scientific community to focus their research on the complex topic of macropore and preferential flow. Although he recognized how difficult it is to correctly include preferential flow in hydrological models, he made substantial progress defining and describing macropore flow and showing its relevance, developing models to simulate preferential flow, and in particular, the interaction between macropores and the soil matrix. In this short commentary, I reflect on these achievements and outline a vision for research in preferential flow experiments and modeling.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHMS; RESERVOIR SYSTEM; MODELS; HYDROPOWER; MANAGEMENT
AB Multireservoir operating policies are usually defined by rules that specify either individual reservoir desired (target) storage volumes or desired (target) releases based on the time of year and the existing total storage volume in all reservoirs. This paper focuses on the use of genetic search algorithms to derive these multireservoir operating policies. The genetic algorithms use real-valued vectors containing information needed to define both system release and individual reservoir storage volume targets as functions of total storage in each of multiple within-year periods. Elitism, arithmetic crossover, mutation, and ''en bloc'' replacement are used in the algorithms to generate successive sets of possible operating policies. Each policy is then evaluated using simulation to compute a performance index for a given flow series. The better performing policies are then used as a basis for generating new sets of possible policies. The process of improved policy generation and evaluation is repeated until no further improvement in performance is obtained. The proposed algorithm is applied to example reservoir systems used for water supply and hydropower.

DT Article
AB The magnitude, position, and timing of the instantaneous maximum boundary shear stress caused by a raindrop on a shallow pool of water are investigated using a series of computer simulation experiments in which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically. A dimensional analysis defines a set of parameters involving fluid properties and initial conditions relevant to the problem. Numerical simulations are performed over ranges of these parameters using a generic, two-dimensional, incompressible, free surface flow model. Results of the simulations are summarized in simple algebraic relationships which serve to clarify the relative importance of the parameters. The algebraic relationships also serve as an efficient substitute for the numerical model in the estimation of the magnitude, position, and timing of the maximum boundary shear stress. Laboratory measurements of water-droplet-induced shear stress are used to demonstrate the validity of the algebraic relationships.

AB A big challenge in constructing global hydrological models is the inclusion of anthropogenic impacts on the water cycle, such as caused by dams. Dam operators make decisions based on experience and often uncertain information. In this study information generally available to dam operators, like inflow into the reservoir and storage levels, was used to derive fuzzy rules describing the way a reservoir is operated. Using an artificial neural network capable of mimicking fuzzy logic, called the ANFIS adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system, fuzzy rules linking inflow and storage with reservoir release were determined for 11 reservoirs in central Asia, the US and Vietnam. By varying the input variables of the neural network, different configurations of fuzzy rules were created and tested. It was found that the release from relatively large reservoirs was significantly dependent on information concerning recent storage levels, while release from smaller reservoirs was more dependent on reservoir inflows. Subsequently, the derived rules were used to simulate reservoir release with an average Nash-Sutcliffe co-efficient of 0.81.

TI Information gap analysis of flood model uncertainties and regional
   frequency analysis
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INUNDATION; REGRESSION; QUANTILES
AB Flood risk analysis is subject to often severe uncertainties, which can potentially undermine flood management decisions. This paper explores the use of information gap theory to analyze the sensitivity of flood management decisions to uncertainties in flood inundation models and flood frequency analysis. Information gap is a quantified nonprobabilistic theory of robustness. To analyze uncertainties in flood modeling, an energy-bounded information gap model is established and applied first to a simplified uniform channel and then to a more realistic 2-D flood model. Information gap theory is then applied to the estimation of flood discharges using regional frequency analysis. The use of an information gap model is motivated by the notion that hydrologically similar sites are clustered in the space of their L moments. The information gap model is constructed around a parametric statistical flood frequency analysis, resulting in a hybrid model of uncertainty in which natural variability is handled statistically while epistemic uncertainties are represented in the information gap model. The analysis is demonstrated for sites in the Trent catchment, United Kingdom. The analysis is extended to address ungauged catchments, which, because of the attendant uncertainties in flood frequency analysis, are particularly appropriate for information gap analysis. Finally, the information gap model of flood frequency is combined with the treatment of hydraulic model uncertainties in an example of how both sources of uncertainty can be accounted for using information gap theory in a flood risk management decision.

AB Annually laminated (varved) sediments from the River Angermanalven, mid-central Sweden, have been used to construct an annual 2000-year long record of varve thickness. Maximum daily annual discharge and mean varve thickness for the years 1909-1971 are significantly correlated (r = 0.87). A relationship between maximum daily annual discharge for the observed period (1909-1971) and varve thickness was determined. The return time of two exceptionally thick varves in the 2000-year long record at the years 658 and 492 AD were estimated and their likelihood estimated based on a Gumbel frequency analysis.

AB Watersheds are drained by river networks, which route materials and energy from headwaters to terminal water bodies. River networks likewise perfuse the terrestrial portion of watershed ecosystems and reroute some of these materials upslope via material exchange between rivers and land. Here we develop a model of resource exchange between rivers and watersheds to predict the spatial extent of material and nutrient fluxes from aquatic portions of watershed ecosystems. The model is based on a geomorphic template that includes river network structure, topography, and channel sinuosity as well as important biological attributes (productivity and dispersal ability). Analysis of this model suggests that the geomorphic template strongly influences the spatial extent of resource flows in watershed ecosystems. The geomorphic template also predicts the location of areas of concentrated resource exchange, typically at ridge crests, in meander bends, and tributary junctions. We contend that these areas represent hotspots of foraging activity for terrestrial consumers, especially those at the reach scale (meander bends). More generally, our model suggests that the spatial extent of aquatic resource flow equal in magnitude to 20% or greater of terrestrial production may encompass as much as 20%-50% of terrestrial portions of watersheds. Resource flow from rivers to terrestrial ecosystems is not merely an edge effect. Instead, the river network may reroute a substantial flux of materials into watershed ecosystems.

ID INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; COMPLEX NETWORKS; FOOD; RESOURCES; CLIMATE; DEMAND;

AB In the international trade network, links express the (temporary) presence of a commercial exchange of goods between any two countries. Given the dynamical behaviour of the trade network, where links are created and dismissed every year, predicting the link activation/deactivation is an open research question. Through the international trade network of agricultural goods, water resources are 'virtually' transferred from the country of production to the country of consumption. We propose a novel methodology for link prediction applied to the network of virtual water trade. Starting from the assumption of having links between any two countries, we estimate the associated virtual water flows by means of a gravity-law model using country and link characteristics as drivers. We consider the links with estimated flows higher than 10 0 0 m3/year as active links, while the others as non-active links. Flows traded along estimated active links are then re-estimated using a similar but differently-calibrated gravity-law model. We were able to correctly model 84% of the existing links and 93% of the non-existing links in year 2011. It is worth to note that the predicted active links carry 99% of the global virtual water flow; hence, missed links are mainly those where a minimum volume of virtual water is exchanged. Results indicate that, over the period from 1986 to 2011, population, geographical distances between countries, and agricultural efficiency (through fertilizers use) are the major factors driving the link activation and deactivation. As opposed to other (network-based) models for link prediction, the proposed method is able to reconstruct the network architecture without any prior knowledge of the network topology, using only the nodes and links attributes; it thus represents a general method that can be applied to other networks such as food or value trade networks.

AB Adapting to climate change is just one among many challenges facing river managers. The response will involve balancing the long-term water demands of society with the changing needs of the environment in sustainable and cost effective ways. This paper describes a modeling framework for evaluating the sensitivity of low river flows to different configurations of abstraction licensing under both historical climate variability and expected climate change. A rainfall-runoff model is used to quantify trade-offs among environmental flow (e-flow) requirements, potential surface and groundwater abstraction volumes, and the frequency of harmful low-flow conditions. Using the River Itchen in southern England as a case study it is shown that the abstraction volume is more sensitive to uncertainty in the regional climate change projection than to the e-flow target. It is also found that "smarter" licensing arrangements (involving a mix of hands off flows and "rising block" abstraction rules) could achieve e-flow targets more frequently than conventional seasonal abstraction limits, with only modest reductions in average annual yield, even under a hotter, drier climate change scenario.

AB Nowadays, the majority of the scientific community is not aware of the risks and problems associated with an inadequate use of computer systems for research, mostly for reproducibility of scientific results. Such reproducibility can be compromised by the lack of clear standards and insufficient methodological description of the computational details involved in an experiment. In addition, the inappropriate application or ignorance of copyright laws can have undesirable effects on access to aspects of great importance of the design of experiments and therefore to the interpretation of results.
   Plain Language Summary This article highlights several important issues to ensure the scientific reproducibility of results within the current scientific framework, going beyond simple documentation. Several specific examples are discussed in the field of hydrological modeling.

AB [1] When the flow parameters, such as celerity and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, are allowed to vary spatially within a basin, three mechanisms, namely, geomorphologic, kinematic, and hydrodynamic dispersion, contribute to the variance of the instantaneous response function. The relative contributions of the three dispersion mechanisms as a function of scale, or Strahler order of the basin, are studied. This analysis is performed for two study basins, the Vermilion and the Mackinaw river basins, in central Illinois. Log linear trends for all the dispersion coefficients as a function of scale are observed. These trends can be cast in the form of Horton law type of relations. The asymptotic behavior of the dispersion coefficients of basins with self-similar network structure is consistent with the observations.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC DISPERSION; MEDIA; GEOMETRY
AB A law for dispersion in fracture networks below the representative elementary volume (REV) is established by analyzing random walks in two-dimensional fracture networks in conjunction with percolation theory.  Irregular fracture networks near the percolation threshold were obtained by removing some of the fractures of a regular orthogonal network, consisting of fractures of equal length and different apertures, drawn randomly from a lognormal distribution.  The random walk was directed by an exact solution of flow through the network, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to track particles through the fracture system.  The percolation theory analysis indicates a proportionality between the mean square displacement and time raised to the power 1.27, in excellent agreement with the simulations in the fracture networks, which indicate a proportionality with time raised to the power 1.3.

AB The use of precipitation estimates from weather radar reflectivity has become widespread in hydrologic predictions. However, uncertainty remains in the use of the nonlinear reflectivity-rainfall (Z-R) relation, in particular for mountainous regions where ground validation stations are often lacking, land surface data sets are inaccurate and the spatial variability in many features is high. In this study, we assess the propagation of rainfall errors introduced by different Z-R relations on distributed hydrologic model performance for four mountain basins in the Colorado Front Range. To do so, we compare spatially integrated and distributed rainfall and runoff metrics at seasonal and event time scales during the warm season when convective storms dominate. Results reveal that the basin simulations are quite sensitive to the uncertainties introduced by the Z-R relation in terms of streamflow, runoff mechanisms and the water balance components. The propagation of rainfall errors into basin responses follows power law relationships that link streamflow uncertainty to the precipitation errors and streamflow magnitude. Overall, different Z-R relations preserve the spatial distribution of rainfall relative to a reference case, but not the precipitation magnitude, thus leading to large changes in streamflow amounts and runoff spatial patterns at seasonal and event scales. Furthermore, streamflow errors from the Z-R relation follow a typical pattern that varies with catchment scale where higher uncertainties exist for intermediate-sized basins. The relatively high error values introduced by two operational Z-R relations (WSR-57 and NEXRAD) in terms of the streamflow response indicate that site-specific Z-R relations are desirable in the complex terrain region, particularly in light of other uncertainties in the modelling process, such as model parameter values and initial conditions.

AB Evaporation is an important process in many natural and technical systems, such as the unsaturated zone of the subsurface or microchannel evaporators. For the understanding and prediction of the involved processes, numerical simulations of multiphase flow and transport processes are an important tool. In order to achieve an accurate, physically based description of kinetic interphase mass and heat transfer occurring during evaporation, the numerical model has to account for the interfacial areas between phases. A recently developed model for two-phase flow in porous media is able to account for the involved processes by using interfacial areas explicitly as parameters in the model. The crucial issue, however, is the determination of the relationships between specific interfacial areas, capillary pressure, and saturation in this paper, we present a multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, which allows us to determine these relationships. On the basis of the scanned geometry of a natural porous medium, the relationships between specific interfacial areas, capillary pressure, and saturation are determined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that fluid-solid specific interfacial area relationships have been obtained from pore-scale data. Using these functions, we present the results of macroscale simulations of an evaporator device and of drying in a porous medium.

AB The sound of a river can change from a babbling brook to a thunderous torrent, and we have previously shown that there is the potential to predict river stage from the river's sub-aerial sound. Here, we examined how alterations in channel configuration can change the relationship between stage and sound pressure level using a white water course to simulate a real-world scale channel. By using blocks as roughness elements (REs), we were able to customize the course's obstacles, creating towers of different heights and placements. We then ran a varied flow discharge of up to 10 m(3) s(-1). We used data collected from microphones, a hydrophone and cameras to monitor the flow and to understand the processes occurring. In addition to sound processing, we used image analysis to calculate the area of white water on the surface of the water to determine the mechanism for sound production. Our analysis showed the likeliest source of sub-aerial sound is from white water being produced from the flow's interaction with the REs, with the relationship between white water value and sound relationship having an R-2 between 0.35 and 0.82. In terms of influence on sound, we found that the height of the REs is more important than their spatial distribution, with the taller the RE, the better the logarithmic relationship between sound and stage. We suggest that monitoring in a natural setting will work best in the places with the tallest obstacles and that the quality of the sound-stage relationship is dependent on RE height.

AB A true-to-mechanism model is proposed, which considers steady-state two-phase flow in porous media (SS2 phi PM) as a composition of two prototype flows, namely ganglion dynamics (GD) and connected-oil pathway flow (CPF). Coupling of the prototype flows is effected with the simple rule that the macroscopic pressure gradient is the same in both. For a given set of values of the flow system parameters, a domain of admissible flow combinations is obtained. The solution is determined by assuming that each point in this domain has equal probability of being 'visited'. This leads to unique values for the flow arrangement variables (FAV), the rate of mechanical energy dissipation, and the relative permeabilities. The new model accounts for the non-linearity of the flow as well as for the effects of all the system parameters (notably those affecting interfaces), and its predictions are in very good agreement with existing data.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) typically accounts for 60-70% of precipitation in rural basins of the Southeastern United States. Since 1930, substantial reforestation of former croplands has occurred in the Piedmont and Appalachian Highlands in this area, leading to an expected increase in ET and reduction in baseflow. This study examines relationships between basin vegetative cover, abiotic factors, and water-budget partitioning in 45 USGS-gaged rural basins in the Southeastern US. Data are for the 1982-2014 water years with watersheds having >= 40% forest cover, crystalline-rock aquifers, minimal basin water export, and no large reservoirs. Long-term annual ET is calculated using the water-budget equation (ET = P-Q), which ranges from 641 to 971 mm/yr. (median 824). Vegetative cover and other basin variables are regressed against ET to quantify the effects of vegetative and forest types. Budyko analysis is employed to compare the watersheds and to evaluate factors affecting residuals. Regression analysis indicates that ET behavior is best explained by abiotic factors (i.e., precipitation and temperature) but forest-cover type also has some effect. Evergreen forest cover is less common than deciduous or mixed forest but has a positive relationship with ET, while deciduous and total forest have negative relationships with ET. Comparison of water-balance and Budyko-estimated ET indicates that deciduous and total forest are associated with negative residuals while evergreen is not significant. These results show that forest cover effects on basin ET are complicated; forest-cover type is important for water-yield management in this region, and abiotic basin characteristics exert stronger control than forest cover on ET.

AB [ 1] An evaluation of Pacific and Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and continental U. S. streamflow was performed to identify coupled regions of SST and continental U. S. streamflow variability. Both SSTs and streamflow displayed temporal variability when applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) statistical method. Initially, an extended temporal evaluation was performed using the entire period of record (i.e., all years from 1951 to 2002). This was followed by an interdecadal-temporal evaluation for the Pacific ( Atlantic) Ocean based on the phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) ( Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)). Finally, an extended temporal evaluation was performed using detrended SST and streamflow data. A lead time approach was assessed in which the previous year's spring-summer season Pacific Ocean ( Atlantic Ocean) SSTs were evaluated with the current water year continental U. S. streamflow. During the cold phase of the PDO, Pacific Ocean SSTs influenced streamflow regions ( southeast, northwest, southwest, and northeast United States) most often associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), while during the warm phase of the PDO, Pacific Ocean SSTs influenced non-ENSO streamflow regions ( Upper Colorado River basin and middle Atlantic United States). ENSO and the PDO were identified by the Pacific Ocean SST SVD first temporal expansion series as climatic influences for the PDO cold phase, PDO warm phase, and the all years analysis. Additionally, the phase of the AMO resulted in continental U. S. streamflow variability when evaluating Atlantic Ocean SSTs. During the cold phase of the AMO, Atlantic Ocean SSTs influenced middle Atlantic and central U. S. streamflow, while during the warm phase of the AMO, Atlantic Ocean SSTs influenced upper Mississippi River basin, peninsular Florida, and northwest U. S. streamflow. The AMO signal was identified in the Atlantic Ocean SST SVD first temporal expansion series. Applying SVD, first temporal expansions series were developed for Pacific and Atlantic Ocean SSTs and continental U. S. streamflow. The first temporal expansion series of SSTs and streamflow were strongly correlated, which could result in improved streamflow predictability.

AB This paper presents the hydraulic derivation of a fully mass conservative, variable parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) method derived directly from the Saint-Venant equations for routing flood waves in prismatic channels having any cross-section shape, and using the Manning's friction law. The approach employed in the development of the method theoretically justifies the heuristic assumption made by McCarthy in 1938 in expressing the channel reach storage of the Muskingum method in terms of prism and wedge storages. The approach advocated in this paper also provides a solution to the mass conservation problem associated with the variable parameter Muskingum routing method, which has been a major issue in the hydrological literature for the last three decades. Moreover, the VPMM method enables the simultaneous computation of the stage hydrograph corresponding to a given inflow or routed discharge hydrograph. The verification of the methodology and the evaluation of its performance in routing floods in three different shapes of a hypothetical channels are presented by reproducing the corresponding numerical solutions of the Saint-Venant equations. The results are also compared with the corresponding results of the mass conservative variable parameter Muskingum-Cunge-Todini method proposed by Todini in 2007 with and without the inclusion of the correction introduced by Cappelaere in 1997 for diffusion.

AB This paper presents a finite volume scheme for coupling the Saint-Venant equations with the multiparticle size class Hairsine-Rose soil erosion model. A well-balanced monotone upstream-centered schemes for conservation laws-Hancock (MUSCL-Hancock) method is proposed to minimize spurious waves in the solution arising from an imbalance between the flux gradient and the source terms in the momentum equation. Additional criteria for numerical stability when dealing with very shallow flows and wet/dry fronts are highlighted. Numerical tests show that the scheme performs well in terms of accuracy and robustness for both the water and sediment transport equations. The proposed scheme facilitates the application of the Hairsine-Rose model to complex scenarios of soil erosion with concurrent interacting erosion processes over a nonuniform topography.

AB The choice of an adequate large-scale conceptual transport model constitutes a major challenge associated with the upscaling of solute transport. Among the different alternatives to the classical advection-dispersion model, the (multirate) mass transfer model has been proposed as a valuable and convenient alternative to model the large-scale behavior of solute transport. This paper evaluates the use of mass transfer models as a constitutive equation for upscaling solute transport. To achieve this, we compare Monte Carlo simulations of solute transport at two different support scales. Transport simulations performed at the smallest scale represent a set of reference transport solutions described at a high resolution, which are contrasted against transport simulations obtained using an upscaled model (low resolution). Several formulations of the multirate mass transfer model, which differ in the type of memory function (single rate, double rate, and truncated power law), are used as a constitutive transport equation. The large-scale scenario represents a simplified model obtained by partially homogenizing the reference solution. Results show that the double-rate and the truncated power law mass transfer models are capable of properly describing the ensemble average behavior of the main features associated with the integrated breakthrough curves. However, the uncertainty associated with the upscaled mass transfer models was substantially smaller than that attributed to the reference solution. Importantly, the cumulative distribution function of concentrations associated with the upscaled model follows a distribution similar to the reference solution but with smaller statistical dispersion. The reason is that while appropriate memory functions can be used to preserve the residence time distribution of mass particles during upscaling, the lack of memory in space prevents the model from reproducing mass fluxes in all directions. Specifically, the reproduction of mass fluxes taking place at the interface between two homogenized blocks of the upscaled model is not satisfied, thus providing a poor description of the spatial distribution of mass particles in a given realization.

AB Preferential flow (PF) is a fundamentally important soil hydrologic process that controls a variety of soil physical, chemical, and biological functions. However, the lack of theory in this field and the existence of conceptual and technological bottlenecks continue to hinder the advancement of PF modeling and prediction. This paper explores three theoretical perspectives on the relationships between pedogenesis and flow regimes in field soils. First, we examine non-equilibrium thermodynamics as applied to open dissipative field soils with continuous energy inputs and mass exchanges with the surrounding environment. The dual-partitioning of pedogenesis (dissipating and organizing processes) is consistent with the theory of dissipative structure, which explains the genesis and evolution of soil architecture (structure + matrix) and organized heterogeneity found in various soils. Such organized heterogeneity leads to widespread potential for PF occurrence. Second, we investigate constructal theory to explain the tendency for dual-flow regimes in soils - one with high resistivity (Darcy flow) and the other with low resistivity (PF) - together, they form PF configuration that provides the least global flow resistance. This theory is applied to explain some general characteristics of weathering processes and related flow regime changes, which are supported by limited chronologic data from the literature on subsoil's saturated hydraulic conductivity decrease after a soil reaches a certain age. Third, the theory of evolving networks sheds light on a variety of PF networks observed in field soils, which increase the effectiveness of energy and mass transfer in the subsurface. This is because networks are a part of the organization resulting from the minimum energy dissipation principle and far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. All the three theories discussed support the notion that the potential for PF occurrence in field soils is likely universal. However, controversies and challenges associated with these theories require further efforts to rigorously test their applicability in natural soils and to formulate explicit quantitative relationships between PF occurrence and its controls. The principle of soil formation and evolution provides a useful guide to this endeavor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We simulate the generation of a landslide-induced impulse wave with a newly-developed soil-water coupling model in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) framework. The model includes an elastoplastic constitutive model for soil, a Navier-Stokes equation based model for water, and a bilateral coupling model at the interface. The model is tested with simulated waves induced by a slow and a fast landslide. Good agreement is obtained between simulation results and experimental data. The generated wave and the deformation of the landslide body can both be resolved satisfactorily. All parameters in our model have their physical meaning in soil mechanics and can be obtained from conventional soil mechanics experiments directly. The influence of the dilatancy angle of soil shows that the non-associated flow rule must be selected, and the value of the dilatancy angle should not be chosen arbitrarily, if it is not determined with relative experiments.

AB Vegetation plays a significant role in river ecosystem, which has a great influence on hydraulic structures and sediment transport. Understanding the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in canopy flow is helpful to study the process of riverbed erosion and deposition in vegetated channels. Aiming at the sediment-laden flow in open channel covered with submerged vegetation, this study divides the water depth into two layers along the vertical direction with the vegetation height as the boundary and then proposes a new SSC distribution model based on gravitational theory to estimate the vertical distribution of relative SSC in the free water layer and vegetation layer respectively. In the meanwhile, a new formula is also proposed to evaluate the Reynolds shear stress below the submerged vegetation height, which has been successfully applied in the derivation of the new SSC distribution model. The validation results of the simplified velocity model, the new Reynolds shear stress formula and the new SSC model compare well with the collected experimental data series. On top of that, it is found that the uniformity of SSC distribution profile progressively decreases with the increasing sediment particles diameters. Besides, according to the validation results and discussion, it is believed that the controversy point about gravitational theory would not have obvious influence on the estimation of SSC distribution so that the gravitational theory can be adopted to investigate suspended sediment transport in vegetation flow. That would be benefit for river ecological restoration and better management.

AB [1] Bed load sediment particles supplied to channels by hillslopes are reduced in size by abrasion during downstream transport. The branching structure of the channel network creates a distribution of downstream travel distances to a given reach of river and thus may strongly influence the grain size distribution of the long-term bed load flux through that reach. Here we investigate this hypothesis, using mass conservation and the Sternberg exponential decay equation for particle abrasion, to predict bed material variability at multiple scales for both natural and artificial drainage networks. We assume that over a sufficiently long timescale, no net deposition occurs and that grains less than 2 mm are swept away in suspension. We find that abrasion during fluvial transport has a surprisingly small effect on the bed load sediment grain size distribution, for the simple case of spatially uniform supply of poorly sorted hillslope sediments. This occurs because at any point in the channel network, local resupply offsets the size reduction of material transported from upstream. Thus river bed material may essentially mirror the coarse component of the size distribution of hillslope sediment supply. Furthermore, there is a predictable distance downstream at which the bed load grain size distribution reaches a steady state. In the absence of net deposition due to selective transport, large-scale variability in bed material, such as downstream fining, must then be due primarily to spatial gradients in hillslope sediment production and transport characteristics. A second key finding is that average bed load flux will tend to stabilize at a constant value, independent of upstream drainage area, once the rate of silt production by bed load abrasion per unit travel distance is equal to the rate of coarse sediment supply per unit channel length (q). Bed load flux equilibrates over a distance that scales with the inverse of the fining coefficient in the abrasion rate law ( a) and can be approximated simply as q/3 alpha. Thus the efficiency of particle abrasion sets a fundamental length scale, shorter for weaker rocks and longer for harder rocks, which controls the expression in the river bed of variability in sediment supply. We explore the role of the abrasion length scale in modulating the influence of sediment supply variability in a number of channel network contexts, including individual tributary junctions, a sequence of tributary inputs along a main stem channel, and variable basin shapes and network architecture as expressed by the width function. These findings highlight the need for both data and theory that can be used to predict the grain size distributions supplied to channels by hillslopes.

AB The variation of unfrozen water content with temperature has a significant effect on the coupled heat-water transport in freezing soil, which can cause the frost heave and thaw settlement, and thus influence the stability of infrastructures. The premelting theory for water-ice in soils is developed to study the unfrozen water variation in freezing soil. The developed theory integrates the interfacial premelting of contact ice, the soil particles, the melting of the ice surface, and the premelting induced by impurity and curvature. A model to predict the unfrozen water content is then established by considering the change of unfrozen water film. The equivalent grain size is introduced to improve the solving efficiency in the calculation. Finally, the proposed analytical model is verified by the test data. The results indicate that the thickness of water film in soils increases when the surface charge density and the impurity concentration increase under the same supercooling degree. The surface melting on the interfaces of soil particle and the pore ice has key influence on the variation of the liquid water content. Meanwhile, the unfrozen water content increases with the increasing impurity concentration and surface charge on soil particles. Besides, the unfrozen water content also increases with the decreasing radius of soil particles.

AB Typical multivariate time series models may exhibit comovement in mean but not in variance of hydrologic and climatic variables. This paper introduces multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models to capture the comovement of the variance or the conditional covariance between two hydroclimatic time series. The diagonal vectorized and Baba-Engle-Kroft-Kroner models are developed to evaluate the covariance between drought and two atmospheric circulations, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) time series during 1954-2000. The univariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model indicates a strong persistency level in conditional variance for NAO and a moderate persistency level for SOI. The conditional variance of short-term drought index indicates low level of persistency, while the long-term index drought indicates high level of persistency in conditional variance. The estimated conditional covariance between drought and atmospheric indices is shown to be weak and negative. It is also observed that the covariance between drought and atmospheric indices is largely dependent on short-run variance of atmospheric indices rather than their long-run variance. The nonlinearity and stationarity tests show that the conditional covariances are nonlinear but stationary. However, the degree of nonlinearity is higher for the covariance between long-term drought and atmospheric indices. It is also observed that the nonlinearity of NAO is higher than that for SOI, in contrast to the stationarity which is stronger for SOI time series.

ID DIVIDING OPEN-CHANNEL; JUNCTION; FLOOD; SIMULATION; DIVISION; MODEL
AB Subcritical flow in an intersection composed of four similar orthogonal channels has been studied experimentally in a configuration with two inflows and two outflows for a wide range of experimental conditions. The results have been used to develop a relationship between the incoming flow rates and the flow distribution in the two outlet channels, based on the conservation of discharge and momentum in the intersection, and suitable stage-discharge relationships for the downstream controls in the outflow channels. A final equation is provided by an empirical correlation for the outflow in one of the channels, based on the experimental data obtained from these experiments; this correlation agrees with all the available data to within +/- 5%. It is shown how the resulting set of equations can be used to compute the discharge distribution in any similar intersection, given the incoming flow rates and some form of stage-discharge relationship for the outlet conditions.

AB [1] A Eulerian moment expansion through the first order of sigma(2)(p)(p = f, m) (sigma(2)(p) is the velocity variance in the fracture, p = f, or matrix, p = m, domain) is developed for solute transport in a nonstationary, fractured medium. A dual-permeability model is applied to describe the conceptualized fractured medium where solute convection and dispersion in both the fracture and matrix domains are considered. Hydraulic conductivity distrbutions in both fracture and matrix domains are nonstationary. The stochastic governing equations for the mean concentration and concentration covariance are analytically derived. A numerical method ( a finite difference method) is applied to obtain the solutions. The developed method is applied to study solute transport in stationary and nonstationary fractured media. The study results indicate that medium nonstationarity significantly influences the solute transport process. The nonstationary transport theory relaxes many assumptions adopted in stationary theories and paves the way for applying the theory to many environmental projects, especially for uncertainty analysis of solute transport.

AB Evaporation-a key process for water exchange between soil and atmosphere-is controlled by internal water fluxes and surface vapor fluxes. Recent studies demonstrated that the dynamics of the water flow in corners determine the time behavior of the evaporation rate. The internal water flux of the porous media is often described by capillary flow assuming complete wetting. Particularly, the crucial influence of partial wetting, that is, the nonlinear contact angle dependency of the capillary flow has been neglected so far. The focus of the paper is to demonstrate that SiO2-surfaces can exhibit contact angles of about 40 degrees. This reduces the internal capillary flow by 1 order of magnitude compared to complete wetting. First, we derived the contact angle by inverse modeling. We conducted a series of evaporation experiments in a 2-D square lattice microstructure connected by lognormal distributed throats. We used an explicit analytical power series solution of the single square capillary model. A contact angle of 38 degrees +/- 1 degrees was derived. Second, we directly measured the contact angle of the Si-SiO2 wafer using the Drop Shape Analyzer Krtiss 100 and obtained an averaged contact angle of 42 degrees +/- 2 degrees. The results support the single square capillary model as an appropriate model for the description of the evaporation process in an ideal square capillary.

AB A fuzzy logic based centralized control algorithm for irrigation canals is presented. Purpose of the algorithm is to control downstream discharge and water level of pools in the canal, by adjusting discharge release from the upstream end and gates settings. The algorithm is based on the dynamic wave model (Saint-Venant equations) inversion in space, wherein the momentum equation is replaced by a fuzzy rule based model, while retaining the continuity equation in its complete form. The fuzzy rule based model is developed on fuzzification of a new mathematical model for wave velocity, the derivational details of which are given. The advantages of the fuzzy control algorithm, over other conventional control algorithms, are described. It is transparent and intuitive, and no linearizations of the governing equations are involved. Timing of the algorithm and method of computation are explained. It is shown that the tuning is easy and the computations are straightforward. The algorithm provides stable, realistic and robust outputs. The disadvantage of the algorithm is reduced precision in its outputs due to the approximation inherent in the fuzzy logic. Feed back control logic is adopted to eliminate error caused by the system disturbances as well as error caused by the reduced precision in the outputs. The algorithm is tested by applying it to water level control problem in a fictitious canal with a single pool and also in a real canal with a series of pools. It is found that results obtained from the algorithm are comparable to those obtained from conventional control algorithms. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In the context of transboundary issues, this paper introduces a composite water resources allocation approach that integrates both game theory and Pareto frontier concepts over the case of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The proposed approach searches for an acceptable and viable solution set over the Pareto Frontier Surface via game theory based rationality constraints. For this purpose, the used base model is the Euphrates and Tigris River Basin Model, which is a linear programming model maximizing net economic benefits while optimally allocating scarce water resources in the basin. Results indicate that game theory based strategies and associated constraints provide a determinative backbone for an efficient and effective use of generated Pareto Frontier Surfaces. Additionally, estimated marginal values imply that the upstream countries have upper hand positions regarding their geographic and climatic contexts. After all the generation schemes, it appears that Turkey is the critical partner for inclusion into any form of coalition in the Euphrates and Tigris River Basin. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Variations in riverine solute chemistry with changing runoff are used to interrogate catchment hydrology and to investigate chemical reactions in Earth's critical zone. This approach requires some understanding of how spatial and temporal averaging of solute-generating reactions affect the dissolved load of rivers and streams. In this study, we investigate the concentration-runoff (C-Q) dynamics of a suite of major (Na, Mg, Ca, Si, K, and SO4) and trace (Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ge, Li, Mn, Mo, Nd, Ni, Rb, Sr, U, V, and Zn) elements in nested catchments of variable size, spanning the geomorphic gradient from the Andes Mountains to the Amazon Foreland-floodplain. The major elements exhibit various degrees of dilution with increasing runoff at all sites, whereas the concentrations of most trace elements either increase or show no relationship with increasing runoff in the three larger catchments (160-28,000 km(2) area). We show that the observed main stem C-Q dynamics are influenced by variable mixing of tributaries with distinct C-Q relationships. Trace element C-Q relationships are more variable among tributaries relative to major elements, which could be the result of variations in geomorphology, lithology, and hydrology of the subcatchments. Certain trace metals are also lost from solution during in-channel processes (possibly related to colloidal size-partitioning), which may exert an additional control on C-Q dynamics. Overall, we suggest that tributary aggregation effects should be assessed in heterogeneous catchments before C-Q or ratio-Q relationships can be interpreted as reflecting catchment-wide solute generation processes and their relationship to hydrology.

AB Many forested mountain watersheds worldwide evolved with frequent fire, which Twentieth Century fire suppression activities eliminated, resulting in unnaturally dense forests with high water demand. Restoration of pre-suppression forest composition and structure through a variety of management activities could improve forest resilience and water yields. This study explores the potential for "managed wildfire", whereby naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn, to alter the water balance. Interest in this type of managed wildfire is increasing, yet its long-term effects on water balance are uncertain. We use soil moisture as a spatially-distributed hydrologic indicator to assess the influence of vegetation, fire history and landscape position on water availability in the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park.
   Over 6000 manual surface soil moisture measurements were made over a period of three years, and supplemented with continuous soil moisture measurements over the top 1m of soil in three sites. Random forest and linear mixed effects models showed a dominant effect of vegetation type and history of vegetation change on measured soil moisture. Contemporary and historical vegetation maps were used to upscale the soil moisture observations to the basin and infer soil moisture under fire-suppressed conditions. Little change in basin-averaged soil moisture was inferred due to managed wildfire, but the results indicated that large localized increases in soil moisture had occurred, which could have important impacts on local ecology or downstream flows.

AB We propose a coupled model for suspended and bedload sediment transport in the shallow water framework. The model is deduced under hydrostatic pressure assumptions and will not assume any Boussinesq hypothesis. The numerical resolution is carried out in a segregated way. First the underlying system of conservation laws is solved by using a first order path-conservative Riemann solver. Then, the source terms corresponding with the erosion and depositions rates are approximated in a semi-implicit way. The final scheme preserves the positivity of the density. Several numerical experiments were carried out in order to validate the model and the numerical scheme. The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB To bridge the gap between academic research and actual operation, we propose an intelligent control system for reservoir operation. The methodology includes two major processes, the knowledge acquired and implemented, and the inference system. In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a fuzzy rule base (FRB) are used to extract knowledge based on the historical inflow data with a design objective function and on the operating rule curves respectively. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is then used to implement the knowledge, to create the fuzzy inference system, and then to estimate the optimal reservoir operation. To investigate its applicability and practicability, the Shihmen reservoir, Taiwan, is used as a case study. For the purpose of comparison, a simulation of the currently used M-5 operating rule curve is also performed. The results demonstrate that (1) the GA is an efficient way to search the optimal input-output patterns, (2) the FRB can extract the knowledge from the operating rule curves, and (3) the ANFIS models built on different types of knowledge can produce much better performance than the traditional M-5 curves in real-time reservoir operation. Moreover, we show that the model can be more intelligent for reservoir operation if more information (or knowledge) is involved. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The process of dispersion in porous media is the effect of combined variability in fluid velocity and concentration at scales smaller than the ones resolved that contributes to spreading and mixing. It is usually introduced in textbooks and taught in classes through the Fick-Scheidegger parameterization, which is introduced as a scientific law of universal validity. This parameterization is based on observations in bench-scale laboratory experiments using homogeneous media. Fickian means that dispersive flux is proportional to the gradient of the resolved concentration while the Scheidegger parameterization is a particular way to compute the dispersion coefficients. The unresolved scales are thus associated with the pore-grain geometry that is ignored when the composite pore-grain medium is replaced by a homogeneous continuum. However, the challenge faced in practice is how to account for dispersion in numerical models that discretize the domain into blocks, often cubic meters in size, that contain multiple geologic facies. Although the Fick-Scheidegger parameterization is by far the one most commonly used, its validity has been questioned. This work presents a method of teaching dispersion that emphasizes the physical basis of dispersion and highlights the conditions under which a Fickian dispersion model is justified. In particular, we show that Fickian dispersion has a solid physical basis provided that an equilibrium condition is met. The issue of the Scheidegger parameterization is more complex but it is shown that the approximation that the dispersion coefficients should scale linearly with the mean velocity is often reasonable, at least as a practical approximation, but may not necessarily be always appropriate. Generally in Hydrogeology, the Scheidegger feature of constant dispersivity is considered as a physical law and inseparable from the Fickian model, but both perceptions are wrong. We also explain why Fickian dispersion fails under certain conditions, such as dispersion inside and directly upstream of a contaminant source. Other issues discussed are the relevance of column tests and confusion regarding the meaning of terms dispersion and Fickian. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern hydrology places nearly all its emphasis on science-as-knowledge, the hypotheses of which are increasingly expressed as physical models, whose predictions are tested by correspondence to quantitative data sets. Though arguably appropriate for applications of theory to engineering and applied science, the associated emphases on truth and degrees of certainty are not optimal for the productive and creative processes that facilitate the fundamental advancement of science as a process of discovery. The latter requires an investigative approach, where the goal is uberty, a kind of fruitfulness of inquiry, in which the abductive mode of inference adds to the much more commonly acknowledged modes of deduction and induction. The resulting world-directed approach to hydrology provides a valuable complement to the prevailing hypothesis- (theory-) directed paradigm.
   Plain Language Summary This commentary suggests that a world-directed, investigative approach to hydrology may serve as a productive complement to the prevailing hypothesis- (theory-) directed, approaches. The emphasis of the former on discovery has the potential to be transformative for investigative hydrology.

AB This study experimentally analyzed the influence of shear processes on nonlinear flow behavior through 3D rough-walled rock fractures. A high-precision apparatus was developed to perform stress-dependent fluid flow tests of fractured rocks. Then, water flow tests on rough-walled fractures with different mechanical displacements were conducted. At each shear level, the hydraulic pressure ranged from 0 to 0.6 MPa, and the normal load varied from 7 to 35 kN. The results show that (i) the relationship between the volumetric flow rate and hydraulic gradient of rough-walled fractures can be well fit using Forchheimer's law. Notably, both the linear and nonlinear coefficients in Forchheimer's law decrease during shearing; (ii) a sixth-order polynomial function is used to evaluate the transmissivity based on the Reynolds number of fractures during shearing. The transmissivity exhibits a decreasing trend as the Reynolds number increases and an increasing trend as the shear displacement increases; (iii) the critical hydraulic gradient, critical Reynolds number and equivalent hydraulic aperture of the rock fractures all increase as the shear displacement increases. When the shear displacement varies from 0 to 15 mm, the critical hydraulic gradient ranges from 0.3 to 2.2 for a normal load of 7 kN and increases to 1.8-8.6 for a normal load of 35 kN; and (iv) the Forchheimer law results are evaluated by plotting the normalized transmissivity of the fractures during shearing against the Reynolds number. An increase in the normal load shifts the fitted curves downward. Additionally, the Forchheimer coefficient beta decreases with the shear displacement but increases with the applied normal load.

TI Hydrologic connectivity between landscapes and streams: Transferring

AB The relationship between catchment structure and runoff characteristics is poorly understood. In steep headwater catchments with shallow soils the accumulation of hillslope area (upslope accumulated area (UAA)) is a hypothesized first-order control on the distribution of soil water and groundwater. Hillslope-riparian water table connectivity represents the linkage between the dominant catchment landscape elements (hillslopes and riparian zones) and the channel network. Hydrologic connectivity between hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) landscape elements is heterogeneous in space and often temporally transient. We sought to test the relationship between UAA and the existence and longevity of HRS shallow groundwater connectivity. We quantified water table connectivity based on 84 recording wells distributed across 24 HRS transects within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (U. S. Forest Service), northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. Correlations were observed between the longevity of HRS water table connectivity and the size of each transect's UAA (r(2) = 0.91). We applied this relationship to the entire stream network to quantify landscape-scale connectivity through time and ascertain its relationship to catchment-scale runoff dynamics. We found that the shape of the estimated annual landscape connectivity duration curve was highly related to the catchment flow duration curve (r(2) = 0.95). This research suggests internal catchment landscape structure (topography and topology) as a first-order control on runoff source area and whole catchment response characteristics.

ID FLOW; WAKE; LAW
AB River discharge has to be monitored reliably for effective water management. As river discharge cannot be measured directly, it is usually inferred from the water level. This practice is unreliable at places where the relation between water level and flow velocity is ambiguous. In such a case, the continuous measurement of the flow velocity can improve the discharge prediction. The emergence of horizontal acoustic Doppler current profilers (HADCPs) has made it possible to continuously measure the flow velocity. However, the profiling range of HADCPs is limited, so that a single instrument can only partially cover a wide cross section. The total discharge still has to be determined with a model. While the limitations of rating curves are well understood, there is not yet a comprehensive theory to assess the accuracy of discharge predicted from velocity measurements. Such a theory is necessary to discriminate which factors influence the measurements, and to improve instrument deployment as well as discharge prediction. This paper presents a generic method to assess the uncertainty of discharge predicted from range-limited velocity profiles. The theory shows that a major source of error is the variation of the ratio between the local and cross-section-averaged velocity. This variation is large near the banks, where HADCPs are usually deployed and can limit the advantage gained from the velocity measurement. We apply our theory at two gauging stations situated in the Kapuas River, Indonesia. We find that at one of the two stations the index velocity does not outperform a simple rating curve.

AB Measured (or empirically fitted) reaction rates at groundwater remediation sites are typically much lower than those found in the same material at the batch or laboratory scale. The reduced rates are commonly attributed to poorer mixing at the larger scales. A variety of methods have been proposed to account for this scaling effect in reactive transport. In this study, we use the Lagrangian particle-tracking and reaction (PTR) method to simulate a field bioremediation experiment at the Schoolcraft, MI site. A denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas Stutzeri strain KC (KC), was injected to the aquifer, along with sufficient substrate, to degrade the contaminant, carbon tetrachloride (CT), under anaerobic conditions. The PTR method simulates chemical reactions through probabilistic rules of particle collisions, interactions, and transformations to address the scale effect (lower apparent reaction rates for each level of upscaling, from batch to column to field scale). In contrast to a prior Eulerian reaction model, the PTR method is able to match the fieldscale experiment using the rate coefficients obtained from batch experiments.

AB Alternate bars in rivers and streams develop as a result of differences in length scales involved in the adjustment of flow and sediment transport to irregularities of the bed. The amount of field evidence supporting theoretical insights is highly limited. Here, we present results from a large-scale field experiment in a 600 m long straight reach. Over a period of almost 3 years, the channel was allowed to evolve autogenously from initially flat bed conditions, subject to discharge variation. Alternate bars developed within 8 months from the start of the experiment. The initial stages of bar development included bar growth, both in wavelength and amplitude, and bar migration. The latter was too limited to classify the bars as being migrating bars; therefore, we classify the bars as nonmigrating bars. Toward the end of the experiment, the regular alternate bar pattern evolved into an irregular pattern and bar amplitude started to decrease. From the start of the experiment we observed a declining channel slope, from 1.8 m km(-1) initially to 0.9 m km(-1) halfway the experiment, after which it stabilized. We applied two bar theories to establish their predictive capacity. Both bar theories predicted the development of alternate bars under the constructed channel conditions. In response to the declining channel slope, both theories predicted a decreasing likelihood for the development of alternate bars. Our study shows that under field conditions, the applied bar theories may predict the initial stages of bed development.

AB Anthropogenic impacts and climate change modify instream flow, altering ecosystem services and impacting on aquatic ecosystems. Alpine rivers and streams on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are especially vulnerable to disturbance owing to limited taxonomic complexity. The effects of flow have been studied using specific taxa, yet the flow-biota relationships of assemblages are poorly understood. A multi-metric habitat suitability model (MM-HSM) was developed using integrated measures of entire macroinvertebrate assemblages to substitute for habitat suitability indices derived from individual taxa. The MM-HSM was trained using macroinvertebrates data from three alpine rivers on the QTP, including the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Nujiang, and the Bai rivers, and then validated using data from a forth alpine river (the Lanmucuo). The model produced predictions using the training data set (R-2 = 0.587) and the validation data set (R-2 = 0.489). By coupling the MM-HSM with hydrodynamic simulations, the relationship between weighted usable area and flow (0.11-1.99 m(3) s(-1)) for macroinvertebrate assemblages was established, whereby a unimodal response pattern was observed for the Lanmucuo River. This contrast with monotonically positive or negative relationships observed for individual indicator taxa further supported our hypothesis that the response pattern of entire macroinvertebrate assemblages to flow would differ from responses of individual indicator taxa. The MM-HSM provides a novel framework to quantify flow-biota relationships, which is a useful approach for integrated river management.

AB Laboratory flume experiments were undertaken to measure the vertical profiles of mean flow velocity for three different flow discharges and four different stem densities of Hydrilla verticillata. The data were used to calculate three parameters, namely Manning's roughness coefficient, the Reynolds number and the Froude number. In addition, empirical equations were obtained for the vertical distribution of measured flow velocity within the transitional zone and above the plant canopy. The results show that: (a)the vertical distribution of measured flow velocity exhibits three zone profiles; (b)Manning's roughness coefficient decreases with increasing depth-averaged flow velocity; (c)the relationship between Manning's roughness coefficient and the depth-averaged flow velocity is within the smooth left inverse curve; (d)Manning's roughness coefficient significantly changes with increasing density of Hydrilla; (e)the Froude number is independent of the density of Hydrilla; and (f)both the Reynolds number and the Froude number increase with increasing depth-averaged flow velocity.

AB A systematic numerical method has been presented to investigate the constitutive relationships between two-phase flow properties of horizontal fractures and aperture distributions. Based on fractal geometry, single rough-walled fractures are generated numerically by modified successive random addition (SRA) method and then aperture distributions with truncated Gaussian distribution are formed by shear displacement between lower and upper surfaces. (The truncated Gaussian distribution is used to describe aperture evolution under different normal stresses.) According to the assumption of two-dimensional porous media and local parallel plate model, invasion percolation approach is employed to model the two-phase flow displacement (imbibition) in generated horizontal fractures, in which capillary forces are dominant over viscous and gravity forces. For truncated Gaussian distributions, constitutive relationships from numerical simulation are compared to closed-form relationships and a good agreement is obtained. The simulation results indicate strong phase interference with the sum of two phase relative permeability values being less than one in the intermediate saturations. It is found that fracture properties related to residual saturations depend on spatial correlation of aperture distributions. Based on the simulation results, we proposed an empirical relationship between the fracture residual-saturation-rated parameters and the corresponding aperture distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to better quantify resistance to water flow exerted by vegetation is receiving increased attention due to ongoing worldwide efforts to restore natural vegetation communities in the wetlands and use of vegetation for environmental benefits in streams and wetlands. In south Florida, vegetation resistance affects discharge through shallow wetlands of the Everglades and projects under way in the system to restore remaining natural systems. A more detailed knowledge of the flow dynamics in these wetlands is required to improve modeling of these systems that supports restoration and management efforts. The goal of this investigation is to understand the flow dynamics and the vegetation resistance within a 3 km by 7 km area in the Everglades referred to as STA-3/4 Cell 3A. Methods are developed to demonstrate the use of analytical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse methods to obtain bulk and spatially varying resistance parameters. To achieve this goal, a field test was conducted using sinusoidal discharge disturbances capable of creating water waves in the storm water treatment area (STAs). The discharges, wave speeds, and the wave attenuation rates from the test are used to develop graphical and empirical functions expressing discharge in terms of water depth and energy slope. The empirical functions developed are power law type, and different functions are developed for different depths. The results show that the Manning's equation is not applicable for wetlands with thick emergent vegetation, as well as the difficulty of applying a single power law-type expression for vegetation resistance over a wide range of depths and energy slopes without errors. This is partly due to the existence of multiple flow regimes and different power exponents over depth and energy slopes in these regimes. Results show that the flow regime at low depths is similar to porous media flow, and the flow regime at higher depths is more turbulent.

AB This paper describes a nonstationary spectral theory for analyzing flow in a heterogeneous porous medium with a systematic trend in log hydraulic conductivity. This theory relies on a linearization of the groundwater flow equation but does not require the stationarity assumptions used in classical spectral theories. The nonstationary theory is illustrated with a two-dimensional analysis of a linear trend aligned with the mean flow direction. In this case, closed-form solutions can be obtained for the effective hydraulic conductivity, head covariance, and log conductivity-head cross covariance. The:effective hydraulic conductivity decreases from the geometrical mean as the mean slope of the log conductivity increases. Trending leads to a reduction of head variance and a structural change in the head covariance and the log conductivity-head cross covariance: Such changes have important implications for measurement conditioning (or cokriging) methods which rely on the head covariance and log conductivity-head covariance. The nonstationary spectral analysis is also compared with classical spectral analysis. This comparison indicates that the classical spectral method correctly predicts the normalized head covariance in a linear trending media. The stationary spectral method fails to capture the qualitative influence of trends on the effective hydraulic conductivity and the log conductivity-head cross covariance, although the magnitude of the error is relatively small for realistic values of the mean log conductivity slope. The stationary and nonstationary results are the same when there is no trend in log conductivity. The trending conductivity example illustrates that the nonstationary spectral method has all the capabilities of the classical spectral approach while not requiring as many restrictive assumptions.

AB [1] Aperture distributions have been measured using replicas of apertures to investigate the effect of variable aperture on solute transport in five transparent fracture samples. The coefficient of variation (C-v), correlation length (lambda), and anisotropy ratio (AR) were used to quantify the aperture distributions. Step-type tracer tests showed that dispersion is significantly influenced by both lambda and C-v. Dispersivity (alpha) increases with lambda and C-v. The magnitude of alpha is proportional to a polynomial function of natural logarithm of C-v(2) and is linearly proportional to lambda and the total sill measured from the semivariogram. The effect of AR is insignificant to those of the other parameters on alpha. Despite assumptions of the small perturbation theory developed by Gelhar [1993], the prediction of a from the theory is similar to alpha measured in this study. If the small perturbation theory is valid and reliable data for the tailing in a breakthrough curve are obtained, the analysis of the curve by the moment method gives a more reliable result than by the conventional fitting of a one-dimensional analytical solution to the curve.

AB Adequate knowledge of spatial connections in rainfall is important for reliable modeling of catchment processes and water management. This study applies the ideas of network theory to examine and interpret the spatial connections in rainfall in Australian conditions. As case studies, monthly rainfall data across a network of raingages from two vastly different areas are studied: (1) Western Australia - data over a period of 67 years (1937-2003) from 57 raingages; and (2) Sydney catchment - data over a period of 114 years (1890-2003) from 47 monitoring stations. The spatial rainfall connections in the two networks are examined using clustering coefficient (CC), a popular network connectivity measure. The clustering coefficient measures the local density and quantifies the network's tendency to cluster. Different values of rainfall correlation threshold (CT) are used to measure the strength of connections in rainfall between different stations and, hence, to calculate CC. The clustering coefficient values are interpreted in terms of topographic factors (latitude, longitude, and elevation) and rainfall properties (mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation).

AB Estimation of urban evapotranspiration (ET) is meaningful for evaluating the urban heat island effect and promoting urban water conservation. While multi-source satellite-based ET models for farmland and natural ecosystems have been developed, these models lack the object-oriented solutions for the urban areas. In view of this, the present study proposed a Three-source Remote sensing model for Urban areas (TRU) to simulate the urban ET, which can discriminate between urban soil evaporation, vegetation transpiration, and impervious surface evaporation. The new parameterization scheme proposed herein is characterized by the theory of complementary relationship to estimate the urban soil evaporation. Evaporation losses in the impervious areas were independently estimated in accordance with the distribution of urban land use and land cover (LULC). The developed TRU model was evaluated for 63 cloud-free test days in Tianjin, China by using 30 m Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images. The outcomes of this study revealed a root-mean square-error (RMSE) of 40.2 W/m(2) and a bias of 10.8 W/m2 compared with the two eddy correlation (EC) observations for the instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) simulation. Moreover, the RMSE and bias were 0.092 and-0.023, respectively in simulating the vegetation latent heat flux fraction (LEv/LE) when verified with respect to the stable water isotope measurements. Due to limited water availability, the impervious urban surface evaporation magnitude was found quite low with minimal variation on different test days. The results emphasize the importance of coupling LULC information in the urban ET modeling conceptualization. Certainly, the TRU model improved the ET simulation accuracy in urban areas and could facilitate the mapping of urban ET components at high spatial resolution.

AB We apply ''field theoretic'' methods to the calculation of the effective diffusivity (macrodispersion coefficient) in a random flow. We show how this approach can be utilized to calculate a perturbation series for the effective diffusivity of conservative tracers in an incompressible velocity field with nonvanishing mean. The first-order (i.e., ''one-loop'') approximation of this series coincides with, classical results derived by Gelhar and Axness and Dagan. A renormalization group (RNG) approach is utilized, and the results are compared to the classical first-order perturbation theory. For a moderate variability of the permeability the renormalized theory predicts only small corrections to the longitudinal dispersivity. However, the transverse dispersivity can be larger than that predicted by the first-order perturbation theory by several orders of magnitude. We compare these values to the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations and find that the RNG predictions are in much better, though not perfect, accordance with the results of simulations. Moreover, the results are in good quantitative agreement with reported observations from the Borden Site field experiment.

TI Estimation of 'drainable' storage - A geomorphological approach
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English

   network; GRFM
ID RECESSION; RAINFALL
AB Storage of water within a river basin is often estimated by analyzing recession flow curves as it cannot be 'instantly' estimated with the aid of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of 'drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the 'complete' recession flow curve (i.e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that recession curves are rarely 'complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the wellknown Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q : -dQ/dt = kQ(alpha). However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis is that it is not suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute alpha considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when alpha >= 2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, alpha is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete recession curves from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for 'incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.

AB Preferential flow, a term that includes macropore flow, non-equilibrium flow, and finger flow, stands in well known conflict with Richards' () capillary flow. Acoustic velocity experiments demonstrate that preferential flow moves independently from, faster than, and before capillary flow during gravity-driven infiltration. Viscous flow in permeable media is briefly introduced to the point where Richards' () particular treatment of viscosity turns out as the hydro-mechanical bifurcation from general laminar flow. Preferential flow is expected during significant infiltration, however, spatio-temporarily limited according to the viscous-flow regime. Two ways of delineating capillary flow from viscous flow reveal minimum path widths of preferential flow in the range of about 20m.

AB The classical deterministic approach to tidal prediction is based on barotropic or baroclinic models with prescribed boundary conditions from a global model or measurements. The prediction by the deterministic model is limited by the precision of the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. Improvement to the knowledge of model formulation would only marginally increase the prediction accuracy without the correct driving forces. This study describes an improvement in the forecasting capability of the tidal model by combining the,best of a deterministic model and a stochastic model. The latter is overlaid on the numerical model predictions to improve the forecast accuracy. The tidal prediction is carried out using a three-dimensional baroclinic model and, error correction is instigated using a stochastic model based on a local linear approximation. Embedding theorem based on the time lagged embedded vectors is the basis for the stochastic model. The combined model could achieve an efficiency of 80% for 1 day tidal forecast and 73% for a 7 day tidal forecast as compared to the deterministic model estimation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lake volume is a critical parameter in the prediction of potential flood volume and peak discharge in the risk assessment of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). As existing volume-area scaling relationships often blur the complexity of lake geometry, we presented a new volume-scaling law specific to moraine-dammed lakes, derived from a large lake bathymetry dataset. The relationship was based on the premise that lake geometry parameters (i.e., area, volume, width/length ratio) scale predictably. We then critically evaluated the performance of the new approach and compared it with 19 existing empirical relationships by examining a database of glacial lake bathymetry obtained without repeated measurements. Overall, the new volume-scaling relationship showed a more robust performance than other published formulas. In addition, an intriguing result was that regional differences were not always controlled by the predictability of lake volumes, that is, there were no regional restrictions on the use of the new method, at least not in the Himalayas. Finally, using the new approach and high-resolution Landsat imagery, our results of sequential mapping of all lakes in the Poiqu basin indicated that the total lake volume has increased by 148% from 1974 to 2020. Compared with other formulas, the lake volume estimation approach proposed in this paper provides an approximate mean value, which provides a key input parameter for flood simulation and a new alternative for estimating lake volume.

AB Co-loading of mercury (Hg) with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key driver of the observed spatial and temporal Hg patterns among aquatic ecosystems. Their strong biogeochemical coupling has spurred the use of DOC as a predictor of Hg concentrations and exports in boreal regions where sampling logistics for Hg are costly and complex. Yet relationships between Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) with DOC have recently been shown to be highly variable in terms of slope and strength, suggesting that mechanisms other than co-transport along the land-water continuum may drive the relationship between Hg and DOC across landscapes. In this study, we explore the relationship between Hg and MeHg with DOC across 18 boreal rivers collectively draining over 350,000 km(2) of the eastern James Bay territory (Quebec), comprising watersheds with a wide range of vegetation, water residence time and riverine DOC concentrations and optical properties. Our results show that although a large portion of the variation in Hg and MeHg is explained by concentrations of DOC, Hg-DOC and MeHg-DOC relationships and ratios vary greatly both spatially and temporally. We show that ratios and strength of the coupling can be predicted from system hydrology, with declines in Hg:DOC and increase in MeHg:DOC ratios and stronger coupling during the seasonal progression to warmer temperatures, higher water evaporation, and longer residence time. Our study highlights the role of seasonal hydrology and biogeochemical processing in governing Hg, MeHg and DOC patterns in boreal rivers.

AB For an irreversible reaction, the Rayleigh or distillation-type relationship between stable isotope enrichment and reactant concentration is compromised if fluid samples are characterized by a range of water ages or different extents of reaction progress. Such mixed samples are rarely avoided in the standard methods of sampling fluid from natural porous media. As a result, application of a Rayleigh model to stable isotope ratios measured in aquifers commonly requires a diminished or effective fractionation factor relative to the intrinsic value obtained in the absence of transport effects. Thus, quantitative application of intrinsic parameter values to a fractionating reaction occurring in porous media flow requires revision to the functional form of the relationship between reactant concentration and isotope fractionation. Here we derive a series of analytical solutions for the relationship between fractionation and flow subject to nonuniform fluid travel time distributions. These solutions are unique from previous approaches in that they avoid the use of a dispersion coefficient. The results are demonstrated against multicomponent reactive transport simulations of stable isotope fractionation in homogeneous and spatially correlated heterogeneous flow fields, and applied to a data set of stable chromium (Cr) isotope enrichment obtained from a contaminated aquifer. We show that the flux-weighted isotope ratio of a solute is more sensitive to the effects of physical heterogeneity than solute concentrations. Our results support an updated functional form of the traditional Rayleigh model that describes the relationship between reactant concentration and isotope fractionation and is valid for a mixed-fluid sample.

TI LUMPED MODELS OF CONVECTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN HETEROGENEOUS
   POROUS-MEDIA .1. ONE-DIMENSIONAL MEDIA
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Lumped models of convective solute transport in one-dimensional porous media are derived from the mass balance and the law of mass action. These models predict cumulative leaching from cumulative solute application and cumulative irrigation or rainfall. The solutes can be subject to adsorption or exchange governed by a nonlinear isotherm. The most important feature of the models is that although the properties of the medium and the liquid phase are allowed to be nonuniform, application requires only knowledge of the integrated moisture storage and adsorption isotherm over the medium section under consideration. Sufficient conditions are derived for the validity of lumped models and convenient expressions for evaluation of the model output are given. The results will be applied in part 2 of this paper, forthcoming, which will deal with convective solute transport along fixed streamlines in three-dimensional porous media.

AB The advection-dispersion equation for scalar transport is essential for the numerical modeling of many fluid dynamics problems. However, solutions from numerical schemes always suffer from numerical diffusion and/or oscillation. In this study, we develop an Intra-Cell Advection Tracking (ICAT) scheme to minimize numerical diffusion and preserve monotonicity for advection-dispersion modeling. The key idea is to introduce "queues" in each discretized cell, and using a sequential transport rule and a flow distribution mechanism to track the scalar transport in these queues temporally and spatially. The capability and limitations of ICAT are first investigated through three test cases. Compared with the results obtained from other numerical schemes, the results from ICAT show substantially reduced numerical diffusion and agree better with analytical solutions. We also employ ICAT to simulate the transport process of a conservative tracer in a fracture with a highly heterogeneous aperture distribution. Discrete flow channels in the fracture are better discerned by ICAT than by other numerical schemes, indicating the suitability of ICAT for modeling tracer transport in channelized flow fields.

ID VELOCITY; SMOOTH
AB This study investigates turbulence structures in steady and non-uniform flows. Equations of Reynolds shear stress and turbulent velocity fluctuations are derived and their physical interpretations are explained. The theoretical results show that. different from previous studies, the variation of water surface can generate the wall-normal velocity, resulting in deviations of Reynolds shear stress and turbulence intensities from those in uniform flows. A self-similarity relationship is found between the Reynolds shear stress and turbulence intensities in non-uniform flows. The existence of self-similarity indicates that the effect of non-uniformity does not influence the mixing length. An empirical equation has been proposed to express the relationship based on experimental data available in the literature. Good agreement is achieved between the measured and predicted turbulence intensities by applying the self-similarity relationship. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time series of rainfall and karst-spring discharge are influenced by various space-time-variant processes involved in the transfer of water in hydrological cycle. The effects of these processes can be exhibited in auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions. Consequently, ambiguities with respect to the effects encoded in the correlation functions exist. To solve this problem, a new statistical method for investigating relationships between rainfall and karst-spring discharge is proposed. The method is based on the determination and analysis of higher-order partial correlation functions and their spectral representations. The study area is the catchment of the Jadro Spring in Croatia. The analyzed daily time series are the air temperature, relative humidity, spring discharge, and rainfall at seven rain-gauges over a period of 19 years, from 1995 to 2013. The application results show that the effects of spatial and temporal variations of hydrological time series and the space-time-variant behaviours of the karst system can be separated from the correlation functions. Specifically, the effect of evapotranspiration can be separated to obtain the forms of correlation functions that represent the hydrogeological characteristics of the karst system. Using the proposed method, it is also possible to separate the effects of the process of groundwater recharge that occurs in neighbouring parts of a catchment to identify the specific contribution of each part of the catchment to the karst-spring discharge. The main quantitative results obtained for the Jadro Spring show that the quick-flow duration is 14 days, the intermediate-flow duration is 80 days, and the pure base flow starts after 80 days. The base flow consists of an inter-catchment groundwater flow. The system memory of the spring is 80 days. The presented results indicate the far-reaching applicability of the proposed method in the analyses of relationships between rainfall and karst-spring discharge; e.g., the method can be used for (1) the identification of effects of various time series on the quick-flow, intermediate-flow and base-flow components of the discharge, (2) the detection of the seasonal effect of inter-catchment groundwater flows in the discharge, and (3) the estimation of the karst system memory. Generally, the presented approach can be applied to the qualitative analyses of the relationships between two time series whenever appropriate control time series are available.

AB Understanding the relative influence of catchment structure (topography and topology), underlying geology, and vegetation on runoff response is key to interpreting catchment hydrology. Hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) water table connectivity serves as the hydrologic linkage between a catchment's uplands and the channel network and facilitates the transmission of water and solutes to streams. While there has been tremendous interest in the concept of hydrological connectivity to characterize catchments, few studies have quantified hydrologic connectivity at the stream network and catchment scales with observational data. Here we examine how catchment topography, vegetation, and geology influenced patterns of stream network HRS connectivity and runoff dynamics across 11 nested headwater catchments in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF), MT. This study builds on the empirical findings of Jencso et al. (2009) who found a strong linear relationship (r(2) = 0.91) between the upslope accumulated area (UAA) and the annual duration of shallow groundwater table connectivity observed across 24 HRS transects (146 groundwater recording wells). We applied this relationship to the entire stream network across 11 nested catchments to quantify the frequency distribution of stream network connectivity through time, and quantify its relationship to catchment-scale runoff dynamics. Each catchment's hydrologic connectivity duration curve (CDC) was highly related to its flow duration curve (FDC) and the slope of the relationship varied across catchments. The slope represents the streamflow yield per unit connectivity (Con(yield)). We analyzed the slope of each catchment's CDC-FDC relationship or Con(yield) (annual, peak, transition, and base flow periods) in multiple linear regression models with common terrain, land cover vegetation, and geology explanatory variables. Significant predictors (p < 0.05) across 11 catchments included the ratio of flow path distances and gradients to the creek (DFC/GTC), geology, and a vegetation index. The order and strength of these predictors changed seasonally and highlight the hierarchical controls on headwater catchment runoff generation. Our results highlight direct and quantifiable linkages between catchment topography, vegetation, geology, their topology, and hydrologic dynamics.

AB One major challenge in large scale modeling is the estimation of spatially consistent distributed parameters, that are parameters with a clear functional relationship to climate and landscape characteristics. We present a newly developed PArameter Set Shuffling (PASS) approach, which is able to provide such regionally consistent parameter sets. The PASS method does not require any a priori assumption on the relationship between model parameters and catchment descriptors. It instead derives these relationships from observed patterns of calibrated parameters and available catchment descriptors. We tested the PASS approach to derive parameters of a conceptual hydrological model applied to 263 German catchments. The resulting median model efficiencies for training and test catchments are, respectively, 0.74 and 0.72, similar to those obtained by other modeling approaches, which use regional calibration. In this study, a combination of catchment descriptors that clearly controls model parameters is not found. In fact, we show that various regional functional relationships between catchment descriptors and model parameters result in similarly good model performances. Moreover, catchment descriptors used for parameter prediction can be replaced in the parameter prediction, without any decrease in model performance. Our results suggest that by using conventional catchment descriptors based on averages, only the amount of information that is also retained in the existing correlations among climatic and catchment indicators is exploited. Development of a new generation of hydrologically meaningful catchment and climate descriptors is required to further improve our capability of forecasting hydrological dynamics of interest by means of large scale models and regionalization approaches.

AB Relationships between porosity and hydraulic conductivity tend to be strongly scale- and site-dependent and are thus very difficult to establish. As a result, hydraulic conductivity distributions inferred from geophysically derived porosity models must be calibrated using some measurement of aquifer response. This type of calibration is potentially very valuable as it may allow for transport predictions within the considered hydrological unit at locations where only geophysical measurements are available, thus reducing the number of well tests required and thereby the costs of management and remediation. Here, we explore this concept through a series of numerical experiments. Considering the case of porosity characterization in saturated heterogeneous aquifers using crosshole ground-penetrating radar and borehole porosity log data, we use tracer test measurements to calibrate a relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity that allows the best prediction of the observed hydrological behavior. To examine the validity and effectiveness of the obtained relationship, we examine its performance at alternate locations not used in the calibration procedure. Our results indicate that this methodology allows us to obtain remarkably reliable hydrological predictions throughout the considered hydrological unit based on the geophysical data only. This was also found to be the case when significant uncertainty was considered in the underlying relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We start from the well-documented scale dependence displayed by the probability distribution and associated statistical moments of a variety of hydrogeological and soil science variables and their spatial or temporal increments. These features can be captured by a Generalized Sub-Gaussian (GSG) model, according to which a given variable, Y, is subordinated to a (typically spatially correlated) Gaussian random field, G, through a subordinator, U. This study extends the theoretical framework originally proposed by Riva et al. (2015, 10.1002/2015WR016998) to include the possibility of selecting a general form of the subordinator, thus enhancing the flexibility of the GSG framework for data interpretation and modeling. Analytical expressions for the GSG process associated with lognormal, Pareto, and Gamma subordinator distributions are then derived. We demonstrate the ability of the GSG modeling framework to capture the way key features of the statistics associated with two data sets transition across scales. The latter correspond to variables, which are typical of a geochemical and a hydrogeological setting, that is, (i) data characterizing the micrometer-scale surface roughness of a crystal of calcite, collected within a laboratory-scale setting, resulting from induced mineral dissolution, and (ii) a vertical distribution of decimeter-scale porosity data, collected along a deep kilometer-scale borehole within a sandstone formation and typically used in hydrogeological and geophysical characterization of aquifer systems. The theoretical developments and the successful applications of the approach we propose provide a unique framework within which one can interpret a broad range of scaling behaviors displayed by a variety of Earth and environmental variables in various scenarios.
   Plain Language Summary Characterization of hydrogeological and geochemical systems aims at assessing the heterogeneity and scale dependency exhibited by their attributes and the associated key statistics. It has been shown that complex scaling features documented for the statistics of a wide range of Earth, environmental (and several other) variables, and their spatial/temporal increments can be captured through a Generalized Sub-Gaussian (GSG) model. The latter relies on the subordination of a Gaussian random field through a subordinator. This study extends the theoretical framework originally proposed for the GSG model to include multiple choices of the subordinator distribution. We provide the theoretical formulation and discuss the main features of the GSG model resulting from (i) a general form of the subordinator and (ii) three selected distributional forms. We show the effectiveness of the GSG modeling framework for the interpretation of real data encompassing a considerably wide range of scales by analyzing (i) a set of surface topography (roughness) data collected on a calcite sample in a laboratory-scale geochemical setting and (ii) a field-scale distribution of porosity data, collected along a deep borehole within a sandstone formation.

AB At the pore scale, slow invasion of a wetting fluid in porous materials is often modeled with quasi-static approximations which only consider capillary forces in the form of simple pore-filling rules. The appropriateness of this approximation, often applied in pore network models, is contested in the literature, reflecting the difficulty of predicting imbibition relative permeability with these models. However, validation by sole comparison to continuum-scale experiments is prone to induce model overfitting. It has therefore remained unclear whether difficulties generalizing the model performance are caused by errors in the predicted filling sequence or by subsequent calculations. Here, we address this by examining whether such a model can predict the pore-scale fluid distributions underlying the behavior at the continuum scale. To this end, we compare the fluid arrangement evolution measured in fast synchrotron micro-CT experiments on two rock types to quasi-static simulations which implement capillary-dominated pore filling and snap-off, including a sophisticated model for cooperative pore filling. The results indicate that such pore network models can, in principle, predict fluid distributions accurately enough to estimate upscaled flow properties of strongly wetted rocks at low capillary numbers.

AB Using satellite observations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from NOAA-AVHRR and Terra-MODIS, together with climatic data in a physical evapotranspiration (ET) model, the spatio-temporal variability of ET is investigated in terrestrial China from 1981 to 2010. The model predictions of actual ET (ETa) are validated with ET values from in situ eddy covariance flux measurements and from basin water balance calculations. The national averaged crop reference ET (ETp) and ETa values are 91621 and 415 +/- 12mm year(-1), respectively. The annual ETa pattern is closely associated with vegetation conditions in the eastern part of China, whereas ETa is low in the sparsely-vegetated areas and deserts in the northwestern region, corresponding to scarce rainfall events and amounts. The trends of ETp and ETa are remarkably different over the country, and the complementary relationship between ETp and ETa is revealed for the study period. Averaged over the whole country, ETa showed an increasing trend from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, followed by a decreasing trend, consistent with the precipitation anomaly. Across the main vegetation types, annual ETa amounts are found to correspond clearly with the bands of precipitation and ETp. Resume l'aide d'observations satellitaires dindice de vegetation NDVI de NOAA-AVHRR et Terra-MODIS et de donnees climatiques utilisees dans un modele physique d'evapotranspiration (ET), la variabilite spatio-temporelle de l'ET en Chine a ete etudiee de 1981 a 2010. Les previsionss du modele d'ET reelle (ETa) ont ete validees avec des valeurs d'ET issues de mesures de covariance de flux in situ et de calculs de bilan en eau a l'echelle du bassin. La moyenne nationale de reference de l'ET de culture (ETP) et les valeurs de l'ETa sont respectivement de 916 +/- 21 et 415 +/- 12 mm an-1. Les valeurs annuelles d'ETa sont etroitement associees aux conditions de vegetation dans la partie orientale de la Chine, alors que l'ETa est faible dans les zones a faible densite de vegetation et dans les deserts de la region Nord-Ouest, correspondant a des evenements et des quantites de precipitations rares. Les tendances d'ETp et d'ETa sont remarquablement differentes dans le pays, et la relation complementaire entre ETp et l'ETa a ete determinee pour la periode d'etude. En moyenne sur l'ensemble du pays, l'ETa est en augmentation des annees 1980 au milieu des annees 1990, puis subit une tendance a la baisse, conformement a l'anomalie de precipitation. En ce qui concerne les principaux types de vegetation, les valeurs annuelles d'ETa correspondent clairement aux bandes de precipitations et d'ETp.

AB [ 1] We study macroscopic ( centimeter scale) dispersion using pore-scale network simulation. A Lagrangian-based transport model incorporating flow and diffusion is applied in a diamond lattice of throats with square cross section whose radius distribution is the same as computed for Berea sandstone. We use physically consistent rules using a combination of stream-tube routing and ideal mixing to transport particles across pore junctions. The influence of both heterogeneity and high Peclet numbers results in asymptotic behavior only being seen after movement through many throats. A comprehensive comparative study of longitudinal dispersion with experiments in consolidated and unconsolidated media indicates that the model can quantitatively predict the asymptotic macroscopic dispersion coefficient over a broad range of Peclet numbers, 0 < Pe < 10(5). In the low Peclet number region, molecular diffusion is more restricted for consolidated media as compared with unconsolidated media. The first effects of advection on dispersion are observed at Pe - 0.1. In the advection-dominated regions the longitudinal dispersion coefficient follows a weak nonlinear dependence on Peclet number (D-L - Pe(1.19)) followed by a linear dependence D-L - Pe for Pe > 400.

AB Evapotranspiration and photosynthetic carbon uptake are both constrained by water availability, with presumed water-limited and water-independent but energy-limited regimes. We investigate water availability's relationships with evaporative fluxes and photosynthetic measures at continental scale using surface and satellite-based observations. The observation-driven approach is independent of prior model-based estimates. We find water-limited and water-independent regimes for both energy and carbon cycle processes in spatial and temporal aggregate, differences in water-limitation relationships across ecohydrological regions, and more consistent signs of water limitation in photosynthetic than evaporative processes. Ecosystem water use efficiency's response to water availability changes in sign with aridity state across time and space generally but shows negative correlations in temporal anomalies.
   Plain Language Summary Evaporation and plant CO2 uptake both require water to be available at the land surface. From satellite and weather station data, we find simple relationships between these processes and the amount of available water. Even though evaporation and CO2 uptake are linked through water loss from plant leaves, we find that the relationships between each of these and the amount of available soil water are different; it seems that plant CO2 uptake is similarly sensitive to the amount of available water, in wet and dry environments, while evaporation is much more sensitive in dry environments. The amount of water used in the landscape for similar amounts of photosynthesis changes with soil wetness in the Western United States but remains relatively constant in the eastern United States.

AB A model-based approach is implemented to attribute changes in the seasonal extreme river flows to meteorological drivers. A semidistributed model that simulates daily runoff from daily series of meteorological variables was employed together with a multisite, multivariable weather generator. Ensembles of synthetic meteorological variables were synthesized using the weather generator and were used to drive the hydrological model. In order to systematically assess the relative importance of each of the meteorological variables in explaining the detected changes in the flood behavior, the variables were generated by accounting for the year to year variability of the distribution of one of the variables at a time while keeping the distributions of the others temporally stationary. The approach was tested on eight case study catchments from different parts of Germany. The results show the ability of the approach in identifying the meteorological variable that is associated with the detected change in the extreme flow. Changes in precipitation were found to be the major meteorological drivers of the trends detected in the seasonal extreme flows in most of the investigated catchments. Temperature was found to be less important in explaining any of the changes in all catchments.

AB Solute transport process in fractured rocks is central to many engineering applications. However, how matrix diffusion affects non-Fickian transport behavior, which is typically characterized by the late time tailing in breakthrough curves and residence time distributions, remains underexplored, especially considering the coupling effects of the finite matrix thickness (h) and transport regimes quantified by Peclet number (Pe). In this work, the fluid flow and solute transport were simulated by directly solving the Navier-Stokes equations and advection-diffusion equation in a two-dimensional fracture-matrix system considering matrix diffusion. In total, eighty cases considering variations of h and Pe were conducted to investigate the impacts of h and Pe on the late time solute tailing characterized by the exponent (n) in the power law function. Numerical results demonstrate that n decreases with an increase of h and Pe, where n eventually reduces to 1.5 that is a theoretical value for an infinite matrix domain. Moreover, the relationship between n and (h, Pe) is established via a polynomial function, which is further validated by the three-dimensional heterogeneous fracture-matrix system. The newly -established function can be used to accurately assess the power law tailing process given the knowledge of measurable h and Pe.

AB Hydraulic aperture (e(h)) which is independent of inertial effect has been widely used as an important parameter to study the geometric properties of single fractures in previous studies. However, the inertial effect dependence of hydraulic aperture was gradually revealed in recent studies. Therefore, hydraulic aperture could provide a new method to characterize the non-Darcy effect. In this study, 2D numerical simulations based on Navier-Stokes equation were carried out to explore the feasibility of characterizing non-Darcy effect based on hydraulic aperture. The results showed that the onset of flow regimes transition from Darcy to non-Darcy could be well characterized by the hydraulic aperture. Before the non-Darcy flow appeared, the initial hydraulic aperture (e(h0)) maintained constant regardless of the inertial effect (quantified by non-Darcy effect factor E), once the non-Darcy effect emerged, the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of inertial effect. The increased volume of low-velocity zone in the rough single fractures was considered as the mechanism of non-Darcy effect. And the existence of critical relative roughness (R-c) was found and it would affect the critical non-Darcy effect factor (E-d) or critical Reynolds number (Re-c) by affecting the development of low velocity region and preferential flow paths. From the overall trend, the hydraulic aperture decreased with the increase of E, and it fluctuated due to the development of recirculation zones (RZs). Moreover, the predictive model of non-Darcy effect factor (E) based on hydraulic aperture was obtained and the validity of the model was preliminarily verified.

AB In semiarid regions, where water resources are limited and precipitation dynamics are changing, understanding land surface-atmosphere interactions that regulate the coupled soil moisture-precipitation system is key for resource management and planning. We present a modeling approach to study soil moisture and albedo controls on planetary boundary layer height (PBLh). We used Santa Rita Creosote Ameriflux and Tucson Airport atmospheric sounding data to generate empirical relationships between soil moisture, albedo, and PBLh. Empirical relationships showed that similar to 50% of the variation in PBLh can be explained by soil moisture and albedo with additional knowledge gained by dividing the soil profile into two layers. Therefore, we coupled these empirical relationships with soil moisture estimated using a two-layer bucket approach to model PBLh under six precipitation scenarios. Overall we observed that decreases in precipitation tend to limit the recovery of the PBL at the end of the wet season. However, increases in winter precipitation despite decreases in summer precipitation may provide opportunities for positive feedbacks that may further generate more winter precipitation. Our results highlight that the response of soil moisture, albedo, and the PBLh will depend not only on changes in annual precipitation, but also on the frequency and intensity of this change. We argue that because albedo and soil moisture data are readily available at multiple temporal and spatial scales, developing empirical relationships that can be used in land surface-atmosphere applications have great potential for exploring the consequences of climate change.

ID RUNOFF; EROSION
AB Recently, a USDA Curve Number-based method for obtaining estimates of event runoff has been developed for use in enhancing the capacity of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE2) to deal with runoff-driven phenomena. However, RUSLE2 still uses the EI30 index as the basis for determining the erosivity of the rainfall for sets of runoff producing storms at a location even though the product of the runoff ratio (Q(R)) and EI30 index is better at prediction event erosion when runoff is known or predicted well. This paper reports the results of applying the Q(R)EI(30) index using data available from tables within RUSLE2 to predict storm event soil losses from bare fallow areas and areas with continuous corn at Holly Springs, MS, and Morris, MN. In RUSLE2, all rainfall during a calendar year is considered to detach soil material that is flushed from the area if and when runoff occurs. However, the Q(R)EI(30) index is calculated using the EI30 value for the amount of rain in the storm that produces runoff. Consequently, changes were made to the timing of events during the calendar year in order to meet the criteria for using the Q(R)EI(30) index. As a general rule, the peak event soil loss produced using the Q(R)EI(30) index were higher than produced by RUSLE2, and the peak event soil loss for the bare fallow occurred later than for the continuous corn. The results of the work reported here show that the Q(R)EI(30) index may be used to model event erosion produced by a set of storms within RUSLE2 provided that the appropriate mathematical rules upon which the USLE was developed are adhered to.

AB Understanding the factors that influence how global climate phenomena, such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), affect streamflow behavior is an important area of research in the hydrologic sciences. While large-scale patterns in ENSO-streamflow relationships have been thoroughly studied, and are relatively well-understood, information is scarce concerning factors that affect variation in ENSO responses from one watershed to another. To this end, we examined relationships between variability in ENSO activity and streamflow for 2731 watersheds across the conterminous U.S. from 1970 to 2014 using a novel approach to account for the intermediary role of precipitation. We applied an ensemble of regression techniques to describe relationships between variability in ENSO activity and streamflow as a function of watershed characteristics including: hydroclimate, topography, geomorphology, geographic location, land cover, soil characteristics, bedrock geology, and anthropogenic influences. We found that variability in watershed scale ENSO-streamflow relationships was strongly related to factors including: precipitation timing and phase, forest cover, and interactions between watershed topography and geomorphology. These, and other influential factors, share in common the ability to affect the partitioning and movement of water within watersheds. Our results demonstrate that the conceptualization of watersheds as signal filters for hydroclimate inputs, commonly applied to short-term rainfall-runoff responses, also applies to long-term hydrologic responses to sources of recurrent climate variability. These results also show that watershed processes, which are typically studied at relatively fine spatial scales, are also critical for understanding continental scale hydrologic responses to global climate.

AB Nature manifests itself in space and time. The spatiotemporal complexity of processes such as precipitation, temperature, and wind, does not allow purely deterministic modeling. Spatiotemporal random fields have a long history in modeling such processes, and yet a single unified framework offering the flexibility to simulate processes that may differ profoundly does not exist. Here we introduce a blueprint to efficiently simulate spatiotemporal random fields that preserve any marginal distribution, any valid spatiotemporal correlation structure, and intermittency. We suggest a set of parsimonious yet flexible marginal distributions and provide a rule of thumb for their selection. We propose a new and unified approach to construct flexible spatiotemporal correlation structures by combining copulas and survival functions. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated by simulating conceptual cases of intermittent precipitation, double-bounded relative humidity, and temperature maxima fields. As a real-word case we simulate daily precipitation fields. In all cases, we reproduce the desired properties. In an era characterized by advances in remote sensing and increasing availability of spatiotemporal data, we deem that this unified approach offers a valuable and easy-to-apply tool for modeling complex spatiotemporal processes.

AB In this study, the stable isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta H-2 and d-excess) in daily precipitation from October 2017 to May 2020 in the lower reach of the Yangtze River (LYR) were examined to understand the relationship between stable isotopic compositions in precipitation and synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns (SACPs). Atmospheric circulations over the LYR were classified into seven patterns according to the Kirchhofer method with three, one and three SACPs in the East Asian winter monsoon period (EAWM), the monsoon transition period and the East Asian summer monsoon period (EASM), respectively. Precipitation events between most SACPs are distinguishable for either delta O-18 or d-excess, except for two SACPs in the EAWM, and two SACPs in the EASM. Local meteorological variables are primary factors determining the variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation for three SACPs in the EAWM. Though the precipitation-producing air masses come from different seas under two different SACPs in the EASM, i.e., the South China Sea for one and the western Pacific for the other, neither delta O-18 nor d-excess is distinguishable. Nevertheless, the relationships between isotopic composition and meteorological variables appear to be distinguishable between these two SACPs. The SACP dominant in the monsoon transition tends to have higher delta O-18 (mean value) and delta H-2 (mean value) in precipitation than all other SACPs. The d-excess in precipitation of this SACP is more likely altered by subcloud evaporation, and the retrieval of moisture source d-excess information should be treated with cautions. Similarly, d-excess in Meiyu rain, classified in one of the SACPs in the EASM period, is very likely altered by moisture recycling along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway, evident from the significant negative relationship between d-excess in precipitation and mean specific humidity along the backward trajectories. Thus d-exess of Meiyu rain is very likely positively deviated from its oceanic moisture source. Overall, the findings can provide valuable insights for understanding the relationship between stable isotopes in precipitation and SACPs in the East Asian monsoon region.

AB Eagleson's classical regional flood frequency model is investigated. Our intention was not to improve the model, but to reveal previously unidentified important and dominant hydrological processes in it. The change of the coefficient of variation (CV) of annual maximum discharge with catchment area can be viewed as representing the spatial variance of floods in a homogeneous region. Several researchers have reported that the CV decreases as the catchment area increases, at least for large areas. On the other hand, Eagleson's classical studies have been known as pioneer efforts that combine the concept of similarity analysis (scaling) with the derived flood frequency approach. As we have shown, the classical model can reproduce the empirical relationship between the mean annual maximum discharge and catchment area, but it cannot reproduce the empirical decreasing CV-catchment area curve. Therefore, we postulate that previously unidentified hydrological processes would be revealed if the classical model were improved to reproduce the decreasing of CV with catchment area. First, we attempted to improve the classical model by introducing a channel network, but this was ineffective. However, the classical model was improved by introducing a two-parameter gamma distribution for rainfall intensity. What is important is not the gamma distribution itself, but those characteristics of spatial variability of rainfall intensity whose CV decreases with increasing catchment area. Introducing the variability of rainfall intensity into the hydrological simulations explains how the CV of rainfall intensity decreases with increasing catchment area. It is difficult to reflect the rainfall-runoff processes in the model while neglecting the characteristics of rainfall intensity from the viewpoint of annual flood discharge variances.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME; ANFIS; SYSTEM
AB Conventional neuro-fuzzy systems used for rainfall-runoff (R-R) modelling are generally dependent on expert knowledge. In these models, not only the structure is designed by the expert user, but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input-output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert. To move towards NFS with a more flexible rule base and structure, efforts are made to integrate the self-reliant mechanisms into the learning algorithm that enable the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input-output space and generate the required rule base. In this study, the self-adaptive fuzzy inference network (SaFIN) is used for the R-R application. SaFIN employs a new clustering technique known as Categorical Learning-Induced Partitioning (CLIP) which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model. SaFIN is also equipped with a rule-pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules. In this study, SaFIN R-R models are developed in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against a benchmark NFS model and few physical models including URHM, HBV, GR4J. Results shows that SaFIN is a capable and robust tool for R-R modeling under varying catchment conditions. Moreover, SaFIN produced comparable if not superior results to the benchmark models. It was concluded that SsFIN with its self-reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with rule pruning can make it a competent tool for R-R modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies.

AB Solute concentration variability is of fundamental importance for the chemical and ecological state of streams. It is often closely related to discharge variability and can be characterized in terms of a solute export regime. Previous studies, especially in lowland catchments, report that nitrate is often exported with an accretion pattern of increasing concentrations with increasing discharge. Several modeling approaches exist to predict the export regime of solutes from the spatial relationship of discharge generating zones with solute availability in the catchment. For a small agriculturally managed lowland catchment in central Germany, we show that this relationship is controlled by the depth to groundwater table and its temporal dynamics. Principal component analysis of groundwater level time series from wells distributed throughout the catchment allowed derivation of a representative groundwater level time series that explained most of the discharge variability. Groundwater sampling revealed consistently decreasing nitrate concentrations with an increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone. The relationships of depth to groundwater table to discharge and to nitrate concentration were parameterized and integrated to successfully model catchment discharge and nitrate export on the basis of groundwater level variations alone. This study shows that intensive and uniform agricultural land use likely results in a clear and consistent concentration-depth relationship of nitrate, which can be utilized in simple approaches to predict stream nitrate export dynamics at the catchment scale.

AB [1] The relationship between soil moisture and outflow is fundamental to land surface water and energy balance monitoring and modeling. However, characterizing it at levels above a point scale is complicated by factors including climate and surface heterogeneity, presence of lateral transports, and mismatches between spatial resolutions of measurements and models. We investigate the distinct roles of heterogeneity and nonlocal interactions in scaling this relationship from points to areas. Locations are modeled as independent columns, using measured soil moisture and precipitation data in a conditional averaging approach to estimate the local moisture outflow relationship. These estimates are aggregated using a distributional approach to account for the effect of heterogeneity. The locations are then treated as one large column; that is, the moisture outflow relationship is estimated directly from spatially aggregated data. We demonstrate that statistically significant differences between the two estimates indicate that the system is not well represented by the independence assumption; that is, local outflow is dependent on local moisture and is also independently influenced by large-scale moisture. We applied these methods to data from a hillslope, a watershed, and the state of Illinois and found that heterogeneity and nonlocal processes significantly affected scaling in all three. The identified nonlocal effect is to decrease ( increase) local outflow during large-scale dry ( wet) anomalies. A possible pathway is through decreased wind speed during dry anomalies. The combined effect increases the sensitivity of outflow to soil moisture as scale increases. These results could have implications for specifying parameters in large-scale models, especially those calibrated with smaller-scale field data.

AB Flow and transport properties of fractured rock masses are a function of geometrical structures across many scales. These structures result from physical processes and states and are highly anisotropic in nature. Fracture surfaces often tend to be shifted with respect to each other, which is generally a result of stress-induced displacements. This shift controls the fracture's transmissivity through the pore space that forms from the created mismatch between the surfaces. This transmissivity is anisotropic and greater in the direction perpendicular to the displacement. A contact mechanics-based, first-principle numerical approach is developed to investigate the effects that this shear-induced transmissivity anisotropy has on the overall permeability of a fractured rock mass. Deformation of the rock and contact between fracture surfaces is computed in three dimensions at two scales. At the rock mass scale, fractures are treated as planar discontinuities along which displacements and tractions are resolved. Contact between the individual rough fracture surfaces is solved for each fracture at the small scale to find the stiffness and transmissivity that result from shear-induced dilation and elastic compression. Results show that, given isotropic fracture networks, the direction of maximum permeability of a fractured rock mass tends to be aligned with the direction of the intermediate principal stress. This reflects the fact that fractures have the most pronounced slip in the plane of the maximum and minimum principal stresses, and for individual fractures transmissivity is most pronounced in the direction perpendicular to this slip.

AB Increased streamflow and its associated impacts on water quality have frequently been linked to changes in land use and land cover (LULC) such as tile drainage, cultivation of prairies, and increased adoption of soybeans (Glycine max) in modern day cropping systems. This study evaluated the relative importance of changes in precipitation and LULC on streamflow in 29 Hydrologic Unit Code 008 watersheds in the upper midwestern United States. The evaluation was done by statistically testing the changes in slope and intercept of the relationships between ln(annual streamflow) versus annual precipitation for the periods prior to 1975 (prechange period) and after 1976 (postchange period). A significant shift either in slope or intercept of these relationships was assumed to be an indication of LULC changes whereas a lack of significant shift suggested a single relationship driven by precipitation. All 29 watersheds showed no statistical difference in slope or intercept of the relationships between the two periods. However, a simpler model that kept the slope constant for the two periods showed a slight upward shift in the intercept value for 10 watersheds in the postchange period. A comparison of 5 year moving averages also revealed that the increased streamflows in the postchange period are mainly due to an increase in precipitation. Minimal or the lack of LULC change impact on streamflow results from comparable evapotranspiration in the two time periods. We also show how incorrect assumptions in previously published studies minimized precipitation change impacts and heightened the LULC change impacts on streamflows.

AB In uniform soils that are susceptible to unstable preferential flow, the water saturation exhibits a nonmonotonic profile upon continuous infiltration. This overshoot cannot be described by the conventional Richards equation. Here, solutions to the infiltrations using a popular nonequilibrium extension to the Richards equation are obtained using the traveling wave nature of the saturation profile. Quantitative comparisons are made to recent measurements of saturation overshoot. The nonequilibrium solutions can be made to fit the flux range of the overshoot, but the fit to the tip saturations is fair to poor at best. Also, small changes in porous media size and roughness require large changes in the magnitude of the nonequilibrium term to match the flux range. The results suggest that the nonequilibrium. capillary pressure does not include the correct physics that controls the overshoot. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To address questions related to the acceleration or deceleration of the global hydrological cycle or links between the carbon and water cycles over land, reliable data for past climatic conditions based on proxies are required. In particular, the reconstruction of palaeoatmospheric Co-2 content (C-a) is needed to assist the separation of natural from anthropogenic C-a variability and to explore phase relations between C-a and air temperature T-a time series. Both T-a and C-a are needed to fingerprint anthropogenic signatures in vapor pressure deficit, a major driver used to explain acceleration or deceleration phases in the global hydrological cycle. Current approaches to C-a reconstruction rely on a robust inverse correlation between measured stomatal density in leaves (nu) of many plant taxa and C-a. There are two methods that exploit this correlation: The first uses calibration curves obtained from extant species assumed to represent the fossil taxa, thereby restricting the suitable taxa to those existing today. The second is a hybrid eco-hydrological/physiological approach that determines C-a with the aid of systems of equations based on quasi-instantaneous leaf-gas exchange theories and fossil stomatal data collected along with other measured leaf anatomical traits and parameters. In this contribution, a reduced order model (ROM) is proposed that derives C-a from a single equation incorporating the aforementioned stomatal data, basic climate (e.g. temperature), estimated biochemical parameters of assimilation and isotope data. The usage of the ROM is then illustrated by applying it to isotopic and anatomical measurements from three extant species. The ROM derivation is based on a balance between the biochemical demand and atmospheric supply of Co-2 that leads to an explicit expression linking stomatal conductance to internal Co-2 concentration (C-i) and C-a. The resulting expression of stomatal conductance from the carbon economy of the leaf is then equated to another expression derived from water vapor gas diffusion that includes anatomical traits. When combined with isotopic measurements for long-term C-i/C-a, C-a can be analytically determined and is interpreted as the time-averaged C-a that existed over the life-span of the leaf. Key advantages of the proposed ROM are: 1) the usage of isotopic data provides constraints on the reconstructed atmospheric Co-2 concentration from., 2) the analytical form of this approach permits direct links between parameter uncertainties and reconstructed C-a, and 3) the time-scale mismatch between the application of instantaneous leaf-gas exchange expressions constrained with longer-term isotopic data is reconciled through averaging rules and sensitivity analysis. The latter point was rarely considered in prior reconstruction studies that combined models of leaf-gas exchange and isotopic data to reconstruct C-a from nu. The proposed ROM is not without its limitations given the need to a priori assume a parameter related to the control on photosynthetic rate. The work here further explores immanent constraints for the aforementioned photosynthetic parameter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanistic models now exist to predict hydraulic conductivity (K) from the spectral-induced polarization (SIP) response of granular media. We examined the predictions of such a model on unconsolidated coarse fluvial sediments and compared them to those obtained with a modified Kozeny-Carman (KC) model. Samples were retrieved from the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), located on a gravel bar adjacent to the Boise River, Idaho. A sample holder (0.102 m diameter and 0.12 m in length) was designed to include the cobble framework in reconstituted samples representing the primary stratigraphic units defined based on porosity variation at this site. SIP (0.001-1000 Hz) and K (from Darcy tests) measurements were recorded for 12 samples, with SIP measurements made as a function of pore fluid conductivity (3-300 mS/m), grain size distribution (GSD), and total porosity. K prediction with the KC model was improved after discounting of the cobble framework and multiplying by the tortuosity resulting from matrix "capillaries'' around the cobbles, resulting in estimates of sigma '' within a factor of 5 of the measurements. K prediction with a mechanistic SIP model based on Stern layer polarization (SLP model) that requires an estimate of the GSD also required discounting for the cobble framework to obtain estimates within 0.5 orders of magnitude of the measurements. Similarly, the SLP model overpredicts the measured imaginary conductivity (sigma '') unless the cobble framework is discounted, which then results in estimates of r00 within a factor of 2 of the measurements. This can be explained by the fact that the cobbles polarize at frequencies well below the minimum measurement frequency (0.001 Hz). The SLP model for K prediction parameterized in terms of the formation factor and imaginary conductivity performed well for the 10 samples with a cobble framework without modification as the imaginary conductivity directly senses the matrix grain size characteristics, whereas the formation factor captures the porosity reduction and tortuosity resulting from the presence of the cobble framework (capillary tortuosity). Our findings suggest that the estimation of contrasts in K in coarse sediments may be achievable through measurements of electrical properties after appropriate consideration of the cobble fraction.

TI Incentive compatibility and conflict resolution in international river
   basins: A case study of the Nile Basin
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Nation-states rarely go to war over water, but it is equally rare that water conflicts in an international river basin are resolved through cooperation among the riparian countries that use the shared resources. Gains from cooperation will mean little to individual riparians unless the required cooperative behaviors are incentive compatible. Cooperative game theory offers useful insights for assessing cooperative solutions for water conflicts in international river basins. Applying cooperative game theory concepts such as core, nucleolus, and Shapley value to Nile water conflicts, we examine the incentive structure of both cooperative and noncooperative strategies for different riparian countries and establish some baseline conditions for incentive-compatible cooperation in the Nile basin.

TI Finite amplitude bed deformations in totally and partially transporting
   wide channel bends
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MEANDERS; FLOW
AB We develop an analytic approach able to predict flow and bed topography in curved cohesionless wide channels. The novel feature of the present theory, compared with previous analytic approaches, is its ability to treat bottom perturbations of finite amplitude and situations such that sediment transport does not occur within the whole cross section. The theory is presently applied to the case of constant curvature channels though it can be extended, in principle, to channels with variable curvature. Results show that the dominant mechanism controlling the establishment of bed profile is the topographic feedback of bottom deformations on the flow field, while the role of the dispersive transverse transport of longitudinal momentum and of the metrically induced transverse variations of longitudinal slope is usually relatively small. The theory extends previous linear analyses which are shown to underpredict deeping of the cross section close to the outer bank. Also, unlike linear theories, the present approach predicts a transverse slope of the bed profile increasing towards the outer bend in agreement with experimental observations. The maximum depth is found to depend on the friction coefficient C-u of the undisturbed uniform stream and on the parameter nu(theta(u))(1/2)/C-u where nu is curvature ratio, that is, the ratio between channel half width and radius of curvature of the centerline, while theta(u) is the Shields stress of the undisturbed uniform stream. Comparison with experimental observations is fairly satisfactory. The shape of the cross section is then determined also for values of theta(u) close enough to the critical values not to allow bedload transport within the whole cross section, The threshold value of theta(u) separating the total transport from the partial transport regime is finally determined as a function of the curvature ratio nu.

AB We study diffusion in a heterogeneous medium that is characterized by spatially varying diffusion properties from a random walk point of view. We show that an inhomogeneous continuous time random walk (CTRW) with a spatially variable exponential transition time distribution solves the spatially discretized heterogeneous diffusion equation. This demonstrates the equivalence of the widely used time-domain random walk (TDRW) scheme and spatially inhomogeneous CTRW and at the same time provides a demonstration of the formal equivalence of the TDRW particle formulation and the heterogeneous diffusion equation. Based on this equivalence, we develop a TDRW method for heterogeneous diffusion under spatially variable multirate mass transfer properties. We discuss the implementation of these schemes and study the diffusion behavior in the presence of traps that are characterized by a truncated power-law trapping time distribution.

AB Aquifer remediation is a challenging problem with environmental, social, and economic implications. As a general rule, pumping proceeds until the concentration of the target substance within the pumped water lies below a prespecified value. In this paper we estimate the a priori potential failure of the endpoint of remediation due to a rebound of concentrations driven by back diffusion. In many cases, it has been observed that once pumping ceases, a rebound in the concentration at the well takes place. For this reason, administrative approaches are rather conservative, and pumping is forced to last much longer than initially expected. While a number of physical and chemical processes might account for the presence of rebounding, we focus here on diffusion from low water mobility into high mobility zones. In this work we look specifically at the concentration rebound when pumping is discontinued while accounting for multiple mass transfer processes occurring at different time scales and parametric uncertainty. We aim to develop a risk-based optimal operation methodology that is capable of estimating the endpoint of remediation based on aquifer parameters characterizing the heterogeneous medium as well as pumping rate and initial size of the polluted area.

AB Reservoir systems with multiple operators can benefit from coordination of operation policies. To maximize the total benefit of these systems the literature has normally used the social planner's approach. Based on this approach operation decisions are optimized using a multi-objective optimization model with a compound system's objective. While the utility of the system can be increased this way, fair allocation of benefits among the operators remains challenging for the social planner who has to assign controversial weights to the system's beneficiaries and their objectives. Cooperative game theory provides an alternative framework for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation. To determine the fair and efficient utility shares of the beneficiaries, cooperative game theory solution methods consider the gains of each party in the status quo (non-cooperation) as well as what can be gained through the grand coalition (social planner's solution or full cooperation) and partial coalitions. Nevertheless, estimation of the benefits of different coalitions can be challenging in complex multibeneficiary systems. Reinforcement learning can be used to address this challenge and determine the gains of the beneficiaries for different levels of cooperation, i.e., non-cooperation, partial cooperation, and full cooperation, providing the essential input for allocation based on cooperative game theory. This paper develops a game theory-reinforcement learning (GT-RL) method for determining the optimal operation policies in multi-operator multi-reservoir systems with respect to fairness and efficiency criteria. As the first step to underline the utility of the GT-RL method in solving complex multi-agent multi-reservoir problems without a need for developing compound objectives and weight assignment, the proposed method is applied to a hypothetical three-agent three-reservoir system.

AB Understanding streamflow patterns in space and time is important for improving flood and drought forecasting, water resources management, and predictions of ecological changes. Objectives of this work include (a) to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow using information theory-based measures at two thoroughly-monitored agricultural watersheds located in different hydroclimatic zones with similar land use, and (b) to elucidate and quantify temporal and spatial scale effects on those measures. We selected two USDA experimental watersheds to serve as case study examples, including the Little River experimental watershed (LREW) in Tifton, Georgia and the Sleepers River experimental watershed (SREW) in North Danville, Vermont. Both watersheds possess several nested sub-watersheds and more than 30 years of continuous data records of precipitation and streamflow. Information content measures (metric entropy and mean information gain) and complexity measures (effective measure complexity and fluctuation complexity) were computed based on the binary encoding of 5-year streamflow and precipitation time series data. We quantified patterns of streamflow using probabilities of joint or sequential appearances of the binary symbol sequences. Results of our analysis illustrate that information content measures of streamflow time series are much smaller than those for precipitation data, and the streamflow data also exhibit higher complexity, suggesting that the watersheds effectively act as filters of the precipitation information that leads to the observed additional complexity in streamflow measures. Correlation coefficients between the information-theory-based measures and time intervals are close to 0.9, demonstrating the significance of temporal scale effects on streamflow patterns. Moderate spatial scale effects on streamflow patterns are observed with absolute values of correlation coefficients between the measures and sub-watershed area varying from 0.2 to 0.6 in the two watersheds. We conclude that temporal effects must be evaluated and accounted for when the information theory-based methods are used for performance evaluation and comparison of hydrological models.

AB Since its development by Lighthill and Whitham (1955a,b), the kinematic wave theory has found widespread application in environmental and water sciences, It took nearly 15 years before the theory was accepted as a sound scientific concept for modelling of a variety of hydrological processes. The debate as to its validity, however, still continues in some quarters and is not likely to end any time soon. Irrespective of the merits of the argument for or against the theory, new areas of its application continue to unfold and its scope is expanding considerably.
   These days the kinematic wave theory is being applied to a variety of hydrological processes (Singh, 1996a, 1997a,b). Examples of its application span overland and channel flow, baseflow, unsaturated flow, macropore flow, flow in furrows and borders, river hydraulics, movement of glaciers, erosion and sediment transport, sedimentation, solute transport, microbial. transport and chromatographic transport, to name but a few. These and other applications of the kinematic wave theory can be pooled together under different branches of hydrology, including surface water hydrology, vadose zone hydrology, river and coastal hydrology, irrigation hydrology, subsurface hydrology, snow and glacier hydrology, and water quality hydlology. The discussion in what follows is organized according to these areas of application.
   The objective of this paper is to trace the history of evolution of the kinematic wave theory and its application in hydrology and water resources. This historical essay attempts to put the theory in I,roper perspective and should serve as a guide to decide when and where to use the theory. The essay points to areas where further advances in applying the theory can be made.

AB We review the state of the art in modeling of variable-density flow and transport in porous media, including conceptual models for convection systems, governing balance equations, phenomenological laws, constitutive relations for fluid density and viscosity, and numerical methods for solving the resulting nonlinear multifield problems. The discussion of numerical methods addresses strategies for solving the coupled spatio-temporal convection process, consistent velocity approximation, and error-based mesh adaptation techniques. As numerical models for those nonlinear systems must be carefully verified in appropriate tests, we discuss weaknesses and inconsistencies of current model-verification methods as well as benchmark solutions. We give examples of field-related applications to illustrate specific challenges of further research, where heterogeneities and large scales are important. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent focus of flood frequency analysis (FFA) studies has been on development of methods to model joint distributions of variables such as peak flow, volume, and duration that characterize a flood event, as comprehensive knowledge of flood event is often necessary in hydrological applications. Diffusion process based adaptive kernel (D-kernel) is suggested in this paper for this purpose. It is data driven, flexible and unlike most kernel density estimators, always yields a bona fide probability density function. It overcomes shortcomings associated with the use of conventional kernel density estimators in FFA, such as boundary leakage problem and normal reference rule. The potential of the D-kernel is demonstrated by application to synthetic samples of various sizes drawn from known unimodal and bimodal populations, and five typical peak flow records from different parts of the world. It is shown to be effective when compared to conventional Gaussian kernel and the best of seven commonly used copulas (Gumbel-Hougaard, Frank, Clayton, Joe, Normal, Plackett, and Student's T) in estimating joint distribution of peak flow characteristics and extrapolating beyond historical maxima. Selection of optimum number of bins is found to be critical in modeling with D-kernel.

AB This paper proposes a non-linear model to describe streamflow recessions. A model of combining power-law and exponential functions is derived from a non-linear differential equation associating outflow change rate and flow itself with a time-dependent decreasing decay rate. The decay rate is approximated by the first three terms in a Taylor series expansion. The solution of the resulting differential equation includes three components of the expansion determining two exponential functions and a power-law function, respectively. It is demonstrated analytically and empirically that the introduction of a non-linear differential equation comprising a mixture of power-law and exponential forms is superior to using an ordinary differential equation with exponential solution, or a nonlinear equation with power-law solution, for modeling the decay patterns of flow in river systems. Analytical properties of the mixing model are discussed and the model is subsequently validated by characterizing the relationships between decay of peak flow as a function of time after the initial occurrence of flow peak in 10 datasets of flow events chosen from five gauging stations in the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) area, Canada.

AB Understanding the time-dependent scaling of chemical weathering has been a significant research goal for over a decade. A percolation theoretical treatment of nonreactive solute transport that was previously shown compatible with the scaling of chemical weathering rates is here shown to be compatible with soil formation rates, and with C and N sequestration rates in the soil as well. In this theoretical framework, the percolation backbone fractal dimensionality, which generates the long-time tail of the solute arrival time distribution, also predicts the scaling of the reaction rates, while laboratory proportionality to the fluid flow velocity translates to an analogous relevance of the vertical infiltration rate in the field. The predicted proportionality of solute transport to net infiltration generates simultaneously the variability in soil formation rates across 4 orders of magnitude of precipitation and 12 orders of magnitude of time scales.

AB Step-pool units, common features in steep, narrow streams, are highly dynamic systems that adjust during high flows and active sediment transport conditions. Consecutive step pools in a reach form a step-pool sequence, and though these features are prevalent in nature, quantifying the stability of such systems is challenging. This study focuses on the statistical relationships between 445 stable sequences of three or more steps and nine geometric and resistance-based parameters. Step sequence stability is parameterized through a sequence stability parameter, a metric of how long a given step-pool sequence exists relative to the total run time. Despite variability in the strength of the statistical relationships, the results allow identification of dominant trends between sequence stability and both roughness and geometric parameters. The sediment concentration ratio provides a means for comparing the relative strength of these statistical relationships. As sediment concentration ratios increase, the relations between flow resistance parameters and step stability change from dominantly inverse to dominantly direct. Thus, at higher sediment concentration ratios, sequence stability is more likely to increase with flow resistance, but the reverse is more likely at low sediment concentration ratios. A connection exists between bed morphology, flow resistance, and stability. For the majority of stable step sequences, resistance parameters increase over time, indicating some sequences adjust their geometry to increase stability during flood events. The influence of sediment concentration over the stability-geometric and stability-resistance parameter relationships may enable the use of the sediment concentration ratio as a predictor of step sequence stability during a flow event.

AB This paper synthesizes recent works at the interface of hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology under an integrated framework of analysis with an aim for a general theory. It addresses a wide range of related topics, including biodiversity of freshwater fish in river networks and vegetation along riparian systems, how river networks affected historic spreading of human populations, and how they influence the spreading of water-borne diseases. Given the commonalities among various dendritic structures and despite the variety and complexity of the ecosystems involved, we present here an integrated line of research addressing the above and related topics through a unique, coherent ecohydrological thread and similar mathematical methods. Metacommunity and individual-based models are studied in the context of hydrochory, population, and species migrations and the spreading of infections of water-borne diseases along the ecological corridors of river basins. A general theory emerges on the effects of dendritic geometries on the ecological processes and dynamics operating on river basins that will establish a new significant scientific branch. Insights provided by such a theory will lend themselves to issues of great practical importance such as integration of riparian systems into large-scale resource management, spatial strategies to minimize loss of freshwater biodiversity, and effective prevention campaigns against water-borne diseases.

TI A new soil matric potential sensor based on time domain reflectometry
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER CONTENT; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY
AB We developed and tested a new sensor based on time domain reflectometry (TDR) to measure soil matric potential (h). The TDR-matric (TM) sensor is constructed of porous disks having different known maximum pore sizes and stacked within a coaxial cage. The constant relationship between water content (theta) and h of the TM porous matrix is initially calibrated and subsequently used to infer matric potential of the surrounding soil, similar to existing porous heat dissipation and electrical resistance sensors. The theta of the sensor's porous matrix in hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding soil is measured by TDR travel time analysis. Prototype sensors were constructed using porous ceramic and plastic disks having maximum pore diameters between 120 mu m (2.5 kPa) and about 0.6 mu m (0.5 MPa). Calibration tests to evaluate sensor theta-h relationships were completed in a pressure chamber apparatus using four soils. These results and those from sensors installed in soil lysimeters in the presence of growing plants showed consistent theta-h relationships and synchronized responses of soils and TM sensors to changing water status. Pairing standard TDR probes with the new TM sensors facilitates in situ determination of soil theta(h) relationships, using conventional TDR instrumentation. The sensor design accommodates construction of media- or application-specific sensors using combinations of disks having different pore sizes. There is a trade-off between the TM sensor's matric potential range and its sensitivity to changes in the surrounding soil. Additionally, a mismatch between the pore size distributions of the TM sensor and the soil (mostly relevant to coarse-textured soils) can lead to hydraulic decoupling of these and other porous sensors.

AB Aquifer hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity (K) are ubiquitously heterogeneous and typically only a statistical characterization can be sought. Additionally, statistical anisotropy at typical characterization scales is the rule. Thus, regardless of the processes governing solute transport at the local (pore) scale, transport becomes non-Fickian. Mass-transfer models provide an efficient tool that reproduces observed anomalous transport; in some cases though, these models lack predictability as model parameters cannot readily be connected to the physical properties of aquifers. In this study, we focus on a multirate mass-transfer model (MRMT), and in particular the apparent capacity coefficient (), which is a strong indicator of the potential of immobile zones to capture moving solute. We aim to find if the choice of an apparent can be phenomenologically related to measures of statistical anisotropy. We analyzed an ensemble of random simulations of three-dimensional log-transformed multi-Gaussian permeability fields with stationary anisotropic correlation under convergent flow conditions. It was found that apparent also displays an anisotropic behavior, physically controlled by the aquifer directional connectivity, which in turn is controlled by the anisotropic correlation model. A high hydraulic connectivity results in large values. These results provide new insights into the practical use of mass-transfer models for predictive purposes.

AB The traditional hydrologic time series approaches are used for modeling, simulating and forecasting conditional mean of hydrologic variables but neglect their time varying variance or the second order moment. This paper introduces the multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) modeling approach to show how the variance-covariance relationship between hydrologic variables varies in time. These approaches are also useful to estimate the dynamic conditional correlation between hydrologic variables. To illustrate the novelty and usefulness of MGARCH models in hydrology, two major types of MGARCH models, the bivariate diagonal VECH and constant conditional correlation (CCC) models are applied to show the variance-covariance structure and cdynamic correlation in a rainfall-runoff process. The bivariate diagonal VECH-GARCH(1,1) and CCC-GARCH(1,1) models indicated both short-run and long-run persistency in the conditional variance-covariance matrix of the rainfall-runoff process. The conditional variance of rainfall appears to have a stronger persistency, especially long-run persistency, than the conditional variance of streamflow which shows a short-lived drastic increasing pattern and a stronger short-run persistency. The conditional covariance and conditional correlation coefficients have different features for each bivariate rainfall-runoff process with different degrees of stationarity and dynamic nonlinearity. The spatial and temporal pattern of variance-covariance features may reflect the signature of different physical and hydrological variables such as drainage area, topography, soil moisture and ground water fluctuations on the strength, stationarity and nonlinearity of the conditional variance-covariance for a rainfall-runoff process.

AB The breakthrough pressures of shale fractures are of great significance for the understanding of shale gas seepage or accumulation, CO2 geological sequestration and radioactive waste storage in shale, and pollution problems caused by gas leakage. In this study, three shale cores taken from the eastern Qaidam Basin in China were used to investigate the breakthrough pressures of partially saturated shale fractures. The fractured shale core had a single longitudinal fracture across the core along the axis. A quantitative description of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture is difficult because of the difficulty in the measurement of the water volume in the fracture. We propose a method to describe this relationship. In this method, the water content in the fracture is described by the matric potential. Cores with different matric potentials were prepared by moistening the cores in different humidity environments. Methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on three core samples under six different matric potentials. The six matric potential levels were - 51.38 MPa, - 39.08 MPa, - 23.45 MPa, 8.55 MPa, - 2.33 MPa, and 0 MPa. Based on the experimental results, we apply a conceptual model to qualitatively describe the relationship among the matric potential, water distribution in the fracture, and breakthrough pressure. At a low matric potential, water forms very thin water films on fracture surfaces, and the effect of water on the breakthrough pressure is not notable. As the matric potential increases, the thickness of water film in the fracture increases, and the increase in the breakthrough pressure become notably. We establish a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and matric potential. The experimental data show that the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential is a process that proceeds from slow to fast, and there is a critical value of matric potential in this process. When the critical value is reached, the connected gas passages are gradually sealed by water films, and the breakthrough pressure begins to increase significantly.

AB A discontinuous Gaterkin (DG) finite element method is described for the two-dimensional, depth-integrated shallow water equations (SWEs). This method is based on formulating the SWEs as a system of conservation laws, or advection-diffusion equations. A weak formulation is obtained by integrating the equations over a single element, and approximating the unknowns by piecewise, possibly discontinuous, polynomials, Because of its local nature, the DG method easily allows for varying the polynomial order of approximation. It is also "locally conservative", and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes for modeling problems with high flow gradients. Numerical results are presented for several test cases, including supercritical flow, river inflow and standard tidal flow in complex domains, and a contaminant transport scenario where we have coupled the shallow water flow equations with a transport equation for a chemical species.

AB Storage-discharge curves are widely used in several hydrological applications concerning flow and solute transport in small catchments. This article analyzes the relation Q(S) (where Q is the discharge and S is the saturated storage in the hillslope), as a function of some simple structural parameters. The relation Q(S) is evaluated through two-dimensional numerical simulations and makes use of dimensionless quantities. The method lies in between simple analytical approaches, like those based on the Boussinesq formulation, and more complex distributed models. After the numerical solution of the dimensionless Richards equation, simple analytical relations for Q(S) are determined in dimensionless form, as a function of a few relevant physical parameters. It was found that the storage-discharge curve can be well approximated by a power law function Q/(LKs) = a(S/(L-2(phi, theta(r))))(b), where L is the length of the hillslope, K-s the saturated conductivity,phi theta(r) the effective porosity, and a, b two coefficients which mainly depend on the slope. The results confirm the validity of the widely used power law assumption for Q(S). Similar relations can be obtained by performing a standard recession curve analysis. Although simplified, the results obtained in the present work may serve as a preliminary tool for assessing the storage-discharge relation in hillslopes. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB At different time scales, the potential factors influencing changes in sediment transport vary. Because the processes of each impact factor overlaps on different time scales, it is challenging to evaluate the complex multiscale relationships between monthly sediment load and its potential impact factors. The objective of this study was to investigate the scale-specific main factors influencing monthly sediment loads using the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) method. Monthly sediment loads and five potential influencing factors (runoff, precipitation, air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and enhanced vegetation index) during 2003-2017 were collected in the Wujiang karst watershed of southwest China. The MEMD method was used to decompose the temporal series of monthly sediment load into seven intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and residuals using a Hilbert transform. The sum of variance contribution rates of IMF1 (3.2 months), IMF2 (5.5 months) and IMF3 (12.1 months) was more than 90%. Although temperature and potential evapotranspiration significantly affect monthly sediment loads at the observation scale, no significant relationships were observed between them at some specific scales after MEMD. The accuracy of the prediction model after MEMD was better than that of the prediction model using original data. Runoff and precipitation were important predictors in the prediction model. This study shows the advantages of the MEMD method for analyzing non-stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes, and this useful tool is recommended for application in other karst watersheds.

AB Interpreting the links between transient in-channel fine sediment storage and the dynamics of suspended sediment transport during flood events helps the understanding of river geomorphology, and also the impacts of fine sediment on water quality and bed habitats of rivers and downstream receiving environments. We present a unique physically based model of suspended sediment transport which is intimately coupled with fine sediment deposition and re-entrainment processes within the gravel bed. This multi-size fraction theory provides unique information about the effect of fine sediment size classes due to their dynamics and associated river bed changes in net deposition. The data from a series of flood events from the Oreti River, located in Southland, New Zealand were used to test the ability of this theory to provide a description of the dynamics of the fine sediment size distribution, their concentration, load, and rate of river bed deposition and re-entrainment. After calibration of the model using the data from one flood event, the model provides good agreement between observed and modeled fine sediment concentration and event load for seven subsequent test events. One of the main applications of this theory in future is for routing suspended sediment concentration and changes on fine sediment deposition down a river network.

TI Quantile regression for investigating scaling of extreme precipitation
   with temperature
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE extreme precipitation; climate change; quantile regression
ID INCREASE
AB The consensus in the scientific community is that the intensity of extreme precipitation will increase in a warmer climate. However, as there is limited observational evidence to this effect, there is a growing body of research which focuses on directly investigating the relationship between temperature and precipitation. This is currently performed by binning precipitation data in temperature bins and then investigating the trend in the precipitation percentiles in each bin with temperature. In this paper, we highlight limitations in the binning approach and present quantile regression as an alternative to the above process. Quantile regression allows estimation of this scaling directly and, unlike binning, is unbiased with sample size. Moreover, quantile regression presents a natural framework for investigation into other factors (covariates) that may be affecting the nature of the scaling relationship. Results using subdaily rainfall data for Australia show the efficacy of the proposed quantile regression method, as well as the presence of season indicators as significant covariates that affect the scaling relationship of precipitation with temperature.

AB The dynamic control operation of reservoir flood limited water level (FLWL) can solve the contradictions between reservoir flood control and beneficial operation well, and it is an important measure to make sure the security of flood control and realize the flood utilization. The dynamic control bound of FLWL is a fundamental key element for implementing reservoir dynamic control operation. In order to optimize the dynamic control bound of FLWL by considering flood forecasting error, this paper took the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable, and described it with the emerging credibility theory in recent years. By combining the flood forecasting error quantitative model, a credibility-based fuzzy chance constrained model used to optimize the dynamic control bound was proposed in this paper, and fuzzy simulation technology was used to solve the model. The FENGTAN reservoir in China was selected as a case study, and the results show that, compared with the original operation water level, the initial operation water level (IOWL) of FENGTAN reservoir can be raised 4 m, 2 m and 5.5 m respectively in the three division stages of flood season, and without increasing flood control risk. In addition, the rationality and feasibility of the proposed forecasting error quantitative model and credibility-based dynamic control bound optimization model are verified by the calculation results of extreme risk theory.

TI HORTON LAWS AND THE FRACTAL NATURE OF STREAMS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DRAINAGE AREA RELATIONSHIP; MAINSTREAM LENGTH; CHANNEL NETWORKS;
   CATCHMENT-AREA; RIVER NETWORKS; DIMENSION
AB Stream networks and catchment basins are characterized by numerous fractal dimensions, the traditional one being the mainstream length as a function of length scale which we denote by d. We consider an ideal Horton system and define fractal dimensions based on (1) the subcatchment length-area relationship, which gives D1 ; (2) the total length of streams as a function of scale, which gives a network similarity dimension D2; (3) the mainstream length-area relationship (D3), and (4) the total area of streams as a function of areal scale (D4). These fractal dimensions are related to the values of the bifurcation ratio, the stream length ratio, and the stream area ratio. Their value should be indirectly estimated from these Horton parameters. An improved understanding of the relationships between the fractal dimension and Horton's laws is obtained by defining an eigenarea of a stream of a particular Horton order. This is the area of the drainage basin which is not drained by streams of immediately lower order. The variation of eigenareas with scale controls the value of D1 , which equals D3 for hydrologically realistic systems. In such cases D4 = 2. This paper assumes that river systems are Hortonian in nature and that measured departures from Hortonianity are due to statistical variability. Estimates of the Horton parameters and of the fractal dimensions are therefore subject to uncertainty. Two sources of statistical variability are considered herein: The first source of statistical variability is due to the fluctuations in stream numbers, stream lengths, and stream areas. These fluctuations affect the values of the Horton parameters, which are traditionally estimated using a graphical technique. We show that an analytical technique (which corresponds to a constrained graphical technique) is preferable. The second source of variability that we consider arises from the fact that estimates of Horton's parameters and fractal dimensions are always made on truncated systems because the particular scales of measurement determine the order of the catchment. In a Horton system it is straightforward to estimate D1, which is defined exactly at all scales. Direct attempts to estimate D2 and D3 (as opposed to indirect attempts via the Horton parameters) are difficult because their true value is approached asymptotically in the limit of infinite-order catchments.

AB We report direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of hyporheic exchange for a flat river bed with two different particle roughness textures, at a surface flow friction Reynolds number of 395 and a bed permeability Reynolds number of 2.6. Transit time distributions (TTDs), subsurface flow patterns, and the interfacial volumetric fluxes are discussed. The transit time was quantified using a forward particle tracking method based on pure advection by three-dimensional, pore-resolved, time-mean velocities. Results show that bed roughness induces deep subsurface flow paths that yield a TTD with a power-law tail. Roughness obstructs the surface flow, creating interfacial pressure variations which induce subsurface flow. Next, the molecular diffusion is accounted for based on a random walk method and is shown to increase transit times regardless of roughness texture. This work demonstrates that particle roughness on a macroscopically flat sediment bed can induce significant hyporheic exchange that is fundamentally similar to that induced by bedforms.

AB We derive probability density functions for advective transport of a solute that undergoes a heterogeneous chemical reaction involving an aqueous solution reacting with a solid phase. This enables us to quantify uncertainty associated with spatially varying reaction rate constants for both linear and nonlinear kinetic rate laws. While many standard techniques for uncertainty quantification in groundwater hydrology yield only concentration's mean and variance, the proposed approach leads to its full probabilistic description. This allows one to compute so-called rare events (distribution tails), which are required in modern probabilistic risk analyses. We also compute an effective (apparent and upscaled) kinetic rate constant, a parameter that enters transport equations governing the spatiotemporal evolution of mean concentration. We demonstrate that the effective kinetic rate of nonlinear reactions is time-dependent. This behavior provides a possible explanation for the observed discrepancy between laboratory-measured rate constants on uniform grain sizes and measurements in natural systems where the grain size distributions are heterogeneous.

AB Several satellite-based snow products are assimilated, both separately and jointly, into the Noah land surface model for improving snow prediction in Alaska. These include the standard and interpreted versions of snow cover fraction (SCF) data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the snow depth (SD) estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The satellite-based SD estimates are adjusted against in situ observations via statistical interpolation to reduce the potentially large biases, prior to being assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter. A customized, rule-based direct insertion approach is developed to assimilate the two SCF datasets. Our results indicate that considerable overall improvement on snow prediction can be achieved via assimilating the bias-adjusted satellite SD estimates; however, the improvement does not always translate into improvements in streamflow prediction. Assimilating the standard MODIS SCF is found to have little impact on snow and streamflow predictions, while assimilating the interpreted SCF estimates, which have reduced cloud coverage and improved snow mapping accuracy, has resulted in the most consistent improvements on snow and streamflow predictions across the study domain.

AB Rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas easily triggers flashy floods. Urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation. This study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi-objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in Taipei City. The Yu-Cheng pumping station constitutes the study case, and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon/storm events are adopted for model construction and validation. Three objective functions are designed to minimize: (1) the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond (FSP); (2) the sum of peak FSP water levels; and (3) the mean absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along operation sequence. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm H (NSGA-II) is applied to searching the Pareto-optimal solutions that optimize the trade-off between the objectives. We next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two-tier sorting process based on a compromised Pareto-optimal solution. The comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives, with improvement rates reaching 43% (OBJ1), 3% (OBJ2) and 71% (OBJ3), respectively. We demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation.

AB The original paradigm of urban hydrology identified links between urbanization and changes in hydrologic processes. One of the prominent relationships identified was increased impervious surface coverage decreased subsurface recharge and subsequently low flows. This does not consider watershed-specific biophysical or anthropogenic characteristics that could increase low flows, such as direct discharge from wastewater treatment plants and indirect recharge to groundwater from leaking pipes and infiltration-based green infrastructure. Here, in an effort to sharpen this original paradigm, we take a statistical approach to evaluate relationships between natural and human-impacted watershed characteristics and a suite of low flow metrics that describe mean annual low flow magnitudes and interannual variability in 54 watersheds over 15 years in the Piedmont physiographic region of the southeastern United States. We find that annual low flow magnitudes are most strongly correlated to biophysical watershed factors, including positive relationships with topography and precipitation and negative relationships with poorly drained soils. In contrast, interannual variability is positively correlated to land use characteristics, including forest, and negatively related to urbanization. Similarities in best fit models across long-term average, wet, and dry years indicate a robustness of hydrologic drivers across watershed wetness conditions. Our results also showcase that while the original paradigm of urban hydrology may hold across traditional low flow metrics, such as baseflow index, extreme low flow drivers are complex and counterintuitive. Understanding these first-order controls on baseflow magnitude and variability across an urbanization gradient is needed to conceptualize the impacts that continued, rapid urbanization will have on low flow dynamics.

AB One major challenge in modeling groundwater flow within heterogeneous geological media is that of modeling arbitrarily oriented or intersected boundaries and inner material interfaces. The Numerical Manifold Method (NMM) has recently emerged as a promising method for such modeling, in its ability to handle boundaries, its flexibility in constructing physical cover functions (continuous or with gradient jump), its meshing efficiency with a fixed mathematical mesh (covers), its convenience for enhancing approximation precision, and its integration precision, achieved by simplex integration. In this paper, we report on developing and comparing two new approaches for boundary constraints using the NMM, namely a continuous approach with jump functions and a discontinuous approach with Lagrange multipliers. In the discontinuous Lagrange multiplier method (LMM), the material interfaces are regarded as discontinuities which divide mathematical covers into different physical covers. We define and derive stringent forms of Lagrange multipliers to link the divided physical covers, thus satisfying the continuity requirement of the refraction law. In the continuous Jump Function Method (JFM), the material interfaces are regarded as inner interfaces contained within physical covers. We briefly define jump terms to represent the discontinuity of the head gradient across an interface to satisfy the refraction law. We then make a theoretical comparison between the two approaches in terms of global degrees of freedom, treatment of multiple material interfaces, treatment of small area, treatment of moving interfaces, the feasibility of coupling with mechanical analysis and applicability to other numerical methods. The newly derived boundary-constraint approaches are coded into a NMM model for groundwater flow analysis, and tested for precision and efficiency on different simulation examples. We first test the LMM for a Dirichlet boundary and then test both LMM and JFM for an idealized heterogeneous model, comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions. Then we test both approaches for a heterogeneous model and compare the results of hydraulic head and specific discharge. We show that both approaches are suitable for modeling material boundaries, considering high accuracy for the boundary constraints, the capability to deal with arbitrarily oriented or complexly intersected boundaries, and their efficiency using a fixed mathematical mesh.

AB A mathematical model is presented for colloid transport and retention in saturated porous media under unfavorable attachment conditions. The model accounts for colloid transport in the bulk aqueous phase and adjacent to the solid surface, and rates of colloid collision, interaction, release, and immobilization on the solid phase. Model parameters were estimated using (1) filtration theory; (2) calculated interaction energies in conjunction with the Maxwellian kinetic energy model of diffusion; (3) information about the velocity magnitude and distribution adjacent to the solid phase that was obtained from pore scale water flow simulations; (4) colloid and collector sizes; (5) the balance of applied hydrodynamic and resisting adhesive torques; and (6) time dependent filling of retention locations using a Langmuirian approach. The presented theory constrains the model parameters and output to physically realistic values in many instances, and minimizes the need for parameter optimization. Example simulations demonstrate that our modeling formulation is qualitatively consistent with observed trends for retention with colloid size and concentration, grain size, and velocity for many systems. The model provides a clear conceptual explanation for the causes of hyperexponential, exponential, uniform, and nonmonotonic retention profiles without invoking hypotheses with regard to colloid heterogeneity, aggregation, or multiple deposition rates. Furthermore, the model formulation and research presented herein helps to identify areas where additional research and theory development are still needed.

AB For overbank flows, submerged flexible vegetation on floodplains increases channel resistance and decreases channel conveyance capability. This study presents an analytical model for estimating the stage-discharge relationship in a meandering compound channel with dense, submerged, flexible vegetation on floodplains under high flow conditions. The mean velocity within a canopy was linked to the depth-averaged velocity, and a relationship between the two velocities was proposed. The governing equation was deduced in curvilinear coordinates, and the lateral shear stresses were found to be negligible, as validated by our experimental measurements in a large-scale meandering channel. Then, analytical solutions of subarea discharges and total discharge were derived by ignoring lateral shear stresses. Measurements from two flume experiments and one field study were used to verify the proposed model. The field case involved a natural river with both submerged and emergent grass on the floodplains. Good agreement between predictions and measurements indicated that the model accurately predicted subarea discharges and the stage-discharge relationships in a meandering compound channel with submerged vegetation. Finally, the predictions of this model were sensitive to the secondary flow parameters in the main channel but insensitive to those on the floodplains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an analysis of the forest hydrology and plant water status interaction, focusing on the relationship between the hydrological water balance at the catchment level and the predawn leaf water potential of the species Quercus ilex (holm oak). The catchment water balance approach was applied to a Mediterranean watershed forested with holm oak to evaluate the daily soil water reserve at the catchment level. After this, evapotranspiration and soil water content were combined to estimate the potential soil water reserve and evaluate plant water status at the catchment level. A close relationship was detected between Leaf water potential and the soil water reserve, and was fitted to a negative exponential curve to estimate predawn leaf water potential from a hydrological database. The proposed equation can help to predict the frequency, intensity, and length of droughts potentially capable of causing structural damage to the forest, from the hydrological time series records.

AB Recent recognition of the widespread occurrence of freshwater beneath the ocean has renewed interest in approaches to understand and predict its extent. The most straightforward methodologies are based on the sharp-interface approximation, which neglects dispersive mechanisms. The understanding of dispersion effects on freshwater extents in coastal aquifers is based almost entirely on onshore aquifer situations. This study explores dispersion in offshore coastal aquifers, in terms of the steady-state freshwater extent, seawater circulation and freshwater discharge, through numerical experimentation. Results show that increasing dispersion causes a seaward shift in the interface toe location, as expected, whereas the interface tip shows a non-monotonic relationship with dispersion that depends on the contrast between aquifer and aquitard hydraulic conductivities. Higher dispersion leads to enhanced seawater recirculation rates and freshwater discharge, as opposed to non-monotonic relationships obtained previously for onshore aquifers. The mixing zone at the toe widens as dispersion increases, similar to onshore cases, whereas the mixing zone at the tip has a surprisingly non-monotonic relationship with dispersion. The dispersion relationships revealed in this study can be explained by counteractions between dispersion, density and advective forces, and refraction across the aquifer-aquitard interface, which in combination produce offshore aquifer behaviour that differs, in some ways, to the manner in which onshore aquifers respond to dispersive processes. Consequently, previous empirical corrections to sharp-interface methods (to account for dispersive effects) applied to onshore coastal aquifers are ineffective in their application to offshore settings.

AB Nanoparticle deposition behavior observed at the Darcy scale represents an average of the processes occurring at the pore scale. Hence, the effect of various pore-scale parameters on nanoparticle deposition can be understood by studying nanoparticle transport at pore scale and upscaling the results to the Darcy scale. In this work, correlation equations for the deposition rate coefficients of nanoparticles in a cylindrical pore are developed as a function of nine pore-scale parameters: the pore radius, nanoparticle radius, mean flow velocity, solution ionic strength, viscosity, temperature, solution dielectric constant, and nanoparticle and collector surface potentials. Based on dominant processes, the pore space is divided into three different regions, namely, bulk, diffusion, and potential regions. Advection-diffusion equations for nanoparticle transport are prescribed for the bulk and diffusion regions, while the interaction between the diffusion and potential regions is included as a boundary condition. This interaction is modeled as a first-order reversible kinetic adsorption. The expressions for the mass transfer rate coefficients between the diffusion and the potential regions are derived in terms of the interaction energy profile. Among other effects, we account for nanoparticle-collector interaction forces on nanoparticle deposition. The resulting equations are solved numerically for a range of values of pore-scale parameters. The nanoparticle concentration profile obtained for the cylindrical pore is averaged over a moving averaging volume within the pore in order to get the 1-D concentration field. The latter is fitted to the 1-D advection-dispersion equation with an equilibrium or kinetic adsorption model to determine the values of the average deposition rate coefficients. In this study, pore-scale simulations are performed for three values of Peclet number, Pe = 0.05, 5, and 50. We find that under unfavorable conditions, the nanoparticle deposition at pore scale is best described by an equilibrium model at low Peclet numbers (Pe = 0.05) and by a kinetic model at high Peclet numbers (Pe = 50). But, at an intermediate Pe (e.g., near Pe = 5), both equilibrium and kinetic models fit the 1-D concentration field. Correlation equations for the pore-averaged nanoparticle deposition rate coefficients under unfavorable conditions are derived by performing a multiple-linear regression analysis between the estimated deposition rate coefficients for a single pore and various pore-scale parameters. The correlation equations, which follow a power law relation with nine pore-scale parameters, are found to be consistent with the column-scale and pore-scale experimental results, and qualitatively agree with the colloid filtration theory. These equations can be incorporated into pore network models to study the effect of pore-scale parameters on nanoparticle deposition at larger length scales such as Darcy scale.

AB Three distinct definitions of "equivalent aperture'' have been used in the literature to describe variable-aperture fractures; however, significant inconsistencies exist in the literature as to which "equivalent aperture'' is appropriate for simulating solute transport. In this work, a systematic series of hydraulic and tracer tests was conducted on three laboratory-scale fracture replicas, and the cubic law, mass balance, and frictional loss apertures were calculated. The analytical solution of the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation was fit to the experimental breakthrough curves. Additionally, one of the experimental aperture fields was measured directly using a light transmission technique. The results clearly demonstrate that the mass balance aperture is the only appropriate "equivalent aperture'' for describing solute transport in a single variable aperture fracture and that the mass balance aperture is an excellent approximation of the arithmetic mean aperture. Previously, these conclusions have been reached based only on theoretical and numerical analyses.

AB An underwater landslide is a complex multiphase flow phenomenon with potential to cause large waves and destruction. Particle size is an important parameter that affects flow behaviors of multiphase flows. This numerical study examines underwater granular landslides on an inclined plane and their resultant waves with the purpose of exploring how the particle size affects landslide kinematics and wave amplitudes. A rheology-based multi-phase flow model is employed, newly incorporating the Navier-slip condition. Smooth and rough beds that reflect ideal and practical conditions, respectively, are simulated. Five types of particle are used; they are very fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, granules, and pebbles. The granular masses are initially in the loose-packing condition. Our numerical results demonstrate that a smooth bed results in the faster landslides and the larger impulsive waves than a rough bed. The effects of particle size differ between the two bed conditions. For the rough bed, the relationship between the landslide speed and the particle size is negative, and so is the relationship between the wave amplitude and the particle size. For the smooth bed, the two relationships become concave and non-monotonic.

Sensitivity Analysis (SA) provides an essential means for understanding the role and importance of these factors in producing model responses. However, conventional approaches to SA suffer from (1) an ambiguous characterization of sensitivity, and (2) poor computational efficiency, particularly as the problem dimension grows. Here, we present a new and general sensitivity analysis framework (called VARS), based on an analogy to "variogram analysis,'' that provides an intuitive and comprehensive characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their extensions are special cases of VARS, and that their SA indices can be computed as by-products of the VARS framework. Synthetic functions that resemble actual model response surfaces are used to illustrate the concepts, and show VARS to be as much as two orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art Sobol approach. In a companion paper, we propose a practical implementation strategy, and demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability (robustness) of the VARS framework on real-data case studies.

AB An approach for modeling daily flows during flood events using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is presented. The rainfall-runoff process is modeled by coupling a simple linear (black box) model with the ANN. The study uses data from two large size catchments in India and five other catchments used earlier by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for inter-comparison of the operational hydrological models. The study demonstrates that the approach adopted herein for modeling produces reasonably satisfactory results for data of catchments from different geographical locations, which thus proves its versatility. Most importantly, the substitution of the previous days runoff (being used as one of the input to the ANN by most of the previous researchers), by a term that represents the runoff estimated from a linear model and coupling the simple linear model with the ANN may prove to be very much useful in modeling the rainfall-runoff relationship in the non-updating mode.

AB The normal stress-dependent hydraulic properties of single fractures are fundamental in hydro-mechanical coupling for the fractured reservoirs. With increasing normal stress, fluid flow through single fractures de-creases dramatically in the low stress range and then gradually in the high stress range, respectively. In order to describe this heterogeneous hydro-mechanical behavior, analytical relationships between normal stress and fluid flow for single fractures are established based on the two-part Hooke's model (TPHM), in which the fracture aperture is conceptualized into two parts at a macro scale, hard part and soft part. The contributions of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties are separately evaluated by the different mechanical properties with normal stress. The validity of the proposed relationships between normal stress and fluid flow is verified by the good agreements between experimental data and theoretical predictions for natural and induced tensile fractures. The significant reductions of permeability and flow rate at low stress are dominated by the soft part and the degree of their nonlinearity highly depends on the spatial correlation of fracture geometry. In addition, the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop between loading cycles are also greatly affected by the soft part while the fracture modulus of the hard part exhibits a weak dependence on loading cycle. The proposed relationships can be used to evaluate the coupled hydro-mechanical processes in fractured rock en-gineering such as geothermal energy development, CO2 geologic sequestration and stability of fractured rock slope.

AB Time-variable transit time distributions (TTDs) have been utilized as a tool to understand how catchments transmit water. However, most of the existing TTD estimation methods require to impose certain structures on those TTDs a priori, which could lead to misinterpreting data. We present a data-based method to estimate time-variable TTDs without imposing their structure a priori. The core of the method is the use of a revised flow-weighted time, where TTDs do not reflect variable external forcings directly. The functional forms of the TTDs are much simpler in flow-weighted time, compared to those in calendar time, and this allows for easier estimation of TTDs. Dynamic (state-dependent) multiple linear regression methods were applied to estimate the time-variable TTDs in flow-weighted time, which can eventually be transformed back to calendar time. The method performs well in a proof-of-concept demonstration with synthetic data sets. We also discuss potential generalizations of the proposed method.

AB The spatio-temporal scaling relationship for individual channels in braided streams is shown to be identical to the spatio-temporal scaling associated with constant Froude number, e.g. F-r = 1. A means to derive this relationship is developed from a new theory of sediment transport. The mechanism by which the F-r = 1 condition apparently governs the scaling seems to derive from the sensitivity of sediment transport to flow fluctuations when F-r = 1. The condition F-r = 1 is also given a theoretical basis using arguments from surface roughness. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The turning point in the classic environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) fails to identify the pollution risk transfer effect. Based on the interactions of environmental regulations among local governments, this paper decomposes the relationship between sewage emissions and the economic growth depicted by the pollution risk transfer effect and proposes a spatial hyperbolic model to illustrate this relationship in local and other regions. The results show that the relationship between industrial sewage emissions and economic growth presents an inverted U-shaped curve in the local region and a U-shaped curve in other regions. The turning point of the inverted U-shaped curve in the hyperbola lags behind that in the EKC, indicating that the turning point in the EKC is influenced by the pollution risk transfer effect. The turning point of the inverted U-shaped curve lags behind that of the U-shaped curve in the hyperbola, indicating that pollution transfer behavior has become the main choice under environmental regulation. Based on this conclusion, this paper suggests that the central government should optimize the assessment standards of local government achievements and should encourage enterprises to engage in technological innovation using market incentive environmental regulation.

   MODELS; SUPPORT; STRATEGIES; PREDICTION; REGRESSION
AB Groundwater management and allocation planning involves a rigorous assessment of the performance of operational decisions such as extraction/injection rates on community and environmental objectives. Maximizing performance through numerical optimization can be essential for high-value resources and is often computationally infeasible due to long simulation model run times combined with nonconvex objectives and constraints. In order to mitigate these drawbacks, surrogate models can be used in place of complex models during the optimization process. There exist a number of machine learning techniques that can be used to develop a data-driven surrogate model. However, the curse of dimensionality, common to groundwater management, limits the use of these techniques due to the necessity for large training data sets. Even though it is now possible to handle large data sets, the generation of these data sets themselves remains computationally prohibitive as they require numerous simulations to produce accurate surrogates. In this study, we integrate a dimensionality reduction method using truncated singular value decomposition to reduce the number of decision variables, thereby reducing the size of the training data set needed. Correspondingly, we demonstrate a simple technique for acquiring an approximate minimax Latin Hypercube design from within the subspace. We also implement a novel technique for adaptive resampling through particle swarm optimization in order to maintain accuracy of the surrogate model throughout the optimization process. The resulting accurate surrogate model for the Perth regional aquifer system of Western Australia runs in a matter of seconds. Adopting this approach can produce timely solutions, making formal optimization tractable for practitioners.

AB Diamond Lake in Minnesota is covered every winter with ice and snow providing a modified thermal insulation between water and air. Autonomous temperature sensors, data loggers, were placed in this lake so that hourly measurements could be obtained from the snow-covered ice and water. The sensors that became frozen measured damped and delayed thermal response from the air-temperature fluctuation. Those sensors that were deeper within the snow-covered ice measured continuous, almost constant, temperature values near freezing. Several of them were within the liquid water and responded with a fluctuation of 24 h periods of amplitudes up to 0.2 degrees C. Our analysis of the vertical temperature profiles suggested that the source of periodic water heating comes from the lake bottom. Because of the absence of daily temperature variations of the snow-covered ice, the influence of the air-temperature fluctuation can be ruled out. We attribute the heating process to the periodic inflow of groundwater to the lake and the cooling to the heat diffusion to the overlying ice cover. The periodic groundwater inflow is interpreted due to solid Earth tides, which cause periodic fluctuations of the groundwater pressure head.

AB [1] Erosion and sediment transport in a temperate forested watershed are predicted with a new sediment model that represents the main sources of sediment generation in forested environments ( mass wasting, hillslope erosion, and road surface erosion) within the distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) environment. The model produces slope failures on the basis of a factor-of-safety analysis with the infinite slope model through use of stochastically generated soil and vegetation parameters. Failed material is routed downslope with a rule-based scheme that determines sediment delivery to streams. Sediment from hillslopes and road surfaces is also transported to the channel network. A simple channel routing scheme is implemented to predict basin sediment yield. We demonstrate through an initial application of this model to the Rainy Creek catchment, a tributary of the Wenatchee River, which drains the east slopes of the Cascade Mountains, that the model produces plausible sediment yield and ratios of landsliding and surface erosion when compared to published rates for similar catchments in the Pacific Northwest. A road removal scenario and a basin-wide fire scenario are both evaluated with the model.

AB Models of energy and mass exchange between vegetation canopies and the atmosphere usually include some formulation of the bulk boundary layer resistance (Rb or the related parameter kB(-1)) to describe the effects of molecular diffusion occurring near the leaf and soil surfaces. Present formulations of kB(-1) are either empirical expressions or are physically based models derived from a K-theory approach. However, K-theory does not describe the observed counter gradient how within canopies and the empirical expressions usually lump both canopy and soil effects into a single surface resistance (single source approach). For areas of partial canopy cover, single source formulations have been difficult to formulate with any certainty and often do not agree with observations. This study uses 'localized near-field' (LNF) Lagrangian theory to develop a model of kB(-1) (for heat transfer) for the vegetation component of a dual source model and for the combined effects of canopy and soil in a single source approach. The present model also uses a physically based, one-dimensional, analytical model to describe the influence of canopy structure and density upon the within-canopy far field diffusivity and Lagrangian time scale which are central to the LNF Lagrangian theory. The canopy turbulence model is designed for arbitrary foliage structure and density and kB(-1) is defined in terms of heat and momentum fluxes rather than the more conventional logarithm of the ratio of the momentum and thermal roughness lengths. The resulting kB(-1) model is used for sensitivity studies of kB(-1) for canopies only (i.e. no soil contribution) and for the coupled canopy-soil system (i.e. a single source model). Results indicate that foliage density (Drag Area Index or Leaf Area Index), wind speed, leaf size, possible sheltering effects, and, to a lesser extent, the vertical foliage distribution and the vertical variation of the temperature difference between the foliage and the near-leaf air space can influence kB(-1). For the single source model the soil boundary layer resistance was found to be significant for areas of partial canopy cover. In spite of the relative complexity of the full LNF model of kB(-1), a simple expression that varies smoothly between bare soil and full canopy cover is developed that captures much of the modeled and observed variation in kB(-1) for the single source approach.

ID ENTRAINMENT; PROPAGATION; SEDIMENT; BOTTOM; FLUID
AB Quasi-steady gravity currents propagating first on a horizontal and then up a sloping boundary are investigated by means of theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments. The bottom slope ranged from 0.18 to 1 and full- and partial-depth configurations were considered. The developed theoretical model, using the depth averaged momentum equation, provides new physical insight into the importance of the different forces that act on the current and accounts for the gravity component along the slope, whose effect increases with both the slope angle and the ratio of current to ambient fluid depths. The height of the current decreases linearly with up-slope distance and the spatial rate of decrease, expressed by the current shape parameter is determined from the theory, using the measured up slope distance at which the current stops. This current shape parameter is found to depend on the slope only and it is not dependent on the current to ambient fluid depths. It can then be used to calculate the current velocity and the up-slope distance reached by the current. It is shown that the front velocity of all performed experiments is predicted by the theory indicating that the theory remains valid up to a slope equal to 1.

AB In this work, we derive a Darcy-scale model for solute transport in porous media colonized by biofilms. Biofilms refer to structured communities of microbial cells that grow attached to an aqueous interface, e.g., the pore walls of a water-saturated porous medium. First, we present the pore-scale description of mass transport within and between the phases (water phase and biofilm phase) including the biologically-mediated reactions. Then, a two-equation Darcy-scale mass balance model (classically referred to as dual-porosity model), suitable both for local equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, is obtained from the method of volume averaging. Application of this macroscopic model to complex pore geometry of a two-dimensional porous medium supporting biofilms is presented. Comparisons with direct numerical simulation results confirm the large range of validity of the model. Finally, an illustrative example based on a scenario of reactive transport experimental tests is used to point out conditions for when the use of the proposed model is required.

AB Microbial surface water contamination can disrupt critical ecosystem services such as recreation and drinking water supply. Prediction of water contamination and assessment of sustainability of water resources in the context of water quality are needed but are difficult to achieve - with challenges arising from the complexity of environmental systems, and stochastic variability of processes that drive contaminant fate and transport. In this paper we use reliability theory as a framework to address these issues. We define failure as exceedance of regulatory water contamination limits, and system components as reaches in the surface water network. We then methodically study the reliability of each component in the context of water quality, as well as the impact of individual components on overall water quality and sustainability. We obtain spatially distributed probability- and physics-based sustainability measures of reliability, vulnerability, resilience and the sustainability index. Finally, we use GIS as a platform to present these measures as geospatial products in an effort to foster public acceptance of probability-based methods in contaminant hydrology.

AB A simple mathematical theory is proposed for the analysis of the free convection motion around a horizontal line source of thermal energy in a sparsely packed porous medium assuming the validity of the Brinkman model. The theory consists of retaining only the leading terms of the series expansions of the dependent variables in terms of the Rayleigh number and is valid in the limit of small Rayleigh number only. The heat generating rate is assumed to be not excessive. The evolution of the flow held is demonstrated by drawing the streamlines at various times. The results are delineated by comparing them with those of the Darcy flow model.

AB The selection of the correct model for describing contaminant transport in fractured media remains a challenging problem in subsurface hydrology. In this work, the experimental data corresponding to nonsorbing tracer runs in natural fissures of Moreno et al. (1985) are analyzed. The advection dispersion equation (ADE) model yields a poor fit in the late time regions of the experimental breakthrough curves denoting the existence of "nomalous" or "on-Fickian" transport. Continuous time random walks (CTRW) are proposed for describing this kind of transport using two of the most studied forms for the transition rate probability: the asymptotic and truncated power law models. The CTRW approach produces better fits to the experimental data than the ADE model. In all the simulations a moderately dispersive transport was found which is interpreted as being as a result of the effects of the small- and intermediate-scale heterogeneities.

AB The contribution of groundwater to streams is controlled by temporally and spatially variable groundwater flow paths with distinctive travel times. The aggregated average travel time distribution (TTD) of all these flow paths functions as a catchment characteristic. Currently, research on TTDs is expanding towards dynamic TTDs and building on this, we present dynamic backward TTDs and residence time distributions using forward particle tracking on a high-resolution spatially distributed groundwater flow model (25*25 m). We show that the dynamic backward TTDs of three Dutch catchments are determined by the interplay between the activation of shallow short flow paths and the intensification of fluxes through all flow paths when groundwater levels rise. In addition, the preference for young water in our lowland catchments appears strongly controlled by drainage density. Variations in catchment mixing with time and between catchments were analyzed using dynamic StorAge Selection (SAS) functions. This showed the effect of differences in geology and topography on the shape of the SAS functions. Additionally, the variability of SAS functions in time was shown to depend on the extent to which new flow paths can be activated. Time-varying SAS functions are required for computation of dynamic TTDs, and this research showed realistic values for the variability in the SAS functions of lowland catchments. The step towards dynamic TTDs is crucial for understanding the temporal and spatial behavior of streams, their chemical composition, and their ecological value.

AB Knowledge of spatial mean soil moisture and its variability over time is needed in many environmental applications. We analyzed dependencies of soil moisture variability on average soil moisture contents in soils with and without root water uptake using ensembles of non-stationary water flow simulations by varying soil hydraulic properties under different climatic conditions. We focused on the dry end of the soil moisture range and found that the magnitude of soil moisture variability was controlled by the interplay of soil hydraulic properties and climate. The average moisture at which the maximum variability occurred depended on soil hydraulic properties and vegetation. A positive linear relationship was observed between mean soil moisture and its standard deviation and was controlled by the parameter defining the shape of soil water retention curves and the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity. The influence of other controls, such as variable weather patterns, topography or lateral flow processes needs to be studied further to see if such relationship persists and could be used for the inference of soil hydraulic properties from the spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture.

AB We investigate experimentally the functional relationship between capillary pressure, Pc, wetting phase saturation, S-w, and interfacial area per volume between the wetting and nonwetting phases, awn, for drainage and imbibition processes in micromodels of two-dimensional pore structures. Within the experimental and analysis error (around 10-15%), the resulting P-c-S-w-a(wn) surfaces were the same. This suggests that data obtained from either the drainage process or the imbibition process are sufficient to generate the complete functional relationship among P-c-S-w-a(wn) and that the observed hysteresis in P-c-S-w-a(wn) can be modeled by including interfacial area as an additional state variable.

AB We use the Budyko framework to calculate catchment-scale evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) as a function of two climatic factors, precipitation (P) and evaporative demand (E-o = 0.75 times the pan evaporation rate), and a third parameter that encodes the catchment properties (n) and modifies how P is partitioned between E and Q. This simple theory accurately predicted the long-term evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) for the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeast Australia. We extend the theory by developing a simple and novel analytical expression for the effects on E and Q of small perturbations in P, E-o, and n. The theory predicts that a 10% change in P, with all else constant, would result in a 26% change in Q in the MDB. Future climate scenarios (2070-2099) derived using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 climate model output highlight the diversity of projections for P (+/- 30%) with a correspondingly large range in projections for Q (+/- 80%) in the MDB. We conclude with a qualitative description about the impact of changes in catchment properties on water availability and focus on the interaction between vegetation change, increasing atmospheric [CO2], and fire frequency. We conclude that the modern version of the Budyko framework is a useful tool for making simple and transparent estimates of changes in water availability.

AB Topographic depressions have large impacts on the hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry in prairie environments. Topographic depressions control the hydrological flow regime through their role in storing water from precipitation and snow melt, and the storage dynamics of topographic depressions affect the retention, transformations, and transport of sediment, carbon, and nutrients. The water stored in topographic depressions supports a diversity of animal and plant species. More generally, depressional wetlands are an integral component of global water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. In this technical note, we present simple models to simulate hysteretic relationships between storage and contributing area. We consider both spatially distributed and spatially integrated models. The spatially distributed models (the ensemble-depression model) explicitly simulate storage dynamics for a distribution of discrete depressions. In these spatially distributed models, the large-scale storage-contributing fraction relationships are an emergent property of the modeled system. The spatially integrated models (the meta-depression model) parameterize the large-scale storage-discharge relationships. The spatially integrated models are formulated in a way to represent hysteretic behavior. We present a suite of numerical experiments and demonstrate that the ensemble-depression and meta-depression models have similar large-scale behavior. The simple hysteretic models defined here are formulated in a way so that they can easily be incorporated in conventional hydrological models.

AB It has been previously shown that the normalized concentration of a radioactively decaying tracer defines one point on the Laplace transformed age distribution and that point corresponds to the decay rate of the tracer. However, it is unclear how two time domain quantities, the decay rate and normalized concentration, are related to the elements of a Laplace transformed distribution; this note clarifies these relationships mechanistically. It is shown that the Laplace transformed age distribution is equivalent to the late-time concentration of a radiometric tracer if transport and age are both at steady state. The result is general and may be applied to any age distribution, including non-Fickian distributions. The significance of the generality is that the steady state concentrations and known decay rates may be used to help constrain the parameters of an unknown age distribution in a wide range of flow systems.

AB Unsteady transit time distribution (TTD) theory is a promising new approach for merging hydrologic and water quality models at the catchment scale. A major obstacle to widespread adoption of the theory, however, has been the specification of the StorAge Selection (SAS) function, which describes how the selection of water for outflow is biased by age. In this paper we hypothesize that some unsteady hydrologic systems of practical interest can be described, to first-order, by a "shifted-uniform" SAS that falls along a continuum between plug flow sampling (for which only the oldest water in storage is sampled for outflow) and uniform sampling (for which water in storage is sampled randomly for outflow). For this choice of SAS function, explicit formulae are derived for the evolving: (a) age distribution of water in storage; (b) age distribution of water in outflow; and (c) breakthrough concentration of a conservative solute under either continuous or impulsive addition. Model predictions conform closely to chloride and deuterium breakthrough curves measured previously in a sloping lysimeter subject to periodic wetting, although refinements of the model are needed to account for the reconfiguration of flow paths at high storage levels (the so-called inverse storage effect). The analytical results derived in this paper should lower the barrier to applying TTD theory in practice, ease the computational demands associated with simulating solute transport through complex hydrologic systems, and provide physical insights that might not be apparent from traditional numerical solutions of the governing equations.

DT Article

AB The annual timing of flood events is a useful indicator to study the interaction between atmospheric and catchment processes in generating floods. This paper presents an assessment of the seasonal timing of floods for 7,894 gauging locations across the globe over a common period from 1981 to 2010. The averaged ordinal date of annual maximum streamflow is then estimated for ungauged locations following a two-stage prediction scheme. The first stage identifies regions that share a common climatic predictor of flood timing by analyzing the similarity of flood timing with seven climate variables. These variables represent precipitation timing and snowmelt dynamics and are derived from a global climate reanalysis data set. Homogeneous regions in terms of the dominant predictor are generalized in the second stage through a rule-based classification. The classification partitions the world into 10 hydroclimate classes, where each class has flood timing predicted using the most relevant climate predictor. Using this relatively simple and interpretable model structure, flood timing could be predicted with a global mean absolute error of approximately 32 days while maintaining consistency across large regions. Potential applications of the developed map include better understanding of climatic drivers of flooding and benchmarking the performance of global hydrological models in simulating the processes relevant to flooding.

AB Hydropower accounts for about 20% of the worldwide electrical power production. In mountainous regions this ratio is significantly higher. In this study we present how future projected climatic forcing, as described in regional climate models (RCMs), will affect water resources and subsequently hydropower production in downstream hydropower plants in a glacierized alpine valley (Vispa valley, Switzerland, 778 km(2)). In order to estimate future runoff generation and hydropower production, we used error-corrected and downscaled climate scenarios from regional climate models (RCMs) as well as glacier retreat projections from a dynamic glacier model and coupled them to a physically based hydrological model. Furthermore, we implemented all relevant hydropower operational rules in the hydrological model to estimate future hydropower production based on the runoff projections. The uncertainty of each modeling component (climate projections, glacier retreat, and hydrological projection) and the resulting propagation of uncertainty to the projected future water availability for energy production were assessed using an analysis of variance. While the uncertainty of the projections is considerable, the consistent trends observed in all projections indicate significant changes to the current situation. The model results indicate that future melt-and rainfall-runoff will increase during spring but decline during summer. The study concludes by outlining the most relevant expected changes for hydropower operations.

AB The challenge of determining mixing extent of solutions undergoing advective-dispersive-diffusive transport is well known. In particular, reaction extent between displacing and displaced solutes depends on mixing at the pore scale, that is, generally smaller than continuum scale quantification that relies on dispersive fluxes. Here a novel mobile-mobile mass transfer approach is developed to distinguish diffusive mixing from dispersive spreading in one-dimensional transport involving small-scale velocity variations with some correlation, such as occurs in hydrodynamic dispersion, in which short-range ballistic transports give rise to dispersed but not mixed segregation zones, termed here ballisticules. When considering transport of a single solution, this approach distinguishes self-diffusive mixing from spreading, and in the case of displacement of one solution by another, each containing a participant reactant of an irreversible bimolecular reaction, this results in time-delayed diffusive mixing of reactants. The approach generates models for both kinetically controlled and equilibrium irreversible reaction cases, while honoring independently measured reaction rates and dispersivities. The mathematical solution for the equilibrium case is a simple analytical expression. The approach is applied to published experimental data on bimolecular reactions for homogeneous porous media under postasymptotic dispersive conditions with good results.
   Plain Language Summary Computer models of the way that chemicals such as contaminants move in pipes, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and in groundwater, are important to science and engineering because this is how we predict water quality. These models also keep track of how the chemicals change due to reactions, and to do so they make big assumptions about how the chemicals mix. Experiments show that the models get the mixing part wrong, and as a result don't do a good job representing which chemicals occur where. This work fixes a part of the mixing error, with a simple fix that works in simple models.

AB The estimation of groundwater released from aquitards is important for the groundwater resource management. In this study, a governing equation of drawdown variation within the aquitard, which undergoes nonlinear consolidation, was obtained based on the consolidation theory of Gibson et al. (1967, ). Then, analytical solutions of drawdown variations within an aquitard were derived for a single aquifer underlying an aquitard, as well as for the case when there are aquifers above and below an aquitard. Drawdown solutions were obtained for both the cases when there was a sudden hydraulic head decline in the confined aquifer(s). The characteristics of the groundwater dynamics and water balance in the aquitard have been analyzed with the analytical solution. A laboratory experiment was conducted to verify the analytical solution, and a type-curve fitting method was presented to calculate the aquitard's hydraulic parameters. Our study revealed that the cumulative water released from the aquitard predicted by Gibson's theory (1967) is less than that obtained through Terzaghi's theory (1943). Groundwater released from the aquitard increases with increasing compression index, aquitard thickness, and drawdown of the adjacent aquifer, and with decreasing initial void ratio and initial effective stress. The time for the drawdown to reach steady state increases with increasing compression index, initial void ratio, and aquitard thickness, and with decreasing initial effective stress and hydraulic conductivity.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB The information contained in hyetographs and hydrographs is often synthesized by using key properties such as the peak or maximum value X-p, volume V, duration D, and average intensity I. These variables play a fundamental role in hydrologic engineering as they are used, for instance, to define design hyetographs and hydrographs as well as to model and simulate the rainfall and streamflow processes. Given their inherent variability and the empirical evidence of the presence of a significant degree of association, such quantities have been studied as correlated random variables suitable to be modeled by multivariate joint distribution functions. The advent of copulas in geosciences simplified the inference procedures allowing for splitting the analysis of the marginal distributions and the study of the so-called dependence structure or copula. However, the attention paid to the modeling task has overlooked a more thorough study of the true nature and origin of the relationships that link Xp; V; D, and I. In this study, we apply a set of ad hoc bootstrap algorithms to investigate these aspects by analyzing the hyetographs and hydrographs extracted from 282 daily rainfall series from central eastern Europe, three 5 min rainfall series from central Italy, 80 daily streamflow series from the continental United States, and two sets of 200 simulated universal multifractal time series. Our results show that all the pairwise dependence structures between Xp; V; D, and I exhibit some key properties that can be reproduced by simple bootstrap algorithms that rely on a standard univariate resampling without resort to multivariate techniques. Therefore, the strong similarities between the observed dependence structures and the agreement between the observed and bootstrap samples suggest the existence of a numerical generating mechanism based on the superposition of the effects of sampling data at finite time steps and the process of summing realizations of independent random variables over random durations. We also show that the pairwise dependence structures are weakly dependent on the internal patterns of the hyetographs and hydrographs, meaning that the temporal evolution of the rainfall and runoff events marginally influences the mutual relationships of Xp; V; D, and I. Finally, our findings point out that subtle and often overlooked deterministic relationships between the properties of the event hyetographs and hydrographs exist. Confusing these relationships with genuine stochastic relationships can lead to an incorrect application of multivariate distributions and copulas and to misleading results.

AB Although discharge estimations are central for water management and hydropower, there are few studies on the variability and uncertainty of their basis; deriving discharge from stage heights through the use of a rating curve that depends on riverbed geometry. A large fraction of the world's river-discharge stations are presumably located in alluvial channels where riverbed characteristics may change over time because of erosion and sedimentation. This study was conducted to analyse and quantify the dynamic relationship between stage and discharge and to determine to what degree currently used methods are able to account for such variability. The study was carried out for six hydrometric stations in the upper Choluteca River basin, Honduras, where a set of unusually frequent stage-discharge data are available. The temporal variability and the uncertainty of the rating curve and its parameters were analysed through a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis on a moving window of data using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Acceptable ranges for the values of the rating-curve parameters were determined from riverbed surveys at the six stations, and the sampling space was constrained according to those ranges, using three-dimensional alpha shapes. Temporal variability was analysed in three ways: (i) with annually updated rating curves (simulating Honduran practices), (ii) a rating curve for each time window, and (iii) a smoothed, continuous dynamic rating curve derived from the MC analysis. The temporal variability of the rating parameters translated into a high rating-curve variability. The variability could turn out as increasing or decreasing trends and/or cyclic behaviour. There was a tendency at all stations to a seasonal variability. The discharge at a given stage could vary by a factor of two or more. The quotient in discharge volumes estimated from dynamic and static rating curves varied between 0.5 and 1.5. The difference between discharge volumes derived from static and dynamic curves was largest for sub-daily ratings but stayed large also for monthly and yearly totals. The relative uncertainty was largest for low flows but it was considerable also for intermediate and large flows. The standard procedure of adjusting rating curves when calculated and observed discharge differ by more than 5% would have required continuously updated rating curves at the studied locations. We believe that these findings can be applicable to many other discharge stations around the globe. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, missing consecutive streamflows are estimated, using the principles of chaos theory, in two steps. First, the existence of chaotic behavior in the daily flows of the river is investigated. The time delay embedding method of reconstructing the phase space of a time series is utilized to identify the characteristics of the nonlinear deterministic dynamics. Second, the analysis of chaos is used to configure two models employed to estimate the missing data, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and K-nearest neighbor (K-nn). The results indicate the utility of using the analysis of chaos for configuring the models. ANN model is configured using the identified correlation dimension (measure of chaos), and (K-nn) technique is applied within a subspace of the reconstructed attractor. ANNs show some superiority over K-nn in estimating the missing data of the English River, which is used as a case study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban water distribution systems are often made of loops to increase redundancy and improve reliability. The inherent feature of multipath wave propagation in looped networks has been the main obstacle to directly derive a factorized wave propagation model with decoupled leak location and size, which is essential for developing a robust and efficient leak localization method. To address this problem, this article proposes an efficient algorithm to estimate the transient hydraulic pressure and discharge at all nodes of a looped network using boundary measurements. Given these hydraulic properties, a factorized wave propagation model is formulated by applying conservation laws to a tree-shaped control volume of the looped network. Based on this factorized model, a fast and efficient one-dimensional search of the leak location along all pipes of a looped network is realized by the matched-field processing technique. Numerical experiments demonstrate that an unknown leak anywhere in a five-loop network with 13 pipes can be accurately and efficiently localized by the proposed method.

TI Analytical solution of the depth-averaged flow velocity in case of

AB [1] A new model for the depth-averaged velocity for flow in presence of submerged vegetation is developed. The model is based on a two-layer approach, where flow above and through the vegetation layer is described separately. Vegetation is treated as a homogeneous field of identical cylindrical stems, and the flow field is considered stationary and uniform. It is demonstrated that scaling considerations of the bulk flow field can be used to avoid complications associated with smaller scale flow processes and that still the behavior of depth-averaged flow over vegetation is described accurately. The derived scaling expression of the average flow field is simple in form, it follows fundamental laws of fluid flow, and it shows very good agreement with laboratory flume experiments. The new model can be used for quick evaluation of a river's hydraulic response in cases where vegetated floodplains are inundated.

AB [1] In this paper we derive analytical solutions to statistical moments for transient saturated flow in two-dimensional, bounded, randomly heterogeneous porous media. By perturbation expansions, we first derive partial differential equations governing the zeroth-order head h((0)) and the first-order head term h((1)), where orders are in terms of the standard deviation of the log transmissivity. We then solve h((0)) and h((1)) analytically, both of which are expressed as infinite series. The head perturbation h((1)) is then used to derive expressions for autocovariance of the hydraulic head and the cross covariance between the log transmissivity and head. The expressions for the mean flux and flux covariance tensor are formulated from the head moments based on Darcy's law. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate the convergence of these solutions. We also examine the accuracy of these first-order solutions by comparing them with solutions from both Monte Carlo simulations and the numerical moment equation method.

AB The tailing of breakthrough curves (BTCs) commonly observed in the field is often associated with the existence of pools in karst conduits. The transient storage model was always used to simulate the BTC tailing caused by the storage zone, i.e. pool, however, the relationship between parameters in this model and pool volume is not clear, which is very useful for the understanding of the internal geometry of the conduit using this model or prediction of the contaminant transport. In this paper, we performed a series of indoor tracer experiments in a pool-pipe system involving two different pool structures, symmetrical pool (SP) and asymmetrical pool (ASP) with different positions, sizes, and numbers, to explore the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume. Several experiments were conducted in the ASP of 20 cm with different discharges so as to investigate the effect of turbulent flow condition on model parameters. The experimental results indicate that the duration time of the BTC, and the mean residence time of the solute increase linearly with the pool volume (pool size or pool number). For the model parameters, the cross-sectional area of the storage zone (A(s)) or the calculated volume (V-s) of the storage zone using As shows a good linear relationship with the pool volume (V-p) (A(s) = 0.0078V(p) + 3E 06; V-s = 0.8195V(p) + 0.0003, R-2 = 0.95) indicating a potential to use this parameter, which is almost constant with the discharge, to roughly estimate the pool volume. The cross-sectional area (A) of the main channel does not change with the pool volume and changes little with the discharge; it has a close value to the actual cross-sectional area. The remaining parameters, dispersion coefficient (D) and exchange coefficient (alpha), have strong connections with the pool type, pool distribution or flow condition, which can hardly be used to deduce the internal conduit structure directly. The relationships between model parameters and the pool volume are helpful to use the model parameters to identify the conduit geometry roughly.

ID TOPMODEL
AB The hydrological catchment model known as TOPMODEL, in its original and most widely-used form, assumed that subsurface transmissivity decreases exponentially as subsurface water storage decreases. It has been shown that this leads to recession curves of discharge Q that take the form -dQ/dt = aQ(b), where a is a constant and b = 2. In order to reproduce a wider range of recession, or base flow, behaviour, a power function for transmissivity was subsequently incorporated into TOPMODEL as an alternative to the exponential function. This was claimed to extend the realistic values of b to range from 1 to 2, inclusive. We show here that the power transmissivity function can also generate values of b > 2 without making unrealistic assumptions (beyond those arguably made in the original TOPMODEL), thus generating recession curves consistent with catchments showing prolonged base flow. Furthermore, the power transmissivity function can generate recession curves that steepen with time (b < 1). Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID NASH VALUES
AB A theoretical hydrograph based on Darcy's law and the diffusion equation has been extended into a predictive model for the discharge of diffuse springs and small rivers from a detailed rainfall record, using only a single free parameter, the basin time constant b. The model accurately predicts the flow variations of natural hydrographs, including the magnitude and timing of peak flow, total flow volume, inflection points, and recession rate, all as a function of effective rainfall amounts, basin area, and the time constant b. Predicted hydrographs for a sharp storm event in an unimpounded basin are compared to results for two common transfer functions, and our more parsimonious model is statistically superior. Modeling of a long-term record in proximal basins illustrates the effect of variations in b. Potential applications of the model include flood prediction, comparative studies of basin response in a regional context, and estimation of actual evapotranspiration.

AB The emergence of stochastic subsurface hydrology stemmed from the realization that the random spatial variability of aquifer properties has a profound impact on solute transport. The last four decades witnessed a tremendous expansion of the discipline, many fundamental processes and principal mechanisms being identified. However, the research findings have not impacted significantly the application in practice, for several reasons which are discussed. The paper discusses the current status of stochastic subsurface hydrology, the relevance of the scientific results for applications and it also provides a perspective to a few possible future directions. In particular, we discuss how the transfer of knowledge can be facilitated by identifying clear goals for characterization and modeling application, relying on recent recent advances in research in these areas.

AB A dry climate, the prevalence of small depressions, and the lack of a well-developed drainage network are characteristics of environments with extremely variable contributing areas to runoff. These types of regions arguably present the greatest challenge to properly understanding catchment streamflow generation processes. Previous studies have shown that contributing area dynamics are important for streamflow response, but the nature of the relationship between the two is not typically understood. Furthermore, it is not often tested how well hydrological models simulate contributing area. In this study, the ability of a semidistributed hydrological model, the PDMROF configuration of Environment Canada's MESH model, was tested to determine if it could simulate contributing area. The study focused on the St. Denis Creek watershed in central Saskatchewan, Canada, which with its considerable topographic depressions, exhibits wide variation in contributing area, making it ideal for this type of investigation. MESH-PDMROF was able to replicate contributing area derived independently from satellite imagery. Daily model simulations revealed a hysteretic relationship between contributing area and streamflow not apparent from the less frequent remote sensing observations. This exercise revealed that contributing area extent can be simulated by a semi-distributed hydrological model with a scheme that assumes storage capacity distribution can be represented with a probability function. However, further investigation is needed to determine if it can adequately represent the complex relationship between streamflow and contributing area that is such a key signature of catchment behavior.

AB Multi-component flow in porous media involves localized phenomena that could be due to several features, such as concentration fronts, wells or geometry of the media. Our approach to treating the localized phenomena is to use high-resolution discretization methods in combination with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The purpose of AMR is to concentrate the computational work near the regions of interest in the flow. When properly designed, AMR can significantly reduce the computational effort required to obtain a desired level of accuracy in the simulation. Necessarily, AMR requires appropriate techniques for communication between length scales in a hierarchy. The selection of appropriate scaling rules as well as computationally efficient data structures is essential to the success of the overall method. However, the emphasis here is on the development of efficient techniques for solving linear systems that arise in the numerical discretization of an elliptic equation for the incompressible pressure field. In this paper, the combined AMR technique has been applied to a two-component single-phase model for miscible flooding. Numerical results are discussed in one-dimensional and two-dimensional.

AB In water-stressed, semiarid urban environments, connections between impervious surfaces and drainage networks may strongly impact the water use and ecosystem productivity of neighboring vegetated areas. We use an ecohydrologic model, the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), to quantify the sensitivity of vegetation water use and net primary productivity (NPP) to fine-scale impervious surface connectivity. We develop a set of very fine-scale (2 m(2)) scenarios that vary both the percentage of impervious surface and fraction of this impervious surface with direct hydrologic connections to urban drainage systems for a small hillslope. When driven by Mediterranean climate forcing, model estimates suggest that total vegetation water use declines with increasing impervious area. However, when impervious area is hydrologically disconnected from the urban drainage network, declines in water and carbon fluxes with decreased vegetated area can be partially, or in some cases even completely, offset by increased transpiration and NPP in the remaining vegetation. Relative increases in water use and NPP of remaining vegetation are much greater for deeply rooted shrubs and trees and negligible for shallow rooted grasses. We extrapolate our findings to the catchment scale by developing a first-order approximation of fine-scale impervious connection impacts on aggregate watershed water and carbon flux estimates. Our approach offers a computationally and data-efficient method for estimating the impact of impervious area connectivity on these ecohydrologic fluxes. For our only partially urbanized Santa Barbara watershed, estimates of water use and NPP that account for fine-scale impervious connection differed by more than 10% from those that did not.

AB We present new measurements of bed load tracer transport in a mountain stream over several snowmelt seasons. Cumulative displacements were measured using passive tracers, which consisted of gravel and cobbles embedded with radio frequency identification tags. The timing of bed load motion during 11 transporting events was quantified with active tracers, i.e., accelerometer-embedded cobbles. Probabilities of cobble transport increased with discharge above a threshold, and exhibited slight to moderate hysteresis during snowmelt hydrographs. Dividing cumulative displacements by the number of movements recorded by each active tracer constrained average step lengths. Average step lengths increased with discharge, and distributions of average step lengths and cumulative displacements were thin tailed. Distributions of rest times followed heavy-tailed power law scaling. Rest time scaling varied somewhat with discharge and with the degree to which tracers were incorporated into the streambed. The combination of thin-tailed displacement distributions and heavy-tailed rest time distributions predict superdiffusive dispersion.

AB Estimating transpiration and water flow in trees remains a major challenge for quantifying water exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere. We develop a finite element tree crown hydrodynamics (FETCH) model that uses porous media equations for water flow in an explicit three-dimensional branching fractal tree-crown system. It also incorporates a first-order canopy-air turbulence closure model to generate the external forcing of the system. We use FETCH to conduct sensitivity analysis of transpirational dynamics to changes in canopy structure via two scaling parameters for branch thickness and conductance. We compare our results with the equivalent parameters of the commonly used resistor and resistor-capacitor representations of tree hydraulics. We show that the apparent temporal and vertical variability in these parameters strongly depends on structure. We suggest that following empirical calibration and validation, FETCH could be used as a platform for calibrating the "scaling laws'' between tree structure and hydrodynamics and for surface parameterization in meteorological and hydrological models.

AB This study expands the Metastatistical Extreme Value (MEV) framework to sub-daily rainfall frequency analysis and compares it to extreme value theory methods in presence of short records and measurement errors. Ordinary events are identified based on the temporal autocorrelation of hourly data and modeled with a Weibull distribution. MEV is compared to extreme value theory methods in the estimation of long return period quantiles from actual data (160 rain gauges with at least 60-year record in the contiguous United States) and on synthetic data perturbed with measurement errors typical of remote sensing rainfall estimation. MEV tends to underestimate the 100-year return period quantiles of hourly rainfall when 5-20 years of actual data are used, but presents diminished uncertainty. When a good model of the ordinary events and adequate number of events per year are available, MEV is able to provide information on the 100-year return period quantiles from 10-20, or even 5 years of data with significantly reduced uncertainty (<30% uncertainty for 5-year records). MEV estimates of 100-year return period quantiles from short records are much less sensitive than extreme value theory methods to additive/multiplicative errors, presence of cap values in the estimates, and missing of extreme values. Results from this study strongly support the use of MEV for rainfall frequency analyses based on remotely sensed datasets.

AB The current study evaluates the impacts of various sources of uncertainty involved in hydrologic modeling on parameter behavior and regionalization utilizing different Bayesian likelihood functions and the Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm. The developed likelihood functions differ in their underlying assumptions and treatment of error sources. We apply the developed method to a snow accumulation and ablation model (National Weather Service SNOW17) and generate parameter ensembles to predict snow water equivalent (SWE). Observational data include precipitation and air temperature forcing along with SWE measurements from 24 sites with diverse hydroclimatic characteristics. A multiple linear regression model is used to construct regionalization relationships between model parameters and site characteristics. Results indicate that model structural uncertainty has the largest influence on SNOW17 parameter behavior. Precipitation uncertainty is the second largest source of uncertainty, showing greater impact at wetter sites. Measurement uncertainty in SWE tends to have little impact on the final model parameters and resulting SWE predictions. Considering all sources of uncertainty, parameters related to air temperature and snowfall fraction exhibit the strongest correlations to site characteristics. Parameters related to the length of the melting period also show high correlation to site characteristics. Finally, model structural uncertainty and precipitation uncertainty dramatically alter parameter regionalization relationships in comparison to cases where only uncertainty in model parameters or output measurements is considered. Our results demonstrate that accurate treatment of forcing, parameter, model structural, and calibration data errors is critical for deriving robust regionalization relationships.

AB An innovative optimization-simulation framework is applied to a case study of the Province of Quebec, Canada, to optimize the spatial distribution of green infrastructure (GI), the capacity and location of gray infrastructure, and the parameters specific to real-time control (RTC) operating rules of a sewer system for reducing combined sewer overflows (CSOs) frequency and volume. GI, gray infrastructure, and RTC are applied either individually or in integration through eight optimization scenarios which are simulated over a nine-year period of historical rainfall data. Among all scenarios, spatial optimization of GI with RTC leads to maximal CSO volume reduction (98%) and is the most cost-effective option analyzed (70$/m(3) of seasonal average CSO reduction compared to 140$/m(3) for the scenario involving gray infrastructure alone). However, it requires a high GI implementation level and the CSO frequency under this scenario is sensitive to varying GI design parameters. The findings suggest that the best alternative for CSO control is the integration of the optimization of green and gray infrastructures with RTC as it still provides high CSO volume reduction (95%) and remains a cost-effective solution (90$/m(3) of CSO reduction), while providing robustness under cost and design uncertainties.

AB It is important to study the source-sink relationship of pollution. However, research on the groundwater pollution sources and pollution sinks has often been conducted separately in the past, which makes it difficult to study the source-sink relationship of pollutants. In this study, the source and sink of pollution in a site contaminated by a light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) is considered to study the relationship between them. The simulation model needs to be called repeatedly in the research process. To save time and reduce the calculation load, the ResNet-18 network structure is first utilized to create a substitute of simulation model. However, the performance of ResNet-18 surrogate model largely depends on the choice of hyperparameters. The variable-density grid search method is thus utilized to optimize the hyperparameters. In addition, the quality of training samples is an important factor to determine the accuracy of surrogate models. And the accuracy of the surrogate model will affect the effect of groundwater pollution identification. Therefore, the ResNet-18 surrogate model and the ensemble smoother algorithm are combined to construct an adaptive cyclic improved iterative process. Through the adaptive cyclic improved iterative process, the training samples, surrogate model and identification results of variables to be solved can be improved and updated together with the iterative process, to improve the solution effect of groundwater LNAPLs pollution source identification problem. Biodegradation is an important sink of LNAPL pollutants. Therefore, the biodegradation on the LNAPL pollutants in groundwater is considered by adding a biodegradation model to the original model of multi-phase flow. Finally, based on the numerical simulation models of multiphase flow and biodegradation, the Monte Carlo stochastic simulation are used to study the source-sink relationship of LNAPL pollutants. A hypothetical case based on real conditions was used to illustrate the validity of the methods. The results implied that the proposed methods can not only improve the effect of LNAPL pollution identification, but also study the source-sink relationship of LNAPL pollutant.

AB Hydrological drought, defined as below-average streamflow conditions, can be triggered by different mechanisms, which are to a large extent dictated by the climate. Moreover, the simulation of hydrological droughts highly depends on the model structure and how drought-triggering mechanisms are parameterized. In this large-sample hydrological study, we investigate how climate and model structure control hydrological drought simulations. We conducted sensitivity analysis on parameters of three frequently used hydrological models (HBV, SAC, and VIC) for the simulation of drought duration and drought deficit over 605 basins covering more than 10 different Koppen-Geiger climates. The sensitivity analysis revealed that, as anticipated, different parameters are sensitive in different climates. However, not all expected drought mechanisms were reflected in the parameter sensitivity: Especially, the sensitivity of ET parameters does not align with the theory, and the role of snow parameters in snow-related droughts shows a distinction between degree-day-based models and energy-balance models. Besides parameter sensitivity being different over climates, we also found that parameter sensitivity differed over the different models. Where HBV and SAC did display fairly similar behavior, in VIC other model mechanisms were triggered. This implies that conclusions on driving mechanisms in hydrological drought cannot be based on hydrological models only, as different models would lead to different conclusions. Hydrological models can have heuristic value in drought research, to formulate new theories and identify research directions, but formulated theories on driving processes should always be backed up by observations.

AB Water transit time is now a standard measure in catchment hydrological and ecohydrological research. The last comprehensive review of transit time modeling approaches was published 15+ years ago. But since then the field has largely expanded with new data, theory and applications. Here, we review these new developments with focus on water-age-balance approaches and data-based approaches. We discuss and compare methods including StorAge-Selection functions, well/partially mixed compartments, water age tracking through spatially distributed models, direct transit time estimates from controlled experiments, young water fractions, and ensemble hydrograph separation. We unify some of the heterogeneity in the literature that has crept in with these many new approaches, in an attempt to clarify the key differences and similarities among them. Finally, we point to open questions in transit time research, including what we still need from theory, models, field work, and community practice.

AB We model mudstone permeability during consolidation and grain rotation, and during fluid injection by simulating porous media flow using the lattice Boltzmann method. We define the mudstone structure using clay platelet thickness, aspect ratio, orientation, and pore widths. Over the representative range of clay platelet lengths (0.1-3 mu m), aspect ratios (length/thickness = 20-50), and porosities (phi = 0.07-0.80) our permeability results match mudstone datasets well. Homogenous kaolinite and smectite models document a log linear decline in vertical permeability from 8.31 x 10(-1)(5) -6.84 x 10(-12) m(2) at phi = 0.76-0.80 to 6.33 x 10(-19 )-1.30 x 10(-23 )m(2) at phi = 0.14-0.16, showing good correlation with experimental data (R-2 = 0.42 and 0.56).We employ our methodology to predict the permeability of two natural mudstone samples composed of smectite, illite, and chlorite grains. Over phi = 0.32-0.58, the permeability trends of two models replicating the mineralogical composition of the natural mudstone samples match experimental datasets well (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.74). We extend our methodology to evaluate how vertical permeability might evolve during microfracture network growth or macrofracture propagation upon fluid injection in compacted mudstone. Fluid injection results in a permeability increase from 1.02 x 10(-20) m(2) at phi = 0.07 to 2.07 x 10(-16) m(2) at phi = 0.29 for growth of a microfracture network, and from 1.02 x 10(-20 )m(2) at phi = 0.07 to 1.23 x 10(-16) m(2) at phi = 0.32 for macrofracture propagation. Our results suggest that a distributed microfracture network results in greater permeability during fluid injection in compacted mudstones (phi = 0.07-0.32) in comparison to a wide macrofracture. Our modeling approach provides a simple means to estimate permeability during burial and compaction or fluid injection based on knowledge of porosity and mineralogy.

AB Understanding how wormholes develop and how they change the permeability of the porous medium is important for many natural and industrial processes in subsurface solid-fluid systems. We conduct core flood tests to study the wormhole formation in a porous medium under different flow rates and at different moments before breakthrough. We show that the wormholes created in core flood tests have lengths following a power-law distribution, with more short ones than long ones. This statistical nature of the wormhole lengths allow one to experimentally study the wormhole competition in 3-D: Many wormholes develop initially near the inlet, but only a few develop further. Our experimental results also show that the existing wormhole-matrix models underestimate wormhole lengths because of the neglected additional pressure drop caused by the radial flow near the wormhole tip. We improve upon the existing models by approximating the radial flow near the wormhole tip with a Rankine ovoid model.

AB Given the hazardous effects of sudden dam reservoir contamination - as might occur upon the intrusion of the fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) - the contaminant's effect on the quality of allocated waters requires careful study. Employed to determine optimal reservoir operational rules in the case of sudden MTBE pollution, a risk-based simulation-optimization model was developed to simultaneously minimize unsatisfied water demand, the risk of violations of water quality standards, and the reservoir recovery time. Risks were assessed by considering various often-neglected pollution scenarios as a combination of location, quantity, and the season of pollution intrusion. The appropriateness of operational rules proved to depend upon thermal conditions and MTBE intrusion properties, confirming the necessity of considering location-quantity-season uncertainties. Social and regional conditions also occupied a dominant role in determining the level of satisfaction achieved under different water allocation strategies. Accordingly, by considering environmental conditions and local rules, a graph model for conflict resolution was established and used to reach a set of compromise operational rules. The developed framework could serve as a guide for water utilities to determine efficient reservoir operational rules after a sudden contaminant intrusion.

AB Numerous previous studies of bacterial transport in groundwaters and to deep aquifers and sediments have either neglected, or regarded as insignificant, the potential contribution of bacterial sedimentation. This study examines the potential significance of sedimentation as a mechanism for bacterial transport. A simple model is developed to predict the behavior of particles (bacterial or inorganic colloids) sedimenting through granular porous media under hydrostatic conditions. The model indicates that tortuosity-limited sedimentation velocities through porous media consisting of large, well-rounded grains can proceed at velocities close to (approximate to 90% that of) free sedimentation in water columns when particle-grain interactions involve only tortuosity. The assumption of neutral buoyancy of bacteria was demonstrated to be invalid through buoyant density measurements on 25 subsurface bacterial strains (using Percoll density gradient centrifugation). An average buoyant density of 1.088 Mg m(-3) was obtained (range from 1.040 to 1.121 Mg m(-3)). The two nonmotile bacterial strains selected for sedimentation experiments were Arthrobacter globiformis B672 (isolated from the Middendorf aquifer, 259-m depth), and OYS3, a streptomycin-resistant strain isolated from shallow groundwaters at Oyster, Virginia. All experiments were carried out under nongrowth conditions. Stokes' law sedimentation velocities for the two bacterial strains calculated from measurements of buoyant densities and characteristic sizes were 5.8 and 40 mm d(-1), respectively. Direct measurements of free sedimentation of Arthrobacter B672 and OYS3 through water columns (21 degrees C) yielded median velocities of 7.1 and 42 mm d(-1) respectively, in good agreement with Stokes' law calculations. The Arthrobacter B672 and OYS3 strains sedimented through saturated sand columns (quartz sand, 300-420 mu m diameter) under hydrostatic conditions at median velocities of 7 and 17 mm d(-1). Thus the sedimentation model is consistent with sand column observations on Arthrobacter B672 and too simplistic in the case of OYS3. Bacterial breakthrough by sedimentation exhibited trends consistent with first-order attenuation with distance. Bacterial deposition coefficients for this first-order model were in the range of 0.008-0.012 mm(-1). Surface physical-chemical interactions, grain and pore size distributions, and grain surface microtopography can be very important in controlling the effectiveness of bacterial sedimentation as a transport mechanism. This research suggested that if timescales are sufficiently long, spanning many generations, sedimentation can become a significant mechanism for bacterial transport.

AB Characterization of flow topology is essential to understand the effects of the heterogeneity and dimensionality of geological formations on the mixing of inert solute clouds in these same geological formations. In this work, we numerically study two indicators of flow topology, the averaged vorticity magnitude vertical bar omega vertical bar(av) and the averaged positive second invariant Q(av) of the deformation tensor del u, in steady Darcy flows through exponentially correlated lognormal hydraulic conductivity fields K. Our numerical results allow us to establish the relationships between the two indicators considered here and the hydraulic conductivity variance sigma(2) in 2D and 3D, highlighting the role played by the spatial structure of these porous media on flow topology, and indirectly on mixing. This work leads us to assess the maximum dilution index E-max, indicator of mixing, theoretically known to increase monotonically in steady Darcy flows through isotropic heterogeneous porous media. Our numerical results allow us to test this hypothesis by establishing the relationship between the slope a of maximum dilution index E-max and the averaged positive second invariant Q(av) of deformation tensor del u. The parameters of this relationship depend on molecular diffusion and dimensionality of problem considered.

AB Flood inundation modeling across large data sparse areas has been increasing in recent years, driven by a desire to provide hazard information for a wider range of locations. The sophistication of these models has steadily advanced over the past decade due to improvements in remote sensing and modeling capability. There are now several global flood models (GFMs) that seek to simulate water surface dynamics across all rivers and floodplains regardless of data scarcity. However, flood models in data sparse areas lack river bathymetry because this cannot be observed remotely, meaning that a variety of methods for approximating river bathymetry have been developed from uniform flow or downstream hydraulic geometry theory. We argue that bathymetry estimation in these models should follow gradually varying flow theory to account for both uniform and nonuniform flows. We demonstrate that existing methods for bathymetry estimation in GFMs are only accurate for kinematic water surface profiles and are unable to simulate unbiased water surface profiles for reaches with diffusive or shallow water wave properties. The use of gradually varied flow theory to estimate bathymetry in a GFM reduced model error compared to a target water surface profile by 66% and eliminated bias due to backwater effects. For a large-scale test case in Mozambique this reduced flood extents by 40% and floodplain storage by 79% at the 5 years return period. The wet bias associated with uniform flow derived channels could have significant implications for modeling the role floodplains play in attenuating river discharges, potentially overstating their role.

AB Volume changes of natural and compacted soils induced by changes in their water content have many practical implications in the service life of earth dams, river and canal embankments, and waste disposal facilities. An insight into the overall strain response of a clayey soil upon gradual wetting and drying is provided here. Experimental data coming from oedometer and isotropic tests under suction and net stress control are presented for a compacted clay with an initial anisotropic fabric, highlighting the relevant role played by the hydraulic path on collapse, swelling, and shrinkage strains. Irreversible strains could be observed after wetting-drying paths and the subsequent drying-wetting cycle. Both stress and hydraulic histories play a role in the evolution of the directional fabric of clayey soils. The experimental data could be reproduced with a rather simple elastic-plastic constitutive model with a mixed isotropic-rotational hardening, previously conceived for saturated soils. The model is extended to unsaturated conditions by substituting the saturated effective stress with a measure of the average stress acting on the soil skeleton and by introducing generalized hardening rules governed by both plastic strains and degree of saturation. Coupling between the mechanical and the hydraulic behavior is provided by the water retention curve, in which degree of saturation is adopted as a useful measure of the soil water content.

AB The paper focuses on the channel network of alpine basins, attempting to interpret channel reaches in terms of response to erosion and deposition processes. Two basins in the Dolomites (north-eastern Italy) were considered: the Rio Cordon (5 km(2)) and the upper Boite River (163 km(2)). The channel network was extracted from raster-type digital elevation models (DEM) using a slope-area threshold criterion. A contribution area index (CAI), which combines drainage area, A, and local slope, S (CAI = A(0.5)S), was used to identify channel heads. The channel network extracted from the DEM was then analysed to recognize cells showing a value of CAI lower than the threshold adopted for channel initiation. Contiguous cells with low values of CAI define channel reaches with low transport efficiency. Field surveys carried out for some selected cases showed a good agreement between prevailing sediment deposition predicted by the analysis of the channel network and observed channel morphological features. Sediment sources mapped in two study basins were also analysed in relation to the location of channels with high potential for sediment deposition: this made it possible to classify the potential role of different types of sediment sources with regard to basin sediment yield. Topographic characteristics of the channel network, expressed by CAI, were compared with a classification of channel morphology in the Rio Cordon. It was found that cells with low values of CAI frequently occur in the riffle-pool reaches, whereas the percentage significantly decreases in step-pool and bedrock channels.

AB This paper presents the analytical properties of the sensitivity of the two-dimensional, steady-state groundwater flow equation to the flow parameters and to the boundary conditions, based on the perturbation approach These analytical properties are used to provide guidelines for model design, model calibration and monitoring network design The sensitivity patterns are shown to depend on the nature of both the perturbed parameter and the variable investigated. Indeed, the sensitivity of the hydraulic head to the hydraulic conductivity extends mainly in the flow direction, while the sensitivity to the recharge spreads radially. Besides, the sensitivity of the flow longitudinal velocity to the hydraulic conductivity propagates in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, whereas the sensitivity of the flow transverse velocity propagates in the diagonal directions to the flow. The analytical results are confirmed by application examples on idealized and real-world simulations These analytical findings allow some general rules to be established for model design, model calibration and monitoring network design In particular, the optimal location of measurement points depends on the nature of the variable of interest. Measurement network design thus proves to be problem-dependent. Moreover, adequate monitoring well network design may allow to discriminate between the possible sources of error (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB A diffusive process is said to be anomalous if in any given direction the average square of the separation a particle experiences from its origin grows nonlinearly with time. Any diffusive process is anomalous if viewed on a short enough time scale, but interestingly, many diffusive processes remain anomalous over longer times. As a canonical example we study one such process here, diffusion in a laterally-confined nano-film as a function of the strain induced critical point. For this example we motivate and illustrate how a simple but novel process, Brownian motion run with a nonlinear clock (Bm-nlc), statistically mimics trajectories generated via Newton's force law. The model is easily generalized to more complicated random processes and has application in many fields, including but not limited to, random conductivity field or terrain generation, Richardson turbulence in the atmosphere, and time dependent dispersion in hydrology.

AB Subsurface storage as a regulator of streamflow was investigated as an explanation for the large proportion of pre-event water observed in urban streams during storm events. We used multiple lines of inquiry to explore the relationship between pre-event water proportion, subsurface storage, and streamflow under storm conditions. First, we used a three-dimensional model of integrated subsurface and surface flow and solute transport to simulate an idealized hillslope to perform model-based chemical hydrograph separation of stormflow. Second, we employed simple dynamical systems analysis to derive the relationship between subsurface storage and streamflow for three Baltimore, Maryland watersheds (3.8-14 km(2) in area) along an urban-to-rural gradient. Last, we applied chemical hydrograph separation to high-frequency specific conductance data in nested urban watersheds (approximate to 50% impervious surface cover) in Dead Run, Baltimore County, Maryland. Unlike the importance of antecedent subsurface storage observed in some systems, we found that rainfall depth and not subsurface storage was the primary control on pre-event water proportion in both field observations and hillslope numerical experiments. Field observations showed that antecedent stream base flow did not affect pre-event water proportion or streamflow values under storm conditions. Hillslope model results showed that the relationship between streamflow values under storm conditions and subsurface storage was clockwise hysteretic. The simple dynamical systems approach showed that stream base flow in the most urbanized of three watersheds exhibited the largest sensitivity to changes in sto

AB In this article, we present new random walk methods to solve flow and transport problems in saturated/unsaturated porous media, including coupled flow and transport processes in soils, heterogeneous systems modeled through random hydraulic conductivity and recharge fields, processes at the field and regional scales. The numerical schemes are based on global random walk algorithms (GRW) which approximate the solution by moving large numbers of computational particles on regular lattices according to specific random walk rules. To cope with the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation and of the coupled system, we implemented the GRW algorithms by employing linearization techniques similar to the L-scheme developed in finite element/volume approaches. The resulting GRW L-schemes converge with the number of iterations and provide numerical solutions that are first-order accurate in time and second-order in space. A remarkable property of the flow and transport GRW solutions is that they are practically free of numerical diffusion. The GRW solvers are validated by comparisons with mixed finite element and finite volume solvers in one-and two-dimensional benchmark problems. They include Richards' equation fully coupled with the advection-diffusion-reaction equation and capture the transition from unsaturated to saturated flow regimes.

AB Snow anomalies in the western USA have a significant impact on water availability, and hence have been widely investigated by many researchers. This study focuses on how anomalous atmospheric circulation affects snowpack accumulation in the western USA. Our results indicate that the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation anomalies induced by the El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) tend to drive winter precipitation shifts, leading to an anomalous snowpack distribution in the western USA. The warm phase of ENSO produces increased snowpack in the Southwest, whereas the cold phase generates increased snowpack in the Northwest. The results also indicate that temperature has a secondary impact on the anomalous snowpack distribution during ENSO episodes. Additionally, the atmospheric internal variability-related Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern is found to affect snow anomalies strongly in the western USA independent from ENSO. The positive phase of the PNA pattern produces colder temperature and stronger precipitation due to the lower pressure in the region, leading to an above-average snowpack. Conversely, the negative phase of the PNA pattern generates warmer temperature and weaker precipitation resulting from the higher pressure, producing below-average snowpack in the western USA. The significant findings that result from this study strengthen our understanding of climate and water supply variability in the western USA. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are ubiquitous ecological and public health hazards because they are composed of potentially toxic freshwater microorganisms called cyanobacteria. The abiotic drivers for toxic HAB are investigated using a research station deployed in a eutrophic lake in Minnesota in 2016. This research station provides full-depth water quality (hourly) and meteorological conditions monitoring (5min) at the sampling site. Water quality monitoring provides chemical, physical, and biological measurements, that is, phycocyanin concentration, a photosynthetic pigment distinct to cyanobacteria. The high cyanobacteria biovolume (BV) in the epilimnion observed in mid-July persisted until late September when it was distributed uniformly throughout the water column. A scaling relationship was developed among BV heterogeneity, thermal stratification stability, and surface water temperature. This relationship was verified in a dimictic lake the following year. The proposed scaling relationship is relevant to sampling protocols of HAB as it informs if the sample depth is representative of the entire water column. During the strongly stratified period, BV accumulated above the thermocline and in the photic zone, with distinct peaks forming occasionally both near the water surface and at locations with photosynthetically active radiation approximately equal to 10 E/m(2)s. Our observations suggest that the temporal/vertical variability of cyanobacteria BV is strongly influenced by lake dynamics, thermal structure, seasonal temperature variation, and light availability. These observations demonstrate that cyanobacteria tend to move and accumulate in specific warm water layers, confined by the thermocline and determined by well-defined light conditions.

AB Data assimilation allows for updating state variables in a model to represent the initial condition of a catchment more accurately than the initial OpenLoop simulation. In hydrology, data assimilation is often a prerequisite for forecasting. According to Hornik (1991, https://doi.org/10.1016/0893-6080(91)90009-T) artificial neural networks can learn any nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs. Here, we hypothesize that neural networks could learn the relationship between the simulated streamflow (from a hydrological model) and the corresponding state variables. Once learned, this relationship can be used to obtain corrected state variables by applying it to observed rather than simulated streamflow. Based on this, we propose a novel, ensemble-based, data assimilation approach. As a proof of concept and to verify the abovementioned hypothesis, we used an international testbed comprising four hydrologically dissimilar catchments. We applied the new data assimilation method to the lumped hydrological model GR4J, which has two state variables. Within this framework, we compared two types of neural networks, namely, Extreme Learning Machine and the Multilayer Perceptron. Using well-known metrics such as the continuous ranked probability score, we compared the assimilated streamflow series with the OpenLoop streamflow series and with the observed streamflow. We show that neural networks can be successfully used for data assimilation, with a noticeable improvement over the OpenLoop simulation for all catchments.

AB The accurate prediction of depth-averaged streamwise velocity, boundary shear stress and lateral shear stress are important requisites for the estimation of the flow depth associated with flood events in compound river channels composed of main channel and floodplain. This engineering problem may be tackled through the analytical solution of the depth-averaged momentum equation. Under uniform flow, this solution relies on the calibration of three descriptors of the bottom friction, secondary currents and lateral shear stress. In this paper, the analytical solution materialized in the Lateral Distribution Method is revisited through the consideration of a new panel division. Accurate measurements of streamwise and spanwise velocities as well as of boundary shear stress are used to obtain new predictors of the coefficients describing the effects of bottom friction, secondary currents and lateral shear.
   The new lateral division of the compound channel into four panels is physically based on the mixing layer width, which is computed by an iterative procedure easily implemented in practical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB River discharge estimation requires knowledge of bathymetry. However, aside from a few locations where surveys have been conducted, bathymetric data are unavailable, even for major rivers. It has been suggested that water surface elevation and flow width measurements from the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission (planned launch 2021) may be used to infer the submerged channel geometry; however, the full potential of these measurements for inferring bathymetry has yet to be explored. We apply four different techniques, with varying assumptions about height-width relationships, to predict unknown bathymetry. We call these curve-fitting methods the linear, slope break, nonlinear, and nonlinear slope break (NLSB) methods. The linear and slope break methods are based on a linear height-width relationship, while the nonlinear and NLSB methods are based on a height-width relationship derived from hydraulic geometry equations. We generate SWOT-like observations of height and width based on 5-m gridded Upper Mississippi River data and evaluate the performance of each curve-fitting method given the SWOT-like observations. The NLSB method predicts bed elevation and low flow area with the least error, although the nonlinear method may be preferred in low data conditions. Additionally, we show that our method outperforms previously suggested methods, and we propose an NLSB-based bathymetry prior for Bayesian discharge estimation algorithms.

AB A long-term study of O, H and C stable isotopes has been undertaken on river waters across the 7000-km(2) upper Thames lowland river basin in the southern UK. During the period, flow conditions ranged from drought to flood. A 10-year monthly record (2003-2012) of the main River Thames showed a maximum variation of 3 (O-18) and 20 (H-2), although interannual average values varied little around a mean of -6.5 parts per thousand (O-18) and -44 parts per thousand (H-2). A (HO)-H-2-O-18 slope of 5.3 suggested a degree of evaporative enrichment, consistent with derivation from local rainfall with a weighted mean of -7.2 parts per thousand (O-18) and -48 parts per thousand (H-2) for the period. A tendency towards isotopic depletion of the river with increasing flow rate was noted, but at very high flows (>100m(3)/s), a reversion to the mean was interpreted as the displacement of bank storage by rising groundwater levels (corroborated by measurements of specific electrical conductivity). A shorter quarterly study (October 2011-April 2013) of isotope variations in 15 tributaries with varying geology revealed different responses to evaporation, with a well-correlated inverse relationship between O-18 and baseflow index for most of the rivers. A comparison with aquifer waters in the basin showed that even at low flow, rivers rarely consist solely of isotopically unmodified groundwater. p id="hyp10779-para-0003"Long-term monitoring (2003-2007) of carbon stable isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Thames revealed a complex interplay between respiration, photosynthesis and evasion, but with a mean interannual C-13-DIC value of -14.8 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, exchange with atmospheric carbon could be ruled out. Quarterly monitoring of the tributaries (October 2011-April 2013) indicated that in addition to the aforementioned factors, river flow variations and catchment characteristics were likely to affect C-13-DIC. Comparison with basin groundwaters of different alkalinity and C-13-DIC values showed that the origin of river baseflow is usually obscured. p id="hyp10779-para-0004"The findings show that long-term monitoring of environmental tracers can help to improve the understanding of how lowland river catchments function.

   variability; stochastic demand model; water supply
AB Peak demand plays a major role in water distribution system design. Peak demand assessment is currently facing a double challenge: shifting toward a probabilistic approach, and considering the effect of different spatial and temporal resolutions. Most probabilistic approaches so far have focused on inferring scaling laws by analyzing measurement time series for different spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim of this paper is two-fold: (a) to present a novel analytical approach that enables to assess the short-term variability effect on probabilistic peak demands for different spatial and temporal scales, and (b) to ease the understanding of peak demand factors thanks to a physically based (rather than an empirical) approach. This is possible by combining the principles of peak demand analysis with a microcomponent-based (i.e., end-use oriented) demand model that enables assessment of short-term variability. The methodology here proposed is applied to two case studies with the purpose of validating the approach and showing its full potential. Results prove that stochastic demand models can be a powerful tool for peak demand assessment.

AB Understanding flow mechanisms in fractured media is essential for geoscientific research and geological development industries. This study used 3-D printed fracture networks in order to control the properties of fracture distributions inside the sample. The accuracy and appropriateness of creating samples by the 3-D printer was investigated by using a X-ray CT scanner. The CT scan images suggest that the 3-D printer is able to reproduce complex three-dimensional spatial distributions of fracture networks. Use of hexane after printing was found to be an effective way to remove wax for the posttreatment. Local permeability was obtained by the cubic law and used to calculate the global mean. The experimental value of the permeability was between the arithmetic and geometric means of the numerical results, which is consistent with conventional studies. This methodology based on 3-D printed fracture networks can help validate existing flow modeling and numerical methods.

AB Water infiltration into the unsaturated zone is potentially affected by air compression ahead of the wetting front. Analytical infiltration equations accounting for air compression, air counterflow, and flow hysteresis in a porous medium were derived on the basis of the Green and Ampt [1911] assumptions. Air compression ahead of the wetting front was predicted using the perfect gas law. The capillary pressure at the wetting front was found to vary between the dynamic water-bubbling value and the dynamic air-bubbling value of the material. These equations, accounting also for the effects of macropores near the soil surface, turned out to be simpler than the traditional Kostiakov [1932] and the Philip [1957a, b, c, d] equations. The equation parameters are physically meaningful and can be readily obtained from field measurements of the natural saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention or pressure infiltrometer data. Experimental testing showed that the equations are reasonably accurate.

AB An erosion and force/moment equilibrium based three-dimensional dam breach model is developed for the non-cohesive earthen dam overtopping breach problem. The breach location can be anywhere along the dam. The model considers the topography of the entire dam site. Three-dimensional slope stability along the main direction of flow in the breach channel is checked. A second order hybrid-type of total variation diminishing finite-difference scheme is proposed to simulate the dam breach outflow by solving the two-dimensional shallow water equations. The scheme is shown to accurately reproduce supercritical, subcritical, and transcritical flows for the following analytical or experimental cases: one-dimensional theoretical dam break with initially dry and wet beds, steady flow over a bump, hydraulic jump, one-dimensional dam break with a bottom slope, and two-dimensional dam break with bottom and side slopes. Applications to a simple breach channel show that calculated flows match the broad-crested weir formula and reasonably fit the grids. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a vital water source in cold and arid areas, snowmelt alleviates spring drought problems. Based on a laboratory simulation tests, after nine freeze-thaw cycles, under the simulated conditions of different biochar application amounts (0%, 1%, 2% and 3%, denoted as H0, H1, H2 and H3, respectively) in the spring soil thawing period, the characteristics of soil structure and the process of snowmelt transport in farmland black soil were explored. The research results showed that (a) the addition of biochar increased the soil total porosity and the proportion of pores in the middle section (0.3 similar to 100 mu m) and reduced the proportion of soil voids (> 100 mu m) and extremely micro pores (< 0.3 mu m). (b) As the biochar application amount increased, the stability of soil aggregates first increased and then decreased. The rules of the medium aggregates (0.25 similar to 2 mm) were consistent with the structural stability indexes, while the rules of the silt and clay (< 0.106 mm) were opposite. (c) With an increase in the amount of applied biochar, the saturated water conductivity of unfrozen soil increased; however, the opposite effect was observed for frozen soil. The coefficient Xi was developed to evaluate the soil infiltration performance in the thawing period based on the soil saturation water conductivity. Xi exhibited a good correlation with snowmelt transport. (d) Evaporation, infiltration and runoff also showed a trend of first improving and then producing negative effects with increasing biochar application amount in the snowmelt period. From the perspective of the utilization efficiency of spring snowmelt, the utilization rate of H0 snowmelt was 71.13% and it increased by 6.4% and 1.2% in H1 and H2, respectively, and decreased by 13.53% in the H3 treatment compared with the H0 treatment. Considering the soil structure and soil moisture demand needed for spring sowing, 1% biochar application amount is the most suitable for farmland black soil.

AB Five characteristics (intensity or magnitude, duration, frequency, timing, and variability) of drought, defined using the threshold level method (TLM) and recorded in mean annual water levels in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from 1918 to 2010, were compared. Timing is the only characteristic that is different for the two water bodies. For Lake Ontario, the most intense drought occurred in the 1930s, whereas in the St. Lawrence River, intense droughts took place in the 1960s and 2000s. The Lake Ontario drought produced two shifts in mean before (decrease) and after (increase) the 1930s. The change in variance that took place in the 1960s is thought to be related to the construction of locks during the digging of the seaway. The droughts that affected the St. Lawrence River had no impact on the stationarity (mean and variance) of the annual mean water level series. Analysis of the correlation between drought severity and climate indices revealed that years characterized by very weak to moderate drought are significantly correlated with PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), while those characterized by intense drought are correlated with NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation). Both climate indices are negatively correlated with Lake Ontario water levels, while they are positively correlated with St. Lawrence River levels. The study suggests that NAO may be used to predict the driest years for the two water bodies.
   Key Points
   Long-term trend analyses revealed increase in water level of Ontario Lake Long-term trend analyses revealed decrease in water level in St. Lawrence River Shift in mean water level in both systems was not synchronous

ID DEPRESSION-STORAGE; QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION; INDEXES; MODEL
AB The study of the relationships between surface roughness, local slope gradient and maximum volume of water storage in surface depressions is a fundamental element in the development of hydrological models to be used in soil and water conservation strategies. Good estimates of the maximum volume of water storage are important for runoff assessment during rainfall events.
   Some attempts to link surface storage to parameters such as indices of surface roughness and, more rarely, local gradient have been proposed by several authors with empirical equations often conflicting between them and usually based on a narrow range of slope gradients. This suggests care in selecting any of the proposed equations or models and invites one to verify the existence of more realistic experimental relationships, based on physical models of the surfaces and valid for a larger range of gradients. The aim of this study is to develop such a relation for predicting/estimating the maximum volume of water that a soil surface, with given roughness characteristics and local slope gradient, can store.
   Experimental work has been carried out in order to reproduce reliable rough surfaces able to maintain the following properties during the experimental activity: (a) impervious surface to avoid biased storage determination; (b) stable, un-erodible surfaces to avoid changes of retention volume during tests; (c) absence of hydrophobic behaviour. To meet the conditions a-c we generate physical surfaces with various roughness magnitude using plasticine (emulsion of non-expansible clay and oil). The plasticine surface, reproducing surfaces of arable soils, was then wetted and dirtied with a very fine timber sawdust. This reduced the natural hydrophobic behaviour of the plasticine to an undetectable value. Storage experiments were conducted with plasticine rough surfaces on top of large rigid polystyrene plates inclined at different slope gradient: 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%. Roughness data collected on the generated plasticine surfaces were successfully compared with roughness data collected on real soil surfaces for similar conditions.
   A set of roughness indices was computed for each surface using roughness profiles measured with a laser profile meter. Roughness indices included quantiles of the Abbot-Firestone curve, which is used in surface metrology for industrial application to characterize surface roughness in a non-parametric approach (Whitehouse, 1994). Storage data were fitted with an empirical equation (double negative exponential of roughness and slope). Several roughness indices resulted well related to storage. The better results were obtained using the Abbot-Firestone curve parameter P-100.
   Beside this storage empirical model (SEM) a geometrical model was also developed, trying to give a more physical basis to the result obtained so far.
   Depression geometry was approximated with spherical cups. A general physical model was derived (storage cup model - SCM). The cup approximation identifies where roughness elevation comes in and how it relates to slope gradient in defining depression volume. Moreover, the exponential decay used for assessing slope effect on storage volume in the empirical model of Eqs. (8) and (9) emerges as consistent with distribution of cup sizes.

AB The purpose of this paper is to propose a bilevel model and a set of water-transfer rule to solve the multireservoir operation problem in inter-basin water transfer-supply project. At present, there is very little literature on multi-reservoir operating policy taking water transfer and water supply into consideration at the same time, especially very little study on water-transfer rule. In this study, a bilevel model is presented to consider water transfer and water supply together, in view of the hierarchical structure of the problem, which renders this problem unsuitable for modeling by conventional method. The multi-reservoir system manager, at the upper level of the hierarchy, optimizes water-transfer rule curves to allocate trans-boundary water resources spatially. And the individual reservoir manager, at the lower level, pursues the best water supply accompanying the action of water transfer by optimizing hedging rule curves. The East-to-West inter-basin water transfer project of Liaoning province in China is taken as a case study. The results indicate that the proposed bilevel model and water-transfer rule are reasonable and suitable to deal with the multi-reservoir water transfer-supply operation problem.

AB Groundwater in India plays an important role to support livelihoods and maintain ecosystems and the present rate of depletion of groundwater resources poses a serious threat to water security. Yet, the sensitivity of the hydrological processes governing groundwater recharge to climate variability remains unclear in the region. Here we assess the groundwater sensitivity (precipitation-recharge relationship) and its potential resilience towards climatic variability over peninsular India using a conceptual water balance model and a convex model, respectively in 54 catchments over peninsular India. Based on the model performance using a comprehensive approach (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency [NSE], bias and variability), 24 out of 54 catchments are selected for assessment of groundwater sensitivity and its resilience. Further, a systematic approach is used to understand the changes in resilience on a temporal scale based upon the convex model and principle of critical slowing down theory. The results of the study indicate that the catchments with higher mean groundwater sensitivity (GWS) encompass high variability in GWS over the period (1988-2011), thus indicating the associated vulnerability towards hydroclimatic disturbances. Moreover, it was found that the catchments pertaining to a lower magnitude of mean resilience index incorporates a high variability in resilience index over the period (1993-2007), clearly illustrating the inherent vulnerability of these catchments. The resilience of groundwater towards climatic variability and hydroclimatic disturbances that is revealed by groundwater sensitivity is essential to understand the future impacts of changing climate on groundwater and can further facilitate effective adaptation strategies.

   CAPACITY; SCIENCE
AB Land and water management often relies upon relationships describing the catchment-scale water balance using only a few parameters. The classic Budyko and Turc frameworks are examples of these relationships applicable to large catchments, where the effect of climatic variables on the water balance overshadows that of catchment characteristics, including the catchment ability to store water to supply evapotranspiration. To account for the latter in the list of variables driving evapotranspiration, here we introduce a new framework that includes Budyko and Turc as particular cases. The four variables in this framework are combined to form dimensionless groups, the choice of which leads to the definition of hydrological spaces highlighting different features of the long-term hydrological partitioning. In addition to the Budyko and Turc spaces, suitable for water- and energy-limited catchments, respectively, a new space ensues; this is especially apt to describe catchments where evapotranspiration is mainly controlled by catchment characteristics. An existing stochastic model for the soil water balance is used to specify the relationship between the variables in these different hydrological spaces. This framework, successfully tested here against about 400 catchments in the continental United States, provides a concise yet realistic description of long-term catchment-scale water balance and overcomes some limitations of current models for the estimation of long-term evapotranspiration and runoff in ungauged catchments.

AB Relevant flow dynamics for the interpretation of passive fluxmeter (PFM) measurements are investigated by determining the properties of the flow field inside the PFM and its relationship to the undisturbed ambient fluxes in the aquifer. The flow domain is treated in two dimensions and consists of a system of concentric annular filter zones of different radii and hydraulic conductivities. Flow inside the PFM is shown to be uniform regardless of well configuration. Analytical expressions quantifying flow convergence are derived for an increasing number of rings, validated against numerical modeling and used to perform a sensitivity analysis. One of the derived convergence relationships is embedded in an inverse model to estimate aquifer and well screen conductivities and ambient groundwater and methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether ( MTBE) fluxes in the Borden Aquifer under controlled flow conditions. Results compare well to independent estimates when the method of quantifying convergence is consistent with field conditions.

AB The simultaneous thermodynamic pathways (i.e., isenthalps) of the air at the measurement height and at the vegetated land surface under isobaric and adiabatic wetting/drying cycles of the environment make it possible to define the actual evaporation rate with the help of three (one measured and two derived) vapor pressure (and corresponding temperature) terms. From the first-order approximation about the constancy of the relative average speed which the two isenthalps are travelled at during drying out of the environment, a nondimensional, linear form of the complementary relationship (CR) of evaporation naturally emerges, but now expressed by vapor pressures (and temperatures, respectively). Without an artificially low Priestley-Taylor parameter value this linear CR would overestimate the evaporation rates because the surface warms faster than the constant relative speed assumption permits. With the appropriate estimation of the wet-surface temperature and employment of realistic boundary conditions, the latter leading to a nonlinear CR, land evaporation rates can be estimated fairly accurately with minimal input variables (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and net surface radiation) and without any information of land surface properties. Not only actual but three potential evaporation rates can also be defined by linking the temperature/vapor pressure coordinates of the air and the surface isenthalps, thus reproducing certain existing formulations of the CR as well as re-creating an existing hybrid (containing, both non-dimensional vapor pressure and evaporation terms) version of it.

AB Water temperature (Tw) is a key determinant of freshwater ecosystem status and cause for concern under a changing climate. Hence, there is growing interest in the feasibility of moderating rising Tw through management of riparian shade. The Loughborough University Temperature Network (LUTEN) is an array of 36 water and air temperature (Ta) monitoring sites in the English Peak District set-up to explore the predictability of local Tw, given Ta, river reach, and catchment properties. Year 1 of monitoring shows that 84%-94% of variance in daily Tw is explained by Ta. However, site-specific logistic regression parameters exhibit marked variation and dependency on upstream riparian shade. Perennial spring flows in the lower River Dove also affect regression model parameters and strongly buffer daily and seasonal mean Tw. The asymptote of the models (i.e. maximum expected Tw) is particularly sensitive to groundwater inputs. We conclude that reaches with spring flows potentially offer important thermal refuges for aquatic organisms against expected long-term warming of rivers and should be afforded special protection.

AB Semiarid systems compose a significant portion of the world's terrestrial area and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. A model was developed using the relation between surface reflectance and temperature obtained from satellite imagery to determine a Water Deficit Index (WDI) that estimated distributed plant transpiration, and by extension carbon dioxide (CO2) flux, for a point in time. Relationships were developed to scale these instantaneous flux measurements up to daytime estimates, which were then used to obtain measures of nighttime flux. Satellite images were acquired for a 5-year period (1996-2000) during which transpiration and net CO2 flux were measured for a semiarid grassland site in southeastern Arizona. Manual and automatic chamber data were also collected at the same site during the monsoon growing seasons of 2005 and 2006 and used to develop the relationship between and daytime and nighttime CO2 flux. Strong linear relationships were found between WDI-derived instantaneous and daytime net CO2 flux estimates (R-2 = 0.97), and between daytime and nighttime fluxes (R-2 = 0.88). These relations were used to generate maps of distributed total daily net CO2 flux. The error for the model was within the range of error inherent in the data sets used to create it and remained reasonable when used with WDI values less than 0.9. This study demonstrated that remote sensing can offer a physically based means of obtaining daily net CO2 flux in semiarid grasslands.

AB In the Amazon River basin, water stored for months to years in the soils and subsurface provide a persistent resource that regulates local and global climate via teleconnections and provides water to plants in times of little rain. While Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have provided the hydrological community with large advances in the understanding of large river basin dynamics and for water resources monitoring applications, the relative storage measurements from GRACE satellites have not yet been utilized for the quantification of total available freshwater on landmasses. In this study, we quantify the total drainable water storage (TDWS) in the Amazon basin by characterizing the relationship between the water storage anomaly of a large catchment and its base flow. Previous studies have shown that these two hydrological parameters behave like a linear time-independent system over a catchment like the Amazon dominated by fully humid tropical climate. This linear relationship allows us to determine a zero water storage level, at which the storage-driven discharge becomes zero. We quantify the TDWS of the Amazon basin as 1,766 km(3) and estimate an average 2 month residence time for stored waters. An independent analysis over nine major subbasins confirms our estimate for the entire basin. We show that our estimated TDWS values for individual subbasins, varying between 15 and 654 km3, follow two different linear relationships with their mean annual input. Through these relationships we also quantify the storage-driven portion of the streamflow and the total streamflow for Amazon and its subbasins. Furthermore, we estimate surface water storage variation of the Amazon River system by combining the water level time series from satellite altimetry and surface water extent time series from satellite imagery. Our results show that 61% of total basin water storage variation occurs in the surface water compartment. In addition, we find that 65% of the TDWS is available in its surface water system.

AB We study density-driven flow in a fractured porous medium in which the fractures are represented as manifolds of reduced dimensionality. Fractures are assumed to be thin regions of space filled with a porous material whose properties differ from those of the porous medium enclosing them. The interfaces separating the fractures from the embedding medium are assumed to be ideal. We consider two approaches: (i) the fractures have the same dimension, d, as the embedding medium and are said to be d-dimensional; (ii) the fractures are considered as (d - 1)-dimensional manifolds, and the equations of density-driven flow are found by averaging the d-dimensional laws over the fracture width. We show that the second approach is a valid alternative to the first one. For this purpose, we perform numerical experiments using finite-volume discretization for both approaches. The results obtained by the two methods are in good agreement with each other. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EQUATION
AB The physical laws governing the interaction of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in a water body are expressed as coupled one-dimensional, transient partial differential equations and solved by the Green element method (GEM). The GEM has been developed as a flexible, hybrid numerical approach, that utilizes the finite element methodology to achieve optimum, inter-nodal connectivity in the problem domain, while at the same time retaining the elegant second order accurate formulation of the boundary element method (BEM). While overcoming some of the limitations of classical boundary element approach, GEM guarantees a sparsely populated coefficient matrix, which is easy to handle numerically. We test the reliability of GEM by solving a one-dimensional mass transport model that simulates BOD-DO dynamics in a stream. The results compare favorably with those obtained analytically, and by the finite element method (FEM) Galerkin procedure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agriculture affects the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, leading to a deterioration of surface water quality. The increasing magnitude of climate change raises questions about potential additional or mitigating effects of climate change on this deterioration. One way to understand these potential effects is to cross-analyze the dynamics of nutrient concentrations and hydroclimatic variables at multiple time scales. Here, we used a 16-year data set, from a 5 km(2)agricultural watershed in France with a temperate oceanic climate, that contains a daily record of nutrient concentrations and hydroclimatic variables from 2002-2017. We calculated Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen tests, Fourier transforms, and daily hydroclimatic distributions associated with extreme stream concentrations to investigate long-term trends, seasonal dynamics and their interannual variations, and the daily time scale, respectively. Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations displayed opposite patterns at the three temporal scales, while soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations showed decoupled dynamics, related more to extreme hydrological events. Climate and past agricultural changes seem to have a synergetic effect that leads to long-term NO(3)decrease and DOC increase. Precipitation and, to a greater extent, watershed wetness controlled seasonal and event-driven dynamics.

AB Water-use efficiency (WUE) at the whole-plant level plays as an important role as an indicator of both the water use strategy of the plant, and the ecophysiological processes linking the carbon and water cycles. However, the variation in the annual pattern of WUE, the interannual trends, and the regulating factors of WUE in rubber plantations remain poorly understood. Here, we used a four-year (2013-2016) continuous biometric survey along with sap flow data recorded at a monthly resolution to examine the annual and interannual dynamics of WUE and the relationships of WUE with environmental and biological factors in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations in Southwest China. The results showed that (1) there was no definitive pattern in WUE between April and December, but the peak WUE values generally occurred around August; (2) the multi-year mean WUE was 2.34 +/- 0.19 g C.kg(-1) H2O, and a negative correlation of WUE to photosynthetically active radiation was found at the interannual scale (r = -0.962, P < 0.05); and (3) a moderate, significant and parabolic relationship of WUE with air temperature (R-2 = 0.40), net radiation (R-2 = 0.37) and growth rate of the diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.35) was observed at the monthly scale during the growing season (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that WUE might be regulated by factors affecting the carbon sequestration rather than water consumption, and it will provide a deeper understanding of the ecohydrological and coupled processes between the carbon and water cycles of rubber plants.

AB A dominant mechanism for residual trapping of a nonwetting fluid in porous media during imbibition is snap-off or the disconnection of a continuous stream of the nonwetting fluid when it passes through pore constrictions and when a criterion based on capillary pressure imbalance is met. While quasi-static criteria for Roof snap-off have been defined for pores based on the imbalance between capillary pressure across the front/tail meniscus and local capillary pressure at the pore throat, and expressed in terms of pore body to pore throat ratio for simplification, we extended the previous quasi-static snap-off criterion by considering the local capillary pressure imbalance between the pore body and the pore throat for both circular and noncircular pores when the wetting film exists. We then used the criterion to analyze results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of multi-phase flow with supercritical CO2 as the nonwetting fluid and water as the wetting fluid. The extended criterion successfully described most situations we modeled. Furthermore, we compared fluid interface shape for a noncircular 3D pore predicted by the minimum surface energy (MSE) theory against 3D CFD simulations. While the fluid interface shape at the pore throat for 3D simulation was consistent with the shape predicted by MSE theory, the shape could not be successfully predicted by the MSE theory at the upstream and downstream pore body. Moreover, film flow existed for the noncircular pore at the downstream pore body. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We determined present-day (1981-2000) relationships between river network drainage density (D-d) and runoff (R), and between vegetation cover (V) and precipitation (P) across a contiguous 470,800 km(2) area (the Texas Gulf Coast basin), where P varies from 438 to 1280 mm/yr. D-d(R) follows a saturation-growth model which is similar to process-based equilibrium landscape models. V(P) follows a linear relationship. The models for D-d(R) and V(P) were used to assess how D-d and V might respond to decadal-scale climate changes in R and P anomalies predicted by a regional climate model between 2041-2060 and 1981-2000. The regional climate model, CRCM, was forced following the SAES A2 emissions scenario. Our calculations indicate a tendency of 57,500 km of active river channels to drying up, representing 9.9% of the present-day total of 581,985 km, due to future decrease in R. This will be accompanied by a loss of 8150 km(2) in V due to decrease in P. This study extends empirical studies of relationships between climate and landscape properties and explicitly links observations with process-based models. The results provide a simple framework for modeling potential trajectories of the landscape due to climate change. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A process-based coupled model of surface-subsurface flow is applied to the simulation of nonlinear hydrological dynamics for an experimental mountain headwater catchment in northeastern Italy. The comparison between measured and simulated responses, both distributed (water table and soil moisture) and integrated (streamflow at the outlet), shows that the model satisfactorily reproduces various nonlinear processes, in particular threshold behavior and hysteresis in the catchment storage-discharge relationship. We typically observe a clockwise loop in this relationship, i.e., streamflow response is faster than groundwater and soil moisture response, due to larger time scales for subsurface processes and to soil moisture persistence and redistribution. The model is based on a standard Richards equation representation of integrated saturated-unsaturated-runoff dynamics and needs no ad hoc parameterization (e.g., for macropores, pipe flow, or retention curve hysteresis) to capture observed hysteretic relationships between storage and discharge. Additional numerical experiments are carried out to investigate how heterogeneity (bedrock permeability and the distinction between riparian and hillslope areas) and aquifer thickness and topography affect this nonlinear dynamics. The results show that catchment topography and soil depth exert the main control on the hysteresis and threshold patterns. This is evident from a spatial analysis of streamflow and water table response times to storm events, where the threshold points correspond to changes in terrain slope. These findings are confirmed by a further set of analyses carried out on an idealized v-shaped catchment.

AB In order to investigate the influence of the soil vertical nonhomogeneity on the dynamics of the water in the upper soil layer, an analytical solution of the linearized Richards equation was derived. Here the hydraulic conductivity K-s at saturation is assumed to decrease exponentially with depth, in accordance with field data reported in the literature and collected during our surveys in mountain catchments. Gardner's constitutive laws were assumed for the hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics K( s) and Psi( s). The resulting one- dimensional Richards equation is linear, and its coefficients decrease exponentially with depth. An analytical solution was found by using the method of Laplace transform and compared with some test cases both analytically and numerically. The soil water content profile exhibits a maximum at one point in the domain. Moreover, it accounts for a different behavior in the water dynamics, depending on the prevailing role of diffusive effects, related to the soil water retention, or of the transport effects, related to the hydraulic conductivity profile.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ONE-DIMENSIONAL INFILTRATION; MODEL; SOIL; MOVEMENT
AB A series solution which expresses the moisture profiles and surface fluxes during infiltration and exfiltration is derived. The solution applies for conditions of fixed surface moisture content and uniform initial moisture content within an unbounded, homogeneous, nonhysteretic soil column. The series derivation is similar to J. R. Philip's but with a transformed time variable. The series converges for infiltration problems involving soils which exhibit steep increase in capillary pressure near saturation. Under these conditions the solution captures the transition from early square root of time behavior to the longtime traveling wave solution without the use of approximate joining techniques. The soil water retention models for which convergence occurs include the widely applied Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten models, with minor restrictions on the shape parameters of the latter. Other cases examined include infiltration and exfiltration assuming power law, linear, quadratic, and constant dependence of diffusivity and conductivity on moisture content. For these cases the convergence limits were finite. The solution is particularly well suited for infiltration into sandy soils, for which the transition between short-time and longtime behavior occurs relatively early.

AB Direction and depths of hyporheic exchange fluxes at the groundwater - surface water interface are drivers of biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient cycling and water quality. Model concepts on the dynamic relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and exchange depth are typically based on the assumption of a linear relationship between both measures. Here, we quantify seasonal and episodic variations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths with methods of heat tracing. Numerically (FLUX-BOT) and analytically (VFLUX; method based on temperature amplitude dampening developed by Hatch et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005wr004787) working program scripts were used to solve the one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion equation and compute hyporheic flux rates from three vertical sediment water temperature profiles recorded continuously in a small low mountain creek between 2011 and 2017. By comparing the behavior of two differing water temperature-based modeling approaches, dissimilarities in the sensitivity to sediment thermal properties were identified. Besides the differences in parameter responsivity differences in how the temperature data is incorporated, explain deviating behavior of the models regarding exchange flux and depth calculations. We show that the vertical extension of hyporheic exchange depth has a distinctive seasonal pattern over seven years, which differs according to the positioning in the riffle-pool-sequence. Surface water levels, groundwater levels and stream discharges show significant correlations with both flux direction and hyporheic zone extension. Temperature derived flux data allowed for establishing a significant relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths.

TI Topographic relationships for design rainfalls over Australia

   dependence; Elevation scaling; Knots; Data transformation
ID SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; EXTREME RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; ELEVATION; SCALE
AB Design rainfall statistics are the primary inputs used to assess flood risk across river catchments. These statistics normally take the form of Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves that are derived from extreme value probability distributions fitted to observed daily, and sub-daily, rainfall data. The design rainfall relationships are often required for catchments where there are limited rainfall records, particularly catchments in remote areas with high topographic relief and hence some form of interpolation is required to provide estimates in these areas. This paper assesses the topographic dependence of rainfall extremes by using elevation-dependent thin plate smoothing splines to interpolate the mean annual maximum rainfall, for periods from one to seven days, across Australia. The analyses confirm the important impact of topography in explaining the spatial patterns of these extreme rainfall statistics. Continent-wide residual and cross validation statistics are used to demonstrate the 100-fold impact of elevation in relation to horizontal coordinates in explaining the spatial patterns, consistent with previous rainfall scaling studies and observational evidence. The impact of the complexity of the fitted spline surfaces, as defined by the number of knots, and the impact of applying variance stabilising transformations to the data, were also assessed. It was found that a relatively large number of 3570 knots, suitably chosen from 8619 gauge locations, was required to minimise the summary error statistics. Square root and log data transformations were found to deliver marginally superior continent-wide cross validation statistics, in comparison to applying no data transformation, but detailed assessments of residuals in complex high rainfall regions with high topographic relief showed that no data transformation gave superior performance in these regions. These results are consistent with the understanding that in areas with modest topographic relief, as for most of the Australian continent, extreme rainfall is closely aligned with elevation, but in areas with high topographic relief the impacts of topography on rainfall extremes are more complex. The interpolated extreme rainfall statistics, using no data transformation, have been used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to produce new IDF data for the Australian continent. The comprehensive methods presented for the evaluation of gridded design rainfall statistics will be useful for similar studies, in particular the importance of balancing the need for a continentally-optimum solution that maintains sufficient definition at the local scale.

ID MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; SURFACE-WATER; GROUNDWATER
AB Integrated management of surface water and groundwater can provide efficient and flexible use of water by making the best use of the properties of different types of water resources. Integrated cyclical water management can help adaptation to climate variation and uncertainty by varying the proportion of surface water and groundwater allocations over time in response to changing water availability. Water use entitlements and rules specify conditions for the use, storage and exchange of surface water and groundwater. These entitlements and rules provide certainty for water users, investors and managers. Entitlements and rules also need to be flexible to enable users and managers to respond to changing water availability and knowledge. Arrangements to provide certainty and flexibility can conflict. For example guarantees of specific long-term allocations of water, or shares of allocations can conflict with arrangements to bank water underground during wet periods and then to use an increased amount of groundwater in dry periods. Systems of water entitlements and rules need to achieve a balance between certainty and flexibility. This article explores the effect of water entitlements and rules, and arrangements to provide certainty and flexibility for the integration of surface water and groundwater management over time. The analysis draws on case studies from the Namoi River basin in New South Wales and the South Platte River basin in Colorado. Integrated cyclical water management requires a comprehensive, flexible and balanced system of water entitlements and rules that allow extended water carryover, water banking, aquifer storage and recovery over the wet and dry climate cycle. Opportunities for extended carryover and aquifer storage and recovery over the wet and dry climate cycle merit further consideration in New South Wales, Colorado and other jurisdictions.

AB Risk-based planning offers a robust way to identify strategies that permit adaptive water resources management under climate change. This paper presents a flexible methodology for conducting climate change risk assessments involving reservoir operations. Decision makers can apply this methodology to their systems by selecting future periods and risk metrics relevant to their planning questions and by collectively evaluating system impacts relative to an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (weighted or not). This paper shows multiple applications of this methodology in a case study involving California's Central Valley Project and State Water Project systems. Multiple applications were conducted to show how choices made in conducting the risk assessment, choices known as analytical design decisions, can affect assessed risk. Specifically, risk was reanalyzed for every choice combination of two design decisions: (1) whether to assume climate change will influence flood-control constraints on water supply operations (and how), and (2) whether to weight climate change scenarios (and how). Results show that assessed risk would motivate different planning pathways depending on decision-maker attitudes toward risk (e. g., risk neutral versus risk averse). Results also show that assessed risk at a given risk attitude is sensitive to the analytical design choices listed above, with the choice of whether to adjust flood-control rules under climate change having considerably more influence than the choice on whether to weight climate scenarios.

AB Game theory provides a useful framework for studying Multi-Criteria Decision Making problems. This paper suggests modeling Multi-Criteria Decision Making problems as strategic games and solving them using non-cooperative game theory concepts. The suggested method can be used to prescribe non-dominated solutions and also can be used as a method to predict the outcome of a decision making problem. Non-cooperative stability definitions for solving the games allow consideration of non-cooperative behaviors, often neglected by other methods which assume perfect cooperation among decision makers. To deal with the uncertainty in input variables a Monte-Carlo Game Theory (MCGT) approach is suggested which maps the stochastic problem into many deterministic strategic games. The games are solved using non-cooperative stability definitions and the results include possible effects of uncertainty in input variables on outcomes. The method can handle multi-criteria multi-decision-maker problems with uncertainty. The suggested method does not require criteria weighting, developing a compound decision objective, and accurate quantitative (cardinal) information as it simplifies the decision analysis by solving problems based on qualitative (ordinal) information, reducing the computational burden substantially. The MCGT method is applied to analyze California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta problem. The suggested method provides insights, identifies non-dominated alternatives, and predicts likely decision outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] Individual contributions of capillarity and adsorptive surface forces to the matric potential are seldom differentiated in determination of soil water characteristic (SWC) curves. Typically, capillary forces dominate at the wet end, whereas adsorptive surface forces dominate at the dry end of a SWC where water is held as thin liquid films. The amount of adsorbed soil water is intimately linked to soil specific surface area ( SA) and plays an important role in various biological and transport processes in arid environments. Dominated by van der Waals adsorptive forces, surface-water interactions give rise to a nearly universal scaling relationship for SWC curves at low water contents. We demonstrate that scaling measured water content at the dry end by soil specific surface area yields remarkable similarity across a range of soil textures and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on van der Waals interactions. These scaling relationships are important for accurate description of SWC curves in dry soils and may provide rapid and reliable estimates of soil specific surface area from SWC measurements for matric potentials below - 10 MPa conveniently measured with the chilled-mirror dew point technique. Surface area estimates acquired by fitting the scaling relationship to measured SWC data were in good agreement with SA data measured by standard methods. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed method could provide reliable SA estimates for natural soils with hydratable surface areas smaller than 200 m(2)/g.

TI Evaluating the non-stationary relationship between precipitation and

AB In this paper, the trends of the annual streamflow and precipitation and cross correlations between them were analyzed in nine large river basins of China during 1956-2005. The results indicate that: (1) the annual mean streamflow decreases in arid and semi-arid regions of north China; however, increasing trends occur in south and Southwest China; (2) the annual streamflow and precipitation exhibit reasonable correlation in nine large river basins except those located in inland areas. The annual streamflow over most areas of China is fed by precipitation; however, the decline in streamflow is faster than the decreases of precipitation since 1970s in the arid and semi-arid regions of north China. The relationship between the annual precipitation and streamflow presents a non-stationary state in north China. This non-stationary relationship is strongly influenced by both human activities and precipitation changes; (3) a significant increase of water use might be the major factor responsible for the steeper decline in streamflow than in precipitation in Haihe River, Yellow River and Songliao River basins in north China. In inland river areas, increase of water use and actual evapotranspiration might result in decline in streamflow although precipitation has an increase tendency. This paper sheds light on the non-stationary relationship between annual precipitation and streamflow and possible underlying causes, which will be helpful for a better understanding of the changes of precipitation and streamflow in China at large scale and in other regions of the world.

AB A vadose zone field injection experiment was conducted in the summer of 2000 at the Hanford Site, Washington. The unique moisture content (theta) database is used to identify the lithology at the field site and to interpret, visualize, and quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of the three-dimensional (3-D) moisture plume created by the injection experiment. We conducted a hierarchical geostatistical analysis to examine the large-scale geologic structure for the entire field site and then investigated small-scale features within different layers. Afterward, variogram analysis was applied to the q field measured for seven different days during the injection experiment. Temporal variations of sills and ranges are related to the observed moisture plume dynamics. A visualization of the 3-D moisture plume evolution illustrates effects of media heterogeneity. Statistics of changes in moisture content as a function of distance reveal large variance near the wetting front; the coefficient of variation increases with decreasing mean. These findings support the gradient- and mean-dependent variability in the moisture content distribution as reported by existing stochastic theories. Spatial moment analysis is also conducted to quantify the rate and direction of movement of the plume mass center and its spatial spreading. The ratio of horizontal to vertical spreading at varying moisture contents suggests moisture-dependent anisotropy in effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, confirming existing stochastic theories. However, the principal directions of the spatial moments are found to vary as the moisture plume evolves through local heterogeneity, a feature that has not been recognized in the theories.

AB The investigation of throughfall patterns has received considerable interest over the last decades. And yet, the geographical bias of pertinent previous studies and their methodologies and approaches to data analysis cast a doubt on the general validity of claims regarding spatial and temporal patterns of throughfall. We employed 220 collectors in a 1-ha plot of semideciduous tropical rain forest in Panama and sampled throughfall during a period of 14 months. Our analysis of spatial patterns is based on 60 data sets, whereas the temporal analysis comprises 91 events. Both data sets show skewed frequency distributions. When skewness arises from large outliers, the classical, nonrobust variogram estimator overestimates the sill variance and, in some cases, even induces spurious autocorrelation structures. In these situations, robust variogram estimation techniques offer a solution. Throughfall in our plot typically displayed no or only weak spatial autocorrelations. In contrast, temporal correlations were strong, that is, wet and dry locations persisted over consecutive wet seasons. Interestingly, seasonality and hence deciduousness had no influence on spatial and temporal patterns. We argue that if throughfall patterns are to have any explanatory power with respect to patterns of near-surface processes, data analytical artifacts must be ruled out lest spurious correlation be confounded with causality; furthermore, temporal stability over the domain of interest is essential.

AB Estimation of suspended sediment concentration carried by a river is very important for many water resources projects. The accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANN) with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is investigated in this paper for modeling discharge-suspended sediment relationship. The ANN-ABC was compared with those of the neural differential evolution, adaptive neuro-fuzzy, neural networks and rating curve models. The daily stream flow and suspended sediment concentration data from two stations, Rio Valenciano Station and Quebrada Blanca Station, were used as case studies. For evaluating the ability of the models, mean square error and determination coefficient criteria were used. Comparison results showed that the ANN-ABC was able to produce better results than the neural differential evolution, neuro-fuzzy, neural networks and rating curve models. The logarithm transformed data were also used as input to the proposed ANN-ABC models. It was found that the logarithm transform significantly increased accuracy of the models in suspended sediment estimation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Whilst all ecosystems must obey the second law of thermodynamics, these physical bounds and controls on ecosystem evolution and development are largely ignored across the ecohydrological literature. To unravel the importance of these underlying restraints on ecosystem form and function, and their power to inform our scientific understanding, we have calculated the entropy budget of a range of peat ecosystems. We hypothesize that less disturbed peatlands are 'near equilibrium' with respect to the second law of thermodynamics and thus respond to change by minimizing entropy production. This 'near equilibrium' state is best achieved by limiting evaporative losses. Alternatively, peatlands 'far-from-equilibrium' respond to a change in energy inputs by maximizing entropy production which is best achieved by increasing evapotranspiration. To test these alternatives this study examined the energy balance time series from seven peatlands across a disturbance gradient. We estimate the entropy budgets for each and determine how a change in net radiation (Delta R-n) was transferred to a change in latent heat flux (Delta lambda E). The study showed that: (i) The transfer of net radiation to latent heat differed significantly between peatlands. One group transferred up to 64% of the change in net radiation to a change in latent heat flux, while the second transferred as little as 27%. (ii) Sites that transferred the most energy to latent heat flux were those that produced the greatest entropy. The study shows that an ecosystem could be 'near equilibrium' rather than 'far from equilibrium'.

AB The phenomenon of freezing point depression in frozen soils results in the co-existence of ice and liquid water in soil pores at temperatures below 273.15 K (0 degrees C), and is thought to have two causes: (a) capillary and adsorption effects, where the phase transition relationship is modified due to soil-air-water-ice interactions, and (b) solute effects, where the presence of salts lowers the freezing temperature. The soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC) characterizes the relationship between liquid water content and temperature in frozen soils. Most hydrological models represent the SFC using only capillary and adsorption effects with a relationship known as the Generalized Clapeyron Equation (GCE). In this study, we develop and test a salt exclusion model for characterizing the SFC, comparing this with the GCE-based model and a combined salt-GCE effect model. We test these models against measured SFCs in laboratory and field experiments with diverse soil textures and salinities. We consistently found that the GCE-based models under-predicted freezing-point depression. We were able to match the observations with the salt exclusion model and the combined model, suggesting that salinity is a dominant control on the SFC in real soils that always contain solutes. In modeling applications where the salinity is unknown, the soil bulk solute concentration can be treated as a single fitting parameter. Improved characterization of the SFC may result in improvements in coupled mass-heat transport models for simulating hydrological processes in cold regions, particularly the hydraulic properties of frozen soils and the hydraulic head in frozen soils that drives cryosuction.

AB Statistical models relating anthropogenic modifications of the watershed landscape to alterations in streamflow are often plagued by heterogeneity in background watershed conditions and coinciding trends in climate that can complicate the interpretation of clear statistical relationships. This study introduces the use of panel regression as a modeling approach that can better accommodate basin heterogeneity and identify more robust signals between anthropogenic impacts on the watershed landscape and hydrologic response. Panel regression techniques pool multidimensional data recorded across individuals (i.e., watersheds) and through time to better characterize within- and between-variability in the hydrologic data set. The separate attribution of variability to both time and space dimensions enables the method to better identify response characteristics that are generalizable across watersheds. This study introduces in detail two broad classes of panel regression models (the fixed effects and random effects models) that may be particularly useful in the context of identifying and quantifying the impact of human-induced landscape alterations on hydrologic response. The technique is presented in a case study relating watershed urbanization to changes in the annual runoff coefficient for 19 watersheds in the Northeast United States. Comparisons are made against more standard cross-sectional and time-based regression analyses. The results show that the estimated relationship between urbanization and the annual runoff coefficient in this region is highly dependent on the dimensions of data examined (space or time) and model structure selected, with the most sophisticated and appropriate model suggesting that no significant relationship can be detected.

AB We assess the effects of prospective climate change until 2100 on water management of two major reservoirs of Iran, namely, Dez (3.34x10(9)m(3)) and Alavian (6x10(7)m(3)). We tune the Poly-Hydro model suited for simulation of hydrological cycle in high altitude snow-fed catchments. We assess optimal operation rules (ORs) for the reservoirs using three algorithms under dynamic and static operation and linear and non-linear decision rules during control run (1990-2010 for Dez and 2000-2010 for Alavian). We use projected climate scenarios (plus statistical downscaling) from three general circulation models, EC-Earth, CCSM4, and ECHAM6, and three emission scenarios, or representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, for a grand total of nine scenarios, to mimic evolution of the hydrological cycle under future climate until 2100. We subsequently test the ORs under the future hydrological scenarios (at half century and end of century) and the need for reoptimization. Poly-Hydro model when benchmarked against historical data well mimics the hydrological budget of both catchments, including the main processes of evapotranspiration and streamflows. Teaching-learning-based optimization delivers the best performance in both reservoirs according to objective scores and is used for future operation. Our projections in Dez catchment depict decreased precipitation along the XXI century, with -1% on average (of the nine scenarios) at half century and -6% at the end of century, with changes in streamflows on average -7% yearly and -13% yearly, respectively. In Alavian, precipitation would decrease by -10% on average at half century and -13% at the end of century, with streamflows -14% yearly and -18% yearly, respectively. Under the projected future hydrology, reservoirs' operation would provide lower performance (i.e., larger lack of water) than now, especially for Alavian dam. Our results provide evidence of potentially decreasing water availability and less effective water management in water stressed areas like Northern Iran here during this century.

AB Topographic redistribution of water has been represented by various terrain metrics (e.g., topographic wetness index, slope, and upslope accumulated area). This type of landscape characterization has promoted the use of terrain metrics to inform how spatial patterns of soil volumetric water content (VWC) influence streamflow, ecological processes, and associated nutrient fluxes. However, evaluation of what these static terrain metrics reflect has only been accomplished in a few catchments. Additionally, previous research suggests that relationships between topographic metrics and VWC could be different across catchments through time. Here we measured VWC from snowmelt through summer drydown across a semiarid montane catchment. Using a spatially nested sampling design, we assessed the spatiotemporal variability of VWC from plot (tens of meters) to landscape scales (hundreds of meters). Variance of riparian area VWC increased as the catchment dried, while upland variance decreased, highlighting the utility of delineating distinct landscape units when considering spatial variability of moisture, rather than calculating statistics across the landscape as a whole. In contrast to previous research, we found that the relationship between VWC and topographic metrics persisted through the dry catchment state, suggesting that patterns of topographic redistribution of water during snowmelt continued to influence dry season VWC despite variability in plot scale vertical processes (e.g., evapotranspiration). Future research should focus on resolving the relationship between catchment moisture state and VWC variability as a function of wetness state, seasonality, and magnitude of precipitation, topography, and soil depth.

AB Data assimilation and regression are two commonly used methods for combining models and remote sensing observations to estimate agricultural productivity. Data assimilation is a generative approach because it requires explicit approximations of a Bayesian prior and likelihood to compute a probability density function of biomass conditional on observations, and regression is discriminative because it models the conditional biomass density function directly. Both of these methods typically approximate Bayes' law and therefore cannot be expected to be perfectly efficient at extracting information from remote sensing observations. In this paper we measure information in observations using Shannon's theory and define missing information, used information, and bad information as partial divergences from the true Bayesian posterior (biomass conditional on observations). These concepts were applied to directly measure the amount and quality of information about end-of-season biomass extracted from observations by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). Results suggest that the simpler discriminative approach can be as efficient as the more complex generative approach in terms of extracting high quality information from observations, and may therefore be better suited to dealing with the practical problems associated with remote sensed data (e.g., sub-footprint scale heterogeneity). Our method for analyzing information use has many potential applications: approximations of Bayes' law are used regularly in predictive models of environmental systems of all kinds, and the efficiency of such approximations has heretofore not been directly measured.

ID TEMPORAL EVOLUTION; DOWNSTREAM; EROSION; HYDRAULICS
AB Scour processes caused by plunging jets are particularly important in hydraulic engineering because of the connected risk of structural failure. Therefore, many investigations have been conducted on this topic, focusing on jet-induced scour under constant flow discharge (i.e., steady case). Yet, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have analyzed the scour mechanism under variable jet discharge (i.e., unsteady case) and clear-water conditions. Following recent theoretical advancements on scour phenomena for steady cases based on the phenomenological theory of turbulence, we address in this study the general validity of such an approach for time-dependent (i.e., unsteady) jet inflow conditions, in non-cohesive soils. Results show that scour evolution is consistent with that obtained for steady jet flows. In particular, they confirm the existence of two distinct phases-developing and developed-and indicate that the transition time between the two phases does not depend on the jet inflow characteristics. Once again, this study confirms that the phenomenological theory of turbulence is a valid tool for all jet-driven scour problems.

AB The authors present a statistical procedure to estimate the probability distributions of storm characteristics. The approach uses recent advances in stochastic hydrological modeling. The temporal dynamics of rainfall are modeled via a reward alternating renewal process that describes wet and dry phases of storms. In particular, the wet phase is modeled as a rectangular pulse process with dependent random duration and intensity; the global dependence structure is described using multidimensional copulas. The marginal distributions are described by Generalized Pareto laws. The authors derive both the storm volume statistics and the rainfall volume distribution within a fixed temporal window preceding a storm. Based on these results, they calculate the antecedent moisture conditions. The paper includes a thorough discussion of the validity of the assumptions and approximations introduced, and an application to actual rainfall data. The models presented here have important implications for improved design procedures of water resources and hydrologic systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we present new random walk methods to solve flow and transport problems in saturated/unsaturated porous media, including coupled flow and transport processes in soils, heterogeneous systems modeled through random hydraulic conductivity and recharge fields, processes at the field and regional scales. The numerical schemes are based on global random walk algorithms (GRW) which approximate the solution by moving large numbers of computational particles on regular lattices according to specific random walk rules. To cope with the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation and of the coupled system, we implemented the GRW algorithms by employing linearization techniques similar to the L-scheme developed in finite element/volume approaches. The resulting GRW L-schemes converge with the number of iterations and provide numerical solutions that are first-order accurate in time and second-order in space. A remarkable property of the flow and transport GRW solutions is that they are practically free of numerical diffusion. The GRW solvers are validated by comparisons with mixed finite element and finite volume solvers in one-and two-dimensional benchmark problems. They include Richards' equation fully coupled with the advection-diffusion-reaction equation and capture the transition from unsaturated to saturated flow regimes.

AB This paper considers overland flow resistance at low Reynolds numbers through analysis of experimental runs carried out using water only and water/glycerol mixtures. We first examined the power relationship between the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f and the Reynolds number Re to obtain the values of the K coefficient and b exponent. These results confirmed the applicability of the values of b suggested in literature, while K required a specific calibration for laminar open-channel flows. The analysis revealed that transition from a laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows occurred at a threshold value of Re equal to 500 as described historically. The estimate of f by the power relationship and the calibrated b and K values were reliable for water only runs when Re >= 500. The measurements were also used to test a theoretical flow resistance law based on a power-velocity distribution. The calibrated theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter gamma(v), bed slope, flow Froude number and Re enabled a good estimate off for water flows. For mixed fluid flows, the effect of the velocity profile shape was considered calibrating this relationship by two datasets obtained setting a threshold Reynolds number equal to 7. For flows with Re < 7, the shape of the velocity profile can be linear or convex while for flows at Re >= 7 the shape of the velocity distribution is always concave. The theoretical flow resistance allowed an accurate estimate also for mixed fluid flows, even at Re < 7. The different shape of the power-velocity distribution highlighted that mixed flows behave differently as compared to water only flows.

AB This paper concerns a new modeling approach to multicomponent NAPL dissolution and transport, based on analytic solutions and Laguerre series. This approach allows virtually any of the numerous existing 1-D analytic transport solutions in the literature to be coupled with arbitrary boundary conditions stemming from nonlinear NAPL dissolution, as dictated by Raoult's Law. A computer implementation of this approach to coupled dissolution and transport in parallel fractureswhich no other screening tool known to the authors coversis presented. This is verified against an existing analytic transport solution that assumes a constant boundary condition. Subsequently, the model is demonstrated via a study of separation of PAH and phenolic plumes generated by dissolution of creosote, using the new computer implementation. The PAH and phenolic constituents of creosote strongly differ in both their dissolution and their transport behavior, and this is shown to necessitate the use of a tool that can account for both processes, such as the one developed here. We also find the possibility of PAH and phenolic plumes becoming entirely disjoint.

AB For a high-velocity stable flow through a periodic corrugated channel representing an element of porous medium, we suggest splitting the overall nonlinear macroscopic effects into two kinds of different physical origin: a pure inertia effect produced by the convective term of Navier Stokes equations and an inertia-viscous cross effect representing a variation of the viscous dissipation due to a streamline deformation by inertia forces. We will show that the inertia-viscous cross effects may be revealed by simulating a periodic flow, whilst the pure inertia effects are produced by the microscale flow nonperiodicity. We will reveal the individual flow law for each nonlinear component and analyze the relative role of both components numerically by using the finite element method applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Both the pure inertia and the inertia-viscous cross effects are revealed to be exponential prior to quadratic or cubic ones. The influence of the dead volume is analyzed. The inertia-viscous cross phenomena are shown to be negligible when the flow structure is clearly nonperiodic. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a time domain random walk approach for conservative solute transport in heterogeneous media where medium properties vary over a distribution of length scales. The spatial transition lengths are equal to the heterogeneity length scales, and thus determined by medium geometry. We derive analytical expressions for the associated transition times and probabilities in one spatial dimension. This approach determines the coarsegrained solute concentration at the interfaces between regions; we derive a generalized master equation for the evolution of the coarse-grained concentration and reconstruct the fine-scale concentration using the propagator of the subscale transport mechanism. The performance of this approach is demonstrated for diffusion under random retardation in power-law media characterized by heavy-tailed lengthscale and retardation distributions. The coarse representation preserves the correct late-time scaling of concentration variance, and the reconstructed fine-scale concentration is essentially identical to that obtained by direct numerical simulation by random walk particle tracking.

AB An equation describing flow in an open channel with obstacles is derived, following the conservation of momentum approach used by Manger and St. Venant. When the obstacles are all submerged the result yields the Darcy-Weisbach equation for turbulent flow in pipes and open channels. When the obstacles are only partially submerged the result leads to the governing equation in a porous medium. If the flow is turbulent the square of the velocity is proportional to the hydraulic gradient and if the flow is laminar, which is the usual case, the velocity is proportional to the hydraulic gradient. This last result is in agreement with Darcy's law in porous media. Thus our equation interpolates between and reduces to, the two fundamental results of Darcy. In general our equation should prove useful in practice for open flow in a channel with both submerged and emerging obstacles. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial variation of soil moisture over very small areas (<100 m(2)) can have nonlinear impacts on cycling and flux rates resulting in bias if it is not considered, but measuring this variation is difficult over extensive temporal and spatial scales. Most studies examining spatial variation of soil moisture were conducted at hillslope (0.01 km(2)) to multi-catchment spatial scales (1000 km(2)). They found the greatest variation at mid wetness levels and the smallest variation at wet and dry wetness levels forming a concave down relationship. There is growing evidence that concave down relationships formed between spatial variation of soil moisture and average soil moisture are consistent across spatial scales spanning several orders of magnitude, but more research is needed at very small, plot scales (<100 m(2)). The goal of this study was to characterise spatial variation in shallow soil moisture at the plot scale by relating the mean of measurements collected in a plot to the standard deviation (SD). We combined data from a previous study with thousands of new soil moisture measurements from 212 plots in eight catchments distributed across the US Mid-Atlantic Region to (1) test for a generalisable mean-SD relationship at plot scales, (2) characterise how landcover, land use, season, and hillslope position contribute to differences in mean-SD relationships, and (3) use these generalised mean-SD relationships to quantify their impacts on catchment scale nitrification and denitrification potential. Our study found that 98% of all measurements formed a generalised mean-SD relationship like those observed at hillslope and catchment spatial scales. The remaining 2% of data comprised a mean-SD relationship with greater spatial variation that originated from two riparian plots reported in a previous study. Incorporating the generalised mean-SD relationship into estimates of nitrification and denitrification potential revealed strong bias that was even greater when incorporating mean-SD observations from the two riparian plots with significantly greater spatial variation.

AB Water resource management (WRM) through dams or reservoirs is worldwide necessary to support key human-related activities, ranging from hydropower production to water allocation and flood risk mitigation. Designing of reservoir operations aims primarily to fulfill the main purpose (or purposes) for which the structure has been built. However, it is well known that reservoirs strongly influence river geomorphic processes, causing sediment deficits downstream, altering water, and sediment fluxes, leading to riverbed incision and causing infrastructure instability and ecological degradation. We propose a framework that, by combining physically based modeling, surrogate modeling techniques, and multiobjective (MO) optimization, allows to include fluvial geomorphology into MO optimization whose main objectives are the maximization of hydropower revenue and the minimization of riverbed degradation. The case study is a run-of-the-river power plant on the River Po (Italy). A 1-D mobile-bed hydro-morphological model simulated the riverbed evolution over a 10 year horizon for alternatives operation rules of the power plant. The knowledge provided by such a physically based model is integrated into a MO optimization routine via surrogate modeling using the response surface methodology. Hence, this framework overcomes the high computational costs that so far hindered the integration of river geomorphology into WRM. We provided numerical proof that river morphologic processes and hydropower production are indeed in conflict but that the conflict may be mitigated with appropriate control strategies.

AB [1] This work aims at modeling quantitatively the effects of a mulch on the water and heat transfers in the soil-mulch-atmosphere system. The developed model TECmulch derives from the mechanistic model TEC, designed for bare soil. TECmulch accounts for ( 1) free convection, ( 2) forced convection, and ( 3) radiative transfer in the mulch. The mulch formalism does not rely on the classical local gradients theory but on long-distance exchanges. It is based on four parameters that are calibrated on experimental data for two different mulches ( corn residue and crushed glass). Experimental data come from la Tinaja's station ( Mexico) for corn mulch and Avignon's station ( France) for glass mulch. Measurements concern the physical characterization of the soil and the mulch, the evolution of soil water content and temperature, and the radiative balance plus usual climatic data. TECmulch is validated on independent data, compared to the classical theory, and each modeled process is analyzed in detail.

AB A continent-wide classification study of Australian catchments was undertaken to group drainage basins with comparable flow characteristics based on forty metrics from the themes of climate, topography, surface condition and hydrogeology. A principal component analysis reduced the multi-collinear indices to nine principal components (PCs). A fuzzy c-means cluster analysis on the PCs resulted in the delineation of eight subcatchment clusters with similar physiography, and 82.5% of subcatchments displaying a membership coefficient greater than 0.7. Subcatchments with poor cluster membership levels may be significant in highlighting complexity in the interaction between climatic controls and local geomorphological and land use variability. The clusters are distinguished by different attributes in several key subcatchment variables and each group is described in terms of its flow and flood profile. These interpretations are supported by separately derived streamflow signatures from gauged catchments. Cluster and PC distribution mapping revealed distinct spatial and drainage relationships between the subcatchments relevant to the assessment of flood behaviour. The spatial pattern of the river basin regionalisation via physical catchment similarity closely resembles the modified Ko center dot ppen climate classification, with differences highlighting the importance of non-climate characteristics on streamflow behaviour in Australia. The catchment classification is an Australia-wide regionalisation scheme, incorporating datasets with disparate spatial distribution and ungauged subcatchments. This study therefore provides the framework for more detailed streamflow analysis by applying consistent methods across all catchments in Australia, and has implications for flood risk prediction, mitigation and planning.

TI A two-phase SPH model for massive sediment motion in free surface flows

AB Massive sediment motion in water with a free surface is an important kind of geophysical flows such as hyper-concentrated sediment laden river flows discharging into estuarine delta and turbidity currents generated by subaqueous landslides. One of the key and common characteristics of such flows is that interactions between water and sediment as well as those among sediment particles are equally important in affecting the sediment motion and the fluid flow. This paper presents a numerical model that builds on and extends an earlier two-phase SPH model based on a continuum formulation of solid-liquid mixtures (Shi et al., 2017) to provide a unified description of massive sediment motion in free surface flows. In the model, a constitutive law based on the rheology of dense granular flow is introduced to express the intergranular stresses while the interphase drag force is determined by combining the Ergun equation for dense solid-fluid mixtures and the power law for dilute suspensions. The proposed model is firstly applied to the study of collapse of loosely or densely packed granular columns submerged in water. The computed surface profiles of the granular column are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. It shows that the loosely packed and the densely packed columns behave rather differently due to the differences in water-sediment interaction processes. The model is then used to simulate a dam-break flow over a mobile sediment bed. The computed configurations of the flow and the movable bed also agree well with the measured data. The predicted position on the leading edge of the flow has a mean error of 0.8% while the mean error for the maximum bed height is 12.9%. To further identify the dynamic processes involved, effects of water-sediment interactions on the motion of bed materials are investigated by examining the spatial and temporal variations of pressure and flow velocity. As shown in the applications, the proposed two-phase SPH model can successfully represent both the gravity-driven underwater granular flows and the shear flow driven intense sediment transport, implying its potential use in practical scenarios in which the two kinds of flows exist simultaneously, such as landslides triggered by storm in shallow sea and flows resulted in barrier or dam breaks.

AB A new model of phytotoxicity of salt and plant salt uptake is presented and is coupled to an existing three-dimensional groundwater simulation model. The implementation of phytotoxicity and salt uptake relationships is based on experimental findings from willow trees grown in hydroponic solution. The data confirm an s-shaped phytotoxicity relationship as found in previous studies. Uptake data were explained assuming steady state salt concentration in plant roots, passive salt transport into the roots, and active enzymatic removal of salt from plant roots. On the one hand, transpiration strongly depends on groundwater salinity (phytotoxicity); on the other hand, transpiration significantly changes the groundwater salinity (uptake). This feedback loop generates interesting dynamic phenomena in hydrological systems that are dominated by transpiration and are influenced by significant salinity gradients. Generic simulations are performed for the Okavango island system and are shown to reproduce essential phenomena observed in nature.

AB Anomalous transport cannot be adequately described with classical Fickian advection-dispersion equations (ADE) with constant coefficients. Rather, fractional calculus models may be used, which capture salient features of anomalous transport (e.g., skewness and power law tails). FracFit is a parameter estimation tool based on space-fractional and time-fractional models used by the hydrology community. Currently, four fractional models are supported: (1) space-fractional advection-dispersion equation (sFADE), (2) time-fractional dispersion equation with drift (TFDE), (3) fractional mobile-immobile (FMIM) equation, and (4) temporally tempered Levy motion (TTLM). Model solutions using pulse initial conditions and continuous injections are evaluated using stable distributions or subordination integrals. Parameter estimates are extracted from measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) using a weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) algorithm. Optimal weights for BTCs for pulse initial conditions and continuous injections are presented. Two sample applications are analyzed: (1) pulse injection BTCs in the Selke River and (2) continuous injection laboratory experiments using natural organic matter. Model parameters are compared across models and goodness-of-fit metrics are presented, facilitating model evaluation.

AB Hysteresis in the capillary pressure-saturation relationship (P-c-S-w) for a porous medium has contributions from the complex geometry of the pore network as well as the physical chemistry of the grain surfaces. To isolate the role of wettability on hysteresis, we fabricated microfluidic cells that contain a single wedge-shaped channel that simulates a single pore throat. Using confocal microscopy of the three-dimensional interfaces under imbibition and drainage, we demonstrate an accurate balance between mechanical work and surface free energy that was evaluated using measured advancing and receding contact angles. The closed-loop mechanical work per surface water molecule is 95 kJ/mol, which is consistent with physisorption. Therefore, the hysteresis in the P-c-S-w relationship for a single pore throat is defined by advancing and receding contact angles that are controlled by dissipative surface adsorption chemistry.

AB We explore the performance of three types of stochastic models used for spatial rainfall downscaling and assess their ability to reproduce the statistics of precipitation fields observed during the GATE radar experiment. We consider a bounded multifractal cascade, an autoregressive linear process passed through a nonlinear static filter (sometimes called a meta-Gaussian model), and a model based on the presence of individual rainfall cells with power law profile. As test statistics we use the low-order moments of the amplitude distribution, the distribution of generalized fractal dimensions, the generalized scaling exponents, the slope of the power spectrum, and the properties of the spatial autocorrelation. The results of the analysis indicate that all models provide, on average, a satisfactory representation of the statistical properties of the GATE rainfall fields (including the anomalous scaling behavior), with a slightly better performance of the model based on individual rainfall cells. All models, however, display large scatter in the field-to-field comparison with the data. These results indicate that data analysis alone does not allow, at the moment, for preferring one downscaling approach over another.

AB Climate change has been concerned as a trigger of hydrologic changes around the world. Budyko framework was widely used in hydrologic sensitivity analyses on the steady-state water balance. The unsteady-state responses, for example the inter-annual hydrologic sensitivity, were not well investigated, especially for catchments influenced by croplands as that exist in Illinois in the United States. We propose a new hydrologic sensitivity framework for the unsteady-state condition, together with a new hydrological model, to investigate the impact of croplands on the hydrologic sensitivity. In addition to the Budyko-type relationship between the annual evapotranspiration ratio (E/P) and the aridity index (E-p/P), this framework incorporates the empirical relationship between the annual storage change ratio (Delta S/P) and E-p/P into sensitivity coefficients. The required data of annual E/P and Delta S/P could be obtained from observation and hydrological models. In particular, the bcd-alpha K model is newly developed from the existing bcd model in considering croplands in Illinois, which includes only five parameters while capturing major hydrological processes for catchments with croplands. Results show that the annual E/P, Delta S/P and Q/P in 12 studied catchments have significant linear relationships with E-p/P. The annual runoff is much more sensitive to the change in precipitation than to the change in potential evapotranspiration. The traditional steady-state analysis overestimates the sensitivity of the evapotranspiration to the change in the precipitation for the unsteady-state condition and underestimates the variability of sensitivity coefficients among catchments.

AB This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of the hydrological response in a small Mediterranean catchment (Cal Rod6). The first part of the analysis focuses on the rainfall-runoff relationship at seasonal and monthly scale, using an 8-year data set. Then, using storm-flow volume and coefficient, the temporal variability of the rainfall-runoff relationship and its relationship with several hydrological variables are analysed at the event scale from hydrographs observed over a 3-year period. Finally, the spatial non-linearity of the hydrological response is examined by comparing the Cal Rod6 hydrological response with the Can Vila sub-catchment response at the event scale. Results show that, on a seasonal and monthly scale, there is no simple relationship between rainfall and runoff depths, and that evapotranspiration is a factor that introduced some non-linearity in the rainfall-runoff relationship. The analysis of monthly values also reveals the existence of a threshold in the relationship between rainfall and runoff depths, denoting a more contrasted hydrological response than the one usually observed in humid catchments. At the event scale, the storm-flow coefficient has a clear seasonal pattern with an alternance between a wet period, when the catchment is hydrologically responsive, and a dry summer period, when the catchment is much less reactive to any rainfall. The relationship between the storm-flow coefficient and rainfall depth, rainfall maximum intensity and base-flow shows that observed correlations are the same as those observed for humid conditions, even if correlation coefficients are notably lower. Comparison with the Can Vila sub-catchment highlights the spatial heterogeneity of the rainfall-runoff relationship at the small catchment scale. Although interpretation in terms of runoff processes remains delicate, heterogeneities between the two catchments seem to be related to changes in the ratio between infiltration excess and saturation processes in runoff formation.

AB Y This paper is derived from a keynote talk given at the Google's 2020 Flood Forecasting Meets Machine Learning Workshop. Recent experiments applying deep learning to rainfall-runoff simulation indicate that there is significantly more information in large-scale hydrological data sets than hydrologists have been able to translate into theory or models. While there is a growing interest in machine learning in the hydrological sciences community, in many ways, our community still holds deeply subjective and nonevidence-based preferences for models based on a certain type of "process understanding" that has historically not translated into accurate theory, models, or predictions. This commentary is a call to action for the hydrology community to focus on developing a quantitative understanding of where and when hydrological process understanding is valuable in a modeling discipline increasingly dominated by machine learning. We offer some potential perspectives and preliminary examples about how this might be accomplished.

AB [1] Most cities rely on firm water supply capacity to meet demand, but increasing scarcity and supply costs are encouraging greater use of temporary transfers ( e. g., spot leases, options). This raises questions regarding how best to coordinate the use of these transfers in meeting cost and reliability objectives. This paper combines a hydrologic - water market simulation with an optimization approach to identify portfolios of permanent rights, options, and leases that minimize the expected costs of meeting a city's annual demand with a specified reliability. Spot market prices are linked to hydrologic conditions and described by monthly lease price distributions which are used to price options via a risk-neutral approach. Monthly choices regarding when and how much water to acquire through temporary transfers are made on the basis of anticipatory decision rules related to the ratio of expected supply to expected demand. The simulation is linked with an algorithm that uses an implicit filtering search method designed for solution surfaces that exhibit high-frequency, low-amplitude noise. This simulation-optimization approach is applied to a region that currently supports an active water market, with results suggesting that temporary transfers can reduce expected water supply costs substantially, while still maintaining high reliability. Also evaluated are trade-offs between expected costs and cost variability that occur with variation in a portfolio's distribution of rights, options, and leases.

AB Quantitative hydrogeophysical studies rely heavily on petrophysical relationships that link geophysical properties to hydrogeological properties and state variables. Coupled inversion studies are frequently based on the questionable assumption that these relationships are perfect (i.e., no scatter). Using synthetic examples and crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data from the South Oyster Bacterial Transport Site in Virginia, USA, we investigate the impact of spatially-correlated petrophysical uncertainty on inferred posterior porosity and hydraulic conductivity distributions and on Bayes factors used in Bayesian model selection. Our study shows that accounting for petrophysical uncertainty in the inversion (I) decreases bias of the inferred variance of hydrogeological subsurface properties, (II) provides more realistic uncertainty assessment and (III) reduces the overconfidence in the ability of geophysical data to falsify conceptual hydrogeological models.

AB Information on how large-scale forest changes affect water resources is important in China as country-wide reforestation programs are being implemented and concerns have arisen over possible water reduction. In this study, water budget analysis and statistical methods were used to assess the effects of significant forest recovery on river discharge at Guangdong Province based on 50 years of data. We used realized water yield (RWY) as a balance term between the outflows from and inflows to the province to represent the river discharge produced solely in Guangdong Province. The relationship between forest recovery and RWY was inferred after quantitatively examining other contributing variables including precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, development of impervious areas, human water consumption, and reservoir constructions. We applied time series analysis to test the statistical relationship between forest recovery and RWYs at annual, wet season, and dry season intervals. Both approaches showed that large-scale forest recovery did not cause significant water reduction over the past 50 years. This finding is contrary to the widely held perception of the trade-off relationship between carbon (reforestation) and water. There were no significant trends in precipitation or in RWY annually and in the wet season, but there was a significant increase of RWY in the dry season over the past 50 years. It is estimated that forest recovery may play a positive role in redistributing water from the wet season to the dry season and, consequently, in increasing water yield in the dry season. The implication of those research findings for future reforestation programs and water resource protection is also discussed.

AB Threshold changes in rainfall-runoff generation commonly represent shifts in runoff mechanisms and hydrologic connectivity controlling water and solute transport and transformation. In watersheds with limited human influence, threshold runoff responses reflect interaction between precipitation event and antecedent soil moisture. Similar analyses are lacking in intensively managed landscapes where installation of subsurface drainage tiles has altered connectivity between the land surface, groundwater, and streams, and where application of fertilizer has created significant stores of subsurface nitrogen. In this study, we identify threshold patterns of tile-runoff generation for a drained agricultural field in Illinois and evaluate how antecedent conditions-including shallow soil moisture, groundwater table depth, and the presence or absence of crops-control tile response. We relate tile-runoff thresholds to patterns of event nitrate load observed across multiple storm events and evaluate how antecedent conditions control within-event nitrate concentration-discharge relationships. Our results demonstrate that an event tile-runoff threshold emerges relative to the sum of gross precipitation and indices of antecedent shallow soil moisture and antecedent below-tile groundwater moisture deficit, indicating that both shallow soil and below-tile storages must be filled to generate significant runoff. In turn, event nitrate load shows a linear dependence on runoff for most time periods, suggesting that subsurface nitrate export and storage can be estimated using runoff threshold relationships and long-term average nitrate concentrations. Finally, within-event nitrate concentration-discharge relationships are controlled by event size and the antecedent tile flow state because these factors dictate the sequence of flow path activation and tile connectivity over a storm event.

AB This study investigates scaling relationships of watershed area and stream networks delineated from LiDAR DEMs. The delineations are tested against spatial resolution, including 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 m, and interpolation method, including Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Moving Average (MA), Universal Kriging (UK), Natural Neighbor (NN), and Triangular Irregular Networks (TIN). Study sites include Mosquito Creek, Scotty Creek, and Thomas Brook, representing landscapes with high, low, and moderate change in elevation, respectively. Results show scale-dependent irregularities in watershed area due to spatial resolution at Thomas Brook and Mosquito Creek. The highest sensitivity of watershed area to spatial resolution occurred at Scotty Creek, due to high incidence of LiDAR sensor measurement error and subtle changes in elevation. Length of drainage networks did not show a scaling relationship with spatial resolution, due to algorithmic complications of the stream initiation threshold. Stream lengths of main channels at Thomas Brook and Mosquito Creek displayed systematic increases in length with increasing spatial resolution, described through an average fractal dimension of 1.059. The scaling relationship between stream length and DEM resolution allows estimation of stream lengths from low-resolution DEMs in the absence of high-resolution DEMs. Single stream validation at Thomas Brook showed the 1 m DEM produced the lowest length error and highest spatial accuracy, at 3.7% and 71.3%, respectively. Single stream validation at Mosquito Creek showed the 25 m DEM produced the lowest length error, and the 1 m DEM the highest spatial accuracy, at 0.6% and 61.0%, respectively.

AB Transit time of discharge is a hydrological characteristic used in water resource management. Previous studies have demonstrated large spatial variation in the mean transit time (MTT) of stream base flow in meso-scale catchments. Various relationships between topography and MTT have been reported. Although it is generally assumed that base flow MTT is controlled by the depth of the hydrologically active layer that recharges a stream, this hypothesis has not been tested in field studies. This study confirmed that the depth of hydrologically active soil and bedrock controls spatial variation in MTT. The study used isotopic and geochemical tracer data gathered in the 4.27 km(2) Fudoji catchment, central Japan. The results, together with previously documented relationships between topography and MTT, indicate that the depth of the hydrologically active layer is sometimes, but not always, related to topography. A comprehensive understanding of the factors that control base flow production in mountainous catchments will require further study of the water flow path depths that recharge streams.

AB Climate change is projected to impact multiple components of the flow regime. However, changes in some ecologically important aspects of flow seasonality and variability are not well-represented by global climate models. We used a stress testing method and global sensitivity analysis to investigate whether interactions between five different, but plausible, change "dimensions" (hydroclimatic variables or relationships) led to worse ecological outcomes than individual changes. The five dimensions include changes in long-term average rainfall and temperature, low-frequency variability of rainfall, seasonality of rainfall, and the rainfall-runoff relationship. Our case study involved regulated and unregulated sections of the Goulburn River, Australia. We found that four different modeled ecological outcomes (condition of small bodied fish, large bodied fish, in-channel vegetation, and floodplain vegetation) are most sensitive to changes in long-term average rainfall. Sensitivity to changes in rainfall seasonality depends on river characteristics and appears to be heavily dampened by regulation and actively managed environmental water. Changes to the rainfall-runoff relationship (which may be triggered by long-term drying) were found to greatly influence ecological outcomes, but remain poorly understood. However, when considering the worst outcomes that are likely to present severe threats to ecological survival, all five dimensions were significant. These worst outcomes only manifest under certain combinations of changes with interactive effects. These joint interactions have implications for climate risk assessments that do not consider multiple dimensions of change, particularly those aimed at evaluating and mitigating severe threats or extinction probability.

TI Could electrical conductivity replace water level in rating curves for
   alpine streams?
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID UNCERTAINTY; DISCHARGE; RUNOFF; MODELS; RIVER
AB Streamflow time series are important for inference and understanding of the hydrological processes in alpine watersheds. Because streamflow is expensive to continuously measure directly, it is usually derived from measured water levels, using a rating curve modeling the stage-discharge relationship. In alpine streams, this practice is complicated by the fact that the streambed constantly changes due to erosion and sedimentation by the turbulent mountain streams. This makes the stage-discharge relationship dynamic, requiring frequent discharge gaugings to have reliable streamflow estimates. During an ongoing field study in the Val Ferret watershed in the Swiss Alps, 93 streamflow values were measured in the period 2009-2011 using salt dilution gauging with the gulp injection method. The natural background electrical conductivity in the stream, which was measured as by-product of these gaugings, was shown to be a strong predictor for the streamflow, even marginally outperforming water level. Analysis of the residuals of both predictive relations revealed errors in the gauged streamflows. These could be corrected by filtering disinformation from erroneous calibration coefficients. In total, extracting information from the auxiliary data enabled to reduce the uncertainty in the rating curve, as measured by the root-mean-square error in log-transformed streamflow relative to that of the original stage-discharge relationship, by 43.7%.

ID ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION
AB Providers of potable water to households and businesses are charged with conserving water. Addressing this challenge requires accurate information about how water is actually being used. So smart meters are being deployed on a large scale by water providers to collect medium resolution water use data. This paper presents water use signature patterns, the first technique designed for medium resolution meters for discovering patterns that explain how households use water. Signature patterns are clusters (subsets) of water meter readings specified by patterns on volumes and calendar dates. Four types of signature pattern are introduced in this paper: continuous flow days; exceptional peak use days; programmed patterns with recurrent hours; and normal use partitioned by season and period of the day. Signature patterns for each household are calculated using efficient selection rules that scale for city populations and years of data collection. Data from a real-world, large-scale, smart metering trial are analyzed using water use signature patterns. The results demonstrate that water use behaviors are distinctive, for both individuals and populations. Signatures can identify behaviors that are promising targets for water conservation. Pattern discovery can be automated with an efficient and scalable computer program. By identifying relevant consumption patterns in medium resolution meter data, water use signature patterns can help to achieve the water conservation potential of large-scale smart metering.

ID FLOW
AB The theory of homogenization, which is a rigorous method of averaging based on multiple-scale perturbation expansions, is applied to thermal consolidation in two-scale porous media. Starting from the basic conservation laws on the microscale, we derive the linear macroscale governing equations and constitutive coefficients for sufficiently small solid displacements. Several canonical microcell boundary value problems are defined for the computation of the effective coefficients. By extending Auriault & Sanchez-Palencia(2), we deduce certain properties of and relations among the macroscale coefficients. We also outline the results for the case when the medium deformation is comparable to typical grain size. The governing equations are then coupled nonlinearly due to the movement of the fluid-solid interfaces. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Diffusion coefficients and effective, or transport, porosities are important parameters in the assessment of the fate and transport of contaminants in fractured rock systems and when contaminant transport needs to be considered in zones of low to negligible advective flows. This study presents and discusses various solutions, analytical and semianalytical, to Fick's law for the typical through-diffusion experiment and applies these solutions to the results of three through-diffusion experimental data sets. These through-diffusion experiments were conducted on two natural breccia samples, with bulk measured porosities of approximately 13.7% and 16.8%, and one manufactured porous plate sample with a bulk measured porosity of 40.9%, such that the samples displayed order of magnitude differences in their diffusivities. For each experiment, the derived effective porosities and intrinsic diffusion coefficients for each method are compared. It was shown that the semianalytical solution provides an improved method for reliably estimating the effective porosity from through-diffusion experimental data; however, there is little difference between methods in the derived intrinsic diffusion coefficients.

AB We measured velocity and channel geometry in 10 reaches (bed gradient = 0.08-0.21) of a predominantly step-pool channel, the Rio Cordon, Italy, over a range of discharges (3-80% of the bankfull discharge). The resulting data were used to compute flow resistance. At-a-station hydraulic geometry relations indicate that in most reaches, the exponent describing the rate of velocity increases with discharge was between 0.48 and 0.6, which is within the range of published values for pool-riffle channels. The Rio Cordon data are also combined with published hydraulics data from step-pool streams to explore non-dimensional. relationships between velocity and flow resistance and factors including unit discharge, channel gradient, and step geometry. Multiple regression analysis of this combined field dataset indicated that dimensionless unit discharge (q*) is the most important independent variable overall in explaining variations in velocity and flow resistance, followed by channel slope and the ratio of step height to step length. Empirical equations are provided both for dimensionless velocity and flow resistance, but prediction of the former variable appears more reliable. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Higher resolution topographic information contained in the topographic index of TOPMODEL is lost when digital elevation models (DEMs) with a coarse grid resolution are used; thus, the topographic index is scale dependent, demonstrating identified model parameter values to be dependent on DEM resolution. This makes it difficult to use model parameter values identified through a different resolution of TOPMODEL. The inconsistency is the result of the difference between the scale at which the model parameters are identified and the scale at which the model is applied. To overcome this problem, scale laws that govern the relationship between the resolution of digital elevation data and geomorphometric parameters of the topographic index were analysed and a method to downscale the topographic index distribution developed to account for the difference in scales between model application and parameter identification. The method to downscale the topographic index is composed of two ideas: one involves introducing a resolution factor to account for the scale effect in upslope catchment area per unit contour length in the topographic index; the other utilizes a fractal method through steepest slope scaling to account for the scale effect on slopes. This method successfully derived a topographic index distribution of a fine-resolution DEM by using only a coarse-resolution DEM. The method has been applied successfully to the Kamishiiba catchment (210 km(2)) in Japan and has demonstrated that the downscaled topographic index distribution derived using a 1000 m grid DEM is very similar to the topographic index distribution derived via fine-target-resoluition DEMs. The method is then coupled with a TOPMODEL simulation to match the scales of model application and parameter identification. It is shown that the simulated runoff from the downscaled TOPMODEL applied at 1000 m resolution of the Kamishiiba catchment, with the same set of effective parameter values derived from 50 m resolution DEM, matched the simulated runoff in the 50 m DEM resolution TOPMODEL. It was also shown that TOPMODEL coupled with the downscaling method of the topographic index accurately simulated runoff for different rainfall events in the catchment without recalibration.

AB Non-uniform flows encompassing both accelerating and decelerating flows over a cobble-bed flume have been experimentally investigated in a flume at a scale of intermediate relative submergence. Measurements of mean longitudinal flow velocity u, and determinations of turbulence intensities u', v', w', and Reynolds shear stress -u(f)w(f) have been made. The longitudinal velocity distribution was divided into the inner zone close to the bed and the outer zone far from the bed. In the inner zone of the boundary layer (near the bed) the velocity profile closely followed the 'Log Law'; however, in the outer zone the velocity distribution deviated from the Log Law consistently for both accelerating and decelerating flows and the changes in bed slopes ranging from -2% to + 2% had no considerable effect on the outer zone. For a constant bed slope (S = +/- 0.015), the larger the flow rate, the smaller the turbulence intensities. However, no detectable pattern has been observed for u', v' and w' distributions near the bed. Likewise, for a constant flow rate (Q = 0.040 m(3)/s), with variation in bed slope the longitudinal turbulent intensity profile in the longitudinal direction remained concave for both accelerating and decelerating flows; whereas vertical turbulent intensity (w') profile presented no specific form. The results reveal that the positions of maximum values of turbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress depend not only on the flow structure (accelerating or decelerating) but also on the intermediate relative submergence scale.

AB Flow and multicomponent reactive transport in saturated/unsaturated porous media are modeled by ensembles of computational particles moving on regular lattices according to specific random walk rules. The occupation number of the lattice sites is updated with a global random walk (GRW) procedure which spreads the particles from a lattice site with computational costs comparable to those for a single random walk step in sequential procedures. To cope with the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation the GRW flow solver uses linearization techniques similar to the L-scheme developed in finite element/volume approaches. Numerical schemes for reactive transport, coupled with the flow solver via numerical solutions for saturation and water flux, are implemented in splitting procedures. Diffusion-advection steps are solved by GRW algorithms using either biased or unbiased random walk probabilities. Since the number of particles in GRW simulations can be as large as the number of molecules involved in chemical reactions, one avoids the cumbersome problem of rescaling particle densities to approximate concentrations. Reaction steps are therefore formulated in terms of concentrations, as in deterministic approaches. The numerical convergence of the new schemes is demonstrated by comparisons with manufactured analytical solutions. Coupled flow and reactive transport problems of contaminant biodegradation described by the Monod model are further solved and the influence of flow nonlinearity/degeneracy and of the spatial heterogeneity of the medium is investigated numerically.

AB This study explores various aspects of catchment hydrology based on a mechanistic modeling of distributed watershed processes. A new physics-based, distributed-parameter hydrological model that uses an irregular spatial discretization is introduced. The model accounts, on a continuous basis, for the processes of rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, moisture dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and runoff routing. Simulations of several mid- to large-sized watersheds (similar to10(3) km(2)) highlight various dynamic relationships between the vadose zone-groundwater processes and their dependence on the land surface characteristics. It is argued that the model inferences can be used for interpretation of distributed relationships in a catchment. By exploiting a multiple-resolution representation, the hydrologic features of the watershed terrain are captured with only 5-10% of the original grid nodes. This computational efficiency suggests the feasibility of the operational use of fully distributed, physics-based models for large watersheds.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID DIFFUSION; RATES
AB Evaporative losses from large water bodies may exceed 20% of water used in irrigated agriculture, with losses from reservoirs estimated at 50% of storage capacity. Prominent among proposed methods to curtail these evaporative losses are various forms of partial covers placed over water surfaces. Studies show that evaporation through perforated covers and from partially covered water surfaces exhibit nonlinear behavior, where rates of water loss are not proportional to uncovered surface fraction and are significantly affected by opening size and relative spacing. We studied evaporation from small water bodies under various perforated covers, extending the so-called diameter law to opening sizes in the range of 10(-5) to 10(-1) m. Contradicting claims concerning effects of openings and their arrangement on performance of evaporation barriers are analyzed on per opening and on per area mass losses. Our results help reconcile some classical findings invoking detailed pore-scale diffusion and simple temperature-based energetic behaviors. For fixed relative spacing, area-averaged evaporative flux density remains nearly constant across several orders of magnitude variations in opening size. For the scale of the experimental setup, we predict relative evaporation reduction efficiency for various configurations of perforated evaporation barriers.

AB This work aims to present new modeling tools that help to better monitor and predict the groundwater level in sparsely gauged basins. The working area is the Mires basin of Mesara valley in the island of Crete (Greece). Efficient groundwater management in the basin is crucial in light of regional climate change model estimates showing a substantial risk of desertification for Crete. We propose that the prediction of the hydraulic head spatial variability in Mires basin can be improved by incorporating in the trend the distance of the prediction points from a temporary river crossing the basin and a component based on the generalized Thiem's equation for multiple wells as well as using the flexible Spartan semivariogram family to perform Residual Kriging. Our proposal is supported by the results of cross validation analysis. Our results are applicable to other unconfined aquifers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The shear stress at the bed of a channel influences important benthic processes such as sediment transport. Several methods exist to estimate the bed shear stress in bare channels without vegetation, but most of these are not appropriate for vegetated channels due to the impact of vegetation on the velocity profile and turbulence production. This study proposes a new model to estimate the bed shear stress in both vegetated and bare channels with smooth beds. The model, which is supported by measurements, indicates that for both bare and vegetated channels with smooth beds, within a viscous sublayer at the bed, the viscous stress decreases linearly with increasing distance from the bed, resulting in a parabolic velocity profile at the bed. For bare channels, the model describes the velocity profile in the overlap region of the Law of the Wall. For emergent canopies of sufficient density (frontal area per unit canopy volume a >= 4.3m(-1)), the thickness of the linear-stress layer is set by the stem diameter, leading to a simple estimate for bed shear stress.

AB [1] This paper develops a new framework to analyze the relevance of hillslope with respect to channel processes in the generation of the hydrologic response at different scales. The dependence between basin response and geomorphic features of channels and hillslopes is analyzed through the mean and variance of travel times under simple but realistic dynamical hypotheses and within the framework of the rescaled width function. The distribution of travel times is also studied in association with variations of the fraction of saturated areas: with small values of the saturated fraction, the channel network controls most of the mean and variance of travel time distribution. Vice versa, when the basin is saturated, the properties of this distribution may be significantly affected by hillslope processes. These properties depend also on the basin size, with the role of hillslope processes becoming more important in the smaller basins. Furthermore, the average residence time is related to contributing area and drainage density through a simple expression which is shown to be consistent with previous empirical laws.

AB By applying wavelet-based empirical orthogonal function (WEOF) analysis to gridded precipitation (P) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to gridded air temperature (T), potential evapotranspiration (PET), net precipitation (PPET) and runoff (Q), this paper examines the spatial, temporal and frequency patterns of Alberta's climate variability. It was found that only WEOF-based precipitation patterns, possibly modulated by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation(PDO), delineated Alberta into four major regions which geographically represent northern Alberta Boreal forests, southern Alberta grasslands and Aspen Parklands and the Rocky Mountains and Foothills. The leading mode of wavelet-based precipitation variability WPC1 showed that between 1900 and 2000, a wet climate dominated northern Alberta with significant 4-8, 11 and 25-year periodic cycles, while the second mode WPC2 showed that between 1960 and 2000, southern Alberta grasslands were characterized by decreasing precipitation, dominated by 11-year cycles, and the last two modes WPC3 and WPC4 were characterized by 4-7 and 25-year cycles and both delineated regions where moisture from the Pacific Ocean penetrated the Rocky Mountains, accounted for much of the sub-alpine climate. These results show that WEOF is superior to EOF in delineating Alberta precipitation variability to sub-regions that more closely agree with its eco-climate regions. Further, it was found that while WPC2 could not explain runoff variations in southern Alberta, WPC1, WPC3 and WPC4 accounted for runoff variability in their respective sub-re.-ions.

AB Hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts are often spatially related, which increases management challenges and potential impacts. However, these spatial relationships in high and low flows are often overlooked in risk assessments and we know little about their differences and origins. Here, we ask how spatial relationships of both types of hydrologic extremes and their potential hydro-meteorological drivers differ and vary by season. We propose lagged upper- and lower-tail correlation as a measure of extremal dependence for temporally ordered events to build complex networks of high and low flows. We compare complex networks of overall, low and high flows, determine hydro-meteorological drivers of these networks, and map past changes in spatial relationships using a large-sample data set in Central Europe. Our network comparison shows that low flows are correlated more strongly and over longer distances than high flows and high- and low-flow networks are strongest in spring and weakest in summer. Our driver analysis shows that high-flow dependence is most strongly governed by precipitation in winter and evapotranspiration in summer while low-flow dependence is most strongly governed by snowmelt in winter and evapotranspiration in fall. Finally, our change analysis shows that changes in connectedness (i.e., the number of catchments a catchments shows strong flow correlations with) vary spatially and are mostly positive for high flows. We conclude that spatial flow correlations are considerable for both high and particularly low flows as a result of a combination of spatially related hydro-meteorological drivers whose importance varies by extreme type and season.

TI Formal and informal decision making on water management at the village
   level: A case study from the Office du Niger irrigation scheme (Mali)
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; TANZANIA; AFRICA; INDIA
AB Water Users Associations (WUAs) are all too often considered a panacea for improving water management in irrigation schemes. Where grassroots movements are absent, they are usually imposed on farmers by national governments, NGOs, and international donors, without fully considering existing forms of organization. This also happened in the Office du Niger irrigation scheme in Mali, where after a partial irrigation management transfer, WUAs were created to fill the resulting power vacuum. This paper demonstrates that, despite active efforts to organize farmers in WUAs, informal patterns of decision making remain dominant. Given the shortcomings of these informal patterns, WUAs could provide a much-needed platform for institutionalizing collective action, on the condition that farmers accept them. Therefore WUAs should adopt some crucial characteristics of informal patterns of decision making while avoiding their weaknesses. First, making use of the existing authority of village leadership and the central management can improve the credibility of WUAs. Second, allowing flexibility in procedures and rules can make them more appropriate for dealing with collective action problems that are typically temporary and specific. Last, formalizing the current pattern of conflict management and sanctioning might enhance its sphere of action and tackle the current absence of firm engagement with respect to some informal management decisions. In addition, WUAs should represent and be accountable to all farmers, including those residing outside the village community.

AB The accumulation of discharge along a stream valley is frequently assumed to be the primary control on solute transport processes. Relationships of both increasing and decreasing transient storage, and decreased gross losses of stream water have been reported with increasing discharge; however, we have yet to validate these relationships with extensive field study. We conducted transient storage and mass recovery analyses of artificial tracer studies completed for 28 contiguous 100 m reaches along a stream valley, repeated under four base-flow conditions. We calculated net and gross gains and losses, temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves, and best fit transient storage model parameters (with uncertainty estimates) for 106 individual tracer injections. Results supported predictions that gross loss of channel water would decrease with increased discharge. However, results showed no clear relationship between discharge and transient storage, and further analysis of solute tracer methods demonstrated that the lack of this relation may be explained by uncertainty and equifinality in the transient storage model framework. Furthermore, comparison of water balance and transient storage approaches reveals complications in clear interpretation of either method due to changes in advective transport time, which sets a the temporal boundary separating transient storage and channel water balance. We have little ability to parse this limitation of solute tracer methods from the physical processes we seek to study. We suggest the combined analysis of both transient storage and channel water balance more completely characterizes transport of solutes in stream networks than can be inferred from either method alone.

AB Given the variable biogeochemical, physical, and hydrological processes driving fluvial sediment and nutrient export, the water science and management communities need data-driven methods to identify regions prone to production and transport under variable hydrometeorological conditions. We use Bayesian analysis to segment concentration-discharge linear regression models for total suspended solids (TSS) and particulate and dissolved phosphorus (PP, DP) using 22 years of monitoring data from 18 Lake Champlain watersheds. Bayesian inference was leveraged to estimate segmented regression model parameters and identify threshold position. The identified threshold positions demonstrated a considerable range below and above the median discharge-which has been used previously as the default breakpoint in segmented regression models to discern differences between pre and post-threshold export regimes. We then applied a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which partitioned the watersheds into clusters of TSS, PP, and DP export regimes using watershed characteristics, as well as Bayesian regression intercepts and slopes. A SOM defined two clusters of high-flux basins, one where PP flux was predominantly episodic and hydrologically driven; and another in which the sediment and nutrient sourcing and mobilization were more bimodal, resulting from both hydrologic processes at post-threshold discharges and reactive processes (e.g., nutrient cycling or lateral/vertical exchanges of fine sediment) at prethreshold discharges. A separate DP SOM defined two high-flux clusters exhibiting a bimodal concentration-discharge response, but driven by differing land use. Our novel framework shows promise as a tool with broad management application that provides insights into landscape drivers of riverine solute and sediment export.

AB [1] Classical Darcy's equation for multiphase flow assumes that gravity and the gradient in fluid pressure are the only driving forces and resistance to the flow is parameterized by (relative) permeability as a function of saturation. It is conceivable that, in multiphase flow, other driving forces may also exist. This would mean that such nonequilibrium effects are lumped into a permeability coefficient. Indeed, many studies have shown that the relative permeability coefficient generally depends not only on saturation but also on dynamics of the system. Through the application of rational thermodynamics, a theory of two-phase flow had been developed in which interfacial areas were introduced as separate thermodynamic entities and their macroscale effects were explicitly included. This theory includes new driving forces whose significance needs still to be established. To study new terms in the theory, we employ a dynamic pore network model called DYPOSIT. A long pore network (several representative elementary volumes connected in series) is generated, which represents as a one-dimensional porous medium column. This model provides pore scale distribution of local phase pressures, capillary pressure, interfacial area, saturation, and flow rate, which are averaged to obtain the macroscale distributions of these variables. Our analysis shows that there are discrepancies between the simulation results and the classical equations to describe the transient behavior, especially for the nonwetting phase transient permeability. The coefficients in the extended equations are quantified and parameterized. Although under the applied Dirichlet boundary conditions, flow varies significantly, there is a clear trend illustrating dependency of coefficients on saturation, independent of dynamic conditions. Furthermore, using the new coefficients, it is possible to explain either transient or steady state flow regimes, which is a new achievement.

AB Capillary trapping of a non-wetting phase arising from two-phase immiscible flow in sedimentary rocks is critical to many geoscience scenarios, including oil and gas recovery, aquifer recharge and, with increasing interest, carbon sequestration. Here we demonstrate the successful use of low field H-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance [NMR] to quantify capillary trapping; specifically we use transverse relaxation time [T-2] time measurements to measure both residual water [wetting phase] content and the surface-to-volume ratio distribution (which is proportional to pore size] of the void space occupied by this residual water. Critically we systematically confirm this relationship between T-2 and pore size by quantifying inter-pore magnetic field gradients due to magnetic susceptibility contrast, and demonstrate that our measurements at all water saturations are unaffected. Diffusion in such field gradients can potentially severely distort the T-2-pore size relationship, rendering it unusable. Measurements are performed for nitrogen injection into a range of water-saturated sandstone plugs at reservoir conditions. Consistent with a water-wet system, water was preferentially displaced from larger pores while relatively little change was observed in the water occupying smaller pore spaces. The impact of cyclic wetting/non-wetting fluid injection was explored and indicated that such a regime increased non-wetting trapping efficiency by the sequential occupation of the most available larger pores by nitrogen. Finally the replacement of nitrogen by CO2 was considered; this revealed that dissolution of paramagnetic minerals from the sandstone caused by its exposure to carbonic acid reduced the in situ bulk fluid T-2 relaxation time on a timescale comparable to our core flooding experiments. The implications of this for the T-2-pore size relationship are discussed.

AB If fluid is injected into joints in rock masses, the pressure required might result in changes in the joint space between rock blocks that accommodate the fluid transport. At one extreme, very low injection rate and pressure, the joint space is unaffected, and the fluid pressure follows the usual law of linear diffusion. At the opposite extreme, very high injection rates, as used, for example, during hydraulic fracturing, the pressure is so high as to overcome the original Earth stress holding the rock blocks in contact. They "lift off,'' resulting in huge changes in joint space, and the flow equation then becomes so nonlinear that pressure pulses are no longer transmitted in a smooth, diffusive manner but more like a propagating shock wave. In between these extremes, at more modest pressure, the result is not liftoff, but nevertheless, the effective stress tending to close the joint space is reduced; this space dilates, and the effective permeability and storativity of the joint will increase. While the pressure wave will not propagate quite as sharply as it does for liftoff, nonlinearities greatly influence the results, exhibiting behavior far from that predicted by linear diffusion.

AB Although it is generally well known that water repellent soils have distinct preferential flow patterns, the physics of this phenomenon is not well understood, In this paper, we show that water repellency affects the soil water contact angle and this, in turn, has a distinct effect on the constitutive relationships during imbibing. Using these constitutive relationships, unstable flow theory developed for coarse grained soils can be used to predict the shape and water content distribution for water repellent soils. A practical result of this paper is that with a basic experimental setup, we can characterize the imbibing front behavior by measuring the water entry pressure and the imbibing soil characteristic curve from the same heat treated soil.

AB In studies of two-phase flow in complex porous media it is often desirable to have an estimation of the capillary pressure-saturation curve prior to measurements. Therefore, we compare in this research the capability of three pore-scale approaches in reproducing experimentally measured capillary pressure-saturation curves. To do so, we have generated 12 packings of spheres that are representative of four different glass-bead packings and eight different sand packings, for which we have found experimental data on the capillary pressure-saturation curve in the literature. In generating the packings, we matched the particle size distributions and porosity values of the granular materials. We have used three different pore-scale approaches for generating the capillary pressure-saturation curves of each packing: i) the Pore Unit Assembly (PUA) method in combination with the Mayer and Stowe-Princen (MS-P) approximation for estimating the entry pressures of pore throats, ii) the PUA method in combination with the hemisphere approximation, and iii) the Pore Morphology Method (PMM) in combination with the hemisphere approximation. The three approaches were also used to produce capillary pressure-saturation curves for the coating layer of paper, used in inkjet printing. Curves for such layers are extremely difficult to determine experimentally, due to their very small thickness and the presence of extremely small pores (less than one micrometer in size). Results indicate that the PMM and PUA-hemisphere method give similar capillary pressure-saturation curves, because both methods rely on a hemisphere to represent the air-water interface. The ability of the hemisphere approximation and the MS-P approximation to reproduce correct capillary pressure seems to depend on the type of particle size distribution, with the hemisphere approximation working well for narrowly distributed granular materials.

TI Modeling Runoff and Nitrogen Loads From a Watershed at Different Levels

AB Urban development of watersheds increases runoff and nitrogen loads by adding urban impervious surfaces and increasing the hydrologic connectivity of these surfaces to streams. Storm water control measures (SCMs) are designed to disrupt this connectivity by retaining water in biologically active depressions where nitrogen retention, transformation, and removal occur. This work applies a mechanistic, spatially distributed, hydroecological model (RHESSys) to a suburban watershed in Charlotte, NC, with 15% total imperviousness (TI) and 33% watershed area mitigated by SCMs. We developed emergent relationships between watershed-scale predictors (TI and connectivity to SCMs) and water and nitrogen response variables (storm water runoff ratios and nitrogen load by species). Results showed that annual runoff ratios were insensitive to increases in connectivity to SCMs (varying by similar to 1% of rainfall) because SCMs did not substantially increase evaporation but that runoff ratios increased by an average 0.2% per 1% increase in TI due to decreases in transpiration in the watershed. Generally, nitrate loads increased with TI but decreased as more surfaces were mitigated by SCMs. However, these nitrate reductions corresponded to increased export of dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium. Together, these results indicate that SCMs act as both removers and transformers of nitrogen at the watershed scale. SCMs showed a net assimilation of nitrogen in warm months and net release in cool months, which offset the timing of nitrogen export relative to inputs. This work highlights that using a hydroecological, process-based model reveals both the emergent relationships between watershed condition and response and the processes controlling those relationships.

AB River discharge is one of the key elements in the global water cycle; however, its observation and projection are still lacking in alpine regions. This study analyzed the annual and seasonal variability of the river discharge in the upper region of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, investigated the climate-discharge relationship, and projected the annual trend in the next few decades (2021-2100) based on a distributed hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). Results show that river discharge did not show the same trend as precipitation at either annual or seasonal scale in the study area. It indicated that precipitation might not be the primary source of river discharge, and meltwater from snow, glacier, and frozen soil could account for a large percentage of river discharge. The projected river discharge would vary significantly among years with different changing rates under different climate change scenarios. Overall, this study contributes to investigate the unusual climatedischarge relationship which is different from that in the whole river basin. Moreover, to separately consider the parameters related to snow melt could significantly improve the simulation accuracy; however, it could be further improved by considering the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier which are not included in the SWAT model.

AB Numerous efforts have been made to separate effects of climate change and human activities on long-term runoff change, including a commonly used method based on the Budyko complementary relationship (BCR) to deal with the non-closure problems often encountered in separating the observed runoff change into its contributed components. The BCR was derived by assuming the change of the Budyko parameter reflecting basin characteristics is related to human activities alone. However, some studies show that basin characteristics are related to both climate change and human activities in certain basins, where applying the BCR method could lead to wrong results. In the study, a more flexible form of the BCR, the improved Budyko complementary relationship (IBCR), is developed under the situation that basin characteristics may relate to climate change. A separation method based on the IBCR is also developed. In this IBCR method, the relationship of the basin characteristics parameter to climate and/or human factors is estimated by using a multi-year moving window. To identify the flexibility of the IBCR method relative to the BCR method, both methods were applied to the Weihe basin of China, whose basin characteristics have been found to be affected by both climate change and human activities. Compared with the IBCR method, the BCR method overestimates the climate effect, while underestimates the human effect on the runoff change in the Weihe basin. It is found that whether or not to incorporate the climate effect into the basin characteristics parameter has a significant impact on the runoff change separation results in Weihe basin. Overall, the IBCR method is more reasonable and flexible for separating the long-term runoff change into different components.

AB Hillslopes exert critical controls on the quality and quantity of downstream waters. To understand and model dominant headwater catchment processes, we need to estimate the relative importance of different runoff generation processes. In this work we analyze published data from studies of 17 hillslopes from a range of landscapes to better understand the relative role of interflow, that is, shallow lateral subsurface flow moving over a layer impeding percolation, in streamflow generation. For each slope, we calculated downslope interflow travel distances, that is, the potential distance a water parcel travels downslope above an impeding layer until it percolates into the impeding layer. The downslope travel distances for the 17 hillslopes ranged from around 1 m to several hundred meters. The vector analysis of downslope travel distances revealed that all but three hillslopes had slope lengths that were much longer than downslope travel distances. For the remaining 14 cases we could show that most water perched above a shallow impeding layer percolates through the impeding layer before reaching the valley or the stream channel. Thus, interflow usually contributes directly to valley water or streamflow only from the lower portions of the hillslope in most landscapes. A critical finding of our analysis is that a continuously perched saturated zone with downslope flow does not imply continuous connectivity to the stream. Such a continuous connectivity is the exception rather than the rule in most landscapes. Future hillslope and headwater processes and modeling studies will need to account for this.

AB Detection and quantification of groundwater flow in fractures is challenging due to its irregular distribution and fine scale, requiring intensive and depth-discrete field data collection along boreholes. This study presents a new method using fiber optic active distributed temperature sensing (A-DTS) in sealed boreholes to efficiently quantify depth-discrete flow rates along the full length of a bedrock borehole. The method combines field data and numerical modeling to quantify groundwater flow rates under natural gradient conditions, which is important for assessing groundwater flow and contaminant transport. An empirical relationship between enhanced heat dissipation and groundwater flow rates is determined using a numerical model of groundwater flow and heat transport for a system of idealized parallel plate fractures in a homogeneous porous rock with negligible flow through the rock matrix. The empirical relationship is applied to a detailed profile of apparent thermal conductivity measured using A-DTS that combines the effect of rock thermal properties and groundwater flow. In zones with no flow, the A-DTS-derived apparent thermal conductivity matches the laboratory effective rock thermal conductivity values measured independently. Local increases of A-DTS apparent thermal conductivity relative to the rock matrix thermal conductivity can be used to estimate groundwater flow rates using the empirical relationship. The results are in reasonable agreement with straddle pacer tracer dilution tests in the same borehole, which helps to validate the approach. This new approach allows identification of active flow zones and quantification of flow rates and can be efficiently applied in single or multiple boreholes.

AB Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing of vegetation temperature, combined with surface energy balance modeling, allows efficient estimation of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET). Many ET models are sensitive to the parameterization of stomatal control; yet, modelers often employ spatially uniform stomatal resistance values, even in distributed applications. Unfortunately, assuming uniform resistance across a canopy with large temperature variance is physically unrealistic and may produce artifacts in ET magnitude. To account for spatial variations in stomatal control that likely accompany temperature variations, we propose nesting a new submodel within some well-established ET models. The submodel derives, for the canopy patch of interest, a concave-downward relationship between stomatal conductance and temperature, as expected from plant biology. Using the submodel, each pixel's contribution to the total canopy patch ET is influenced both by its observed temperature and by its locationspecific estimated stomatal resistance. The submodel requires only one more parameter than the unmodified ET models, which can be obtained from the literature; it conserves energy between the pixel and image scales, unlike single-valued resistance approaches; it produces realistic ET values at extreme temperature locations; and provides a remote sensing-based way to estimate the in situ canopy stomatal conductance-temperature relationship, which otherwise must be measured under controlled conditions. Since very high-resolution TIR data provide one means to observe large temperature variance, the submodel was tested using data with cm-scale pixels collected over 1.5 m(2) patches of two vegetation types. The biophysical relationships derived by the submodel were successfully verified against laboratory data.

TI A study on the pH and conductivity of rural rainfall employing two

DT Article
ID CHEMISTRY; RAINWATER; PRECIPITATION; SITE
AB A set of about 100 daily rainfall samples were collected over a period of about one year during the 1995-1996 period using two collocated, automated samplers placed similar to 4 m apart at the rural Kadoorie Agricultural Research Centre (KARC) in Hong Kong. The pH and conductivity of the rainwater were measured immediately after sample collection. There is a strong correlation between the two free hydrogen ion concentrations (R-2 approximate to 0.92) and an even stronger one between the conductivities (R-2 approximate to 0.99). Statistically, there is no difference at the 0.05 level of significance between the means of either the two free hydrogen ion concentrations or the two conductivities. The conductivity results suggest that the total dissolved solids in the two samplers is probably quite similar in magnitude. No relationship is observed between the free acid content and daily rainfall volume in either sampler, a result similar to that obtained in previous studies involving bulk fall at the KARC and wet fall in urban Hong Kong as a whole. A weak hyperbolic relationship exists between the rainfall volume and the conductivity, and their log-log plot indicates only a somewhat weak inverse linear relationship, with correlation coefficients of -0.60 and -0.61 for the two samplers, considered individually. Finally, the unbiased estimates of the product of rainfall volume and conductivity for the collocated samples suggest that the microscale variability (greater than or similar to 4 m) of the mean wet mass flux of total dissolved material in rural Hong Kong rainfall is negligible.

AB This paper addresses the integral conservation of linear and angular momentum in the steady hydraulic jump in a linearly diverging channel.
   The flow is considered to be divided into a mainstream that conveys the total liquid discharge, and a roller where no average mass transport occurs. It is assumed that no macroscopic rheological relationship holds, so mass, momentum and angular momentum integral balances are independent relationships. Normal stresses are assumed to be hydrostatic on vertical, cylindrical surfaces. Viscous stresses are assumed to be negligible with respect to turbulent stresses. Assuming that the horizontal velocity distribution in the mainstream is uniform and that the horizontal momentum and angular momentum in the roller are negligible with respect to their mainstream counterparts, an analytical solution is obtained for the free surface profile of the flow. This solution is fundamental for finding the sequent depths and their positions. Consequently, it permits solving for the length of the jump, which is assumed to be equal to the length of the roller. Mainstream and roller thicknesses can also be derived from the present solution. This model may also be theoretically used to derive the average shear stresses exerted by the roller on the mainstream and the power losses per unit weight. This second relationship, which returns the well-known classical expression for total power loss in the jump, demonstrates that the strongly idealized mechanical model proposed here is internally consistent.

AB Numerical models of groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone require relative conductivity and moisture retention curves at a discretization scale much larger than that at which these constitutive relationships are measured. This study seeks to identify simple scaling laws linking parameters of block-scale constitutive relationships with the parameters of their measurement-scale counterparts represented here using Gardner-Russo models. The two parameters of these models, saturated conductivity and pore-size distribution parameter, are viewed as cross-correlated regionalized variables with isotropic or anisotropic spatial correlation structures and are simulated using the sequential Gaussian method. Upscaled constitutive curves for steady gravity drainage through three-dimensional heterogeneous domains are then constructed by repeating numerical flow experiments for a series of applied infiltration rates and plotting the resulting upscaled relative conductivities and average water saturations against average matric potentials. The experiments reveal clear log-linear relationships between upscaled relative conductivities and average matric potentials, the slopes of which are used to define an upscaled pore-size distribution parameter. The reciprocal of this quantity, which represents an upscaled characteristic capillary length, is very well approximated by a spatial power average of its measurement-scale values. Furthermore, the averaging exponent is:; found to be the same as that associated with the upscaling of saturated conductivities over the same flow domains. When average matric potentials are normalized using this upscaled characteristic capillary length, relative conductivity and moisture saturation values for widely different flow field realizations collapse along well defined curves. However, for wet conditions the form of these curves differs from that of the models assumed at the measurement scale.

AB A general analytical model for one-dimensional transient vertical infiltration is presented. The model is based on a combination of the Brooks and Corey soil water retention function and a generalized hydraulic conductivity function. This leads to power law diffusivity and convective term for which the exponents are functions of the inverse of the pore size distribution index. Accordingly, the proposed analytical solution covers many existing realistic models in the literature. The general form of the analytical solution is simple and it expresses implicitly the depth as function of water content and time. It can be used to model infiltration through semi-infinite dry soils with prescribed water content or flux boundary conditions. Some mathematical expressions of practical importance are also derived. The general form solution is useful for comparison between models, validation of numerical solutions and for better understanding the effect of some hydraulic parameters. Based on the analytical expression, a complete inverse procedure which allows the estimation of the hydraulic parameters from water content measurements is presented.

TI On the probability of droughts: The compound renewal model
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID UNCERTAINTIES
AB [1] Droughts influence the planning and design of water supply infrastructure. Hydrologists ascertain drought duration, severity, and pattern of recurrence from instrumental and reconstructed records ( e. g., using tree rings) of streamflow and precipitation. This work introduces a compound renewal model for the probabilistic analysis of multiyear drought recurrence. The compound renewal process generalizes the Poisson process. In the former the interarrival time between two consecutive events is the duration of nondrought conditions, and the events ( i. e., droughts) have a probabilistic duration of at least 0 years. The sum of the interarrival time and its subsequent drought duration is called the renewal time, which regenerates over time according to probabilistic laws derived in this work. Drought severity is incorporated in the analysis by means of a threshold quantile ( e. g., the median or the average), so that low- streamflow conditions become a drought whenever they last over 0 years. A case study dealing with a river basin that has multiyear storage capacity, and in which droughts recurred frequently in the twentieth century, demonstrates the analytical power of the compound renewal model.

ID GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION; NONLINEAR DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS
AB [ 1] Relationships between hydrologic variables are often nonlinear. Usually, the functional form of such a relationship is not known a priori. A multivariate, nonparametric regression methodology is provided here for approximating the underlying regression function using locally weighted polynomials. Locally weighted polynomials consider the approximation of the target function through a Taylor series expansion of the function in the neighborhood of the point of estimate. Cross-validatory procedures for the selection of the size of the neighborhood over which this approximation should take place and for the order of the local polynomial to use are provided and shown for some simple situations. The utility of this nonparametric regression approach is demonstrated through an application to nonparametric short-term forecasts of the biweekly Great Salt Lake volume. Blind forecasts up to 1 year in the future using the 1847 - 2004 time series of the Great Salt Lake are presented.

AB The sensitivity Of a model output (called a variable) to a parameter can be defined as the partial derivative of the variable with respect to the parameter. When the governing equations are not differentiable with respect to this parameter, problems arise in the numerical solution of the sensitivity equations, such as locally infinite values or instability. An approximate Riemann solver is thus proposed for direct sensitivity calculation for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in the presence of discontinuous solutions. The proposed approach uses an extra source term in the form of a Dirac function to restore sensitivity balance across the shocks. It is valid for systems such as the Euler equations for gas dynamics or the shallow water equations for free surface flow. The method is first detailed and its application to the shallow water equations is proposed, with some test cases such as dike- or dam-break problems with or without source terms. An application to a two-dimensional flow problem illustrates the superiority of direct sensitivity calculation over the classical empirical approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid water in snowpacks rules wet snow avalanche formation, surface albedo and snowmelt runoff timing. By now, volumetric liquid water content (LWC) measurements are collected mainly with destructive methods, while continuous-time and non-invasive measurements would be preferable to track its time dynamics. Here, we assess the feasibility of continuous-time monitoring of LWC using EnviroSMART (R) capacitance sensors. These were conceived to track liquid water dynamics in soils, and their use in snow is evaluated here for the first time, as far as we know. A field case study was settled up in April 2013 within an Italian Alpine valley. An instrumental set up with eight capacitance sensors was installed. Two time-domain reflectrometers were added to the aim of comparison. To assist in interpreting the signal of the capacitance sensors, two laboratory tests were run, and a FEM model was implemented. This preliminary study demonstrates that capacitance sensors are sensitive to increasing LWC, although their long-term installation in snow entails the development of an air gap around them, due to localized melting, air turbulence and solar radiation absorption, which hinders following LWC variations. As a result, capacitance sensors readings are challenging to be interpreted quantitatively. Perspectives on future investigation are discussed to bring the proposed procedure towards long-term applications in snowpacks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Watershed model calibration to the base flow recession curve with and

AB Calibration of watershed models to the shape of the base flow recession curve is a way to capture the important relationship between groundwater discharge and subsurface water storage in a catchment. In some montane Mediterranean regions, such as the midelevation Providence Creek catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California (USA), nearly all base flow recession occurs after snow-melt, and during this time evapotranspiration (ET) usually exceeds base flow. We assess the accuracy to which watershed models can be calibrated to ET-dominated base flow recession in Providence Creek, both in terms of fitting a discharge time-series and realistically capturing the observed discharge-storage relationship for the catchment. Model parameters estimated from calibrations to ET-dominated recession are compared to parameters estimated from reference calibrations to base flow recession with ET-effects removed ("potential recession"). We employ the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) for simulations of base flow and ET, and methods that are otherwise general in nature. In models calibrated to ET-dominated recession, simulation errors in ET and the targeted relationship for recession (-dQ/dt versus Q) contribute substantially (up to 57% and 46%, respectively) to overestimates in the discharge-storage differential, defined as d(lnQ)/dS, relative to that derived from water flux observations. These errors result in overestimates of deep-subsurface hydraulic conductivity in models calibrated to ET-dominated recession, by up to an order of magnitude, relative to reference calibrations to potential recession. These results illustrate a potential opportunity for improving model representation of discharge-storage dynamics by calibrating to the shape of base flow recession after removing the complicating effects of ET.

AB In karstic environments, groundwater is strongly influenced by CO2 partial pressure variations of air present in the infiltration zone of these aquifers. In order to characterize the geochemical changes in groundwater as it moves through the infiltration zone, we monitored various rising springs in the perched karstic aquifer of Cussac (Dordogne, France), and measured the CO2 partial pressure in air of a nearby cavity (the Cussac Cave) for 24 months. Our method is based on the relationship between the saturation index with respect to calcite (SIc) and the CO2 partial pressure at atmospheric equilibrium with water. We distinguished a value for this last parameter when water is at equilibrium with respect to calcite (SIc = 0) called saturation CO2 partial pressure. The use of this parameter can provide information on flow conditions and relationships between water, air, and rock. Cussac aquifer is a suitable area to apply these methods because of its small size, numerous springs, and a cave that provides data for CO2 partial pressure condition inside the massif. Results show that most of the calcium-carbonate mineralization is acquired in the epikarst followed by a precipitation phase in the upper part of the infiltration zone. Groundwater reaches the saturated zone with some degree of saturation depending on CO2 partial pressure variations in air inside the massif. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The partitioning of surface vapor flux (F-ET) into evaporation (F-E) and transpiration (F-T) is theoretically possible because of distinct differences in end-member stable isotope composition. In this study, we combine high-frequency laser spectroscopy with eddy covariance techniques to critically evaluate isotope flux partitioning of F-ET over a grass field during a 15 day experiment. Following the application of a 30 mm water pulse, green grass coverage at the study site increased from 0 to 10% of ground surface area after 6 days and then began to senesce. Using isotope flux partitioning, transpiration increased as a fraction of total vapor flux from 0% to 40% during the green-up phase, after which this ratio decreased while exhibiting hysteresis with respect to green grass coverage. Daily daytime leaf-level gas exchange measurements compare well with daily isotope flux partitioning averages (RMSE=0.0018 g m(-2) s(-1)). Overall the average ratio of F-T to F-ET was 29%, where uncertainties in Keeling plot intercepts and transpiration composition resulted in an average of uncertainty of similar to 5% in our isotopic partitioning of F-ET. Flux-variance similarity partitioning was partially consistent with the isotope-based approach, with divergence occurring after rainfall and when the grass was stressed. Over the average diurnal cycle, local meteorological conditions, particularly net radiation and relative humidity, are shown to control partitioning. At longer time scales, green leaf area and available soil water control F-T/F-ET. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of combining isotope flux partitioning and flux-variance similarity theory to estimate water use efficiency at the landscape scale.
   Key Points Isotopic flux partitioning separates evaporation and transpiration from bulk flux Results compare well with scaled leaf-level observations and flux-variance similarity theory Results differ from flux-variance similarity theory during stressed periods

AB We introduce a perturbation method for the forward modeling of transient diffusion phenomena in aquifers with pressure measurements acquired at arbitrary observation points. Our numerical approach requires only two simulations to compute the Permeability Sensitivity Function (PSF) at an observation point under multi-source and multi-rate conditions; one simulation captures the pressure solution due to the flow history of the sources, while the second simulation is required to extract the Green's function of the groundwater system. The PSF is calculated on the spatial-temporal domain by convolving the gradients of the pressure solution and of the Green's function. The first-order term in the perturbation expansion is obtained by weighting the spatial variations of permeability with a flow-history-dependent PSF.
   Our work confirms the flexibility and reliability of the method after successful validation with forward numerical simulations in cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates. Multidimensional synthetic studies including multi-well and formation testing conditions, were examined for diverse anisotropy-dominated fluid-flow regimes. Against perturbations of more than one order of magnitude in background permeability, results show that first-order approximations can be computed in tens of CPU seconds with relative errors in pressure of <7%. Results indicate that sensitivity functions enable improved qualitative understanding of permeability-pressure correlations and local Darcy flow dynamics.

AB High-frequency components of precipitation variability have been an important focus of study during the last few decades in Chile. Low-frequency variations, on the other hand, have received less attention, especially in association with multi-decadal cycles that can affect variability trends of precipitation in the long term. This study analyzes these low-frequency patterns of precipitation in Chile (>30 years), and their relationship to global Sea Sulfate Temperatures (SSTs), with special focus on associations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) indices. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and its Multi-Channel version (MSSA) techniques were applied to a dataset containing long instrumental records of monthly precipitation aggregated yearly and seasonally. The relationships between the low-frequency variability of precipitation and the PDO are significant to the north of the country, whereas connections with the AMO are significant to the north and also to the south. This is also evident from the global spatial correlation analysis of low-frequency precipitation modes and SSTs, where the southernmost station shows a strong relationship with the Atlantic Ocean. We conclude that a significant multi-decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60 years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of Chile. This low-frequency variability seems to be largely linked to PDO and AMO modulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global monitoring of seasonal snow water equivalent (SWE) has advanced significantly over the past decades. However, challenges remain when estimating SWE from passive and active microwave signatures, because a priori characterization of snow properties is required for SWE retrievals. Numerical experiments have shown that utilizing physical snow models to acquire snowpack characterization can potentially improve microwave-based SWE retrievals. This study aims to identify the challenges of assimilating active and passive microwave signatures with physical snow models, and to examine solutions to those challenges. Guided by observations from a point-based study, we designed a sensitivity experiment to quantify the effects of changes in the physically modeled SWE-and of corresponding changes to other snowpack properties-to the microwave-based SWE retrievals. The results indicate that assimilating microwave signatures with physical snow models face some critical challenges associated with the physical relationship between SWE and snow microstructure. We demonstrate these challenges can be overcome if the microwave algorithms account for these relationships.

AB Soil moisture is a crucial component supporting vegetation dynamics in drylands. Despite increasing attention on fog in dryland ecosystems, the statistical characterization of fog distribution and how fog affects soil moisture dynamics have not been seen in literature. To this end, daily fog records over two years (Dec 1, 2014-Nov 1, 2016) from three sites within the Namib Desert were used to characterize fog distribution. Two sites were located within the Gobabeb Research and Training Center vicinity, the gravel plains and the sand dunes. The third site was located at the gravel plains, Kleinberg. A subset of the fog data during rainless period was used to investigate the effect of fog on soil moisture. A stochastic modeling framework was used to simulate the effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics. Our results showed that fog distribution can be characterized by a Poisson process with two parameters (arrival rate. and average depth a (mm)). Fog and soil moisture observations from eighty (Aug 19, 2015-Nov 6, 2015) rainless days indicated a moderate positive relationship between soil moisture and fog in the Gobabeb gravel plains, a weaker relationship in the Gobabeb sand dunes while no relationship was observed at the Kleinberg site. The modeling results suggested that mean and major peaks of soil moisture dynamics can be captured by the fog modeling. Our field observations demonstrated the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics during rainless periods at some locations, which has important implications on soil biogeochemical processes. The statistical characterization and modeling of fog distribution are of great value to predict fog distribution and investigate the effects of potential changes in fog distribution on soil moisture dynamics.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of transverse dispersion for dilution and mixing of solutes but most observations have remained limited to two-dimensional sand-box models. We present a new core-flood test to characterize solute transport in 3-D natural-rock media. A device consisting of three annular regions was used for fluid injection into a cylindrical rock core. Pure water was injected into the center and outer region and a Nal solution into the middle region. Steady state transverse dispersion of Nal was visualized with an X-ray medical CT-scanner for a range of Peclet numbers. Three methods were used to calculate D-t: (1) fitting an analytical solution, (2) analyzing the second-central moment, and (3) analyzing the dilution index and reactor ratio. Transverse dispersion decreased with distance due to flow focusing. Furthermore, D-t in the power-law regime showed sub-linear behavior. Overall, the reactor ratios were high confirming the homogeneity of Berea sandstone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The free surface profile and outflow hydrograph for groundwater under conditions of steady uniform recharge followed by recession have been studied in viscous fluid model tests, using a sloping bed with a gradient of 0.2. The data have been compared with the nonlinear Boussinesq model and a modification of that model simulating the outflow seepage surface, obtained from a finite difference solution of the free boundary problem. It is shown that for a given bed slope, there is close to a linear relationship between outflow and storage raised to a power n, where n ranges from almost 2 for zero slopes to just above 1 at a gradient of 0.3. There is also a simple relationship between outflow and storage in the final stage of recession, when a drainage front occurs on the bed. These results lead to simple algorithms for prediction of the outflow under unsteady recharge conditions.

AB A series of flume experiments was conducted to investigate how unidirectional surface waves interact with a rough boundary. The roughness consisted of several arrays of ribs with varied pitch-to-height ratios (L/d=2, 4, and 8; L=pitch distance and d=rib height). The mean flow and its key turbulence parameters associated with the contributions of burst-sweep cycles of the Reynolds shear stress were analyzed to examine the interaction of combined wave-current flow over ribs. The inner scaling of the mean velocity over the rib roughness resulted in a downward shift of the log-law region. The probability distributions of the velocity fluctuations exhibited a unimodal form in the presence or absence of surface waves in the ambient flow. The streamwise spectral and cospectral energy distributions differed due to the rib spacing and superimposed surface wave. This study also reports the dominant turbulent bursting events (i.e., ejections and sweeps) that contribute to the total Reynolds shear stress for current flow- and wave-induced cases. The effect of the chain of ribs on higher-order moments subject to wave-current interactions is also explored, because momentum transport is sensitive to symmetry breaking and intermittency.

AB We present an extensive experimental data set of particle release from natural porous media saturated with monovalent cations. The generation process of mobile colloidal particles is studied by means of leaching of saturated laboratory columns packed with a noncalcareous soil material with various monovalent electrolytes and by analyzing the colloids in the effluent over typically 1000 pore volumes. The concentration of released particles cannot be modeled with simple first-order kinetics but can be rationalized in terms of a distribution of release rate coefficients k. The experimentally observed effluent concentration often decays with time as a power law c proportional to t(-(alpha +1)) for long times, suggesting a distribution of release rate coefficients p (k) proportional to k(alpha -1) for small k. The observed values of exponent alpha range between 0.01 and 0.8. The composition of the pore water is found to have a profound influence on the particle release characteristics. With decreasing salt concentration the rate for particle release increases. Anionic organic and inorganic ligands have a major effect on the release process. For the ligands studied, the amount of released particles decreases in the sequence malonate, chloride, phtalate, and azide.

TI Mapping snow distribution in the Alaskan Arctic using aerial photography

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID ALPINE CATCHMENT; COVER; MODEL; SIMULATIONS
AB A method is presented for mapping the end-of-winter snow distribution in the Arctic using vertical aerial photographs taken during the melt. The photos show a limited number of distinctive snowmelt patterns that arise reliably year after year. Data and results from an energy balance melt model indicate that the patterns are not caused by differential melt but instead represent areas of distinctive end-of-winter snow depth. A map of these snowmelt patterns-is thus a map of the end-of-winter snow distribution. Because wind transport of snow is common, the patterns are closely related to the topography. Rules based on this pattern-topography relationship are developed and used to map the snow cover directly from topographic maps for three areas covering similar to 220 km(2) of the Kuparuk Basin in northern Alaska. Analysis of the snow maps suggests that about 75% of the area was mapped correctly. Applicability, reliability, and limitations of this mapping approach are discussed.

AB The efficiency of mixing in density-driven natural-convection is largely governed by the aquifer permeability, which is heterogeneous in practice. The character (fingering, stable mixing or channeling) of flow-driven mixing processes depends primarily on the permeability heterogeneity character of the aquifer, i.e., on its degree of permeability variance (Dykstra-Parsons coefficient) and the correlation length. Here we follow the ideas of Waggoner et al. (1992) [13] to identify different flow regimes of a density-driven natural convection flow by numerical simulation. Heterogeneous fields are generated with the spectral method of Shinozuka and Jan (1972)[13], because the method allows the use of power-law variograms. In this paper, we extended the classification of Waggoner et al. (1992) [13] for the natural convection phenomenon, which can be used as a tool in selecting optimal fields with maximum transfer rates of CO2 into water. We observe from our simulations that the rate of mass transfer of CO2 into water is higher for heterogeneous media. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Passive microwave airborne remote sensing was employed to collect daily brightness temperature (T-B) and near-surface (0-5 cm depth) soil water content (referred to as "soil water content") data during June 10-18, 1992. in the Little Washita watershed, Oklahoma. A comparison of multitemporal data with the soils data revealed a direct correlation between changes in T-B and soil water content, and soil texture. Regression relationships were developed for the ratio of percent sand to percent clay (RSC) and effective saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) in terms of T-B and soil water content change. Validation of results indicated that both RSC and K-sat can be estimated with adequate accuracy. The relationships are valid for the region with Small variation Of soil organic matter content, soils with fewer macropores, and limiting experimental conditions. However, the findings have potential to employ microwave remote sensing for obtaining quick estimates of soil properties over large areas.

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are introduced as a time series filter that can assess how the relationship between streamflow and sediment concentration or load changes over time in response to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances or long-term changes. The filter operates by updating parameter values using a recursive Bayesian design that responds to 1 day-ahead forecast errors while also accounting for observational noise. The estimated time series of rating curve parameters can then be used to diagnose multiscale (daily-decadal) variability in sediment yield after accounting for fluctuations in streamflow. The technique is applied in a case study examining changes in turbidity load, a proxy for sediment load, in the Esopus Creek watershed, part of the New York City drinking water supply system. The results show that turbidity load exhibits a complex array of variability across time scales. The DLM highlights flood event-driven positive hysteresis, where turbidity load remained elevated for months after large flood events, as a major component of dynamic behavior in the rating curve relationship. The DLM also produces more accurate 1 day-ahead loading forecasts compared to other static and time-varying rating curve methods. The results suggest that DLMs provide a useful tool for diagnosing changes in sediment-discharge relationships over time and may help identify variability in sediment concentrations and loads that can be used to inform dynamic water quality management.

AB This paper discusses ways in which the tree-ring-based reconstruction of paleohydrology can be better understood and better utilized to support water resource management, especially in cold semiarid regions. The relationships between tree growth as represented by tree ring chronologies (TRCs), runoff (Q), precipitation (P), and evapotranspiration (ET) are discussed and analyzed within both statistical and hydrological contexts. Data from the Oldman River Basin (OMRB), Alberta, Canada, are used to demonstrate the relevant issues. Instrumental records of Q and P data were available while actual ET was estimated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model developed in this study. Correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between TRCs and each of Q, P, and ET over the entire historical record (globally) as well as locally in time within the wet and dry subperiods. Global and local correlation strengths and linear relationships appear to be substantially different. This outcome particularly affects tree-ring-based inferences about the hydrology of wet and dry episodes when reconstructions are made using regression models. Important findings include (i) reconstruction of paleo-runoff may not be as credible as paleo-precipitation and paleo-evapotranspiration; (ii) a moving average window of P and ET larger than 1 year might be necessary for reconstruction of these variables; and (iii) the long-term mean of reconstructed P, Q, and ET leads us to conclude that there is uncertainty about the past climate. Finally, we suggest using the topographic index to prejudge side suitability for dendrohydrological analysis.

ID UNSATURATED ZONE; BIODEGRADATION; GASOLINE; PERMEABILITY; MODELS; RATES
AB We calibrate a stoichiometrically coupled soil gas diffusion model with spatially resolved observations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, total hydrocarbon, and trichloroethylene vapor concentrations in the unsaturated zone above a weathered jet fuel/solvent spill at Plattsburgh Air Force Base in upstate New York. The calibration suggests that aerobic microorganisms in the capillary fringe degrade jet fuel vapor at a steady rate of 9.5 mu g hydrocarbons (m(-2) s(-1)). The solvent does not degrade in the fringe, however, and the model and data estimate a steady evaporation rate of 1.2 x 10(-2) mu g TCE (m(-2) (.) s(-1)). Barometric pumping slightly alters the steady concentration profile at Plattsbur,oh, although the transient advective flux is the same order of magnitude as the steady diffusive flux. We derive a simple perturbation theory for the second-order transient concentration corrections and include it in the calibration. The perturbation theory is valid at Plattsburgh because the soil is uniform and permeable with a relatively deep capillary fringe.

AB The ability of least square support vector machine (LSSVM) is investigated in this paper for modeling discharge-suspended sediment relationship. The daily stream flow and suspended sediment concentration data from two stations on the Eel River in California were used as case studies. In the first part of the study, the LSSVM was compared with those of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and sediment rating curve (SRC) in the prediction of upstream and downstream station sediment data, separately. Two different algorithms, Levenberg-Marquardt and Conjugate Gradient, were employed for the ANN applications. For evaluating the ability of the models, root mean square errors, mean absolute errors and determination coefficient statistics were used. Comparison results showed that the LSSVM model was able to produce better results than the ANN models. LSSVM and ANN models were found to be better than the SRC model for the upstream station. For the downstream station, however. SRC model outperformed the LSSVM and ANN models. In the second part of the study, the models were compared to each other in estimation of downstream suspended sediment data by using data from both stations. It was found that the LSSVM model performs slightly better than the ANN models and both models performed much better than the SRC model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TRANSIENT STORAGE; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE
AB We provide an efficient method to estimate processing rates through simple algebraic relationships derived from the transient storage model equations. The method is based on the transport equations, but eliminates the need to calibrate highly uncertain (and intermediate) parameters. We demonstrate that under some common stream transport conditions dispersion does not play an important role in the estimation of processing rates and, therefore, can be neglected. Under such conditions, no computer modeling is needed to estimate processing rates. We also derive algebraic equations to estimate processing rates of target solutes (such as dissolved oxygen) with proxy-tracers (such as resazurin), and show that even if both the target and proxy reactions happen in exactly the same locations at rates that are linearly proportional, the exact relationship between the two volume-averaged rates can be nonlinear and a function of transport. However, the uncertainty in the estimation of the target processing rate is linearly proportional to the proxy-tracer processing rate.

TI A stochastic model of longitudinal dispersion of bed sediment based on

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English

ID PARTICLES
AB Various stochastic models have been developed for determining the transport rate and dispersion of sand by water flowing over a sand bed, Most of these models are based on one or another form of the theory of random walk. Since any such theory is concerned with a random displacement of a single particle, these models are not always suitable to describe dispersion of a group of sediment particles. This is due to the fact that every such model implicitly requires that all particles are characterized by a property commonly called 'identical transport characteristics'. This paper is concerned with a stochastic model of longitudinal dispersion of sediment particles where the last condition is not required. A general solution (for both, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptionl is presented, assuming only that the granulation curve of the observed particles is given and that the particles with the same granulation have the same transport characteristics.

AB A flow pattern is characterized by aquifer features and the number, type, and distribution of stagnation points (locations where the discharge is zero). This article identifies a condition for transition of flow patterns in two-dimensional groundwater flow obeying Darcy's law by examining changes in stagnation points, using the Taylor series expansion of the discharge vector. It is found that the three standard types of stagnation points (minimums, maximums, and saddle points) are completely characterized by the first-order term containing the discharge gradient tensor. However, when the determinant of the tensor becomes zero, stagnation points of other types characterized by higher-order terms come into existence. In this article, we call these zero-determinant stagnation points as critical stagnation points; they may emerge suddenly, split to a set of new stagnation points, or disappear from the flow, resulting in transitions of flow patterns. Examples of both transient and steady flows are used to illustrate the usefulness and significance of critical stagnation points. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydraulic conductivity profiles (HCPs) are of crucial importance for 3-dimensional flow and transport groundwater models. Easy and inexpensive methods for the estimation of such profiles increase their availability and strengthen the efficiency of the models. In this study a method is presented, which combines the electrical resistivity (ER) measured over the depth of the aquifer in a borehole and the response of the aquifer to the short duration pumping from the borehole. The hydraulic conductivity profile is calculated from the Kozeny-Carman equation, in which the profiles of the porosity and the mean grain size (MGS) are required. Porosity is calculated from Archie's law using the intrinsic formation factor, which results from the ER. MGS is calculated from the porosity using a relationship between them. The initial form of this relationship is obtained from literature data and is then adjusted to the conditions of each particular case. The adjustment is achieved by calibrating a MODFLOW based groundwater model, so that it sufficiently simulates the temporal variation of the water level measured in the borehole during the short pumping. The method is applied to the estimation of the HCP in an unconsolidated alluvial aquifer in Greece. The sensitivity of the results to the parameters and assumptions used in the method is investigated and discussed.

Previous work has shown that catchments with thawing frozen soils due to the warming climate are expected to show changes in their storage-discharge relationship. In this study, we use a mechanistic modelling approach to demonstrate that a thawing catchment underlain with continuous permafrost undergoes a dramatic change in storage-discharge relationship. We demonstrate that the effect of permafrost thaw, conceptualized as a reduction of an impermeable layer in the subsurface, will likely only be clearly observable as a change in slope of the recession curve of catchments with hillslope gradients>5 %. For flat catchments (<1% hillslope gradient), we find no relation with permafrost extent and change in recession curve slope will likely be dominated by changes in active layer parameters, such as in shallow surface permeability (Hydraulic Conductivity, above permafrost) and shallow surface and subsurface water retention (Specific Yield of Groundwater & Specific Yield of Surface). For mildly sloped Arctic catchments (5 % hillslope gradient), change in recession curve slope is controlled both by changes in permafrost extent and the subsurface flow length and subsurface hydraulic properties for the shallow flow, with minimal impact from overland flow properties and changes in meteorological factors. For moderately sloped Arctic catchments (10 % hillslope gradient), change in recession curve slope change is dominated by changes in permafrost extent, and secondly by changes in the subsurface flow length and sub-surface hydraulic properties, with no impact from meteorological factors or changes in overland flow properties. Several of the parameters found to be driving shifts in recession curve slopes in our modeling, such as changes in active layer thickness and the formation of taliks, are more likely than others to evolve with the ongoing Arctic climate change in hillslopes, helping us understand what drives the real-world increases in non-linearity of storage-discharge relationships.

AB Thirty year normal (1981-2010) monthly latent heat fluxes (ET) over the conterminous United States were estimated by a modified Advection-Aridity model from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) radiation and wind as well as Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) air and dew-point temperature data. Mean annual ET values were calibrated with PRISM precipitation (P) and validated against United States Geological Survey runoff (Q) data. At the six-digit Hydrologic Unit Code level (sample size of 334) the estimated 30 year normal runoff (P - ET) had a bias of 18 mm yr(-1), a root-mean-square error of 96 mm yr(-1), and a linear correlation coefficient value of 0.95, making the estimates on par with the latest Land Surface Model results but without the need for soil and vegetation information or any soil moisture budgeting.

AB An implementation of the complementary relationship hypothesis (Bouchet's hypothesis) for estimating regional evapotranspiration within two rainfall-runoff models is proposed and evaluated in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in Australia, France and the USA. Complementary relationship models are attractive approaches to estimating actual evapotranspiration because they rely solely on climatic variables. They are even more interesting since they are supported by a conceptual description underlying the interactions between the evapotranspirating surface and the atmospheric boundary layer, which was highlighted by Bouchet (1963). However, these approaches appear to be in contradiction with the methods prevailing in rainfall-runoff models, which compute actual evapotranspiration using soil moisture accounting procedures. The approach adopted in this article is to introduce the estimation of actual evapotranspiration provided by complementary relationship models (complementary relationship for areal evapotranspiration and advection aridity) into two rainfall-runoff models. Results show that directly using the complementary relationship approach to estimate actual evapotranspiration does not give better results than the soil moisture accounting procedures. Finally, we discuss feedback mechanisms between potential evapotranspiration and soil water availability, and their possible impact on rainfall-runoff modelling.

AB Seminal papers by Brutsaert (1964) and Brutsaert and Luthin (1964) provided the first rigorous theoretical framework for examining the poroelastic behavior of unsaturated soils, including an important application linking acoustic wave propagation to soil hydraulic properties. Theoretical developments during the 50 years that followed have led Lo et al., (2005) to a comprehensive model of these phenomena, but the relationship of its elasticity parameters to standard poroelasticity parameters measured in hydrogeology has not been established. In the present study, we develop this relationship for three key parameters, the Gassman modulus, Skempton coefficient, and Biot-Willis coefficient by generalizing them to an unsaturated porous medium. We demonstrate the remarkable result that well-known and widely applied relationships among these parameters for a porous medium saturated by a single fluid are also valid under very general conditions for unsaturated soils. We show further that measurement of the Biot-Willis coefficient along with three of the six elasticity coefficients in the model of Lo et al. (2005) is sufficient to characterize poroelastic behavior. The elasticity coefficients in the model of Lo et al. (2005) are sensitive to the dependence of capillary pressure on water saturation and its viscous-drag coefficients are functions of relative permeability, implying that hysteresis in the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function should affect acoustic wave behavior in unsaturated soils. To quantify these as-yet unknown effects, we performed numerical simulations for Dune sand at two representative wave excitation frequencies. Our results show that the acoustic wave investigated by Brutsaert and Luthin (1964) propagates at essentially the same speed during imbibition and drainage, but is attenuated more during drainage than imbibition. Overall, effects on acoustic wave behavior caused by hysteresis become more significant as the excitation frequency increases.

AB Oxidative weathering of sedimentary rocks plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Rhenium (Re) has been proposed as a tracer of rock organic carbon (OCpetro) oxidation. However, the sources of Re and its mobilization by hydrological processes remain poorly constrained. Here, we examine dissolved Re as a function of water discharge, using samples collected from three alpine catchments that drain sedimentary rocks in Switzerland (Erlenbach and Vogelbach) and Colorado, USA (East River). The Swiss catchments reveal a higher dissolved Re flux in the catchment with higher erosion rates, but have similar [Re]/[Na+] and [Re]/[SO42-] ratios, which indicate a dominance of Re from OCpetro. Despite differences in rock type and hydro-climatic setting, the three catchments have a positive correlation between river water [Re]/[Na+] and [Re]/[SO42-] and water discharge. We propose that this reflects preferential routing of Re from a near-surface, oxidative weathering zone. The observations support the use of Re as a proxy to trace rock-organic carbon oxidation, and suggest it may be a hydrological tracer of vadose zone processes. We apply the Re proxy and estimate CO2 release by OCpetro oxidation of 5.7 (+6.6)/(-2.0) tC km(-2) yr(-1) for the Erlenbach. The overall weathering intensity was similar to 40%, meaning that the corresponding export of unweathered OCpetro in river sediments is large, and the findings call for more measurements of OCpetro oxidation in mountains and rivers as they cross floodplains.

AB The permeability heterogeneity of cross-bedded sediment increases path lengths of river-groundwater mixing (hyporheic exchange) in riverbeds and modifies the distribution of residence times. For two case studies, we numerically simulated fluid flow and solute transport through immobile bed forms composed of heterogeneous sediment and equivalent homogeneous sediment in order to clarify how cross-bedded permeability structures impact hyporheic exchange. The two permeability fields are from the cross-bedded Massillon Sandstone and modern climbing ripple deposits of the Brazos River (Texas). In both cases, permeability heterogeneity creates long hyporheic exchange paths but only slightly increases the depth of exchange relative to equivalent homogeneous sediment. In the Massillon example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of long hyporheic residence times (>3 days). In the Brazos example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of short residence times (<17 h). We attribute the different responses in residence time distributions to differences in permeability patterns near the sediment-water interface. The tails of residence time distributions extend for tens of years and conform to a power law in both heterogeneous and homogeneous sediment. Current-bed form interactions are responsible for the long tails, as opposed to permeability heterogeneity.

ID RANDOM CASCADE; BASIN; SPACE; MODEL; LAW
AB [ 1] The channel network (S) is a nonconvex set, while its basin [C( S)] is convex. We remove open-end points of the channel connectivity network iteratively to generate a traveltime sequence of networks (S-n). The convex hulls of these traveltime networks provide an interesting topological quantity, which has not been noted thus far. We compute lengths of shrinking traveltime networks L(S-n) and areas of corresponding convex hulls C(S-n), the ratios of which provide convexity measures CM(S-n) of traveltime networks. A statistically significant scaling relationship is found for a model network in the form L(S-n) similar to A[ C(S-n)](0.57). From the plots of the lengths of these traveltime networks and the areas of their corresponding convex hulls as functions of convexity measures, new power law relations are derived. Such relations for a model network are CM(S-n) similar to 1/L(S-n)(0.7) and CM(S-n) similar to 1/ A[C(S-n)](0.43). In addition to the model study, these relations for networks derived from seven subbasins of Cameron Highlands region of Peninsular Malaysia are provided. Further studies are needed on a large number of channel networks of distinct sizes and topologies to understand the relationships of these new exponents with other scaling exponents that define the scaling structure of river networks.

AB [ 1] We couple a shear-stress-dependent fluvial erosion and sediment transport rule with stochastic models of ecohydrological soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. Rainfall is simulated by the Poisson rectangular pulses rainfall model with three parameters: mean rainfall intensity, duration, and interstorm period. These parameters are related to mean annual precipitation on the basis of published data. The model is used to investigate the sensitivity of grass cover and erosion potential to drought length, changes in storm frequency under fixed mean seasonal rainfall, and variations in mean annual precipitation. Three fundamental factors, amount of precipitation, storm frequency, and soil type, are predicted to control the system response. Variation in storm frequency is predicted to have a significant influence on sediment transport capacity because of its influence on vegetation dynamics. Our results predict soil loss potential to be more sensitive to a reduction in storm frequency ( under fixed mean annual precipitation) in humid ecosystems than in arid and semiarid regions. The well-known dependence between mean annual sediment yields and precipitation ( e. g., Langbein and Schumm, 1958) is reproduced by the model. Numerical experiments using different soil types underscore the importance of soil texture in controlling the magnitude and shape of such dependence. Coupling abiotic and biotic Earth surface processes under random climatic forcing is the salient aspect of our approach, opening new avenues for research in the emerging field of complex climate-soil-vegetation-landscape dynamics.

AB In multiscale modelling, multiple models are used simultaneously to describe scale-dependent phenomena in a system of interest. Here we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based multiscale modelling framework for modelling hierarchical multiscale problems. In these problems, closure relations are required for the macroscopic problem in the form of constitutive relations. However, forming explicit closures for nonlinear and hysteretic processes remains challenging. Instead, we provide a framework for learning constitutive mappings given microscale data generated according to micro and macro transitions governed by two-scale homogenisation rules. The resulting data-driven model is then coupled to a macroscale simulator leading to a hybrid ML-physics-based modelling approach. Accordingly, we apply the multiscale framework within the context of transient phenomena in dual-porosity geomaterials. In these materials, the inter-porosity flow is a complex time-dependent function making its adoption within flow simulators challenging. We explore nonlinear feedforward autoregressive ML strategies for the constitutive modelling of this sequential problem. We demonstrate how to inject the resulting surrogate constitutive model into a simulator. We then compare the resulting hybrid approach to traditional dual-porosity and microscale models on a variety of tests. We show the hybrid approach to give high-quality results with respect to explicit microscale simulations without the computational burden of the latter. Lastly, the steps provided by the multiscale framework herein are sufficiently general to be applied to a variety of multiscale settings, using different data generation and learning techniques accordingly.

AB Mineral precipitation affects the pore structure and thus transport properties of porous media. In this study, we investigated the pore-scale dynamics of precipitation in diffusion controlled systems and the resulting impacts on the effective diffusivity, using a micro-continuum reactive transport model. Forty two-dimensional pore structures representing both idealized and realistic geometries were simulated with consideration of different precipitation scenarios and rates. A homogeneous nucleation scenario reproduced patterns observed in previous experimental study showing mixing-induced precipitation, and a surface growth scenario captured the pattern for mineral precipitation on a substrate with the same or similar mineral structures. In all cases, local precipitation resulted in the reduction in the average porosity of the domain (phi) until the cessation of diffusive transport and the termination of precipitation. The minimum porosity reached was referred to as the critical porosity (phi(c)). The effective diffusivity (D-eff) decreased with phi and dropped sharply to effectively zero, that is, the critical effective diffusivity (D-effc), as phi(c) was reached. These pore-scale dynamics can be captured by a revised phi-Deff relationship that explicitly considers the critical porosity and the corresponding effective diffusivity, and the pre-exponential coefficient and the exponent of the relationship varied with initial pore structure and the precipitation kinetics. Overall, the homogeneous nucleation scenario results in systematically larger phi(c) and coefficients that give rise to a sharper decrease in diffusivity as phi(c) is approached, compared to the surface growth scenario. The revised relationship was also implemented at continuum scale and used to examine column scale diffusivity change and reactions.

AB Probabilistic methods are widely adopted for residual flood hazard assessment in flood-prone areas protected by levees. Such methods can consider various sources of uncertainty, including breach location and flood event characteristics, and allow for the quantification of the result confidence. However, the possible occurrence of multiple levee breaches during the same flood event is usually disregarded. This paper presents a probabilistic method based on levee fragility functions and basic probability rules to estimate the probability of selected breach scenarios, including multiple breaching events. The flood hazard classification is based on inundation variables calculated for flood events of different return periods. A combined 1D-2D hydrodynamic model is used for flood simulations. Probabilistic inundation extent maps and probabilistic flood hazard level maps are then created. Finally, probabilistic flood hazard estimates are summarized in a map of a suitable central tendency of the hazard level, coupled with a map of the Shannon entropy as an uncertainty indicator. This pair of statistical maps provides concise and effective information on a reference flood hazard along with the associated uncertainty. The method was applied to a region located along the middle reach of the Po River (northern Italy). Comparable central flood hazard estimates are obtained for the two sets of breaching events including or not including multiple breaches, with higher uncertainty if multiple breaches are considered. This result highlights the importance of considering multiple breaching events in flood risk management.

AB This work presents a stream tube-based analytical approach to evaluate reduction in groundwater contaminant flux resulting from partial mass reduction in a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zone. The reduction in contaminant flux, R-j, discharged from the source zone is a remediation performance metric that has a direct effect on the fundamental drivers of remediation: protection of human health and the environment. Closed form expressions are provided for analyzing remediation performance under conditions of joint spatial variability of both groundwater flow and NAPL content. The performance measures derived here are expressed in terms of measurable parameters. Spatial variability is described within a Lagrangian framework where aquifer hydrodynamic heterogeneities are characterized using nonreactive travel time distributions, while NAPL spatial distribution heterogeneity can be similarly described using reactive travel time distributions. The combined statistics of these distributions are used to evaluate the relationship between reduction in contaminant mass, R-m, and R-j. A portion of the contaminant mass in the source zone is assumed to be removed via in situ flushing remediation, with the initial and final conditions defined as steady state natural gradient groundwater flow through the contaminant source zone. The combined effects of aquifer and NAPL heterogeneities are shown to be captured in a single parameter, reactive travel time variability, which was determined to be the most important factor controlling the relationship between R-m and R-j. It is shown that as heterogeneity in aquifer properties and NAPL spatial distribution increases, less mass reduction is required to achieve a given flux reduction, although the overall source longevity increases. When rate-limited dissolution is important, the efficiency of remediation, in terms of both mass and flux reduction, is reduced. However, at many field sites the combined effects of field-scale heterogeneities and site aging will result in favorable relationships between mass reduction and flux reduction.

AB To enable prioritization among measures for ecological restoration, knowing the expected benefits and consequences of implementation is imperative but rarely explicitly quantified. We developed a novel method to prioritize among environmental flow measures to rehabilitate ecosystems in the Ume River catchment in northern Sweden, a river system heavily regulated for hydropower production. Our strategy was to identify measures with minimal impact on hydropower production while providing substantial environmental benefits. Based on field surveys of remaining natural values and potential for ecological rehabilitation, we quantified the projected gain in habitat area of implementing environmental flows for target organism groups, for example, lotic fish species and riparian vegetation, along the whole river length. We quantified the consequences for hydropower production by identifying a set of hydropower operational rules reflecting the constraints added by environmental flows. We then used production optimization software to calculate changes in hydropower production and revenues. Implementing restrictions on zero-flow events by mandating minimum discharge at all run-of-river hydropower stations and allocating 1%-12% of mean annual discharge to bypassed reaches in the entire catchment would result in a 2.1% loss of annual electricity production. Adding flow to fishways would increase the loss to 3.1% per year. With implementation of more natural water-level fluctuations in run-of-river impoundments, the loss increases to 3.8%. These actions would increase the habitat for lotic species like the grayling Thymallus more than threefold and increase the area of riparian vegetation by about 66%. Our method forms a basis for ongoing implementation of nationwide environmental rehabilitation schemes.

AB Suspended sediment loads can coarsen or fine as a function of flow. The flow-load gradation relationships can also vary nonmonotonically. This complex relationship between flow and load gradation complicates sediment model boundary condition selection and sediment rating curve analysis. This study analyzed flow-gradation data from 78 gages in the continental United States, exploring trends and tendencies in the flow-gradation relationships. Results were then compared to the flow-gradation trends generated by sediment capacity equations and a meta-analysis of sediment model data. Several systems, with abundant sediment supply fined with flow. However, most gage data and calibrated model inputs coarsened with flow. When nonmonotonic models were considered, one-third to one-half of the gages fit a second-order curve, coarsening over low-to-moderate flows (up to an average annual exceedance probability of approximate to 30%) and fining over higher flows. The low-flow-coarsening trend was generally stronger than high-flow-fining trends. Many of these second-order trends demonstrated behavior more like asymptotic coarsening. They coarsened until they reached a maximum physical grain size limit and gradation fined slightly or remained constant beyond the threshold flow. The dominance of flow-coarsening suggests most of the rivers surveyed (which included a bias toward large, regulated rivers) are supply limited. Supply limited (bed regulated) rivers tend to coarsen with flow, while capacity limited, high supply systems tend to fine with flow. Sediment capacity equations computed a variety of flow-gradation trends. Using transport functions to compute load-gradation model boundary conditions will often diverge from (or even invert) observed trends, especially in supply limited systems.
   Plain Language Summary As river flow increases, the sediment load (the sand and silt the water transports) increases. Scientists and engineers try to compute relationships between flow and sediment load for a wide range of economic and environmental applications, like computing how long the river will take to fill a reservoir with sediment or if the river will burry or scour a salmon habitat restoration project. But the suspended sediment load includes particles of various size (from silt finer than 0.004 mm to coarse sand larger than 1 mm). So as the load increases, the mixture of grain sizes changes. The size of the load material can also influence economic and environmental decisions.

AB Empirical sensitivity analyses are important for evaluation of the effects of a changing climate on water resources and ecosystems. Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g., forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western U.S. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R-2=0.87, and SRT, R-2=0.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming.

AB Hydrological model sensitivity to climate change can be defined as the response of a particular hydrological model to a known quantum of climate change. This paper estimates the hydrological sensitivity, measured as the percentage change in mean annual runoff, of two lumped parameter rainfall-runoff models, SIMHYD and AWBM and an empirical model, Zhang01, to changes in rainfall and potential evaporation. These changes are estimated for 22 Australian catchments covering a range of climates, from cool temperate to tropical and moist to arid. The results show that the models display different sensitivities to both rainfall and potential evaporation changes. The SIMHYD, AWBM and Zhang01 models show mean sensitivities of 2.4%, 2.5% and 2.1% change in mean annual flow for every 1% change in mean annual rainfall, respectively. All rainfall sensitivities have a lower limit of 1.8% and show upper limits of 4.1%, 3.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The results for potential evaporation change are -0.5%, -0.8% and -1.0% for every 1% increase in mean annual potential evaporation, respectively, with changes rainfall being approximately 3-5 times more sensitive than changes in potential evaporation for each 1% change in climate. Despite these differences, the results show similar correlations for several catchment characteristics. The most significant relationship is between percent change in annual rainfall and potential evaporation to the catchment runoff coefficient. The sensitivity of both A and B factors decreases with an increasing runoff coefficient, as does the uncertainty in this relationship. The results suggest that a first-order relationship can be used to give a rough estimate of changes in runoff using estimates of change in rainfall and potential evaporation representing small to modest changes in climate. Further work will develop these methods further, by investigating other regions and changes on the subannual scale. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Flow and turbulence structure around an in-stream rectangular cylinder
   with scour hole
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DETACHED EDDY SIMULATION; HORSESHOE VORTEX; LES; TRANSPORT; SPHERE; PIER
AB Most of the erosion around obstacles present in alluvial streams takes place after the formation of a scour hole of sufficiently large dimensions to stabilize the large-scale oscillations of the horseshoe vortex (HV) system. The present paper uses eddy resolving techniques to reveal the unsteady dynamics of the coherent structures present in the flow field around an in-stream vertical cylinder (e. g., bridge pier) with a large scour hole at a channel Reynolds number defined with the channel depth and the bulk channel velocity of 2.4 x 10(5). The cylinder has a rectangular section and is placed perpendicular to the incoming flow. The geometry of the scour hole is obtained from an experiment conducted as part of the present work. The mechanisms driving the bed erosion during the advanced stages of the scour process around the vertical plate are discussed. Simulation results demonstrate the critical role played by these large-scale turbulent eddies and their interactions in driving the local scour. The paper analyzes the changes in the flow and turbulence structure with respect to the initial stages of the scour process (flat bed conditions) for a cylinder of identical shape and orientation. Results show the wake loses its undular shape due to suppression of the antisymmetrical shedding of the roller vortices. Also, the nature of the interactions between the necklace vortices of the HV system and the eddies present inside the detached shear layers (DSLs) changes as the scour process evolves. This means that information on the vortical structure of the flow at the initiation of the scour process, or during its initial stages, are insufficient to understand the local scour mechanisms. The paper also examines the effect of the shape of the obstruction on the dynamics of the vortical eddies and how it affects the bed erosion processes during the advanced stages of the local scour. In particular, the paper provides an explanation for the observed increase in the maximum scour depth for bed-mounted cylinders of rectangular section compared to cylinders of same width but of circular section. This increase is explained by the larger coherence of the HV system, the increased regularity of the interactions between the legs of the necklace vortices and the eddies shed in the DSLs, and the stronger coherence of the wake eddies, during both the initial and the later stages of the local scour process, for cases in which the obstruction has sharp edges that fix the separation point on the in-stream obstacle at all flow depths (e.g., rectangular cylinder).

AB We investigate the impact of ice coverage on flow and bed shear stress profiles in a river bend. We perform field measurements using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler in a bend of the Red River, North Dakota, the United States. Field campaigns were carried out under both open-surface and ice-covered conditions in 2020 and 2021. Our results show that the time-averaged velocity profile follows closely the quartic solution (Guo et al., 2017, under full ice coverage. While the flow profile under open-surface condition follows closely the logarithmic law near the bed, it is challenging to identify the logarithmic layers in our measured data under ice-covered condition. Our results also show that the impact of ice coverage is most significant near both banks where the vertical velocity profile is modified significantly due to the interaction of turbulent flows with the ice cover. Our results suggest that the bend curvature and ice coverage both have significant impacts on the velocity profile as well as the distribution of the bed shear stresses. Our findings provide new insights on sediment transport processes of ice-covered rivers, especially during the break-up period when the surface coverage changes rapidly.

AB This study contributes the Deep Uncertainty (DU) Pathways framework for bridging long-term water supply infrastructure investments and improved short-term water portfolio management (e.g., restrictions, water transfers, financial instruments, etc.) to yield a regional water supply policy robust to supply and financial failures. The DU Pathways framework combines flexibility-providing risk-of-failure (ROF) decision rules, dynamic adaptive policy pathways concepts, and a careful consideration of time-evolving information feedbacks to yield management-conditioned infrastructure pathways for regions. The DU Pathways' framework has been developed to carefully consider multi-actor regional contexts with the goal of aiding stakeholders in discovering pathway policies that attain high performance levels for supply reliability and financial stability across challenging, deeply uncertain futures and to guide robustness compromises that may be necessary between regional actors. As demonstrated in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, DU Pathways clarifies how to identify robust infrastructure investment and management policies across the municipalities of Raleigh, Durham, Cary, and Chapel Hill. Our results provide insights about the most cost-effective infrastructure options to be pursued in the near-term, clarify which sources of uncertainty drive the performance tradeoffs and robustness conflicts across the regional system, and demonstrate valuable information on the diversity of interdependent failure modes that may emerge across the multiple actors implementing each candidate policy.

AB Molecular diffusion of dissolved species is a fundamental mass transport process affecting many environmental and technical processes. Whereas diffusive transport of single tracers can be described by Fick's law, a multicomponent approach based on the Nernst-Planck equation is required for charge-coupled transport of ions. The numerical solution of the Nernst-Planck equation requires special attention with regard to properties that are required at interfaces of numerical cells when using a finite difference or finite volume method. Weighted arithmetic and harmonic averages are used in most codes that can solve the Nernst-Planck equation. This way of averaging is correct for diffusion coefficients but inappropriate for solute concentrations at interfaces. This averaging approach leads to charge balance problems and thus to numerical instabilities near interfaces separating grid volumes with contrasting properties. We argue that a logarithmic-differential average should be used. Here this result is generalized, and it is demonstrated that it generally leads to improved numerical stability and accuracy of concentrations computed near material interfaces. It is particularly relevant when modeling semipermeable clay membranes or membranes used in water treatment processes.

AB The constitutive relationships required for the parameterization of multiphase flow and transport problems are of critical importance to hydrologic modeling. Recently, a hypothesis has been developed that predicts a functional relationship between capillary pressure, saturation, and interfacial area. A network model was developed to test this hypothesis. Microscale physical processes were simulated and volume averaging was used to derive the macroscopic measures of saturation and fluid-fluid interfacial area per volume of porous media. Results indicate that a smooth, though complex, functional relationship exists at the continuum scale. These results have direct relevance to constitutive theory and the modeling of nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution processes.

AB The paper presents a semi-analytical method for predicting the flow rate hydrograph due to a hypothetical sudden and total dam failure in a natural valley. The method generalizes the approach proposed by Hunt for the dam-break problem in a rectangular frictionless sloping channel to a valley with a cross-section area expressed by a power-law function of water depth, in order to take into account the most common shapes of natural valleys. The parameters of the deriving model can be set by exploiting data usually available concerning the dam section geometry and the reservoir storage-depth curve. The application of the technique to three different reservoirs is discussed. The results show that the flow rate hydrographs obtained at the dam site agree with the ones calculated by means of a finite volume numerical code based on two-dimensional shallow water equations.

AB We present a numerical, catchment-scale model that solves flow equations of surface and subsurface flow in a three-dimensional domain. Surface flow is described by the two-dimensional parabolic approximation of the St. Venant equation, using Manning's equation of motion; subsurface flow is described by the three-dimensional Richards' equation for the unsaturated zone and by three-dimensional Darcy's law for the saturated zone, using an integrated finite difference formulation. The hydrological component is a dynamic link library implemented within a comprehensive model which simulates surface energy, radiation budget, snow melt, potential evapotranspiration, plant development and plant water uptake. We tested the model by comparing distributed and integrated three-dimensional simulated and observed perched water depth (PWD), stream flow data, and soil water contents for a small catchment. Additional tests were performed for the snow melting algorithm as well as the different hydrological processes involved. The model successfully described the water balance and its components as evidenced by good agreement between measured and modelled data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS; WATER; HEAT; VAPOR; FLUX
AB Several versions of the Complementary Relationship (CR) between actual regional evaporation and apparent potential evaporation have recently been proposed. Few studies have compared multiple CR versions side-by-side using datasets spanning various climates and land surfaces. Filling this lack is one purpose of this project. It also investigates how various CR versions respond to changes in spatial and temporal averaging. This study uses multiple years of data from seven eddy-covariance flux stations in Australia, representing a wide range of biomes, along with global ERA5 reanalysis data products. Daily and monthly averages were used for both datasets, and the Australian observations also used weekly and yearly averages. The ERA5 data represent a scale of about 30 km, much larger than the scale represented by the flux station data. A set of five questions regarding the impact of spatial and temporal scaling on CR parameter values and performance are asked and assessed using the two datasets. Four recent CR versions are considered in answering the questions. Due to important differences between FLUXNET and ERA5 data, questions regarding temporal scaling were answered with greater confidence than those regarding spatial scaling. With these data, rescaled versions of the CR performed best overall.

AB In this study, we present the prediction of permeability from time domain spectral induced polarization (IP) data, measured in boreholes on undisturbed formations using the El-log logging-while-drilling technique. We collected El-log data and hydraulic properties on unconsolidated Quaternary and Miocene deposits in boreholes at three locations at a field site in Denmark, characterized by different electrical water conductivity and chemistry. The high vertical resolution of the El-log technique matches the lithological variability at the site, minimizing ambiguity in the interpretation originating from resolution issues. The permeability values were computed from IP data using a laboratory-derived empirical relationship presented in a recent study for saturated unconsolidated sediments, without any further calibration. A very good correlation, within 1 order of magnitude, was found between the IP-derived permeability estimates and those derived using grain size analyses and slug tests, with similar depth trends and permeability contrasts. Furthermore, the effect of water conductivity on the IP-derived permeability estimations was found negligible in comparison to the permeability uncertainties estimated from the inversion and the laboratory-derived empirical relationship.

AB Critical path analysis (CPA), originally developed to describe electrical conductance in semiconductors, has been shown recently to hold some promise in describing transport properties of porous media. I applied some previously developed concepts in CPA and percolation theory to predict permeability in a suite of sandstone, carbonate, and clay-rich samples. I assumed that the pore sizes in my samples exhibited fractal scaling and expressed the electrical formation factor as a function of porosity using universal scaling from percolation theory. The resulting CPA permeability predictions match the measured values very well. In addition, I show how considering the scale-dependence of the percolation threshold yields two characteristic length scales for transport properties: the critical pore size, and the sample size. This work suggests that the CPA framework is appropriate for describing transport properties of natural porous media, and provides a theoretical basis for understanding the permeability of tight rocks like shale in which laboratory permeability measurements are difficult.

AB Assessing the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K) in natural aquifers is fundamental to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of solutes, a process that is mainly controlled by the heterogeneity of K. In sedimentary aquifers, the vertical variations of K are typically more relevant than the horizontal ones in controlling the plume evolution at the local scale; such K vertical distributions can be inferred by combining the Lagrangian formulation of transport with the assimilation of tracer test data via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). In this work, the data for the assimilation procedure are provided by monitoring tracer tests with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Our main objective is to show the possibility of directly using ERT data by assimilating the solute travel times, instead of the concentration values, thus avoiding the need for a petrophysical law. The methodology is applied to both a synthetic and a real test case and gives a satisfactory retrieval of the K field distribution, as well as of the solute evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The partitioning tracer test (PTT) is used to quantify subsurface nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) saturations (S-N). The laboratory-measured NAPL-water partitioning coefficient (K-NW) is required to calculate the S-N. The complexing agent hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) has been used to successfully remediate NAPL-contaminated sites. Residual concentrations of HPCD may remain in the groundwater during a postremediation PTT. This investigation examines the influence of HPCD on the trichlorethene NAPL-water partitioning coefficients of several alcohol tracers. Laboratory results indicate that aqueous HPCD concentrations of 2000 mg/L result in the reduction of K-NW values by up to 33%. This effect can result in up to 33% error in the PTT-estimated S-N. The effect decreases as the original K-NW value of a tracer decreases. The relationship between K-NW values and HPCD concentrations is nonlinear and yields curves characteristic of each tracer. Empirical relationships are offered to reproduce the characteristic curves based on tracer K-NW values to allow estimates of corrected K-NW values for an arbitrary tracer.

AB The routing of bed material through channels is poorly understood. We approach the problem by observing and modeling the fate of a low-amplitude sediment wave of poorly sorted sand that we introduced into an experimental channel transporting sediment identical to that of the introduced wave. The wave essentially dispersed upstream and downstream without translation, although there was inconclusive evidence of translation late in the experiment when the wave was only 10-20 grain diameters high. Alternate bars migrated through zones of differing bed load transport rate without varying systematically in volume, celerity, or transport rate. Sediment that overpassed migrating bars was apparently responsible for dispersion of the wave. The evolution of the wave was well predicted by a one-dimensional model that contains no adjusted empirical constants. Numerical experiments demonstrate, however, that the theory does not predict sediment waves that migrate long distances downstream. Such waves can only be explained by the following processes not represented by the theory: selective bed load transport, spatial variations in bar and other form roughness, the mechanics of mobile armor, and perhaps other mechanisms.

AB Experiments were performed on transparent two-dimensional microfluidic porous systems to investigate the relationships among capillary pressure and the interfacial areas per volume between two fluid phases and one solid phase. Capillary pressures were calculated from the observed interfacial curvature of the wetting-nonwetting interface, and these correlated closely to externally measured values of applied pressure. For each applied pressure, the system established mechanical equilibrium characterized by stationary interfaces, uniform curvatures across the model, and random surface normals. To study the relationships among capillary pressure and the interfacial areas, we compare the curvature-based capillary pressure with the differential change in interfacial areas per volume as a function of wetting-phase saturation. The differential pressure contributions calculated from the experimental measurements are found to be nearly independent of the measured capillary pressure. These results suggest that other contributions to the capillary pressure must be significant when imbibition and drainage processes result in saturation gradients.

AB Input variable selection (IVS) is a necessary step in modeling water resources systems. Neglecting this step may lead to unnecessary model complexity and reduced model accuracy. In this paper, we apply the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm to identifying the most relevant set of inputs in modeling a water resources system. We further introduce two modified versions of the MRMR algorithm (alpha-MRMR and beta-MRMR), where alpha and beta are correction factors that are found to increase and decrease as a power-law function, respectively, with the progress of the input selection algorithms and the increase of the number of selected input variables. We apply the proposed algorithms to 22 reservoirs in California to predict daily releases based on a set from a 121 potential input variables. Results indicate that the two proposed algorithms are good measures of model inputs as reflected in enhanced model performance. The alpha-MRMR and beta-MRMR values exhibit strong negative correlation to model performance as depicted in lower root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] The article presents systematic numerical simulations of the temporal behavior of a passive solute in a saturated three-dimensional heterogeneous medium. The groundwater flow is derived from the linearized solution of the Darcy equation with Gauss-distributed log hydraulic conductivity. The transport of a passive solute is studied by a random-walk method, which allows for a systematic study of the temporal behavior of the effective and ensemble dispersion coefficients. The numerical results are compared to the second-order perturbation theory expressions given in two companion papers [Dentz et al., 2000a, 2000b] and to nonperturbative results which follow from Corrsin's conjecture. The low-order perturbation theory is intrinsically based on the assumption of small heterogeneity, while Corrsin's conjecture does not take into account certain contributions due to higher-order terms of the perturbation series. The simulations yield, for the first time, systematic quantitative information on the validity and the limitations of these analytic approximations. For increasing heterogeneities, considerable deviations from the theoretically predicted transport behavior are observed.

AB When determining volumetric discharge from surface measurements of currents in a river or open channel, the velocity index is typically used to convert surface velocities to depth-averaged velocities. The velocity index is given by, k = U-b/U-surf, where U-b is the depth-averaged velocity and U-surf is the local surface velocity. The USGS (United States Geological Survey) standard value for this coefficient, k = 0.85, was determined from a series of laboratory experiments and has been widely used in the field and in laboratory measurements of volumetric discharge despite evidence that the velocity index is site-specific. Numerous studies have documented that the velocity index varies with Reynolds number, flow depth, and relative bed roughness and with the presence of secondary flows. A remote method of determining depth-averaged velocity and hence the velocity index is developed here. The technique leverages the findings of Johnson and Cowen (2017) and permits remote determination of the velocity power-law exponent thereby, enabling remote prediction of the vertical structure of the mean streamwise velocity, the depth-averaged velocity, and the velocity index.

TI Robust stochastic optimization for reservoir operation

ID DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING MODELS; MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; RULES
AB Optimal reservoir operation under uncertainty is a challenging engineering problem. Application of classic stochastic optimization methods to large-scale problems is limited due to computational difficulty. Moreover, classic stochastic methods assume that the estimated distribution function or the sample inflow data accurately represents the true probability distribution, which may be invalid and the performance of the algorithms may be undermined. In this study, we introduce a robust optimization (RO) approach, Iterative Linear Decision Rule (ILDR), so as to provide a tractable approximation for a multiperiod hydropower generation problem. The proposed approach extends the existing LDR method by accommodating nonlinear objective functions. It also provides users with the flexibility of choosing the accuracy of ILDR approximations by assigning a desired number of piecewise linear segments to each uncertainty. The performance of the ILDR is compared with benchmark policies including the sampling stochastic dynamic programming (SSDP) policy derived from historical data. The ILDR solves both the single and multireservoir systems efficiently. The single reservoir case study results show that the RO method is as good as SSDP when implemented on the original historical inflows and it outperforms SSDP policy when tested on generated inflows with the same mean and covariance matrix as those in history. For the multireservoir case study, which considers water supply in addition to power generation, numerical results show that the proposed approach performs as well as in the single reservoir case study in terms of optimal value and distributional robustness.

AB The uncertainty in forecasted precipitation remains a major source of uncertainty in real time flood forecasting. Precipitation uncertainty consists of uncertainty in (i) the magnitude, (ii) temporal distribution, and (iii) spatial distribution of the precipitation. This paper presents a methodology for propagating the precipitation uncertainty through a deterministic rainfall-runoff-routing model for flood forecasting. It uses fuzzy set theory combined with genetic algorithms. The uncertainty due to the unknown temporal distribution of the precipitation is achieved by disaggregation of the precipitation into subperiods. The methodology based on fuzzy set theory is particularly useful where a probabilistic forecast of precipitation is not available. A catchment model of the Klodzko valley (Poland) built with HEC-1 and HEC-HMS was used for the application. The results showed that the output uncertainty due to the uncertain temporal distribution of precipitation can be significantly dominant over the uncertainty due to the uncertain quantity of precipitation.

AB The main processes involved in interrill erosion are soil particles detachment and transport. Detachment is caused by shear stresses created by the impacts of raindrops. After sediments are lifted in the water layer, they are transported over a distance that depends on their settling velocities and the water flow velocity. This study calculates the probabilities of interactions between raindrops during soil detachment, and between raindrops and particles during their sedimentation. Raindrops are assumed to be consistent with the Poisson process and their densities are described by raindrop size distribution functions (Marshall-Palmer, Gamma, and Lognormal laws). Interaction probabilities are calculated based on characteristic time and length scales of the shear stresses and the perturbation created by the raindrop impact inside the water layer. Under the hypothesis of a constant rainfall intensity, the results show that, during soil detachment, raindrops are almost independent. Thus, the total amount of soil detached by a rainfall is practically the sum of soil detached by its individual raindrops. Whereas during sediment transport, the probability of interaction between raindrops and settling particles is very high whatever the rainfall intensity and particle size, emphasizing the need to study further the interaction between raindrops and settling particles.

AB We investigate how the choice of injection mode impacts transport properties in kilometer-scale three-dimensional discrete fracture networks (DFN). The choice of injection mode, resident and flux-weighted, is designed to mimic different physical phenomena. It has been hypothesized that solute plumes injected under resident conditions evolve to behave similarly to solutes injected under flux-weighted conditions. Previously, computational limitations have prohibited the large-scale simulations required to investigate this hypothesis. We investigate this hypothesis by using a high-performance DFN suite, dfnWorks, to simulate flow in kilometer-scale three-dimensional DFNs based on fractured granite at the Forsmark site in Sweden, and adopt a Lagrangian approach to simulate transport therein. Results show that after traveling through a pre-equilibrium region, both injection methods exhibit linear scaling of the first moment of travel time and power law scaling of the breakthrough curve with similar exponents, slightly larger than 2. The physical mechanisms behind this evolution appear to be the combination of in-network channeling of mass into larger fractures, which offer reduced resistance to flow, and in-fracture channeling, which results from the topology of the DFN.

AB Natural bedrock rivers have various bedforms created by erosion. Flow-parallel incisional grooves formed longitudinally in bedrock are one common example of such bedforms. Although several studies have been conducted regarding these grooves, their formation processes are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a flume experiment to investigate the relationship between the flow structure and longitudinal grooves. The experimental results strongly suggest that longitudinal grooves are formed by moving sediment concentrated in multiple longitudinal pathways by turbulence-driven secondary flows. The sediment preferentially abrades the bedrock along these flow-parallel pathways resulting in longitudinal grooves in the bedrock. Measurements of the flow velocity distribution show that the positions of secondary flow cells producing the initial formation of the grooves are altered by the formation of those grooves. Because displaced secondary flows tend to make the sediment collide with the sidewalls of the longitudinal grooves, the grooves grow wider over time and some grooves partially combine with other adjacent grooves. The initial maximum number of longitudinal grooves N-max strongly depends on the river width-depth ratio B/D, which defines the number of secondary flow cells, and can be expressed as N-max = 0.5B/D. However, because some grooves coalesce with other grooves due to the effects of the displacement of secondary flows, the average number of grooves showed a relationship that can be expressed as N = 0.41B/D. Based on this relationship, we inversely estimated the flow discharge of the Abashiri River using the number of longitudinal grooves observed in the river. The result was consistent with the observed annual maximum flow discharge of the river. This suggests that the number of longitudinal grooves can be used as an indicator for estimation of the formative flow discharge in bedrock rivers.

TI Uncertainty Quantification of Medium-Term Heat Storage From Short-Term

AB In theory, aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) systems can recover in winter the heat stored in the aquifer during summer to increase the energy efficiency of the system. In practice, the energy efficiency is often lower than expected from simulations due to spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic properties or non-favorable hydrogeological conditions. A proper design of ATES systems should therefore consider the uncertainty of the prediction related to those parameters. We use a novel framework called Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) to estimate the heat storage capacity of an alluvial aquifer using a heat tracing experiment. BEL is based on two main stages: pre- and postfield data acquisition. Before data acquisition, Monte Carlo simulations and global sensitivity analysis are used to assess the information content of the data to reduce the uncertainty of the prediction. After data acquisition, prior falsification and machine learning based on the same Monte Carlo are used to directly assess uncertainty on key prediction variables from observations. The result is a full quantification of the posterior distribution of the prediction conditioned to observed data, without any explicit full model inversion. We demonstrate the methodology in field conditions and validate the framework using independent measurements.
   Plain Language Summary Geothermal energy can be extracted or stored in shallow aquifers through systems called aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES). In practice, the energy efficiency of those systems is often lower than expected because of the uncertainty related to the subsurface. To assess the uncertainty, a common method in the scientific community is to generate multiple models of the subsurface fitting the available data, a process called stochastic inversion. However this process is time consuming and difficult to apply in practice for real systems. In this contribution, we develop a novel approach to avoid the inversion process called Bayesian Evidential Learning. We are still using many models of the subsurface, but we do not try to fit the available data. Instead, we use the model to learn a direct relationship between the data and the response of interest to the user. For ATES systems, this response corresponds to the energy extracted from the system. It allows to predict the amount of energy extracted with a quantification of the uncertainty. This framework makes uncertainty assessment easier and faster, a prerequisite for robust risk analysis and decision making. We demonstrate the method in a feasibility study of ATES design.

AB [1] Hedging rule policies for reservoir operations accept small deficits in current supply to reduce the probability of a severe water shortage later. This paper expands a theoretical analysis and develops a conceptual two-period model for reservoir operation with hedging that includes uncertain future reservoir inflow explicitly. Extended analysis of the model properties and influencing factors is presented with a general utility function, addressing (1) the starting and ending water availability for hedging, (2) the range of hedging that is related to water demand levels, (3) inflow uncertainty, and (4) evaporation loss. Some intuitive knowledge on reservoir operation is proved or reconfirmed analytically; and new knowledge is derived. This theoretical analysis provides an updated basis for further theoretical study, and the theoretical findings can be used to improve numerical modeling for reservoir operation.

AB With climate warming, many regions are experiencing changes in snow accumulation and persistence. These changes are known to affect streamflow volume, but the magnitude of the effect varies between regions. This research evaluates whether variables derived from remotely sensed snow cover can be used to estimate annual streamflow at the small watershed scale across the western U.S., a region with a wide range of climate types. We compared snow cover variables derived from MODIS, snow persistence (SP), and snow season (SS), to more commonly utilized metrics, snow fraction (fraction of precipitation falling as snow, SF), and peak snow water equivalent (SWE). Each variable represents different information about snow, and this comparison assesses similarities and differences between the snow metrics. Next, we evaluated how two snow variables, SP and SWE, related to annual streamflow (Q) for 119 USGS reference watersheds and examined whether these relationships varied for wet/warm (precipitation surplus) and dry/cold (precipitation deficit) watersheds. Results showed high correlations between all snow variables, but the slopes of these relationships differed between climates, with wet/warm watersheds displaying lower SF and higher SWE for the same SP. In dry/cold watersheds, both SP and SNODAS SWE correlated with Q spatially across all watersheds and over time within individual watersheds. We conclude that SP can be used to map spatial patterns of annual streamflow generation in dry/cold parts of the region. Applying this approach to the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates that 50% of streamflow comes from areas >3,000 masl. If the relationship between SP and Q is similar in other dry/cold regions, this approach could be used to estimate annual streamflow in ungauged basins.

AB Recession flow analysis is usually conducted to infer hydraulic parameters of hillslope aquifers. Various Boussinesq equation-based models, both linear and nonlinear, have been used to analyze the recession curves for sloping aquifers, with a focus on the long-time recession behavior. Based on a modified Boussinesq equation with capillarity incorporated, we demonstrate the significant effect of unsaturated flow on the recession curve, which result in three (instead of two) power law regimes with two transition points (instead of one) corresponding to the formation of a fully unsaturated zone at the adjacent area of the upslope boundary and across the whole domain, respectively. The results show that the power of the second and third recession regime is variable, depending on the slope angles, soil types, and hillslope geometries. The unsaturated flow effects also lead to the absence of drastic drop of -dQ/dt at the transition between the first and second regime, which was predicted by previous numerical models but has not been observed in the field or laboratory experiments. These findings have important implications for recession flow analysis in studies of hillslope aquifers.

TI Hydrologic routing using nonlinear cascaded reservoirs

ID REAL-TIME; FLOOD; MODEL; OPERATION
AB A key element of hydrologic routing models is that the discharge-storage relationship is assumed to follow a certain mathematical form, usually a linear or a power function, with parameters calibrated based on existing inflow-outflow data. This assumption simplifies the model calibration process but also constrains model operation throughout the flow range, potentially introducing biases. We present a new nonlinear hydrologic river routing approach where functions are only required to be nondecreasing. River reaches are modeled as conceptual reservoir cascades, with discharge-storage and loss/gain functions identified by the data. A novel parameter estimation approach is developed to identify these functions and other model parameters within a dynamical optimization framework. It is shown that hydrologic routing functions indeed exhibit different mathematical forms at different regions of their active range, and that the new approach is reliable, efficient, and robust under observational uncertainty. The model is demonstrated in lake and river routing applications for the Nile River, and it is also applicable for the estimation of nonlinear, nondecreasing functional relationships of general dynamic systems in state-space form.

AB A substantial research effort has been aimed at elucidating the role of various physical, chemical and biological factors on microbial transport and removal in natural subsurface environments. The major motivation of such studies is an enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes for development of improved mathematical models of microbial transport and fate. In this review, traditional modeling approaches used to predict the migration and removal of microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) in saturated porous media are systematically evaluated. A number of these methods have inherent weaknesses or inconsistencies which are often overlooked or misunderstood in actual application. Some limitations of modeling methods reviewed here include the inappropriate use of the equilibrium adsorption approach, the observed breakdown of classical filtration theory, the inability of existing theories to predict microbial attachment rates, and omission of physical straining and microbe detachment. These and other issues are considered with an emphasis on current research developments. Finally, recently proposed improvements to the most commonly used filtration model are discussed, with particular consideration of straining and microbe motility. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Runoff from a small glacierized catchment in the Canadian high Arctic was monitored throughout one melt season. The stream discharge record is one aspect of a larger project involving glacier mass balance, superimposed ice formation and local climate on a glacier in the Sawtooth Range, Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. To better understand the main factors influencing the production of runoff on the glacier during the period of main summer melt, regression analyses were performed relating daily air temperature, shortwave incoming and net radiation, absorptivity and wind speed to daily glacier discharge. Air temperature at the glacier meteorological station on rain-free days is the element with the greatest correlation with runoff (r(2) = 0.57; n = 34). A multiple regression of discharge with air temperature, shortwave incoming radiation, net radiation hours and wind speed achieved the best fit (r(2) = 0.84; n = 34). Rain events (> 10 mm d(-1)) can dominate daily discharge when they occur during the period of ice melt, creating more runoff per unit area than can be produced by melt alone, and significantly reduce the accuracy of runoff predictions.

AB A method based on fuzzy set theory is presented to incorporate imprecise thermodynamic parameters into chemical equilibrium calculations of aqueous systems. Imprecision may arise from uncertainties in experimental parameter determination as well as from inconsistency of available data in the literature. Fuzzy numbers with different shapes of membership functions are used to express imprecision in a non-probabilistic sense. A solution algorithm for a system of nonlinear algebraic equations calculating the chemical equilibrium composition is combined with level set operations to solve the fuzzy chemical equlibrium problem. The method results in multiple minimizing/maximizing procedures from which the membership functions of equilibrium species concentrations are determined. An application of the proposed method to an aqueous cadmium-sulfide system illustrates the acquisition of membership functions for the thermodynamic constants out of given information. Stochastic information on measurement data are appropriately transformed into fuzzy numbers to allow for the combined calculation of different kinds of uncertainty. The results of four calculation scenarios show their strong impact on the resulting membership functions of chemical equilibrium composition and are discussed in the context of data evaluation and decision making in geochemistry.

AB The flux of terrestrial carbon across land-water boundaries influences the overall carbon balance of landscapes and the ecology and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. The local consequences and broader fate of carbon delivered to streams is determined by the overall composition of carbon inputs, including the balance of organic and inorganic forms. Yet, our understanding of how hydrologic fluxes across different land-water interfaces regulate carbon supply remains poor. We used 7 years of data from three boreal catchments to test how different land-water interfaces (i.e., forest, wetland, and lake) modulate concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane, as well as the balance among forms (e.g., DOC:CO2). Seasonal patterns in concentrations and C-Q relationships for individual carbon forms differed across catchments. DOC varied between chemostasis and transport limitation in the forest catchment, between supply limitation and chemostasis in the wetland catchment, and was persistently chemostatic in the lake outlet stream. Carbon gases were supply limited overall, but exhibited chemostasis or transport limitation in the forest and wetland catchments linked to elevated flow in summer and autumn. Unique C-Q relationships for individual forms reflected the properties of different interfaces and underpinned changes in the composition of lateral carbon supply. Accordingly, DOC dominated the carbon flux during snowmelt, whereas gas evasion increased in relative importance during other times of the year. Integrating the C-Q dynamics of individual carbon forms provides insight into the shifting composition of lateral export, and thus helps to predict how hydrologic changes may alter the fate of carbon supplied to streams.

AB Hydroclimatic processes come in all "shapes and sizes". They are characterized by different spatiotemporal correlation structures and probability distributions that can be continuous, mixed-type, discrete or even binary. Simulating such processes by reproducing precisely their marginal distribution and linear correlation structure, including features like intermittency, can greatly improve hydrological analysis and design. Traditionally, modelling schemes are case specific and typically attempt to preserve few statistical moments providing inadequate and potentially risky distribution approximations. Here, a single framework is proposed that unifies, extends, and improves a general-purpose modelling strategy, based on the assumption that any process can emerge by transforming a specific "parent" Gaussian process. A novel mathematical representation of this scheme, introducing parametric correlation transformation functions, enables straightforward estimation of the parent-Gaussian process yielding the target process after the marginal back transformation, while it provides a general description that supersedes previous specific parameterizations, offering a simple, fast and efficient simulation procedure for every stationary process at any spatiotemporal scale. This framework, also applicable for cyclostationary and multivariate modelling, is augmented with flexible parametric correlation structures that parsimoniously describe observed correlations. Real-world simulations of various hydroclimatic processes with different correlation structures and marginals, such as precipitation, river discharge, wind speed, humidity, extreme events per year, etc., as well as a multivariate example, highlight the flexibility, advantages, and complete generality of the method.

AB Water resources planning and management by water utilities have traditionally been based on consideration of water availability. However, the reliability of public water supplies can also be influenced by the quality of water bodies. In this study, we proposed a framework that integrates the analysis of risks of inadequate water quality and risks of insufficient water availability. We have developed a coupled modeling system that combines hydrological modeling of river water quantity and quality, rules for water withdrawals from rivers into storage reservoirs, and dynamical simulation of harmful algal blooms in storage reservoirs. We use this framework to assess the impact of climate change, demand growth, and land-use change on the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method is tested on the River Thames catchment in the south of England. The results show that alongside the well-known risks of rising water demand in the south of England and uncertain impacts of climate change, diffuse pollution from agriculture and effluent from upstream waste water treatment works potentially represent a threat to the reliability of public water supplies in London. We quantify the steps that could be taken to ameliorate these threats, though even a vigorous pollution-prevention strategy would not be sufficient to offset the projected effects of climate change on water quality and the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method can help water utilities to recognize their system vulnerability and evaluate the potential solutions to achieve more reliable water supplies.

TI Mechanisms of heat exchange between water and rock in karst conduits

DT Article
ID STREAM TEMPERATURE DYNAMICS; LOSING-STREAM; FLOW; TRANSPORT; RIVERS;
   IDENTIFICATION; RATES; MODEL
AB Previous studies, motivated by understanding water quality, have explored the mechanisms for heat transport and heat exchange in surface streams. In karst aquifers, temperature signals play an additional important role since they carry information about internal aquifer structures. Models for heat transport in karst conduits have previously been developed; however, these models make different, sometimes contradictory, assumptions. Additionally, previous models of heat transport in karst conduits have not been validated using field data from conduits with known geometries. Here we use analytical solutions of heat transfer to examine the relative importance of heat exchange mechanisms and the validity of the assumptions made by previous models. The relative importance of convection, conduction, and radiation is a function of time. Using a characteristic timescale, we show that models neglecting rock conduction produce spurious results in realistic cases. In contrast to the behavior of surface streams, where conduction is often negligible, conduction through the rock surrounding a conduit determines heat flux at timescales of weeks and longer. In open channel conduits, radiative heat flux can be significant. In contrast, convective heat exchange through the conduit air is often negligible. Using the rules derived from our analytical analysis, we develop a numerical model for heat transport in a karst conduit. Our model compares favorably to thermal responses observed in two different karst settings : a cave stream fed via autogenic recharge during a snowmelt event, and an allogenically recharged cave stream that experiences continuous temperature fluctuations on many timescales.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; EVAPORATION; WATER; TERRESTRIAL; EQUATION
AB A complementary relationship (CR) between potential (ETp) and actual (ETa) evapotranspiration is obtained using two independent approaches, and the role of soils in formulating the CR is also investigated. The first approach employs a process-based vadose zone model that links ETp and ETa by explicitly considering the role of soils. To drive the model, hydrometeorological, soil, and remotely sensed physiological data are utilized. The second approach utilizes the products of the MODIS_ET (MOD16) data set that is derived from remotely sensed data by mainly considering above-ground land surface processes. Both methods are applied for 42 sites across Nebraska, USA. The results from both approaches demonstrate the CR; however, according to previously reported ETa and ETp values, MODIS_ET tends to underestimate ETa in wet years and systematically overestimate ETp across Nebraska, which leads the wet surface evapotranspiration (ETw) to decrease with increasing annual humidity index Phi (i.e., the ratio of annual precipitation over annual ETp). In comparison, ETw estimated from the vadose zone model is similar to ETw calculated from the Priestley-Taylor equation, and remains relatively constant over a wide range of annual Phi with a mean of 105.1 cm/year. Both approaches show that ETw is not sensitive to soil properties, which provides a rationale for combining historical data from different locations to study the impact of climate variability on evapotranspiration processes at annual time scales.

TI Flow diversion around cavities in fractured media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SEEPAGE
AB Flow diversion around subsurface cavities in unsaturated fractured media is important to numerous environmental and engineering applications. This paper provides analytical solutions to partial and complete flow diversion around cavities intersected by fractures under steady state conditions. It is focused on a typical trifracture junction located upstream from a cavity surface. Fractures are modeled as two-dimensional porous media with an exponential relationship between the capillary pressure and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The solutions show that the vertical distance between the fracture end and the nearest junction (Z) and the slope of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (alpha) are by far the most important determinants of flow diversion. In fact, the product of Z and a enters the threshold flux and liquid entry flux equations as a dimensionless sorptive length (s). This relationship between Z and alpha is shown to have important implications for uncertainty and scalability of calibrated model parameters. The solutions given in this paper are expected to be directly applicable to cavities on the order of the fracture spacing.

AB Groundwater management models that combine optimization methods with coupled stream/aquifer simulation models are considered. Designing algorithms to solve these problems benefits from improved understanding of the nature of the functional relationship between well extraction and streamflow. An analysis is conducted of the nature of this relationship for the Modflow Stream Package stream/aquifer simulation model. Derivatives of the algebraic implementation of the code and numerical testing on a hypothetical problem are used to perform the analysis. Results indicate that a nonlinear relation exists and that it is expected to be bounded and mild under all practical circumstances. The streamflow function may be convex or concave depending on the location of the observation point relative to the well and the ratio of streambed conductance to hydraulic conductivity. For a given setting of well and observation location, the function is likely to be either concave or convex under all practical values of pumping rates and model parameters. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fluid flow system can be described by an equivalent electromagnetic system. In this paper a successful application of the Biot-Savart law in hydraulics is presented. Similarity between the magnetic field of a current wire and the isovel contours in a channel cross-section is used to derive the isovel patterns in an open or closed channel. Having obtained the normalized isovel contours, one can easily obtain the discharge using a single point of velocity measurement at the conduit cross-section. The estimated discharge, based on measured points and the predicted isovels on the upper half of the flow depth away from the boundaries was within +/- 5% of the measured and much better in comparison to the prediction of one- and two-point methods. Furthermore, the model was applied to real life channels. The prediction of the water surface velocity for the River Unon in Japan and depth-averaged velocity for the Severn River in UK show a good agreement with the measured data and analytical results.

AB Integration of the abundant information derived from different sources, characterizing techniques and modeling methodologies, is crucial for extending our knowledge of karst aquifers and their available water resources. In this work, a numerically based approach derived from an improved version of the lumped VarKarst model is proposed, which jointly considers spring discharge and dye test results in calibration routine, to assess independently the contribution of the allogenic and autogenic components to the total recharge of a complex karst system with proved duality in its recharge mechanisms. A newly developed parameter estimation procedure based on rather soft performance rules is employed to confine the uncertainty of the water budget previously obtained with two other independent methods (Soil Water Balance and APLIS). Unlike other methodologies that lead to semiquantitative estimations of input sources, results from our approach display reliable ranges of calibrated values for recharge rate, recharge area, and, to a lesser extent, for water runoff infiltration coming from the streamflow. The integration of all these quantitative results with data (qualitative) previously derived from other experimental methodologies has meant a significant advance in understanding the behavior of the pilot system, allowing a more realistic and robust conceptual model to be developed. We conclude by emphasizing that a continuous transfer of improvements from conceptual to numerical modeling approaches, and vice versa, is necessary to enhance knowledge of carbonate aquifer functioning and ultimately achieve better evaluation and management of water resources. During this process, frequent mutual evaluation between the modeling approaches must be performed.

AB Interannual changes in low, median, and high regimes of streamflow have important implications for flood control, irrigation, and ecologic and human health. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites record global terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA), providing an opportunity to observe, interpret, and potentially utilize the complex relationships between storage and full-flow-regime streamflow. Here we show that utilizable storage-streamflow correlations exist throughout vastly different climates in the continental US (CONUS) across low- to high-flow regimes. A panoramic framework, the storage-streamflow correlation spectrum (SSCS), is proposed to examine macroscopic gradients in these relationships. SSCS helps form, corroborate or reject hypotheses about basin hydrologic behaviors. SSCS patterns vary greatly over CONUS with climate, land surface, and geologic conditions. Data mining analysis suggests that for catchments with hydrologic settings that favor storage over runoff, e.g., a large fraction of precipitation as snow, thick and highly-permeable permeable soil, SSCS values tend to be high. Based on our results, we form the hypotheses that groundwater flow dominates streamflows in Southeastern CONUS and Great Plains, while thin soils in a belt along the Appalachian Plateau impose alimit on water storage. SSCS also suggests shallow water table caused by high-bulk density soil and flat terrain induces rapid runoff in several regions. Our results highlight the importance of subsurface properties and groundwater flow in capturing flood and drought. We propose that SSCS can be used as a fundamental hydrologic signature to constrain models and to provide insights thatlead usto better understand hydrologic functioning.
   Plain Language Summary: Water storage on land is the sum of surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater. Rainfall can partition into direct runoff and infiltration into the ground. The direction runoff part leaves no signal in water storage, while the part that infiltrates and exfiltrates does. By looking at the correlations between storage and streamflow and combining it with other information, we can infer a great deal about how a basin partitions and processes precipitation. With the GRACE satellites, which measure water storage on land, we now have the opportunity to observe, interpret and possibly utilize storage-streamflow relationships. We propose a novel framework, the storage-streamflow correlation spectrum (SSCS), to synthesize these relationships. SSCS patterns present important clues about hydrology, e.g., storage on the Appalachian Plateau is limited by thin soils, compacted soils in northern Ohio lead to shallow water table that limits storage, and northern Great Plains and Southeast Atlantic regions are groundwater-dominated. SSCS provides a new observation dimension to understanding hydrology. In addition, it points out key dynamics for models to capture to predict streamflow accurately.

AB Contrary to report that dynamic capillary pressure effect was insignificant in the supercritical CO2 water (scCO(2)-water) flow system, this work found the effect to be considerable in the displacement of water or brine by injected scCO(2) in the geological carbon sequestration, especially prior to( )the attainment of equilibrium in the system. Series of controlled laboratory scale experimental measurements and numerical simulations of the dynamic capillary pressure effect and its magnitude (dynamic coefficient, tau) for supercritical CO2 water(scCO(2)-water) system are reported in unconsolidated silica sand. Novel measurement technique has been developed to achieve this purpose, by applying the concept of two-phase flow system in the context of geological carbon sequestration. This work considers the injection of scCO(2) into storage aquifer as a two-phase flow system, where the CO2 displaces the resident fluid (brine or water). Using a high-pressure and high-temperature experimental rig, capillary pressure- saturation relationships (P-c-S) for this flow system and the saturation rate dependencies of the P'-S relationships (quantified by dynamic coefficient, tau), known as dynamic capillary pressure effect were determined. This r was previously unreported for scCO(2)-water system. In scCO(2)-water flow system, r ranges from 2 x 10(5) to 6 x 10(5) Pa s at high water saturation and 1.3 x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6) Pa saround the irreducible saturation. r increases with rising temperature but decreases with increase in porous medium permeability. Numerically determined relationships compare well with the corresponding experimental results for wide range of water saturation.The implication was that water saturation of the porous media will be considerably underestimated, if the dynamic capillary pressure effect was ignored in the characterization of the scCO(2)-water flow system, i.e., if only equilibrium Pcrelationship was used.

TI Identification of best predictors for forecasting seasonal rainfall and

AB The first step towards developing a reliable seasonal runoff forecast is identifying the key predictors that drive rainfall and runoff. This paper investigates the lag relationships between rainfall across Australia and runoff across southeast Australia versus 12 atmospheric-oceanic predictors, and how the relationships change over time. The analysis of rainfall data indicates that the relationship is greatest in spring and summer in northeast Australia and in spring in southeast Australia. The best predictors for spring rainfall in eastern Australia are NINO4 [sea surface temperature (SST) in western Pacific] and thermocline (20 degrees C isotherm of the Pacific) and those for summer rainfall in northeast Australia are NINO4 and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin). The relationship in northern Australia is greatest in spring and autumn with NINO4 being the best predictor. In western Australia, the relationship is significant in summer, where SST2 (SST over the Indian Ocean) and II (SST over the Indonesian region) is the best predictor in the southwest and northwest, respectively.
   The analysis of runoff across southeast Australia indicates that the runoff predictability in the southern parts is greatest in winter and spring, with antecedent runoff being the best predictor. The relationship between spring runoff and NINO4, thermocline and SOI is also relatively high and can be used together with antecedent runoff to forecast spring runoff. In the northern parts of southeast Australia, the atmospheric-oceanic variables are better predictors of runoff than antecedent runoff, and have significant correlation with winter, spring and summer runoff. For longer lead times, the runoff serial correlation is reduced, especially over the northern parts, and the atmospheric-oceanic variables are likely to be better predictors for forecasting runoff. The correlations between runoff versus the predictors vary with time, and this has implications for the development of forecast relationship that assumes stationarity in the historical data.

ID HUDSON-RARITAN ESTUARY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION
AB A local mission of short duration was carried out to investigate the relationship between signals acquired by an airborne multispectral camera (MSC-02) developed by XYbion Corporation and in situ water sampling. The MSC-02 was used to produce video images in six spectral bands in the reflective and near-infrared region of the spectrum from which all below-surface hydrological signals originate. Images of halon-coated panels were obtained in all bands to calculate relative radiometric calibration functions. These functions were applied to corresponding spectral images to calculate relative radiances of both panel and estuarine water targets. These values were then input to regression equations to establish a correlation between water constituents (organic/inorganic) and MSC-02 signals indicating the degree of eutrophication in the estuary. It is hypothesized that if reliable relationships between MSC-02 data with fine spatial resolution and selected water quality parameters are obtained, then it would be possible to calibrate the concurrently acquired Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) data with coarser spatial resolution for monitoring of estuarine water quality.

AB [1] The inherent heterogeneity of many geophysical systems often gives rise to fast and slow pathways to water and chemical movement, and one approach to model solute transport through such media is the continuous time random walk (CTRW). One special asymptotic case of the CTRW is the fractional advection-dispersion equation ( FADE), which has proven to be a promising alternative to model anomalous dispersion and has been increasingly used in hydrology to model chemical transport in both surface and subsurface water. Most practical problems in hydrology have complicated initial and boundary conditions and need to be solved numerically, but the numerical solution of the FADE is not trivial. In this paper we present a finite volume approach to solve the FADE where the spatial derivative of the dispersion term is fractional. We also give methods to solve different boundary conditions often encountered in practical applications. The linear system resulting from the temporal-spatial discretization is solved using a semi-implicit scheme. The numerical method is derived on the basis of mass balance, and its accuracy is tested against analytical solutions. The method is then applied to simulate tracer movement in a stream and a near-saturated hillslope in a naturally structured upland podzol field in northeast Scotland.

AB In the current paper, the effect of the geometrical characteristics of 2-D porous media on the relative permeability in immiscible two-phase flows is studied. The generation of the different artificial porous media is performed using a Boolean model based on a random distribution of overlapping circles/ellipses, the size and shape of which are chosen to satisfy the specific Minkowski functionals (i.e. volume fraction, solid line contour length, connectivity). The study aims to identify how each different Minkowski functional affects the relative permeability of each phase at various saturations of the non-wetting phase. A 2-D multi-relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) that can handle high density ratios is employed in the simulation. The relationship between the driving forces G and the relative permeabilities of the two phases for every artificial structure is quantified. It is found that for high non-wetting phase saturations (fully connected flow), a non-linear relationship exists between the non-wetting phase flow rate and the driving force, whilst this relationship becomes linear at higher magnitudes of the latter. The force magnitude required to approach the linear region is highly influenced by the pore size distribution and the connectivity of the solid phase. For lower non-wetting phase saturation values, its relative permeability in the linear regime decreases as the fraction of small pores in the structure increases and the non-wetting phase flow becomes disconnected. A strong influence of the solid phase connectivity is also observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolution mass transfer from the trapped phase to the flowing phase in porous media occurs in various hydrogeology processes. One of the important phenomena is dissolution fingering and its effect on dissolution mass transfer. In this work, dissolution mass transfer in porous media with various particle sizes and distribution was investigated in pore scale and meso-scale by using X-ray microcomputed tomography. The specific interfacial area and mass transfer coefficient were measured by following the representative elementary volume concept, and the effect of dissolution fingering was evaluated. Linear instability theory was used for the prediction of dissolution finger width (lambda) at the onset of dissolution fingering. Although dissolution fingering tends to develop when the porous media container diameter (Ly) is smaller than half of lambda, its effect on mass transfer coefficient starts to occur when Ly is larger than the whole lambda. Starting this point, dissolution fingering decreases the mass transfer coefficient by three times. For validation, an additional experiment with a larger porous media container size was performed, and three dissolution fingers were successfully observed. Their size was found to be comparable with the theoretical prediction based on linear instability theory.

AB Sap flux (J(S)) measurements were collected across two stands dominated by either trembling aspen or sugar maple in northern Wisconsin. Observed canopy transpiration (EC-obs) values derived from J(S) were used to parameterize the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator ecosystem model. Modeled values of stomatal conductance (G(S)) were used to determine reference stomatal conductance (G(Sref)), a proxy for G(S) that removes the effects of temporal responses to vapor pressure deficit (D) on spatial patterns of G(S). Values of G(Sref) were compared to observations of soil moisture, several physiological variables, and a competition index (C-I) derived from a stand inventory, to determine the underlying cause of observed variability. Considerable variability in G(Sref) between individual trees was found, with values ranging from 20 to 200 mmol m(-2) s(-1) and 20 to 100 mmol m(-2) s(-1) at the aspen and maple stands, respectively. Model-derived values of G(Sref) and a sensitivity to D parameter (m) showed good agreement with a known empirical relationship for both stands. At both sites, G(Sref) did not vary with topographic position, as indicated by surface soil moisture. No relationships were observed between G(Sref) and tree height (H-T), and a weak correlation with sapwood area (A(S)) was only significant for aspen. Significant nonlinear inverse relationships between G(Sref) and C-I were observed at both stands. Simulations with uniform reductions in incident photosynthetically active radiation (Q(0)) resulted in better agreement between observed and simulated E-C. Our results suggest a link between photosynthesis and plant hydraulics whereby individual trees subject to photosynthetic limitation as a result of competitive shading exhibit a dynamic stomatal response resulting in a more conservative strategy for managing hydrologic resources.

AB Total contributing area (TCA) has important hydrological, geological, and geomorphological implications in digital terrain analysis. Currently, the validity of estimated TCA is challenged by the approximation error of digital elevation models (DEMs) to real-world terrains, the choice of flow direction algorithms and the difficulty in a quantitative evaluation. To solve these problems, this work employs a range of synthetic surfaces for free from approximation errors. Theoretical TCA for any cell on synthetic surfaces is analytically solved by using subsection integral and L'Hospital's rule based on the topographical definition of TCA. The impacts of grid discretization on the spatial patterns of theoretical TCA are explained mathematically and geometrically. In case studies, the analytically solved theoretical TCA is treated as a benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the TCAs estimated by three SFD algorithms (i.e., D8, Rho8, and D8-LTD) and three MFD algorithms (i.e., FDFM, MFD-md, and D infinity). Results show that (1) SFD algorithms obtain unsmooth and discontinuous spatial patterns of estimated TCA, due to the existence of source cells caused by the basic hypothesis of allowing only one receiving cell; (2) Cross compensation induced by artificial dispersion in MFD algorithms leads to a less error in the quantity of estimated TCA but a larger error in the physical position of estimated TCA; (3) The addition of contour length errors does not promise larger specific contributing area errors than TCA errors. To summarize, this work offers a theoretical and quantitative evaluation on the precision of the TCAs estimated by flow direction algorithms.

TI Rainfall-runoff modeling through hybrid intelligent system
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY; OPTIMIZATION
AB This study explores the potential of integrating two different artificial intelligence techniques, namely neural network and fuzzy logic, effectively to model the rainfall- runoff process from rainfall and runoff information. The integration is achieved through representing fuzzy system computations in a generic artificial neural network (ANN) architecture, which is functionally equivalent to a fuzzy inference system. The model is initialized by a hyperellipsoidal fuzzy clustering (HEC) procedure, which identifies suitable numbers of fuzzy if- then rules through proper partition of the input space. The parameters of the membership functions are optimized using a nonlinear optimization procedure. The consequent functions are chosen to be linear in their parameters, and a standard least squares error method is employed for parameter estimation. The proposed model is tested on two case studies: Narmada basin in India and Kentucky basin in the United States. The results are highly encouraging as the model is able to explain more than 92% of the variance. The performance of the proposed model is found to be comparable to that of an adaptive neural based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) developed for both the basins. The number of parameters in the proposed model is fewer compared to ANFIS, and the former can be trained in lesser time. It is also observed that the proposed model simulates the peak flow better than ANFIS. Overall, the study suggests that the proposed model can potentially be a viable alternative to ANFIS for use as an operational tool for rainfall runoff modeling purposes.

ID INTELLIGENT CONTROL; SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM
AB A methodology is proposed for constructing a flood forecast model using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This is based on a self-organizing rule-base generator, a feedforward network, and fuzzy control arithmetic. Given the rainfall-runoff patterns, ANFIS could systematically and effectively construct flood forecast models. The precipitation and flow data sets of the Choshui River in central Taiwan are analysed to identify the useful input variables and then the forecasting model can be self-constructed through ANFIS. The analysis results suggest that the persistent effect and upstream flow information are the key effects for modelling the flood forecast, and the watershed's average rainfall provides further information and enhances the accuracy of the model performance. For the purpose of comparison, the commonly used back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is also examined. The forecast results demonstrate that ANFIS is superior to the BPNN, and ANFIS can effectively and reliably construct an accurate flood forecast model. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Experimental evidence supports the validity of the imposed constraints. Earlier complementary relationships are shown to be special cases which satisfy only one of the necessary conditions. The new formulation provides a more rigorous base for the complementary principle.

ID WATER; GAME
AB The common-pool nature of groundwater resources creates incentives to over pump that contribute to their rapid global depletion. In transboundary aquifers, users are separated by a territorial border and might face substantially different economic and hydrogeologic conditions that can alternatively dampen or amplify incentives to over pump. We develop a theoretical model that couples principles of game theory and groundwater flow to capture the combined effect of well locations and user asymmetries on pumping incentives. We find that heterogeneities across users (here referred to as asymmetries) in terms of either energy cost, groundwater profitability or aquifer response tend to dampen incentives to over pump. However, combinations of two or more types of asymmetry can substantially amplify common-pool overdraft, particularly when the same user simultaneously faces comparatively higher costs (or aquifer response) and profitability. We use this theoretical insight to interpret the emergence of the Disi agreement between Saudi Arabia and Jordan in association with the Disi-Amman water pipeline. By using bounded non-dimensional parameters to encode user asymmetries and groundwater connectivity, the theory provides a tractable generalized framework to understand the premature depletion of shared aquifers, whether transboundary or not.

AB We explore selected aspects of J.-Y. Parlange's contributions to hydrological transport of solutes and sediments, including both the laboratory and field scales. At the laboratory scale, he provided numerous approximations for solute transport accounting for effects of boundary conditions, linear and nonlinear reactions, and means to determine relevant parameters. Theory was extended to the field scale with, on the one hand, the effect of varying surface boundary conditions and, on the other, effects of soil structure heterogeneity. Soil erosion modeling, focusing on the Hairsine-Rose model, was considered in several papers. His main results, which provide highly usable approximations for grain-size class dependent sediment transport and deposition, are described. The connection between solute in the soil and that in overland flow was also investigated by Parlange. His theory on exchange of solutes between these two compartments, and subsequent movement, is presented. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were considered, with application to microbial transport. Beyond contaminant transport, Parlange's fundamental contributions to the movement of solutes in hypersaline natural environments provided accurate predictions of vapor and liquid movement in desert, agricultural, and anthropogenic fresh-saline interfaces in porous media, providing the foundation for this area of research.

AB Unmitigated urbanization frequently alters the flow frequency distribution and changes the source and transport rates of sediments in previously "in regime" channels. These changes may result in increased stream erosion, changes in alluvial materials and degradation of water quality and habitat, conditions called "urban stream syndrome". Early identification of streams with the potential to develop urban stream syndrome may allow for additional implementation of watershed controls such as Low Impact Development or within stream mitigation (e.g. erosion controls). Regime theory applied to dynamically-stable alluvial channels has identified empirical equations linking width (W), depth (H), slope (S), mean sediment particle size (D50), and the 2-yr return bankfull discharge (Q2). This study examines the application of regime-theory equations to urban streams as a means of identifying channels with urban stream syndrome. To begin the assessment of the applicability of regime equations an extensive database of channel morphology variables for 733 in-regime channels, from North America, Britain and South Asia, was compiled from existing publications. Using this database a Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) model was developed to predict specific stream power for comparison with observed values to determine whether a channel is in or out of regime. The application of the GMDH model was showcased using regional flow and sediment data to predict channel conditions of several watercourses in Southern Ontario, Canada. The GMDH model reliably identified channels both in and out of regime conditions compared with published in-situ assessments based on Rapid Geomorphic Assessments (RGAs). This study has identified changes in specific stream power (omega) as a reliable early detection metric for occurrence of the urban stream syndrome. The model can inform the strategies to mitigate the urban stream syndrome, including within-channel mitigation and watershed initiatives, including Low Impact Developments (LIDs).

AB This paper introduces a macroscopic invasion percolation process suitable for simulating the displacement of one immiscible fluid by another through porous media under conditions of capillary-dominated flow. The theory is similar to classical percolation theory in that the structure of a real porous medium is represented as an ordered lattice, but differs in that each point of the lattice is assigned a local-scale porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure-saturation relationship, rather than microscale pore and pore throat dimensions. Unlike pore-scale percolation theory, each node of the lattice may be occupied by either one or two phases, thereby allowing bicontinua of fluids in two dimensions. To illustrate an application of the theory, both wetting and nonwetting fluids are percolated through a heterogeneous porous medium while accounting for fluid trapping such that a hysteretic, large-scale capillary pressure-saturation curve is constructed. The simulations are carried out in spatially correlated, random permeability fields assuming that the local-scale capillary pressure-saturation relationships are perfectly correlated with permeability. The resulting large-scale capillary pressure curves are found to be influenced by the mean and variance of the assigned lognormal distribution of permeabilities. Very little sensitivity to the ratio of correlation lengths was observed. It is found that the threshold saturation giving rise to an initial percolating cluster of nonwetting fluid across the lattice corresponds to between 18.8% and 29.5% nonwetting saturation, depending on the statistics of the permeability field. Comparison of the percolation-derived capillary pressure curves to those based on a direct arithmetic average demonstrates that an arithmetic average is only valid through the range of fluid saturations where no trapping occurs.

ID SOLUTE TRANSPORT
AB [1] A three-dimensional (3-D) analysis of transport and macrodispersion at the Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE) site [Boggs et al., 1993] using the Fractional Advection-Dispersion Equation (FADE) developed by Meerschaert et al. [1999, 2001] shows that the Levy dispersion process is scale dependent. Levy dispersion may be superior to Gaussian dispersion on a sufficiently small scale; on larger scales, both theories are likely to suffer from the fact that because of depositional structures most flow fields display an evolving, nonstationary structure. Motion in such fields is advection-dominated, displays a lot of memory and therefore is not modeled well by Markov random processes which underlie the derivation of both the Gaussian and Levy advection-dispersion equations [Berkowitz et al., 2002]. To improve plume simulation of an advection-dominated transport process, one would have to bring in more advective irregularity while simultaneously decreasing the Levy dispersion coefficient. Therefore, on a 3-D basis, first-order Levy dispersion has limitations similar to Gaussian dispersion. However, this and related theories, such as the continuous time random walk (CTRW) formalism, are in the early stages of development and thus may be fruitful areas for further research.

AB The present paper proposes an empirical approach for the modeling of vegetation development, using moisture measurements only. The study is based simply on the use of two databases: one containing soil moisture products derived from ERS scatterometer data over the period 1991-2006 and the other containing normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer over the period 1991-2000. The study is applied over the Kairouan plain, the central semiarid region of Tunisia (North Africa). Soil moisture products were first validated on the basis of comparisons with Global Soil Wetness Project, Phase 2 Data, outputs and rainfall events. The soil moisture distribution during the rainy period between October and May is described and is found to be correlated with the vegetation dynamics estimated using the NDVI products. Finally, a semiempirical model is proposed, based on satellite moisture and NDVI products, which allows the NDVI value to be estimated for a period of 1 month during the rainy season as a function of the moisture profile estimations obtained during the previous months. This approach could prove very useful and provide a simple tool for the modeling of vegetation dynamics during rainy seasons in semiarid regions.

AB Large water resource projects may severely alter hydrological regimes and thus the habitat conditions for biota in wetlands. Plenty of habitat models for fish, vegetation, and invertebrates have been developed and widely used; however, there is a lack of effective models to assess the effects of water resource projects on waterbird habitat in wetlands. This study developed a habitat model by integrating two-dimensional hydrodynamic, multicriteria evaluation Cellular Automata-Markov and habitat suitability modules (HMH) to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on the habitat of waterbirds in wetlands. The developed HMH model was applied to the Duchang Provincial Nature Reserve (DPNR) of Poyang Lake in China, which is an important conservation wetland in the Ramsar Convention. For demonstration, the HMH model analyzed the habitat suitability for Grus leucogeranus, a rare species in the region, with a scheduled sluice under two different regulating rules (named Rule 1 and Rule 2), and compared it to the habitat suitability without the sluice. Results showed that the sluice operations would increase the water body during dry seasons, and thus increase the area of shallow water, a preferential habitat to Grus leucogeranus. The sluice operation in Rule 1 would either change the location or remarkably reduced the area of suitable habitat in the northern DPNR. The sluice operation in Rule 2 would either slightly increase the area or change the location of suitable habitats in the northern DPNR. The study demonstrated that the developed method for habitat suitability assessment could provide a viable approach for eco-hydrological management of wetlands.

TI Unfolding the relationship between seasonal forecast skill and value in
   hydropower production: a global analysis
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE
AB The potential benefits of seasonal streamflow forecasts for the hydropower sector have been evaluated for several basins across the world but with contrasting conclusions on the expected benefits. This raises the prospect of a complex relationship between reservoir characteristics, forecast skill, and value. Here, we unfold the nature of this relationship by studying time series of simulated power production for 735 headwater dams worldwide. The time series are generated by running a detailed dam model over the period 1958-2000 with three operating schemes: basic control rules, perfect forecast-informed operations, and realistic forecast-informed operations. The realistic forecasts are issued by tailored statistical prediction models - based on lagged global and local hydroclimatic variables - predicting seasonal monthly dam inflows. As expected, results show that most dams (94 %) could benefit from perfect forecasts. Yet, the benefits for each dam vary greatly and are primarily controlled by the time-to-fill value and the ratio between reservoir depth and hydraulic head. When realistic forecasts are adopted, 25 % of dams demonstrate improvements with respect to basic control rules. In this case, the likelihood of observing improvements is controlled not only by design specifications but also by forecast skill. We conclude our analysis by identifying two groups of dams of particular interest: dams that fall in regions expressing strong forecast accuracy and having the potential to reap benefits from forecast-informed operations and dams with a strong potential to benefit from forecast-informed operations but falling in regions lacking forecast accuracy. Overall, these results represent a first qualitative step toward informing site-specific hydropower studies.

AB This study investigates spatiotemporal cross correlation between the observed head and the hydraulic diffusivity parameters in heterogeneous aquifers under static and migrating periodic excitations with different frequencies and other factors and a moving single excitation along a river boundary. Results of the cross-correlation analysis are verified by estimating the parameters in a synthetic heterogeneous aquifer under these excitations. For assuring the statistical significance of the results based on a single realization, Monte Carlo experiments of estimating the parameters with these excitations are conducted. The experiments also explore the relationship between the resolution of the estimated parameters and the distance from the excitation to the observation wells, the frequency, and amplitude of the excitation and the mean diffusivity of the aquifer. In addition, the relationship between the resolution of the estimates and monitoring network spatial density is investigated. Finally, the usefulness of moving single excitations, effects of frequencies of the periodic excitations under different situations, the density of monitoring network in term of correlation scale, and the ergodicity issue corresponding to the number of observation and size of simulation domain are discussed.

AB The complex hydrological connectivity of integrated river-reservoir catchment command regions in conjunction with abrupt societal development and population growth impose adverse water availability scenario in the global reservoirs. In this context, to formulate optimal reservoir operation policies, numerous reservoir simulation and optimization models are currently on board. However, lack of combined hydrologic and hydraulic conceptualizations in the existing reservoir operation framework fetches considerable uncertainty; thereby leading to formulation of erroneous reservoir operation rule. This study proposed an integrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) based hydrologic, HEC-ResSim based hydraulic, and genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization framework (SWAT-HEC-ResSim-GA) for formulating the optimal reservoir operation rule of the Kangsabati reservoir located in the eastern India. Unlike the existing reservoir operation rules, the present study incorporates a 10-daily-scale environmental flow estimation approach to quantify the water demand. The proposed reservoir operation framework generated rule curve based HEC-ResSim simulation revealed improved reservoir performance with reservoir time reliability, volume reliability, and resiliency magnitudes of 0.631, 0.736, and 0.591, respectively. Finally, this study endorses to use the developed methodology for supply-demand management, and subsequent, reservoir operation in any global reservoir catchment-command regions with utmost accuracy.

AB The intent of this paper is to provide both an introduction to the concepts of information theory, and to review how such concepts might be effectively applied in computing information reduction via upscaling methods. The concept of using scaling postulates to reduce the dimensionality or amount of information in a problem is a central idea in upscaling. In this paper, we present a number of introductory examples that help illustrate the fundamental concepts and definitions of information theory. While the subject matter relates primarily to applications from hydrologic systems, the concepts are general and may be applied to upscaling in any physical system. Two more involved examples are investigated. The first examines how information content is changed by upscaling for the observable volume fraction in a heterogeneous porous material with a binary distribution of textures. In this example, we also focus on how the entropy of the data changes with increasing sample size, and how the sample size relates to the distribution of the observed volume fraction. The notion of typical sets from information theory is introduced, and a connection between this concept and the concept of a representative (elementary) volume (REV or RV) is made. In a second example, we examine similar issues related to information content, sample size, upscaling, and the distribution of the upscaled variables. To add additional concreteness to the example, we also introduce the idea of a simple utility function as a constraint for discerning among different upscaling options. This latter concept is important when the relative costs of upscaling (i.e., the loss of resolution) must be weighted against the benefits (reduction in the number of degrees of freedom). Such analyses may be important when considering upscaling options (model selection) in applications.

TI Temporal information partitioning: Characterizing synergy, uniqueness,
   and redundancy in interacting environmental variables
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB Information theoretic measures can be used to identify nonlinear interactions between source and target variables through reductions in uncertainty. In information partitioning, multivariate mutual information is decomposed into synergistic, unique, and redundant components. Synergy is information shared only when sources influence a target together, uniqueness is information only provided by one source, and redundancy is overlapping shared information from multiple sources. While this partitioning has been applied to provide insights into complex dependencies, several proposed partitioning methods overestimate redundant information and omit a component of unique information because they do not account for source dependencies. Additionally, information partitioning has only been applied to time-series data in a limited context, using basic pdf estimation techniques or a Gaussian assumption. We develop a Rescaled Redundancy measure (Rs) to solve the source dependency issue, and present Gaussian, autoregressive, and chaotic test cases to demonstrate its advantages over existing techniques in the presence of noise, various source correlations, and different types of interactions. This study constitutes the first rigorous application of information partitioning to environmental time-series data, and addresses how noise, pdf estimation technique, or source dependencies can influence detected measures. We illustrate how our techniques can unravel the complex nature of forcing and feedback within an ecohydrologic system with an application to 1 min environmental signals of air temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed. The methods presented here are applicable to the study of a broad range of complex systems composed of interacting variables.
   Plain Language Summary Within an ecosystem, variables such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind interact with each other in various ways. Although some of these relationships are well understood, others are more complex and may change along with weather conditions or due to human impacts. This study presents a new method with which to characterize these relationships based on time-series data. We develop a metric to detect relationships between multiple "source" variables that influence "target" variables at different time delays. This can be applied to environmental time-series datasets that present challenges for other types of analyses. We show the advantages of our method using several theoretical examples and an application to weather station data. In the weather station case, we find that air temperature and wind speed both tend to influence relative humidity, but in different ways. Over a several-day period, we find that the relationships between the three variables change with weather conditions. The method presented here can be applied to a wide range of systems in which variables are interacting in complex ways.

AB A thermodynamically consistent model for multiphase flow which allows for connected and disconnected phases in a swelling medium is developed using hybrid mixture theory with three spatial scales. The mesoscale of the medium consists of swelling particles and two bulk phases, such as liquid water and vapor. The particles are a combination of a vicinal liquid and a solid, which may swell or shrink as a result of interaction with the other bulk phases; an example is a mixture of montmorillonite platelets and water. The theory defines connected and disconnected bulk phases of liquid and vapor at the mesoscale to create a dual-porosity type model at the macroscale. The disconnected vapor phase consists of either buoyant bubbles or confined vapor packets. The incorporation of disconnected and connected phases is useful for modeling unsaturated swelling systems. The macroscale solid phase volume fraction is refined from previous hybrid mixture approaches for two-phase multiscale problems and is fully utilized in the field equations and the constitutive theory. Macroscale equations for each of the six phases are presented with bulk regions separated into connected and disconnected domains. A constitutive theory is derived by exploiting the entropy inequality for the mixture. Generalized Darcy's laws and the final set of field equations for the system are presented and compared with previous hybrid mixture theoretic results. Classical parallel flow models only consider disconnected bulk regions and therefore are only appropriate for drainage; the current system can be useful for both imbibition and drainage, including extremely dry systems.

AB Porewater fluxes into or out of the sediments in aquatic systems are frequently estimated using Fick's First Law. This assumes that diffusive processes control the transport of nutrients. As a corollary, advection, bioturbation and chemical processes are assumed not to be significant. Through a series of sediment core incubations, this paper seeks to quantify the uncertainties involved in such assumptions. Duplicate sediment cores were collected from 28 sites along the Swan-Canning Estuary, returned to the laboratory and incubated under oxic or anoxic conditions. Porewater nutrient concentrations, sediment porosity and initial nutrient concentrations in the overlying water were measured. These parameters were used to estimate the expected nutrient fluxes via Fick's First Law. The estimated fluxes were then compared with measured fluxes of nutrients out of the sediments over the incubation period. Severe bioturbation occurred in several of the anoxic treatments, resulting in large releases of nutrients into the overlying water. Aside from these bioturbated cores, phosphate and ammonium fluxes under anoxic conditions are well predicted by Fick's First Law. Nitrate fluxes are predicted well under oxic conditions. For coarse sediments (D-10 averaging 0.3 mm) and under redox conditions favourable for nutrient release, Fick's First Law predicted close to 100% of the observed fluxes. For finer grain sediments (D-10 < 0.01 mm), Fick's First Law overestimated the observed flux by up to 40%. Under unfavourable oxygen conditions, chemical retardation processes are likely to dominate fluxes, and the error associated with using Fick's First Law is increased. These results confirm the usefulness of using Fick's First Law for a baseline estimate of nutrient fluxes under favourable redox conditions. Much greater care must be taken when using Fick's First Law to estimate nutrient fluxes under unfavourable redox conditions, or under conditions when bioturbation is likely to be severe.

AB We compared three gravel-bed rivers in north-eastern Italy (Brenta, Piave, Tagliamento) having similar bioclimate, geology and fluvial morphology, but affected by different intensities of anthropogenic disturbance related particularly to hydropower dams, training works and instream gravel mining. Our aim was to test whether a corresponding difference in the interactions between vegetation and geomorphological patterns existed among the three rivers. In equally spaced and sized plots (n = 710) we collected descriptors of geomorphic conditions, and presence-absence of woody species. In the less disturbed river (Tagliamento), spatial succession of woody communities from the floodplain to the channel followed a profile where higher elevation floodplains featured more developed tree communities, and lower elevation islands and bars were covered by pioneer communities. In the intermediate-disturbed river (Piave), islands and floodplains lay at similar elevation and both showed species indicators of mature developed communities. In the most disturbed river (Brenta), all these patterns were simplified, all geomorphic units lay at similar elevations, were not well characterized by species composition, and presented similar persistence age. This indicates that in human-disturbed rivers, channel and vegetation adjustments are closely linked in the long term, and suggests that intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, such as those encountered in the Piave River, could counteract the natural, more dynamic conditions that may periodically fragment vegetated landscapes in natural rivers.

AB Runoff and sediment yields in semiarid areas have often been reported to be scale-dependent. However, scale relationships in these areas have been poorly quantified using empirical data. Commonly, previous empirical works on scale issues have focused on the effect of the size of the contributing area for a particular scale (e.g. catchments of different sizes), or the scale effect has been confounded with other co-varying controlling factors (mainly vegetation cover). In this study, we established quantitative scale relationships for runoff and sediment yields measured during 4 years at several nested scale levels (plot, microcatchment and catchment), covering a range of contributing-area sizes from 16 m(2) to 20 ha, and without major differences in vegetation cover between the scales analyzed. From finer to coarser scales, rainfall thresholds for runoff production increased, runoff frequency decreased, and unit-area runoff decreased. These relationships were well fitted to power law relations with exponents close to -1/2. The decrease in runoff with the coarsening of scale was attributed to the increase in the opportunity for runoff infiltration in vegetation patches along the slope and to other properties appearing at the catchment scale, such as runoff infiltration through limestone fractures and transmission losses through the channel bed. Sediment yield was very low at the plot scale and negligible at the catchment scales. The definition and quantification of the scale-dependent variation in runoff yield obtained in this study clearly show the important effect of scale on semiarid hydrology regardless of the influence of vegetation cover variations and could be used to improve the hydrological modeling and water management of semiarid areas.

AB Soil degradation by water is a serious environmental problem worldwide, with specific climatic factors being the major causes. We investigated the relationships between synoptic atmospheric patterns (i.e. weather types, WI's) and runoff, erosion and sediment yield throughout the Mediterranean basin by analyzing a large database of natural rainfall events at 68 research sites in 9 countries. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify spatial relationships of the different WTs including three hydro-sedimentary variables: rainfall, runoff, and sediment yield (SY, used to refer to both soil erosion measured at plot scale and sediment yield registered at catchment scale). The results indicated 4 spatial classes of rainfall and runoff: (a) northern sites dependent on North (N) and North West (NW) flows; (b) eastern sites dependent on E and NE flows; (c) southern sites dependent on S and SE flows; and, finally, (d) western sites dependent on W and SW flows. Conversely, three spatial classes are identified for SY characterized by: (a) N and NE flows in northern sites (b) E flows in eastern sites, and (c) W and SW flows in western sites. Most of the rainfall, runoff and SY occurred during a small number of daily events, and just a few WTs accounted for large percentages of the total. Our results confirm that characterization by WT improves understanding of the general conditions under which runoff and SY occur, and provides useful information for understanding the spatial variability of runoff, and SY throughout the Mediterranean basin. The approach used here could be useful to aid of the design of regional water management and soil conservation measures.

AB Streamflow and baseflow dynamics are driven by complex, interconnected catchment properties. A national study was conducted to assess the relationship between surface flow, climate and intrinsic catchment attributes in Australia. Subcatchments were delineated based on Horton's 5th stream order and were characterised by identifying parameters that influence streamflow and flood behaviour. Because observational datasets like rainfall and streamflow commonly have a non-normal distribution, the method of L-moments was applied to several time series. Surface hydrology and baseflow patterns were represented by twenty indices, which were statistically summarised via principal component (PC) analysis, yielding six PCs. Forty catchment descriptors from the themes of climate, topography, surface condition and hydmgeology were used to investigate their link with runoff patterns. Among these is the land surface value, a newly defined index incorporating soil properties and land use to estimate the capacity for water infiltration. All metrics were explored via correlation and regression analysis against the surface hydrology PCs and their influence on runoff discussed. The predictive skill of the regression models is improved when non-perennial waterways are excluded. Although rainfall characteristics dominate streamflow behaviour, topographical and surface conditions also greatly impact on runoff, especially during low-flow periods.

TI Trade Openness and Domestic Water Use
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; GROWTH; IMPACT
AB We contribute to the debate over globalization and the environment by asking, what is the impact of trade on national water use? To address this question, we employ econometric methods to quantify the causal relationship between trade openness and water use. Specifically, we use the instrumental variables methodology to evaluate the impact of trade openness on domestic water withdrawals in agriculture and industry. We find that trade openness does not have a significant impact on total or industrial water withdrawals. However, we show that one percentage point increase in trade openness leads to a 5.21% decrease in agricultural water withdrawals. We find that trade openness reduces water use in agriculture primarily through the intensive margin effect, by leading farmers to produce more with less water, such as through the adoption of technology. We do not find evidence for extensive margin or crop mix impacts on agricultural water withdrawals. Significantly, these results demonstrate that trade openness leads to less water use in agriculture. This finding has broad scientific and policy relevance as we endeavor to untangle causal relationships in the complex global food system and develop policies to achieve water and food security.

TI Ensemble-based assimilation of discharge into rainfall-runoff models: A

AB The optimization of hydrologic models using the ensemble Kalman filter has received increasing attention during the last decade. The application of this algorithm is straightforward when the relationship between the state variables and the observations is linear, in other words, when the observations can be directly mapped onto the state space. However, when this relationship is nonlinear, a number of methods can be derived in order to perform this transfer. Up till now, it has not been demonstrated which of these methods is recommended for discharge assimilation with the ensemble Kalman filter. The objective of this paper is to analyze these methods for conceptual rainfall-runoff models in a small-scale catchment. The study has been performed in the Bellebeek catchment (86.36 km(2)) in Belgium, using two time series models and one conceptual rainfall-runoff model. A first analysis of the algorithms has been performed using the one time step ahead discharge predictions. The results indicate that linearization of the storage-discharge relationship (the observation system) should be avoided if discharge data are assimilated using the ensemble Kalman filter. Further, assimilating discharge data into conceptual rainfall-runoff models for small catchments does not work well when a unit hydrograph is used for runoff routing. This can be explained by the stronger impact of the model error (caused by errors in the forcings, model structure, and parameters), accumulated over the duration of the unit hydrograph, as compared to the impact of erroneous initial conditions. A second analysis using longer lead times has led to the conclusion that, for the type of catchment and model used in this study, the accuracy of the meteorological forcings is more important than an accurate estimation of the model initial conditions through data assimilation.

AB In this paper, we use numerical simulations based on a Lagrangian framework to study contaminant transport through highly heterogeneous porous media due to advection and local diffusion (under local diffusion, we assume coupled effect of mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion). The analysis of the concentration field is done for the case of a two-dimensional hydraulic conductivity domain representing the aquifer, with three log-conductivity structures that differ in spatial correlation. In addition to different conductivity structures, we focus our investigation on mild and highly heterogeneous porous media characterized by the values of hydraulic log-conductivity variance (sigma Y2) being equal to 1 and 8. In the concentration moment analysis, we show that a linear relationship exists between higher-order to second-order normalized concentration moments on a log-log scale up to the fourth-order moment. This leads to the important finding that moments of a higher than the second order can be derived based on information about the first two concentration moments only. Such a property has been observed previously for boundary-layer water channels, wind tunnels, and turbulent diffusion in open terrain and laboratory experiments. Normalized moments are shown to collapse for different types of hydraulic conductivity structures, Peclet (Pe) numbers and sigma Y2 values. In the case of local diffusion absence, a linear log-log relationship is derived analytically and is set as a lower limit. The deviation from the lower limit is explained to be predominantly caused by the local diffusion, which needs time to evolve. In the case of local diffusion presence, we define the moment deriving function (MDF) to describe the linear log-log relationship between higher-order concentration moments to the second-order normalized one. Finally, the comparison between numerical results and those obtained from the Columbus Air Force Base Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE 1) is used to demonstrate the robustness of the moment collapse.

AB [ 1] Four methods of statistical downscaling of daily precipitation were evaluated on three catchments located in southern, eastern, and central China. The evaluation focused on seasonal variation of statistical properties of precipitation and indices describing the precipitation regime, e. g., maximum length of dry spell and maximum 5-day precipitation, as well as interannual and intra-annual variations of precipitation. The predictors used in this study were mean sea level pressure, geopotential heights at 1000, 850, 700, and 500 hPa, and specific humidity as well as horizontal winds at 850, 700, and 500 hPa levels from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis with 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees resolution for 1961 - 2000. The predictand was daily precipitation from 13 stations. Two analogue methods, one using principal components analysis (PCA) and the other Teweles-Wobus scores (TWS), a multiregression technique with a weather generator producing precipitation (SDSM) and a fuzzy-rule-based weather-pattern-classification method (MOFRBC), were used. Temporal and spatial properties of the predictors were carefully evaluated to derive the optimum setting for each method, and MOFRBC and SDSM were implemented in two modes, with and without humidity as predictor. The results showed that ( 1) precipitation was most successfully downscaled in the southern and eastern catchments located close to the coast, ( 2) winter properties were generally better downscaled, ( 3) MOFRBC and SDSM performed overall better than the analogue methods, ( 4) the modeled interannual variation in precipitation was improved when humidity was added to the predictor set, and ( 5), the annual precipitation cycle was well captured with all methods.

AB In this paper, a numerical model is developed based on the X-FEM technique to simulate the transport of dense solute in a single fluid phase through the fractured porous media. The governing equation is based on the mass conservation law which is applied to the fluid phase and the solute in both matrix and fracture domain. The integral governing equations of the mass exchange between the fracture and the surrounding matrix is derived. The extended finite element method (X-FEM) is applied by employing appropriate enrichment functions to model the fractured porous domain. The superiorly of the X-FEM is that the FE mesh is not necessary to be conformed to the fracture geometry, so the regular mesh is utilized independent of the position of the fracture. Finally, several numerical examples of dense brine transport in a water aquifer are studied to validate the proposed computational algorithm. Moreover, the effects of various parameters of the fracture, such as the aperture and interconnectivity, as well as the matrix medium, such as the permeability and diffusion are investigated. It is shown that the proposed computational model provides an accurate prediction of subsurface hydrology for a field-scale closed desert basin.

AB Recent advances in multi-phase flow theory have shown that the flow of several phases in a porous medium is highly influenced by the interfaces separating these phases. First modeling studies based on this new theory have been performed on a pore scale, as well as on a volume-averaged macro scale using balance equations and constitutive relations that take the role and presence of interfaces into account. However, neither experimental data nor analytical solutions are available on the macro scale so far, although their knowledge is essential for the verification of the new models.
   In this paper, we derive a semi-analytical solution for the redistribution of two fluid phases in a horizontal one-dimensional and homogeneous porous medium. We start with the macro-scale model including interfacial area. Next, we construct a semi-analytical solution for this problem by using a similarity transformation. We then compare results obtained from a numerical macro-scale model to this semi-analytical solution used as the reference solution. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Stream-groundwater exchange and hydrologic turnover at the network scale
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The exchange of water between streams and groundwater can influence stream water quality, hydrologic mass balances, and attenuate solute export from watersheds. We used conservative tracer injections (chloride, Cl-) across 10 stream reaches to investigate stream water gains and losses from and to groundwater at larger spatial and temporal scales than typically associated with hyporheic exchanges. We found strong relationships between reach discharge, median tracer velocity, and gross hydrologic loss across a range of stream morphologies and sizes in the 11.4 km(2) Bull Trout Watershed of central ID. We implemented these empirical relationships in a numerical network model and simulated stream water gains and losses and subsequent fractional hydrologic turnover across the stream network. We found that stream gains and losses from and to groundwater can influence source water contributions and stream water compositions across stream networks. Quantifying proportional influences of source water contributions from runoff generation locations across the network on stream water composition can provide insight into the internal mechanisms that partially control the hydrologic and biogeochemical signatures observed along networks and at watershed outlets.

AB This study considers Bayesian calibration of hydrological models using streamflow signatures and its implementation using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). If the modeling objective is to predict streamflow time series and associated uncertainty, a probabilistic model of streamflow must be specified but the inference equations must be developed in the signature domain. However, even starting from simple probabilistic models of streamflow time series, working in the signature domain makes the likelihood function difficult or impractical to evaluate (in particular, as it is unavailable in closed form). This challenge can be tackled using ABC, a general class of numerical algorithms for sampling from conditional distributions, such as (but not limited to) Bayesian posteriors given any calibration data. Using ABC does not avoid the requirement of Bayesian inference to specify a probability model of the data, but rather exchanges the requirement to evaluate the pdf of this model (needed to evaluate the likelihood function) by the requirement to sample model output realizations. For this reason ABC is attractive for inference in the signature domain. We clarify poorly understood aspects of ABC in the hydrological literature, including similarities and differences between ABC and GLUE, and comment on previous applications of ABC in hydrology. An error analysis of ABC approximation errors and their dependence on the tolerance is presented. An empirical case study is used to illustrate the impact of omitting the specification of a probabilistic model (and instead using a deterministic model within the ABC algorithm), and the impact of a coarse ABC tolerance.

AB Legacy anthropogenic nitrogen (N) has been suggested as a major cause for increasing riverine N exports despite significant declines in anthropogenic N inputs in many regions. However, little quantitative knowledge exists concerning the contribution of the legacy N pool to riverine N export. This study developed a dynamic watershed N delivery model to address the role of transient storage of anthropogenic N inputs on riverine N flux. Employing simple mass balance and equivalent substitution rules, the model expresses the transient storage of legacy N mass with a term that combines the previous one year's riverine total N (TN) flux, relevant explanatory variables, and unknown parameters, enabling us to inversely calibrate the model parameters from measurable variables using Bayesian statistics. The model efficacy was demonstrated through application to the Yong'an River watershed in eastern China based on a 31 year record (1980-2010) of riverine TN fluxes. The model can quantify annual transient storage of legacy N and its resulting contribution to annual riverine N flux. The model also allows partitioning of the complete long-term mass balance for the fate (e.g., transient storage, riverine export, and loss/retention by denitrification, biomass uptake and wood product export) of annual anthropogenic N inputs. To further improve the model, various N input-output processes can be specified and long-term measurements of N fates are required to further verify the model results. This study demonstrates the need to consider transient storage effects as an improvement to current watershed models and for developing and assessing N pollution control measures.

TI Riparian soil temperature modification of the relationship between flow
   and dissolved organic carbon concentration in a boreal stream

AB Discharge is often strongly correlated to the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]) in watercourses. One recently proposed way to model this is the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM) concept that accounts for the role of flow pathway control on [DOC] dynamics in streams. However, in boreal systems, there is also commonly a seasonal pattern, which cannot be explained by variability in discharge alone. The objectives with this study were to (1) demonstrate RIM as a tool for studying variability in stream water chemistry, (2) investigate factors related to stream water DOC variability, and (3) modify RIM to account for these factors. RIM was used with 14 years of daily discharge and almost 500 stream measurements of [DOC] from a forested boreal headwater stream. We used the calibrated RIM to account for discharge influences and then investigated variables that could be related to DOC variability (air and soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, antecedent flow and stream sulfate). Five alternative formulations of RIM, with temporally varying soil concentration profiles based on the variability in soil temperature and/or antecedent flow, were evaluated. The model where only the effects of riparian soil temperature on dynamics in DOC depth profiles were included performed best overall. This dynamic RIM improved the Nash-Sutcliffe to 0.58 compared to 0.42 for the flow-only formulation and reduced the median absolute error from 3.0 to 2.1 mg L (-1). This study demonstrates that RIM is a simple way of modeling stream DOC and exploring controls on stream water chemistry.

AB [1] We quantified canopy transpiration (E-C) using sap flux measurements representing the four major forest types (northern hardwoods, conifer, aspen/fir, and forested wetland) around the WLEF-TV tall tower in northern Wisconsin. In order to scale individual sap flux measurements to E-C, we quantified the amount of sapwood area per unit ground area and the spatial distribution of sap flux within trees. Contrary to our hypothesis that all tree species would have the same positive relationship between tree diameter and sapwood depth, white cedar and speckled alder, both wetland species, showed no relationship. We also hypothesized that the conifer trees would have a lower whole tree hydraulic conductance than deciduous trees. We actually discovered that white cedar had the highest hydraulic conductance. Our third hypothesis, that sapwood area per unit ground area would determine stand E-C, was not rejected. The resulting average daily E-C values over 53 days (23 June to 16 August 2000) from combining sap flux and sapwood area per unit ground area were 1.4, 0.8, 2.1, and 1.4 mm d(-1) for conifer, northern hardwoods, aspen/fir, and forested wetland cover types, respectively. Average daily E-C was only explained by an exponential saturation with daily average vapor pressure deficit.

TI Minimum relative entropy inversion: Theory and application to recovering

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; CROSS-ENTROPY; AXIOMATIC DERIVATION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS;
   PRINCIPLE
AB In this paper we show that given prior information in terms of a lower and upper bound, a prior bias, and constraints in terms of measured data, minimum relative entropy (MRE) yields exact expressions for the posterior probability density function (pdf) and the expected value of the linear inverse problem. In addition, we are able to produce any desired confidence intervals. In numerical simulations, we use the MRE approach to recover the release and evolution histories of plume in a one-dimensional, constant known velocity and dispersivity system. For noise-free data, we find that the reconstructed plume evolution history is indistinguishable from the true history. An exact match to the observed data is evident. Two methods are chosen for dissociating signal from a noisy data set. The first uses a modification of MRE for uncertain data. The second method uses ''presmoothing'' by fast Fourier transforms and Butterworth filters to attempt to remove noise from the signal before the ''noise-free'' variant of MRE inversion is used. Both methods appear to work very well in recovering the true signal, and qualitatively appear superior to that of Skaggs and Kabala [1994]. We also solve for a degenerate case with a very high standard deviation in the noise. The recovered model indicates that the MRE inverse method did manage to recover the salient features of the source history. Once the plume source history has been developed, future behavior of a plume can then be cast in a probabilistic framework. For an example simulation, the MRE approach not only was able to resolve the source function from noisy data but also was able to correctly predict future behavior.

AB Urbanization and changing rainfall intensities affect the performance of urban stormwater infrastructure, creating the necessity to design resilient stormwater systems. One proposed method to increase the resilience of stormwater infrastructure is the active control of system flows. To improve the understanding of actively-controlled urban water infrastructure function under variable hydro-climate, we develop a stochastic water balance model for stormwater retention and detention basins with both passive and actively-controlled outflow structures. Under active outflow control, the outflow valve is closed until the water level in the basin reaches a specified maximum at which point the valve opens and the basin empties. Using the stochastic water balance model, we develop analytical expressions for the steady-state probability density functions (PDFs) of water level and valve closure time, as well as the joint PDF of water level and valve closure time. These PDFs then are used to define water level and flow duration curves that provide a probabilistic description of the full range of basin performance. The model accurately predicts the water level PDF estimated from data collected at a retention basin with a passive outflow structure. The model provides a basis for evaluating how changes in the rainfall-runoff process, affected by land use and climate change, will impact the variability of stormwater basin water storage and pollutant removal function. We find that this variability can be managed through the adaptive updating of the active control rule for the outflow structure.

AB The dissolution-induced finger pattern in geological medium plays an important role in both geological processes and engineering practices. Numerical models have been developed to investigate the evolution of the chemical dissolution front within a fluid-saturated porous medium. In these models, several permeability-porosity relationships have been proposed and incorporated into the numerical model for describing simultaneous changes in permeability and porosity induced by mineral dissolution, but limited experimental data are available to justify one form superior to the other. This study investigates the effects of the permeability-porosity relationships on the morphological evolution of the chemical dissolution front. Three porosity-permeability relationships, namely, modified Fair-Hatch, Kozeny-Carman and Verma-Pruess (VP) models are incorporated into the numerical model. A series of numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the morphological evolution of reaction front, and the corresponding behaviour diagrams are constructed. Results shows that the morphological development are similar each other for modified Fair-Fatch and Kozeny-Carman model. The VP model yields a relative low primary and secondary critical upstream pressure gradient value owing to the flow-focusing effect enhanced by the stronger dependence of permeability on porosity. A comparison of behaviour diagrams of front morphology among three relationships show that the double-fingering front occurs under condition of lower upstream pressure gradient and smaller non-uniformity spacing for VP model. Our simulations demonstrate that the choice of the permeability-porosity function plays important roles on the evolution patterns of dissolution front. Therefore, an adequate description of the permeability-porosity relationship may lead to a more realistic simulation of field problems. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Because dissolution of rocks may create and enhance groundwater flow channels, the chemical dissolution-front instability (CDFI) can control the quality of groundwater. This paper presents the theoretical analyses of porosity-permeability relationship effects on the CDFI in water-saturated porous rocks. Since the CDFI in a water-rock reaction system can be assessed by comparing the comprehensive dimensionless dynamic characteristic (CDDC) number with the corresponding critical CDDC number of the geochemical dissolution system, it is necessary to investigate theoretically how different porosity-permeability relationships can affect the CDDC number and critical CDDC number of a water-rock reaction system. With the commonly-used Kozeny-Carman (KC) formula taken as a reference porosity-permeability formula, the permeability variation indicator (PVI), which is defined as the ratio of the permeability obtained from any porosity-permeability formula to that obtained from the KC formula, is proposed to reflect the effect of the porosity-permeability formula on the CDFI in a water-rock reaction system. The theoretical results demonstrated that: (1) since the porosity-permeability formula with a higher PVI can result in a stronger Darcy flow velocity, it may have a significant influence on the CDFI in the water-rock reaction system. (2) With an increase in the PVI of a porosity-permeability formula, there is a decrease in the critical CDDC number of the water-rock reaction system. This means that the porous rock with a higher PVI can enable the CDFI to take place much easier in the water-rock reaction system. (3) The use of the porosity-permeability formula with a higher PVI can also cause an increase in both the dimensionless growth rate of a perturbation and the propagation speed of the chemical dissolution front in the water-rock reaction system.

AB The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) plays an essential role in the analysis of the shear strength, deformation, hydraulic conductivity, and aqueous diffusion of unsaturated soils. A review of methods proposed for fitting the main SWCCs is presented. The methods can be categorized into three groups, namely, (i) empirical methods, (ii) domain methods, and (iii) theoretical methods. A hysteretic model considering the contact angle hysteresis is proposed for fitting the main SWCCs based on a theoretical method. The model links the physical quantities at the micro-and macro-scale. Specifically, a modified expression describing the relationship between the volume of the liquid bridge and the water content is derived, and the contact angle hysteresis behavior is modeled based on the study of total thermodynamic potential energy. The model has a clear physical meaning, and the parameters can be obtained easily. Comparisons of the model simulation and experimental data show that the proposed model accurately captures the main features of the SWCC and describes the nonlinear relationship between the matric suction and the water content during wetting and drying processes.
   Plain Language Summary The relationship between the matric suction and the water content in the soil is known as the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). The SWCC is crucial for analyzing the shear strength, deformation, hydraulic conductivity, and aqueous diffusion of unsaturated soils. The drying SWCC is typically located above the wetting SWCC in a given plane. This phenomenon can be described by the hysteretic behavior of the SWCC. The determination of a complete set of hysteretic SWCCs involves measuring the matric suction and water content during wetting and drying processes. However, these measurements are time-consuming and costly, and the use of raw experimental data without a fitted model is impractical. Therefore, we developed a novel hysteretic model based on the Young-Laplace equation to address these issues. The model links the physical quantities at the micro-and macro-scale and accurately captures the main features of the SWCCs.

AB Karstic groundwater systems are often investigated by a combination of environmental or artificial tracers. One of the major downsides of tracer-based methods is the limited availability of tracer measurements, especially in data sparse regions. This study presents an approach to systematically evaluate the information content of the available data, to interpret predictions of tracer concentration from machine learning algorithms, and to compare different machine learning algorithms to obtain an objective assessment of their applicability for predicting environmental tracers. There is a large variety of machine learning approaches, but no clear rules exist on which of them to use for this specific problem. In this study, we formulated a framework to choose the appropriate algorithm for this purpose. We compared four different well-established machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machines, Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks) in seven different karst springs in France for their capability to predict tracer concentrations, in this case SO42- and NO3-, from discharge. Our study reveals that the machine learning algorithms are able to predict some characteristics of the tracer concentration, but not the whole variance, which is caused by the limited information content in the discharge data. Nevertheless, discharge is often the only information available for a catchment, so the ability to predict at least some characteristics of the tracer concentrations from discharge time series to fill, for example, gaps or increase the database for consecutive analyses is a helpful application of machine learning in data sparse regions or for historic databases.

AB The coordination of reservoir operation is critical for water systems' efficiency. Improved coordination requires sharing information, demanding a clear understanding of the potential gains and its distribution among the users to motivate engagement in coordinated operations and bearing of transaction costs. In a multiuser, multireservoir system, the evaluation of the potential coordination gains is not trivial because it requires the simultaneous evaluation of numerous trade offs. This paper presents a methodology to identify the likely upper and lower bounds in multireservoir system benefits, providing a reference framework for analyzing the economic value of coordination. The methodology is applied to a large-scale multireservoir system in Brazil. The methods rely on the comparison between two management scenarios. The first one mimics typical system operation based on individually designed rule curves, which are likely to perform on the lower bound. This is compared with fullscale system-wide optimization through an Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm to represent fully coordinated reservoir operation (upper bound). For our case study, results indicate that better coordination reduced spills and improved releases timing according to reservoirs characteristics and location, allowing overall gains between 3% and 8% in energy and 7.9% in revenues, with revenues mostly improved by coordination in dry years. Larger reservoirs presented the highest gains in absolute terms, while the smaller ones presented the highest relative increases. By indicating individual gains at each reservoir, valuable information is produced to support future negotiations and benefit sharing among different agents, being water agencies or power companies.

AB Water availability is becoming more uncertain as human populations grow, cities expand into rural regions and the climate changes. In this study, we examine the functional relationship between water use and the spatial patterns of developed land across the rapidly growing region of the southeastern United States. We quantified the spatial pattern of developed land within census tract boundaries, including multiple metrics of density and configuration. Through non-spatial and spatial regression approaches we examined relationships and spatial dependencies between the spatial pattern metrics, socio-economic and environmental variables and two water use variables: a) domestic water use, and b) total development-related water use (a combination of public supply, domestic self-supply and industrial self-supply). Metrics describing the spatial patterns of development had the highest measure of relative importance (accounting for 53% of model's explanatory power), explaining significantly more variance in water use compared to socio-economic or environmental variables commonly used to estimate water use. Integrating metrics characterizing the spatial pattern of development into water use models is likely to increase their utility and could facilitate water-efficient land use planning.

AB We investigate space-time dynamics of soil water through extreme drought and wet periods for a Mid-Atlantic Piedmont catchment. Soil moisture is a nonlinear control of soil nitrogen cycling processes, providing "hot spot" and "hot moment" dynamics that are not well modeled using time- or space-averaged conditions. We document spatial variation in near-surface soil moisture and examine relationships between mean and variance in soil moisture at plot and watershed scales. Riparian plot soil moisture spatial variance was significantly higher than the variance in uplands and was high relative to soil moisture variance reported by other studies. Plot soil moisture means closely followed a linear trend with the topographic wetness index. However, high within-plot variance obscured this relationship for experiments where smaller subsets of samples were used, emphasizing the importance of replicate plot measurements to account for fine-scale heterogeneity in soil moisture. We demonstrate the importance of these spatial-temporal patterns of soil moisture for estimates of hydrologic controls on biogeochemical cycling by showing that undersampling of fine-scale soil moisture variation is likely to lead to overestimation and underestimation of nitrification and denitrification, respectively.

AB The semi-empirical Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation is the most famous permeability-porosity relation, which is widely used in the field of flow in porous media and is the starting point for many other permeability models. However, this relation has many limitations from its inception, and the KC constant is an empirical parameter which was proved to be not a constant. In this paper, we briefly reviewed the KC equation, its modifications and various models for the KC constant. We then derived an analytical expression for the permeability in homogeneous porous media based on the fractal characters of porous media and capillary model. The proposed model is expressed as a function of fractal dimensions, porosity and maximum pore size. The analytical KC constant with no empirical constant is obtained from the assumption of square geometrical model. Furthermore, a distinct linear scaling law between the dimensionless permeability and porosity is found. It is also shown that our analytical permeability is more closely related to the microstructures (fractal dimensions, porosity and maximum pore size), compared to those obtained from conventional methods and models.

AB In this paper, we study flow through vegetated wetlands using high resolution computational models to describe the flow. The goal is to describe drag characteristics of this flow at the large scales as a function of Reynolds number. This work is of importance to scientists and engineers dealing with wetland health and restoration, inland flooding due to tropical storms and hurricanes, and river lining projects. The existence of vegetation affects the flow resistance, which is a major factor in determining velocity and water level distribution in wetlands.
   For low Reynolds numbers, wetlands behave similarly to porous media, where it is well-known that Stokes flow at the micro-scale can be upscaled through homogenization to Darcy's Law at the macro-scale. As Reynolds number increases moderately, small-scale drag effects can be captured by adding a quadratic and/or cubic term to the Darcy equation; the so-called Darcy-Forchheimer model. For higher Reynolds numbers, Stokes equation is no longer a valid approximation, and full Navier-Stokes models must be used. We utilize large eddy simulation (LES) to study vegetative drag at high Reynolds numbers. The numerical simulations in this paper are performed using the Proteus Toolkit, which is under development by Kees and Farthing at ERDC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different mechanisms are understood to represent the primary sources of the variance of travel time distribution in natural catchments. To quantify the fraction of variance introduced by each component, dispersion coefficients have been earlier defined in the framework of geomorphology-based rainfall-runoff models. In this paper we compare over a wide range of basin sizes and for a variety of runoff conditions the relative role of geomorphological dispersion, related to the heterogeneity of path lengths, and hillslope kinematic dispersion, generated by flow processes within the hillslopes. Unlike previous works, our approach does not focus on a specific study case; instead, we try to generalize results already obtained in previous literature stemming from the definition of a few significant parameters related to the metrics of the catchment and flow dynamics. We further extend this conceptual framework considering the effects of two additional variance-producing processes: the first covers the random variability of hillslope velocities (i.e. of travel times over hillslopes); the second deals with non-uniform production of runoffover the basin (specifically related to drainage density). Results are useful to clarify the role of hillslope kinematic dispersion and define under which conditions it counteracts or reinforces geomorphological dispersion. We show how its sign is ruled by the specific spatial distribution of hillslope lengths within the basin, as well as by flow conditions. Interestingly, while negative in a wide range of cases, kinematic dispersion is expected to become invariantly positive when the variability of hillslope velocity is large. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of flow heterogeneity on chemical transport from single to multiple fractures is investigated. The emphasis is on the dynamic nature of the specific surface area (SSA) due to heterogeneity of the flow, relative to a purely geometrical definition. The flow-dependent SSA is interpreted probabilistically, following inert tracer particles along individual fractures. Upscaling to a fracture network is proposed as a time domain random walk based on the statistics of SSA for single fractures. Statistics of SSA are investigated for three correlation structures of transmissivity: multi-Gaussian and two non-multi-Gaussian. The mean of SSA stabilizes after similar to 20 fractures at different values depending on whether the cubic or quadratic hydraulic law is assumed. The results are tested against comprehensive DFN simulations based on site-specific data but also against direct estimates from a wider range of tracer tests. The proposed time domain random walk methodology sets bounds for SSA in a 75% confidence interval as similar to 1800 1/m and 27,000 1/m, with a median of 14,000 1/m; these values capture reasonably well both the DFN simulation and tracer test SSA data. Presented results may be particularly relevant when quantifying uncertainty of reactive transport modeling in fractured rock.

DT Article
DE channel asymmetry; floods; fluvial instability; hydraulic geometry;
   scaling
AB The power law dependencies between channel morphology and river flows, known as at-station hydraulic geometry (HG), have been recently shown to have exponents that systematically vary with scale (contributing area). To explain these empirical trends, a generalized HG model whose parameters are explicit functions of scale was derived by Dodov and Foufoula-Georgiou [2004], based on a statistical multiscaling formalism. In this paper we attempt to provide a physical explanation for this scale dependence. The hypothesis we pose is that it arises from the scale dependence of fluvial instability, which induces systematic variation in river planform geometry (e.g., sinuosity, meander wavelength, and radius of curvature) and consequent variations in channel cross-sectional shape with scale. In other words, we postulate that the scale-dependent HG is a direct consequence of the systematic increase of channel cross-sectional asymmetry over reaches of increasing scale. To test this hypothesis, we employ both a direct analysis of observations and also a physical model of meandering rivers, which is based on linearization of the fully coupled equations of mass and momentum balance for water and sediment. We show that the HG emerging from this physical model is scale-dependent and agrees with the empirical observations and the statistical multiscaling model.

AB Nowadays, most of rivers globally are regulated by dams and reservoirs, which have substantially altered natural streamflow regimes. Understanding the impacts of these dams and reservoirs on streamflow is essential for water resources management. In situ reservoir release data or actual reservoir operating rules are difficult to obtain, particularly for transboundary rivers, resulting in the tremendous difficulty of simulating exact reservoir behaviors. This study aims to use easy-to-obtain satellite observations combined with a distributed hydrological model to estimate reservoir releases at the daily time scale. The developed Satellite-Based Reservoir routing Scheme (SBRS) was applied to two individual reservoirs in the United States and Thailand and cascade reservoirs on the Lancang River in China. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and hydrographs of daily regulated streamflow simulations were used to assess the performance of the reservoir release simulations. The SBRS was compared with four other global reservoir operation schemes and showed better overall performance with higherCCand lowerNRMSE. In addition, the SBRS performed better for the individual reservoirs (CC > 0.6,NRMSE < 0.2) than the cascade reservoirs, which is attributed to the uncertainty in the simulation of inflow and reservoir storage changes and to the lack of remote sensing data for all the cascade reservoirs. This study explores the potential of satellite observations combined with hydrological modeling in elucidating reservoir behaviors in ungauged and/or transboundary river basins. A better understanding of reservoir behaviors serves as a basis for water resources management and provides a more cooperative environment for all stakeholders of a basin.

AB Despite recognition of the potential economic benefits and increasing interest in developing marketing instruments, water markets have remained thin and slow to evolve due to high transactions costs, third party effects, and the persistence of historical institutions for water allocation. Water banks are a marketing instrument that can address these obstacles to trade, allowing irrigators within a region to exchange water in order to mitigate the short-term effects of drought. Water banks coexist with the institutions governing water allocation, which implies that rule changes, such as adoption of a system of conjunctive surface water-groundwater administration, carry implications for the economic impacts of banking. This paper assesses and compares the welfare and distributional outcomes for irrigators in the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho under a suite of water management and drought scenarios. We find that water banking can offset irrigators' profit losses during drought, but that its ability to do so depends on whether it facilitates trade across groundwater and surface water users. With conjunctive administration, a bank allowing trade by source realizes 22.23% of the maximum potential efficiency gains from trade during a severe drought, while a bank that allows trade across sources realizes 93.47% of the maximum potential gains. During drought, conjunctive administration redistributes welfare from groundwater to surface water producers, but banking across sources allows groundwater irrigators to recover 88.4% of the profits lost from drought at a cost of 2.2% of the profit earned by surface water irrigators.

AB The aim of this study is to understand the canopy interception of Qinghai spruce forest under conditions of different precipitation characteristics and canopy structures in the upper reach of Heihe River basin, northwestern China. On the basis of a continuous record covering our investigating period by an automatic throughfall-collecting system, we analysed the relationships between the canopy interception and the precipitation characteristics. Our results support the well-established exponential decay relationship between the gross precipitation and the interception percentage after the canopy is saturated. But our results sufficiently illustrate a notable point that the variations in the interception percentage are almost independent from the variations in the gross precipitation before the canopy is saturated. Our examination into the relationship between the interception and the 10-min average intensity of precipitation demonstrates a divergent relationship, and the divergent relationship is bracketed by an upper dry line' indicating that 100% of gross precipitation was intercepted before saturation and by a lower wet line' suggesting that the actual canopy storage capacity reached the maximum and evaporation was the only component of the interception. To search for the relationship between canopy structures and interception, we grouped the canopy covers over the 90 throughfall-collecting tanks into ten categories ranging from 0 (no cover) to 0.9 (nearly completely covered), and the corresponding canopy interception was calculated by subtracting the averaged throughfall of each canopy-cover category from the gross precipitation. The results show that the interception percentage increases faster with increasing canopy cover under intermediate rainfall conditions than that under heavy rainfall conditions. Unexpectedly, under light rainfall conditions the increasing rate of interception percentage with increasing canopy cover and also with increasing plant area index is not faster than that under the intermediate rainfall conditions simply because the tank-measured percentage of interception was extremely high at near-zero canopy cover conditions.

TI Comparison of pore-scale capillary pressure to macroscale capillary

   and quasi-static conditions

AB Conventional macroscale two-phase flow equations for porous media (such as Darcy's law and Richards Equation) require a constitutive relation for capillary pressure (P-c). The capillary pressure relation significantly impacts the behavior and prediction of fluid flow in porous media, and needs to accurately characterize the capillary forces. In a typical laboratory experiment, a functional macroscopic capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S-w) relationship is measured as the difference between the pressures of the non-wetting-phase reservoir at the inlet (P-nw) and wetting-phase reservoir at the outlet (P-w) of a porous medium. It is well-known that this traditional macroscopic capillary pressure definition is valid only at equilibrium conditions and if the phases are connected. Under non-equilibrium (dynamic) conditions, when the fluids are moving, the macroscopic capillary pressure measured in experiments implicitly includes the pressure head caused by viscous effects.
   The goal of the present effort is to understand how well the traditional macroscopic capillary pressure definition represents the pore-scale capillary forces under different flow conditions. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of two-phase flow in a porous medium, we evaluate the capillary pressure at the pore-scale, and compare it to the macroscopic capillary pressure, P-c(S-w), that is typically measured in experiments using pressure transducers. The pore-scale capillary pressure is the pressure difference across the interface between two fluids as the fluids move through a porous medium; the interface pressure differences at fluid-fluid invasion front are averaged across all the pores of the porous medium to yield a representative pore-scale capillary pressure curve, referred to as the interface capillary pressure. The pore-scale interface capillary pressure represents the "true" capillary forces in the system, since depends only on the pore morphology (shape) and interfacial energy of the two fluids, and does not account for the viscous dissipation. In experiments it is difficult to measure the interface capillary pressure jump without accounting for the viscous pressure head, which is at least an order of magnitude larger. Upscaling the pore-scale capillary pressure is an essential step for complete characterization of capillary-dominant two-phase flow in a porous medium at the laboratory scale.
   Drainage is simulated under equilibrium (quasi-static) and non-equilibrium (dynamic) conditions for various capillary numbers. The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved in the pore space using the open-source finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, OpenFOAM. The Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method is employed to track the evolution of the fluid-fluid interfaces, and a contact angle is used to account for the effect of wall adhesion. The simulations are first validated with published experimental data for dynamic and quasistatic drainage in a micromodel. From the microscale simulations, the interface capillary pressure is determined, and compared to the macroscopic capillary pressure under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Our results show the traditionally-measured macroscopic capillary pressure curves exhibit a strong dependence on the capillary number under dynamic flow conditions. In contrast, the interface capillary pressure-saturation relation, which relies on pore-scale pressure differences at the invasion front, is almost invariant of flow conditions (dynamic and quasi-static).

AB [1] Groundwater can be a source of both water and salts in semiarid areas, and therefore, capillary pressure-induced upward water flow may cause root zone salinization. To identify which conditions result in hazardous salt concentrations in the root zone, we combined the mass balance equations for salt and water, further assuming a Poisson-distributed daily rainfall and brackish groundwater quality. For the water fluxes (leaching, capillary upflow, and evapotranspiration), we account for osmotic effects of the dissolved salt mass using Van't Hoff's law. Root zone salinity depends on salt transport via capillary flux and on evapotranspiration, which concentrates salt in the root zone. Both a wet climate and shallow groundwater lead to wetter root zone conditions, which in combination with periodic rainfall enhances salt removal by leaching. For wet climates, root zone salinity (concentrations) increases as groundwater is more shallow (larger groundwater influence). For dry climates, salinity increases as groundwater is deeper because of a drier root zone and less leaching. For intermediate climates, opposing effects can push the salt balance either way. Root zone salinity increases almost linearly with groundwater salinity. With a simple analytical approximation, maximum concentrations can be related to the mean capillary flow rate, leaching rate, water

AB We address modern topics of stochastic hydrogeology from their potential relevance to real modeling efforts at the field scale. While the topics of stochastic hydrogeology and numerical modeling have become routine in hydrogeological studies, nondeterministic models have not yet permeated into practitioners. We point out a number of limitations of stochastic modeling when applied to real applications and comment on the reasons why stochastic models fail to become an attractive alternative for practitioners. We specifically separate issues corresponding to flow, conservative transport, and reactive transport. The different topics addressed are emphasis on process modeling, need for upscaling parameters and governing equations, relevance of properly accounting for detailed geological architecture in hydrogeological modeling, and specific challenges of reactive transport. We end up by concluding that the main responsible for nondeterministic models having not yet permeated in industry can be fully attributed to researchers in stochastic hydrogeology.

AB One-dimensional flows of gravity currents within horizontal and inclined porous channels are investigated combining theoretical and experimental analysis to evaluate the joint effects of channel shape and fluid rheology. The parameter beta governs the shape of the channel cross section, while the fluid rheology is characterised by a power-law model with behaviour index n. Self-similar scalings for current length and height are obtained for horizontal and inclined channels when the current volume increases with time as t(alpha).
   For horizontal channels, the interplay of model parameters alpha, n, and beta governs the front speed, height, and aspect ratio of the current (ratio between the average height and the length). The dependency is modulated by two critical values of alpha,alpha(beta) = n/(n+1) and alpha(n) = (2 beta + 1)/beta. For all channel shapes, alpha(beta) discriminates between currents whose height decreases (alpha< alpha(beta)) or increases (alpha > alpha(beta)) with time at a particular point. For all power-law fluids, alpha(n) discriminates between decelerated currents, with timedecreasing aspect ratio (alpha< alpha(n)), and accelerated currents, with time-increasing aspect ratio (alpha > alpha(n)). Only currents with time-decreasing height (alpha < alpha(beta)) and aspect ratio (alpha < alpha(n)) respect model assumptions asymptotically; the former constraint is more restrictive than the latter.
   For inclined channels, a numerical solution in self-similar form is obtained under the hypothesis that the product of the channel inclination theta and the slope of the free-surface is much smaller than unity; this produces a negligible error for theta > 2 degrees, and is acceptable for theta > 0.5 degrees. The action of gravity in inclined channels is modulated by both the behaviour index n and the shape factor beta. For constant flux, the current reaches at long times a steady state condition with a uniform thickness profile. In steep channels and for sufficiently long currents, the free-surface slope becomes entirely negligible with respect to channel inclination, and the constant thickness profile depends only on n.
   Theoretical results are validated by comparison with experiments (i) in horizontal and inclined channels with triangular or semicircular cross-section, (ii) with different shear-thinning fluids, and (iii) for constant volume and constant flux conditions. The experimental results show good agreement with theoretical predictions in the long-time regime.
   Our analysis demonstrates that self-similar solutions are able to capture the essential long-term behaviour of gravity currents in porous media, accounting for diverse effects such as non-Newtonian rheology, presence of boundaries, and channel inclination. This provides a relatively simple framework for sensitivity analysis, and a convenient benchmark for numerical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study sheds light on the limitations of using [(cos )(1/2)] to scale sorptivity by contact angle while reaffirming its scaling by geometrical Miller scaling factor ((1/2)). The sorptivity for uniform and nonuniform (wavy) capillary tubes was determined by a mathematical model that includes the effect of inertia and dynamic contact angle. Given that real porous media are preferably represented by a bundle of nonuniform rather than uniform capillary tubes, the relationship between sorptivity and contact angle was examined for different combinations of contact angles and capillary tube degrees of waviness. A general relationship of S=f [cos )] (with 1/2) was found. The deviation of from 1/2 (associated with uniform capillary tubes) increased with contact angle and capillary waviness increase. Zero sorptivity was obtained even for wettable capillaries, <90 degrees, a phenomenon that has been generally associated with hydrophobic capillaries (90 degrees). Contact angle and nonuniform pore structure had a synergistic effect on sorptivity. Capillary nonuniformity per se diminished sorptivity but its synergy with contact angle markedly magnified this reduction. Thus, following the sorptivity impact on finger width, it is rational to assume that larger-than-zero contact angles are involved in the formation of narrow fingers with an abrupt change between the inner wet and surrounding dry areas.

AB The processes underlying sediment transport mechanics are still debated. Here, we present novel ensemble particle bedload measurements, obtained with high-frequency imaging of particle velocities and activity over various bedform migration stages. We show that the bedload particle flux quickly responds to the unsteady non-uniform flow over the bed. Mean particle velocity linearly increases over the dune slopes towards the crest. In contrast, particle activity exhibits a power law increase over the dune slopes, with the top layer almost saturating in the saltation regime. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal variability of particle motion over dune slopes is high. For lower flow, spatial and temporal variability from small-scale topography, such as superposed bedforms, spurs, and irregular crestlines, are shown to be important for quantifying sediment dynamics. With increasing flow, however, the cross-stream particle velocities increase significantly, influenced by the large-scale dune topography (transverse slopes). Overall, variability in the particle flux increases with both flow strength and frequency of turbulent events. For the mean particle flux over the dune slopes, however, differences between neighboring dunes are large, which are attributed to dune topography variations and flow acceleration. The presented insights are essential to validate numerical simulations of sediment dynamics in three-dimensional flow conditions over dune beds.

AB The focus of this work was on understanding the impact of evaporation on the capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S) state of a porous medium. Evaporation is ubiquitous near the ground surface in the vadose zone, but little is known about how evaporation impacts the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation. The hypothesis driving the work was that the P-c-S relationship is the result of an equilibrium between evaporative water loss, capillary forces, and the upward flow of water to replenish evaporated water. Experiments were conducted using two different porous media, a coarse sand and a nylon membrane with a 20 tun pore size. Long-term evaporation experiments were conducted using different configurations to control evaporation within the media. Results found that increased accessibility to evaporation caused saturation in drainage P-c-S curves to decrease over time, causing the curves to become closer to imbibition P-c-S curves. In the membrane, the high external surface area to pore volume ratio caused changes in evaporative flux to produce rapid changes in the P-c-S state of the medium. One implication of the work is that results suggest that long-term drainage experiments in vented columns may not necessarily provide a meaningful measurement of static P-c-S curve, but rather may be impacted by evaporation.

AB Flood hazard maps are useful tools for land planning and flood risk management in order to increase the safety of flood-prone areas that can be inundated in the event of levee failure. However, flood hazard assessment is affected by various uncertainties, both aleatory and epistemic. The flood hazard analysis should hence take into account the main sources of uncertainty and quantify the confidence of the results for a given design flood event. To this end, this paper presents a probabilistic method for flood hazard mapping, which considers uncertainty due to breach location and failure time. A reliability analysis of the discretized levee system, performed using the concept of fragility function, enables the preselection of a set of levee sections more susceptible to failure. The probabilities of the breach scenarios (characterized by different breach locations and times) are then calculated using the probability multiplication rule, neglecting multiple breaches. The method is applied to a 96-km levee-protected reach in the central portion of the Po River (Northern Italy) and to an adjacent 1,900-km(2) flood-prone area on the right-hand side of the river, with a focus on the piping breach mechanism. The numerical simulations are performed through a combined 1D-2D hydrodynamic model using widespread free software. The results show that the method is effective for probabilistic inundation and flood hazard mapping. In addition, it has the advantage of requiring a smaller computational effort in comparison with the methods based on a classic Monte Carlo procedure.

AB Eight years (2002-2010) of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover fraction (SCF) observations are assimilated separately or jointly into the Noah land surface model over a domain in Northern Colorado. A multiscale ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used, supplemented with a rule-based update. The satellite data are either left unscaled or are scaled for anomaly assimilation. The results are validated against in situ observations at 14 high-elevation Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites with typically deep snow and at 4 lower-elevation Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) sites. Assimilation of coarse-scale AMSR-E SWE and fine-scale MODIS SCF observations both result in realistic spatial SWE patterns. At COOP sites with shallow snowpacks, AMSR-E SWE and MODIS SCF data assimilation are beneficial separately, and joint SWE and SCF assimilation yields significantly improved root-mean-square error and correlation values for scaled and unscaled data assimilation. In areas of deep snow where the SNOTEL sites are located, however, AMSR-E retrievals are typically biased low and assimilation without prior scaling leads to degraded SWE estimates. Anomaly SWE assimilation could not improve the interannual SWE variations in the assimilation results because the AMSR-E retrievals lack realistic interannual variability in deep snowpacks. SCF assimilation has only a marginal impact at the SNOTEL locations because these sites experience extended periods of near-complete snow cover. Across all sites, SCF assimilation improves the timing of the onset of the snow season but without a net improvement of SWE amounts.

AB Large-scale climatic variability in the North Atlantic region modulates seasonal rainfall and river flow across the British Isles. We show how the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) dramatically increases orographic enhancement of upland precipitation. NAO variations cause large differences in seasonal precipitation totals compared to NAO-neutral conditions, an effect amplified with altitude-what we term "double orographic enhancement.'' For NAO conditions since 1825, this gives a maximum range of 150% in precipitation totals at the wettest (upland) location compared to NAO-neutral conditions. In autumn, winter, and spring, there is a strong positive relationship between upland precipitation and NAO; this is not seen at low altitude except on northwest coasts. In summer, significant negative relationships are evident in the English lowlands. These precipitation patterns directly translate to seasonal runoff. Our findings show that the hydroclimatology of rainfall and river flow in upland areas is closely coupled to the strength of atmospheric circulation, an effect which strengthens with increasing altitude. Identified effects are large enough to cause very high river flow during periods of highly positive NAO but may also lead to severe drought when NAO is highly negative.

AB At present, groundwater vulnerability assessment is mainly aimed at phreatic aquifer, but in most areas, people draw water from confined aquifer, so it is necessary to assess the vulnerability of confined water. As the existing groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are greatly influenced by subjectivity. The purpose of this study is to put forward W-F&PNN method to avoid subjectivity. Weber-Fechner (W-F) law in psychophysics and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) are combined in this paper. W-F law is a theory for describing the people's response to a stimulus, which is used to calculate the cluster center and determine the assessment standard; Probabilistic Neural Network is a widely used algorithm for classification, which is used to classify the vulnerability of confined water. According to the influence factors of confined water, the assessment parameters D(3)A(2)C(2) were determined, and the vulnerability of confined water in plain area of Xi'an city in 2005 was assessed by W-F&PNN method and were divided into four categories. The vulnerability of confined water gradually reduces from the flood plain, the first terrace, the second terrace, the third terrace, the alluvial fan, to the loess tableland. Results of vulnerability assessment were validated by nitrate concentration in 2016 over the area. The results show that the distribution of vulnerability region is mostly consistent with that of nitrate concentration region. The W-F&PNN method does not assign rate, but calculate the cluster center; and not need to assign weight for parameters, avoiding subjectivity, is a reliable method for groundwater vulnerability assessment and suitable for the area with insufficient data.

AB Water quality in tropical rivers is changing rapidly. The ongoing boom of dam construction for hydropower is one of the drivers for this change. In particular, the stratification in tropical reservoirs induces oxygen deficits in their deep waters and warmer surface water temperatures, which often translate into altered thermal and oxygen regimes of downstream river systems, with cascading consequences for the entire aquatic ecosystem. Operation rules of reservoirs, involving water intakes at different levels, could mitigate the consequences for downstream water quality. However, optimized water management of deep reservoirs relies on predictive models for water quality, but such predictive capability is often lacking for tropical dams. Here we focus on the Zambezi River Basin (southern Africa) to address this gap. Using the one-dimensional General Lake Model, we reproduced the internal dynamics of the transboundary Lake Kariba, the world's largest artificial lake by volume, created by damming the Zambezi River at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Through this modeling approach, we assessed and quantified the thermal and oxygen alteration in the Zambezi River downstream of the reservoir. Results suggest that these alterations depend directly on Kariba's stratification dynamics, its water level and the transboundary policies for water withdrawal from the reservoir. Scenario calculations indicate a large potential for mitigating downstream water quality alterations by implementing a hypothetical selective withdrawal technology. However, we show that a different and cooperative management of the existing infrastructure of Kariba Dam has the potential to mitigate most of the actual water quality alterations.

TI Application of multiobjective optimization to scheduling capacity
   expansion of urban water resource systems
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Significant population increase in urban areas is likely to result in a deterioration of drought security and level of service provided by urban water resource systems. One way to cope with this is to optimally schedule the expansion of system resources. However, the high capital costs and environmental impacts associated with expanding or building major water infrastructure warrant the investigation of scheduling system operational options such as reservoir operating rules, demand reduction policies, and drought contingency plans, as a way of delaying or avoiding the expansion of water supply infrastructure. Traditionally, minimizing cost has been considered the primary objective in scheduling capacity expansion problems. In this paper, we consider some of the drawbacks of this approach. It is shown that there is no guarantee that the social burden of coping with drought emergencies is shared equitably across planning stages. In addition, it is shown that previous approaches do not adequately exploit the benefits of joint optimization of operational and infrastructure options and do not adequately address the need for the high level of drought security expected for urban systems. To address these shortcomings, a new multiobjective optimization approach to scheduling capacity expansion in an urban water resource system is presented and illustrated in a case study involving the bulk water supply system for Canberra. The results show that the multiobjective approach can address the temporal equity issue of sharing the burden of drought emergencies and that joint optimization of operational and infrastructure options can provide solutions superior to those just involving infrastructure options.

AB Depth to water table (DWT) for an unconfined aquifer affects a wide range of hydrological, ecological, and agri-cultural problems such as soil salinization, plant type, and crop output. In a world without human impacts, DWT in shallow groundwater zones is mainly driven by evapotranspiration and precipitation. In the real-world however, human impacts on groundwater hydrological processes are ubiquitous, which hinders one to fully un-derstand the natural groundwater hydrological rule. The purpose of this study is to derive an analytical solution of precipitation-evapotranspiration driven DWT irrespective of the human impacts. Through pretreatment of practical data to eliminate human impacts, we show that the proposed method is efficient in dealing with the real-world problems. Specifically, we establish a mathematical model describing impacts of periodic evapotran-spiration and precipitation on DWT. An innovative quasi-analytical solution using the Fourier series is developed and analyzed in detail based on the model. This study indicates that the amplitude of DWT is correlated linearly with the amplitude of precipitation and quadratically with the amplitude of potential evapotranspiration. The phase position of DWT is subject to the phase lag between the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. In arid regions, the evapotranspiration has a greater influence on the phase of DWT than the precipitation. This quasi-analytical solution is limited for a shallow groundwater situation in which DWT is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration.

AB The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global hydro-climatic variability, with well-known effects on floods, droughts, and coupled human-natural systems. Its impact on urban settlements depends on both level of exposure and preparedness; two factors that are responsible for severe cuts on millions of people in developing countries, where urban water supply relies almost entirely on rainfall-dependent sources. To understand whether information on the ENSO state could help mitigate the effects of droughts, we use Metro Manila's water supply system as exemplifying case study, for which we design "traditional" and adaptive management policies. The former are based on information typically available to operators, such as reservoir storage; the latter complement such information with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI)-an indicator used for monitoring El Nino and La Nina state. Results obtained by comparing the policy performance on a large set of stochastic streamflow and ONI replicates show that ENSO-informed policies are more robust, meaning that they attain a minimum performance level across a broader set of replicates. We show that the primary cause of this behavior is the information on the ENSO state. To further quantify the value of the ONI, we then compare the performance of a representative ENSO-informed policy and the system's current operating rules on the period 1968-2014. The comparison shows that the severe water supply restrictions caused by the existing management system could have been partially avoided through a sequence of smaller restrictions implemented at the onset of the main El Nino events.

AB We study the standard deviation of water saturation SDS as function of the mean saturation < S > by a stochastic model of unsaturated flow, which is based on the first-order solution of the three-dimensional Richards equation. The model assumes spatially variable soil properties, following a given geostatistical description, and it explicitly accounts for the different scales involved in the determination of the spatial properties of saturation: the extent L, i.e., the domain size, the spacing Delta among measurements, and the dimension l associated to the sampling measurement. It is found that the interplay between those scales and the correlation scale I of the hydraulic properties rules the spatial variability of saturation. A "scale effect'' manifests for small to intermediate L/I, for which SDS increase with the extent L. This nonergodic effect depends on the structural and hydraulic parameters as well as the scales of the problem, and it is consistent with a similar effect found in field experiments. In turn, the influence of the scale l is to decrease the saturation variability and increase its spatial correlation. Although the solution focuses on the medium heterogeneity as the main driver for the spatial variability of saturation, neglecting other important components, it explicitly links the spatial variation of saturation to the hydraulic properties of the soil, their spatial variability, and the sampling schemes; it can provide a useful tool to assess the impact of scales on the saturation variability, also in view of the several applications that involve the saturation variability.

AB A study of Rostherne Mere (Cheshire, UK) was undertaken to reveal relationships among various ecosystem components and assess the progress in lake recovery following sewage diversion. An intensive monitoring programme included measurements of dissolved oxygen. T, pH, electric conductivity, K, Mg, Ca, Si, N and P species, Secchi depth, suspended solids, chlorophyll-a, phyto- and zooplankton counts. Recorded changes and the results of correlation analysis broadly confirmed to the classic limnoecological theory and allowed detailed interpretation of the dynamics observed. The Si level was used to estimate the amount of diatom detritus produced in spring. Chemical profiles were used to estimate the amount of nutrients ac:cumulated in the hypolimnion during the stratified period. These estimates were compared with simulations made using the model of exponential decay, which showed a good performance in the case of Si but considerable underestimation in the case of P. The differences between the values simulated by the model and estimates based on field observations resulted from the additional P release from the sediments. This release could have been stimulated by a combination of factors, including the development of anoxic layers on the sediment-water interface and Si-induced desorption from Fe, Al and Mn oxides. Internal P loading during the stratified period was thus estimated at about 4-9 g/m(2), suggesting that rapid changes in the lake's trophic status are at present unlikely. Certain aspects of this work (including interpretation of interrelationships between ecosystem components, estimation of the decomposition constant. analysis of factors controlling nutrient accumulation in the hypolimnion, and a low-cost method to estimate intern; l P release) may be useful for studies of other aquatic systems and have, therefore, general limnological applicability.

AB [ 1] Controlled laboratory-scale column deposition experiments were conducted using a well-characterized mutant of the Escherichia coli ( E. coli) K12 strain to obtain insight into the mechanisms that give rise to the observed deviation from classical colloid filtration theory (CFT). Both the suspended effluent bacteria concentration and the spatial distribution of retained bacteria were systematically measured over a wide range of solution conditions using columns packed with spherical glass beads. Calculations of Derjaguin - Landau - Verwey - Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies based on measured cell zeta potentials indicated that the bacteria should experience considerable repulsive interaction forces when approaching the glass bead surface. In spite of these predictions, bacterial adhesion was observed even at the lowest solution ionic strength investigated ( 3 mM) and increased with solution salt concentration. Comparison of these results with measurements obtained using model colloidal particles ( polystyrene latex microspheres) and a different microbe ( Cryptosporidium parvum) suggested that another non-DLVO-type interaction may be contributing to the observed deposition behavior. Furthermore, predictions based on a discrete dual deposition mode (DDM) model disagreed with measured fractions of released cells. Taken together, the experimental and modeling results suggest that the deposition behavior of bacteria in saturated porous media is influenced by additional interaction mechanism(s) or factors not considered in classical DLVO theory, such as local charge heterogeneities of the cell membrane and surface biomolecule-specific interactions.

AB This study is aimed at investigating the vertical velocity profile of flow passing over a vegetal area by an analytical approach. The soil ground is considered as pervious and thus non-zero velocity at the ground surface can be estimated. The soil and vegetation layers are regarded as homogeneous and isotropic porous media. Therefore the solution of the flow can be obtained by applying the theory of turbulent flow and Biot's theory of poroelasticity after dividing the flow field into three layers: homogenous water, vegetation and pervious soil. The velocity distribution is compared with the experimental data of [Rowinski PM, Kubrak J. A mixing-length model for predicting vertical velocity distribution on flows through emergent vegetation. J Hydrol Sci 2002;47(6):893904] to show its validity. In addition, five dimensionless parameters denoting the variation of slope, permeability of soil, Reynolds stress, density of vegetation, and relative height of vegetation are proposed to reveal their effects on the surface water flow. The analytical solutions of flow velocity can also be simplified into simpler expressions to describe the flow passing over a non-vegetated area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   CANOPIES; SMOOTH; MODEL; WAVES
AB Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are efficient at wastewater treatment; however, data and physical models describing water flow through them remain limited. A two-domain model is proposed dividing the flow region into an upper part characterizing the flow through suspended vegetation and an inner part describing the vegetation-free zone. The suspended vegetation domain is represented as a porous medium characterized by constant permeability thereby allowing Biot's Law to be used to describe the mean velocity and stress profiles. The flow in the inner part is bounded by asymmetric stresses arising from interactions with the suspended vegetated (porous) base and solid channel bed. An asymmetric eddy viscosity model is employed to derive an integral expression for the shear stress and the mean velocity profiles in this inner layer. The solution features an asymmetric shear stress index that reflects two different roughness conditions over the vegetation-induced auxiliary bed and the physical channel bed. A phenomenological model is then presented to explain this index. An expression for the penetration depth into the porous medium defined by 10% of the maximum shear stress is also derived. The predicted shear stress profile, local mean velocity profile, and bulk velocity agree with the limited experiments published in the literature.

AB The objective of this research is to explore the relationship between small catchment properties and the temporal growth and decay of saturated source areas (SSA). A simple physics-based hydrologic model, which we call the Sandbox model, is developed for this purpose. A thorough sensitivity analysis is undertaken to evaluate model response to variations in model parameters. Sandbox model output is compared to that from the semi-distributed conceptual model, TOPMODEL, a model with a wide spread acceptance. Plotting the temporal evolution of the extent of saturated source area versus catchment average soil water content during a number of wetting and drying cycles shows a wide variety of trajectories or hysteretic loops. A parametric analysis was performed to quantify the impact of hypothetical catchment properties on the relationship between saturated area extent and basin-average soil water content, revealing hysteretic behavior. It is shown that this hysteresis is the result of changes in groundwater table slope, which is usually less than, and seldom equal to, the land-surface slope in non-saturated areas.

AB It is suggested that the scaling laws satisfied by fluvial erosion topography and river networks reflect a basic self-similarity or multifractality property of the topographic surface within river basins. By analyzing the symmetries of fluvial topography, we conclude that this self-similarity or multifractality condition should be expressed in a particular way in terms of the topographic increments within subbasins. We then analyze whether selfsimilar or multifractal topographies can be stationary or transient solutions of dynamic evolution models of the type partial derivative h/partial derivative t = U - f{beta, tau}, where U is the uplift rate, f is the fluvial erosion rate, beta is a vector of erodibility parameters, and tau is hydraulic shear stress. The hydraulic stress on a channel bed is assumed to satisfy tau proportional to A(m)S(n), where A is contributing area, S is slope, and m and n are parameters. We allow U to vary randomly in time and beta to vary randomly in space and determine conditions on these random functions as well as the parameters m and n under which the topography may remain in a self-similar or multifractal state. Simulation shows that self-similar states are attractive also for non-self-similar boundary and initial conditions.

AB We propose a conceptual model that examines the 'variable source area' (VSA) and 'nitrate flushing' hypothesis in the vertical direction, and use this approach to explain nitrate concentration-discharge relationships in a semi-arid watershed. We use an eco-hydrology simulation model (RHESSys) to show that small changes in the vertical distribution of nitrate mass and their interaction with soil hydraulic conductivity can result in abrupt changes in the nitrate concentration-discharge relationship. We show that the estimated concentration-discharge relationship is sensitive to the parameters governing soil vertical nitrate distribution and soil hydraulic conductivity, at both patch scale and watershed scale, where lateral redistribution of water and nitrate is also accounted for. Given heterogeneity in nitrogen inputs, uptake processes, soil drainage and storage processes, substantial variation in parameters that describe rate of changes in vertical distribution of soil nitrate and hydraulic properties is likely both within and between watersheds. Thus, we argue that vertical 'variable source area' processes may be as important as lateral VSA in determining concentration discharge relationships.

AB A unified conceptual framework for river corridors requires synthesis of diverse site-, method- and discipline-specific findings. The river research community has developed a substantial body of observations and process-specific interpretations, but we are still lacking a comprehensive model to distill this knowledge into fundamental transferable concepts. We confront the challenge of how a discipline classically organized around the deductive model of systematically collecting of site-, scale-, and mechanism-specific observations begins the process of synthesis. Machine learning is particularly well-suited to inductive generation of hypotheses. In this study, we prototype an inductive approach to holistic synthesis of river corridor observations, using support vector machine regression to identify potential couplings or feedbacks that would not necessarily arise from classical approaches. This approach generated 672 relationships linking a suite of 157 variables each measured at 62 locations in a fifth order river network. Eighty four percent of these relationships have not been previously investigated, and representing potential (hypothetical) process connections. We document relationships consistent with current understanding including hydrologic exchange processes, microbial ecology, and the River Continuum Concept, supporting that the approach can identify meaningful relationships in the data. Moreover, we highlight examples of two novel research questions that stem from interpretation of inductively-generated relationships. This study demonstrates the implementation of machine learning to sieve complex data sets and identify a small set of candidate relationships that warrant further study, including data types not commonly measured together. This structured approach complements traditional modes of inquiry, which are often limited by disciplinary perspectives and favour the careful pursuit of parsimony. Finally, we emphasize that this approach should be viewed as a complement to, rather than in place of, more traditional, deductive approaches to scientific discovery.

AB We investigated scaling of conservative solute transport using temporal moment analysis of 98 tracer experiments (384 breakthrough curves) conducted in 44 streams located on five continents. The experiments span 7 orders of magnitude in discharge (10(-3) to 10(3) m(3)/s), span 5 orders of magnitude in longitudinal scale (10(1) to 10(5) m), and sample different lotic environments-forested headwater streams, hyporheic zones, desert streams, major rivers, and an urban manmade channel. Our meta-analysis of these data reveals that the coefficient of skewness is constant over time (CSK = 1.18 +/- 0.08, R-2 > 0.98). In contrast, the CSK of all commonly used solute transport models decreases over time. This shows that current theory is inconsistent with experimental data and suggests that a revised theory of solute transport is needed. Our meta-analysis also shows that the variance (second normalized central moment) is correlated with the mean travel time (R-2 > 0.86), and the third normalized central moment and the product of the first two are very strongly correlated (R-2 > 0.96). These correlations were applied in four different streams to predict transport based on the transient storage and the aggregated dead zone models, and two probability distributions (Gumbel and log normal).

AB A recently developed technique for identifying continuous-time, time-dependent, stochastic model parameters is embedded in a general framework for identifying causes of bias and reducing bias in dynamic models. In contrast to the usual approach of considering bias in model output with an autoregressive error model or a stochastic process, we make the attempt to correct for bias within the model or even in model input. This increases the potential of learning about the causes of bias and of subsequently correcting deficits of the deterministic model structure. The time-dependent parameters as formulated in our approach can also consistently be used for adding stochasticity to the model without losing precise fulfilment of conservation laws used for deriving the model equations. An additional advantage of the suggested procedure is that it makes it possible to derive more realistic uncertainty bounds of internal model variables than is the case when bias is only considered for measured model output. This is important for mechanistic models in which internal variables have a direct physical meaning. The concept is illustrated by an application to a simple eight-parameter conceptual hydrological model. This application demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach and gives an impression of its potential for application to a large class of nonlinear, dynamic models.

   WATER-MOVEMENT IN THE UNSATURATED SOIL MATRIX USING A FUZZY APPROACH
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Modeling water movement in the unsaturated soil matrix is usually based on the numerical solution of the Richards equation. This approach requires much computational effort, therefore practical 2- or 3-dimensional applications are extremely rare. The purpose of this paper is to describe a computationally efficient and simple method. It is based on a transformation of the unsaturated Darcy law to a fuzzy rule system. The rule system is combined with the continuity equation yielding a fuzzy rule-based model for simulating the unsaturated flow. Basic definitions of fuzzy logic are given and the concept of the unsaturated how model is outlined. The presented model performs well compared with a semi-analytical model and a 2-dimensional, numerical model. Furthermore the model has been incorporated into a physically-based and distributed, hydrological model. Model simulations for different types of hydrological situations show that the fuzzy rule-based approach is especially suitable for real-life applications.

AB Research has yet to operationalize water footprint information for urban water policy and planning to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to water scarcity. Using a county-level database of the U.S. hydro-economy, NWED, we spatially mapped and analyzed the Water Footprint of Flagstaff, Arizona, a small city. Virtual water inflow and outflow networks were developed using the flow of commodities into and out of the city. The power law distribution of virtual water trade volume between Flagstaff and its county trading partners broke at a spatial distance of roughly 2000 km. Most large trading partners are within this geographical distance, and this distance is an objective definition for Flagstaff's zone of indirect hydro-economic influence-that is, its water resource hinterland. Metrics were developed to measure Flagstaff's reliance on virtual water resources, versus direct use of local physical water resources. Flagstaff's reliance on external water supplies via virtual water trade increases both its hydro-economic resilience and vulnerability to water scarcity. These methods empower city managers to operationalize the city's Water Footprint information to reduce vulnerability, increase resilience, and optimally balance the allocation of local physical water supplies with the outsourcing of some water uses via the virtual water supply chain.

AB Low-frequency quadrature conductivity spectra of siliclastic materials exhibit typically a characteristic relaxation time, which either corresponds to the peak frequency of the phase or the quadrature conductivity or a typical corner frequency, at which the quadrature conductivity starts to decrease rapidly toward lower frequencies. This characteristic relaxation time can be combined with the (intrinsic) formation factor and a diffusion coefficient to predict the permeability to flow of porous materials at saturation. The intrinsic formation factor can either be determined at several salinities using an electrical conductivity model or at a single salinity using a relationship between the surface and quadrature conductivities. The diffusion coefficient entering into the relationship between the permeability, the characteristic relaxation time, and the formation factor takes only two distinct values for isothermal conditions. For pure silica, the diffusion coefficient of cations, like sodium or potassium, in the Stern layer is equal to the diffusion coefficient of these ions in the bulk pore water, indicating weak sorption of these couterions. For clayey materials and clean sands and sandstones whose surface have been exposed to alumina (possibly iron), the diffusion coefficient of the cations in the Stern layer appears to be 350 times smaller than the diffusion coefficient of the same cations in the pore water. These values are consistent with the values of the ionic mobilities used to determine the amplitude of the low and high-frequency quadrature conductivities and surface conductivity. The database used to test the model comprises a total of 202 samples. Our analysis reveals that permeability prediction with the proposed model is usually within an order of magnitude from the measured value above 0.1 mD. We also discuss the relationship between the different time constants that have been considered in previous works as characteristic relaxation time, including the mean relaxation time obtained from a Debye decomposition of the spectra and the Cole-Cole time constant.

ID DISTRIBUTIONS; HYDROLOGY
AB A flow duration curve (FDC) is the relationship between any given discharge value and the percentage of time that this discharge is exceeded. It represents the relationship between magnitude and frequency of streamflow discharges. In this paper, a new methodology for the evaluation of the flow duration curve with assigned return period T is proposed. The procedure is based on the use of distributions bounded by the interval 0 to 1 and exploits the properties of the beta and complementary beta (CB) distributions. The proposed model, called "EtaBeta," accounts for the interannual variability of the FDC using the distributions of annual minimum daily flow and total annual flow. The intra-annual variability is described by the CB distribution, which (like the beta distribution) has two parameters that characterize the shape of the distribution and in particular of its tails. The model is applied to basins of southern Italy characterized by strong seasonality and highly variable discharge. The results show good performance in terms of the model's ability to represent the analyzed flow duration curves of discharge data even in low-flow conditions. The EtaBeta model also offers interesting possibilities for use in regional analysis.

AB This study presents a scaling analysis of extremes in hourly precipitation with coincident temperature in 14 urban locations across India for monsoon as well as non-monsoon seasons, and examines the probabilistic as-sociation through bivariate copula. Using gridded hourly rainfall and dew point temperature (DPT) datasets from ERA5 Reanalysis and daily maximum temperature from the India Meteorology Department (IMD), it examines how far the scaling relationships of sub-daily precipitation extremes with temperature deviate from the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling across different climatic regimes in India. Pre-and post-1975 analyses were conducted to evaluate if the scaling relationships have altered in line with the global climate shift of the 1970s. Findings from the study indicate that during the monsoon, the scaling relationship was negative in all the cities except Pune (PNQ) during the post-1975 period. In fact, in most of the locations (e.g., Bhopal (BHO), Jaipur (JAI) and Mumbai (BOM)), the scaling coefficient for monsoon rainfall extremes decreased after the 1975 global climate shift. During the non-monsoon season, the scaling coefficient was slightly positive almost everywhere and approximately equal to the CC scaling rate, both pre-and post-1975; the only exception being in PNQ, where a negative scaling was observed. The joint probabilistic distributions for BOM showed that the non-exceedance probability of extreme rainfall was higher when conditioned on higher temperatures in the monsoon season; however, the opposite was observed in the non-monsoon season pre-1975. A similar distinct seasonal feature was noticed in a few other locations including New Delhi (DEL). Using DPT as the scaling variable, Chennai (MAA), Guwahati (GAU) and Tiruchirappalli (TRZ) showed positive scaling in both pre-and post-1975 in both monsoon and non-monsoon seasons. Unlike with maximum air temperature, super-CC scaling was observed with DPT in the monsoon season for TRZ (pre-and post-1975) and for MAA and GAU (pre-1975) and also in the non-monsoon season for MAA (pre-and post-1975) and for GAU and BOM (post-1975). This analysis is expected to provide useful insights into the regional and seasonal distribution of hydrological extremes for a subsequent assessment of their impacts on the design of urban infrastructure.

AB This paper deals with modeling the mutual feedbacks between runoff production and geomorphological processes and attributes that lead to patterns of equilibrium soil depth. Our primary goal is an attempt to describe spatial patterns of soil depth resulting from long-term interactions between hydrologic forcings and soil production, erosion, and sediment transport processes under the framework of landscape dynamic equilibrium. Another goal is to set the premises for exploiting the role of soil depths in shaping the hydrologic response of a catchment. The relevance of the study stems from the massive improvement in hydrologic predictions for ungauged basins that would be achieved by using directly soil depths derived from geomorphic features remotely measured and objectively manipulated. Hydrological processes are here described by explicitly accounting for local soil depths and detailed catchment topography. Geomorphological processes are described by means of well-studied geomorphic transport laws. The modeling approach is applied to the semiarid Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, located near Boise, Idaho. Modeled soil depths are compared with field data obtained from an extensive survey of the catchment. Our results show the ability of the model to describe properly the mean soil depth and the broad features of the distribution of measured data. However, local comparisons show significant scatter whose origins are discussed.

AB Soil water repellency (SWR) increases surface runoff and preferential flows. Thus, quantitative evaluation of SWR distribution is necessary to understand water movements. Because the variability of SWR distribution makes it difficult to measure directly, we developed a method for estimating an SWR distribution index, defined as the areal fraction of surface soil showing SWR (SWRarea). The theoretical basis of the method is as follows: (1) SWRarea is equivalent to the probability that a position on the soil surface is drier than the critical water content (CWC); SWR is present (droplets absorbed in >10 s) when the soil surface is drier than the CWC and absent when it is wetter. (2) CWC and soil moisture content (theta) are normally distributed independent variables. (3) Thus, based on probability theory, the cumulative normal distribution of theta - CWC (f(x)) can be obtained from the distributions of CWC and theta, and f(0), the cumulative probability that theta - CWC < 0, gives the SWRarea. To investigate whether the method gives reasonable results, we repeatedly measured theta at 0-5 cm depth and determined the water repellency of the soil surface at multiple points in fixed plots with different soils and topography in a humid-temperate forest. We then calculated the CWC from the observed theta-SWR relationship at each point. We tested the normality of the CWC and theta distributions and the correlation between CWC and theta. Then, we determined f(x) from the CWC and theta distributions and estimated the SWRarea on each measurement day. Although CWC and theta were both normally distributed, in many cases they were correlated. Nevertheless, the CWC-theta dependency had little effect on the estimation error, and f(x) explained 69% of the SWRarea variability. Our findings show that a stochastic approach is useful for estimating SWRarea.

AB A considerable fraction of urban water supply capacity serves primarily as a hedge against drought. Water utilities can reduce their dependence on firm capacity and forestall the development of new supplies using short-term drought management actions, such as conservation and transfers. Nevertheless, new supplies will often be needed, especially as demands rise due to population growth and economic development. Planning decisions regarding when and how to integrate new supply projects are fundamentally shaped by the way in which short-term adaptive drought management strategies are employed. To date, the challenges posed by long-term infrastructure sequencing and adaptive short-term drought management are treated independently, neglecting important feedbacks between planning and management actions. This work contributes a risk-based framework that uses continuously updating risk-of-failure (ROF) triggers to capture the feedbacks between short-term drought management actions (e.g., conservation and water transfers) and the selection and sequencing of a set of regional supply infrastructure options over the long term. Probabilistic regional water supply pathways are discovered for four water utilities in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. Furthermore, this study distinguishes the status-quo planning path of independent action (encompassing utility-specific conservation and new supply infrastructure only) from two cooperative formulations: weak cooperation, which combines utility-specific conservation and infrastructure development with regional transfers, and strong cooperation, which also includes jointly developed regional infrastructure to support transfers. Results suggest that strong cooperation aids utilities in meeting their individual objectives at substantially lower costs and with less overall development. These benefits demonstrate how an adaptive, rule-based decision framework can coordinate integrated solutions that would not be identified using more traditional optimization methods.

AB Transport of nonreactive solutes in aquifers of random permeability is considered. The local concentration C, which is a random function of space and time, can be modeled through <C> the ensemble mean, and sigma-(2)(c), the variance. Because of the irregular spatial distribution of the concentration, which is a consequence of the spreading and dilution of the solute plume, the uncertainty in the local concentration prediction can be very large, and the mean concentration <C> may not accurately predict the concentration distribution in the field, in particular, the peak concentration. The aim of the present paper is to quantify dilution through the peak concentration by introducing a quantity denoted as Lagrangian concentration (C-L). According to the proposed methodology the combined effects of dispersion, which is ruled by large-scale advection, and dilution, which is a consequence of pore-scale dispersion, are analyzed by following each Darcy-scale solute particle constituting the initial plume by focusing on the mass exchanges between the examined particle and the surrounding ones. After definition and derivation of C-L and its statistical moments, illustrative examples are shown for a small solute injection. Then the comparison of the theoretical results with the Borden and Cape Cod experimental findings shows that the Lagrangian concentration gives a reasonable prediction of the peak concentration: conversely, the often employed mean concentration <C> underestimates the maximum concentration. Furthermore, the fluctuations of C-L are also smaller than those for C, as indicated by the analysis of the variance. The results are of some importance for applications in which the environmental regulations are formulated in terms of maximal admissible local concentrations.

AB A recent study employed a broken power-law (BPL) distribution for understanding the scaling frequency of bankfull discharge in snowmelt-dominated basins. This study, grounded from those findings, investigated the ability of a BPL function to describe the distribution of daily flows above the mean annual flow in 1217 sites across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). The hydrologic regime in all the sites is unregulated and spans a wide range in drainage areas (2-120,000 km(2)) and elevation (0-3000 m). Available daily flow records in all sites varied between 15 and 108 years. Comparing the performance of BPL distribution and the traditionally used lognormal distribution, we found that BPL provides stronger fit in similar to 80% of the sites. Thus the BPL function provides a suitable tool to model daily flows in most areas of the CONUS. The potential for developing a model for predicting the frequency distribution of daily flows in ungauged sites was analyzed. We found that such model is possible using drainage area, mean basin elevation, and mean annual precipitation as predicting variables for any site located above 600 m across the CONUS. We also found strong continental-wide correlations between 3 of the 4 parameters that describe the BPL and basin characteristics. Our results indicate that the BPL function provides a robust alternative to traditional functions such as the lognormal to model the statistical variation of daily flows above the mean annual in most basins of the CONUS.

In practice, it is common to make simplifying assumptions about the prior and posterior state distributions, and to employ approximations of the likelihood function, which can reduce the efficiency of the filter. We propose metrics that quantify how much of the uncertainty in a Bayesian posterior state distribution is due to (i) the observation operator, (ii) observation error, and (iii) approximations of Bayes' Law. Our approach uses discrete Shannon entropy to quantify uncertainty, and we define the utility of an observation (for reducing uncertainty about a model state) as the ratio of the mutual information between the state and observation to the entropy of the state prior. These metrics make it possible to analyze the efficiency of a proposed observation system and data assimilation strategy, and provide a way to examine the propagation of information through the dynamic system model. We demonstrate the procedure on the problem of estimating profile soil moisture from observations at the surface (top 5 cm). The results show that when synthetic observations of 5 cm soil moisture are assimilated into a three-layer model of soil hydrology, the ensemble Kalman filter does not use all of the information available in observations.

AB [ 1] Direct estimation of groundwater solute concentrations from geophysical tomograms has been only moderately successful because ( 1) reconstructed tomograms are often highly uncertain and subject to inversion artifacts, ( 2) the range of subsurface conditions represented in data sets is incomplete because of the paucity of colocated well or core data and aquifer heterogeneity, and ( 3) geophysical methods exhibit spatially variable sensitivity. We show that electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can be used to estimate groundwater solute concentrations if a relation between concentration and inverted resistivity is used to deal quantitatively with these issues. We use numerical simulation of solute transport and electrical current flow to develop these relations, which we call "apparent'' petrophysical relations. They provide the connection between concentration, or local resistivity, and inverted resistivity, which is measured at the field scale based on ERT for media containing ionic solute. The apparent petrophysical relations are applied to tomograms of electrical resistivity obtained from field measurements of resistance from cross-well ERT to create maps of tracer concentration. On the basis of synthetic and field cases we demonstrate that tracer mass and concentration estimates obtained using these apparent petrophysical relations are far better than those obtained using direct application of Archie's law applied to three-dimensional tomograms from ERT, which gives severe underestimates.

AB Seismic waves affect fluid flow and transport processes in porous media. Therefore, quantitative understanding of the role of seismic waves in subsurface hydrodynamics is important for the development of practical applications and prediction of natural phenomena. We present a theoretical fluid dynamics model to describe how low-frequency elastic waves mobilize isolated droplets trapped in pores by capillary resistance. The ability of the theoretical model to predict the critical mobilization amplitudes (A(c)) and the displacement dynamics of the nonwetting droplet are validated against computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Our theory has the advantage of rapid calculation of A(c) for various scenarios. Both theory and CFD simulations show that the A(c) increases with increasing wave frequency. The theoretical and computational models agree well in the low-frequency range both in terms of predicting the displacement history of the droplet and its eventual dislodgment, but their results begin to diverge with increasing wave frequency since the Hagen-Poiseuille flow approximation in the model becomes invalid. Relative to a previous viscous seismic model, our model compares more favorably to experimental observations. The model is thus appropriate for predicting trapped nonwetting droplet dynamics in and dislodgement from pore constrictions by low-frequency elastic waves.

AB We analyze the transient motion of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid in a porous medium of infinite extent and given geometry (plane, cylindrical or spherical). The flow in the domain, initially at constant ambient pressure, is induced by fluid withdrawal or injection in the domain origin at prescribed pressure or injection rate.
   Previous literature work is generalized and expanded, providing a dimensionless formulation suitable for any geometry, and deriving similarity solutions to the nonlinear governing equations valid for pseudoplastic, Newtonian and dilatant fluids. A pressure front propagating with finite velocity is generated when the fluid is pseudoplastic; no such front exists for Newtonian or dilatant fluids. The front rate of advance depends directly on fluid flow behavior index and inversely on medium porosity and domain dimensionality.
   The effects and relative importance of uncertain input parameters on the model outputs are investigated via Global Sensitivity Analysis by calculating the Sobol' indices of (a) pressure front position and (b) domain pressure, by adopting the Polynomial Chaos Expansion technique. For the selected case study, the permeability is the most influential factor affecting the system responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On the correlation structure of continuous and discrete point rainfall
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE precipitation; stochastic processes
ID MODEL; TIME; MULTIFRACTALS; CLOUDS
AB This paper proposes new analytical results based on the theory of stochastic processes that establish a theoretical dependence of point rainfall variance on the scale of observation under somewhat general assumptions. It is shown that power law scaling, commonly assumed by analyses and models of point rainfall, cannot hold over all scales of observation and that an "inner'' regime exists for small sampling intervals where the variance is a quadratic function of interval length. A power law scaling regime is shown to exist for larger aggregation intervals, whose characteristics depend on the memory of the continuous rainfall process. The presence of a "transition'' regime between the inner and the scaling regime is also shown and may explain the deviations from a power law scaling behavior in observed rainfall reported in the literature. Furthermore, the application of the theory to rainfall data from a representative variety of climate types shows that fractal and multifractal analysis techniques and models may indeed fail to capture observed rainfall properties over wide ranges of aggregation scales. Finally, correlation structures with "short-'' and "long-'' term memory are considered and different theoretical relationships expressing rainfall variance as a function of aggregation interval are derived and tested against rainfall observed at different locations with aggregation timescales ranging from 15 min to 2 days. The theoretical and observational analyses show that both finite and infinite memory rainfall processes may be observed in nature.

AB Evaporation and condensation in bare soils govern water and energy fluxes between the land and atmosphere. Phase change between liquid water and water vapor is commonly evaluated in soil hydrology using an assumption of instantaneous phase change (i.e., chemical equilibrium). Past experimental studies have shown that finite volatilization and condensation times can be observed under certain environmental conditions, thereby questioning the validity of this assumption. A comparison between equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase change modeling approaches showed that the latter is able to provide better estimates of evaporation, justifying the need for more research on this topic. Several formulations based on irreversible thermodynamics, first-order reaction kinetics, or the kinetic theory of gases have been employed to describe nonequilibrium phase change at the continuum scale. In this study, results from a fully coupled nonisothermal heat and mass transfer model applying four different nonequilibrium phase change formulations were compared with experimental data generated under different initial and boundary conditions. Results from a modified Hertz-Knudsen formulation based on kinetic theory of gases, proposed herein, were consistently in best agreement in terms of preserving both magnitude and trends of experimental data under all environmental conditions analyzed. Simulation results showed that temperature-dependent formulations generally better predict evaporation than formulations independent of temperature. Analysis of vapor concentrations within the porous media showed that conditions were not at equilibrium under the experimental conditions tested.

AB Attenuation of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) in a river occurs to a large extent in its hyporheic zone. A major part of the attenuation of polar TrOCs is of microbial origin. As microbial activity depends on temperature and redox conditions, seasonal differences in TrOC attenuation are likely. We investigated TrOC attenuation at a river influenced by treated wastewater during two sampling campaigns, one in summer and one in winter. In addition to redox conditions and temperature, we also determined residence times of porewater in sediment using three methods: (a) non-parametric deconvolution of electrical conductivity time series, (b) the model VFLUX 2.0 based on temperature time series (only summer), and (c) applying Darcy's law to differences in hydraulic heads (only summer). Contrary to our expectations, we found higher attenuation for 12 out of 18 TrOCs in winter, while three TrOCs were better attenuated in summer. Sediment conditions varied between seasons as more of the top sandy layer with a higher hydraulic permeability accumulated on the river bed in summer. As a result, residence times in the sediment were shorter in summer. In winter, longer residence times, lower temperatures, and a steeper oxygen gradient in sediment coincided with higher TrOC attenuation. Further research is needed to understand our unexpected findings and underlying mechanisms.

Analyses show that the traditional reservoir models are unable to reproduce the observed baseflow variations. By incorporating a freezing temperature function in the reservoir models, the model performances are largely improved. It indicates the dominant role of freezing temperature in controlling the aquifer discharge through reducing the watershed conductivity and liquid (active) water content. The results for the Albany watershed in Canada show that the watershed lump conductivity decreases by half when air temperature accumulates to -172 degrees C center dot day from winter start and in extremely cold years, it could decrease by more than 85%. With this relationship, a climate warming of +1, +2, and +4 degrees C would suggest an increase of 7.7%, 16.7%, and 41.0% in conductivity or 6.8%, 14.7%, and 35.0% in winter discharge, respectively. The study provides an important link between climate warming and aquifer discharge in cold regions. The results could be particularly useful for developing process-based models, estimating baseflow variations, and assessing climate change impact on cold region hydrology.

AB Recently, new data have been acquired on the chemical composition of waters within the glacial till beneath the Kamb Ice Stream (KIS, formerly Ice Stream C) and the Bindschadler Ice Stream (BIS, formerly Ice Stream D), two of the arteries of ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). We compare this water chemistry with basally stored subglacial waters from Arctic and Alpine glaciers and the only other measurements of sub-ice sheet chemistry to date, that emerging from beneath Law Dome near Casey Station, SW Antarctica, during a jokulhlaup. We find that the chemistries pose significant questions about the hydrology and biogeochemistry of ice sheet beds. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently, a unified Eulerian-Lagrangian theory has been developed by one of us for nonreactive solute transport in space-time nonstationary velocity fields. We describe a combined analytical-numerical method of solution based on this theory for the special case of steady state flow in a mildly fluctuating; statistically homogeneous, lognormal hydraulic conductivity field. We take the unconditional mean velocity to be uniform but allow conditioning on measurements of log hydraulic conductivity (or transmissivity) and/or hydraulic head. This renders the velocity field nonstationary. We solve the conditional transport problem analytically at early time and express it in pseudo-Fickian form at later time. The deterministic pseudo-Fickian equations involve a conditional, space-time dependent dispersion tenser which we evaluate numerically along mean ''particle'' trajectories. These equations lend themselves to accurate solution by standard Galerkin finite elements on a relatively coarse grid. The final step is an explicit numerical computation of lower bounds on conditional concentration prediction variance-covariance (and coefficient of variation), travel time distribution, cumulative mass release across a ''compliance surface,'' the associated error, and plume spatial moments. Our method also allows quantification of the uncertainty in the original source location of any solute ''particle'' located anywhere in the field, at any time. This paper describes the methodology and presents some unconditional results. Conditioning and more advanced computations are presented in the subsequent papers.

TI Unstable relationship between tree-ring delta O-18 in the transitional

AB The Asian Summer Monsoon system (ASM) affects a large population in the monsoonal Asia. Previous studies have thoroughly discussed the temporally unstable response of tree-ring oxygen isotope (delta O-18) to the regional climate variables and ocean-atmosphere interaction modes, however, the response to the ASM remains ambiguous. In this study, an annually resolved tree-ring delta O-18 chronology is developed from eastern YunnanGuizhou Plateau, in the transitional zone of the ASM. Based on the results from response analyses, the climatic controls of tree-ring delta O-18 is considered to be the moisture-related variables of the monsoon season. Spatial correlations suggest that in the study area, the water vapor is mainly originated from the Bay of Bengal and transported by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Furthermore, the temporal stability in relationships between the tree-ring delta O-18 and the ISM variability are explored. Our findings suggest that on interannual to decadal timescales, the tree-ring delta O-18 is significantly anti-correlated, but temporally unstable with respect to the ISM. The strength of interannual relationship is affected by the ISM intensity, which is modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) variability. Moreover, the strength of decadal relationship is associated with the phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Additionally, the decreasing trend of tree-ring delta O-18 after the late 1970 s that diverges from the simultaneous normal level of the ISM is caused by the isotopically-depleted trend in upstream precipitation of the moisture source. The opposite patterns of correlations between the tree-ring delta O-18 and the ENSO and IOD in recent decades demonstrate that the regional hydroclimate in the study region has been undergoing significant secular variations that are characterised by an increasing effect of the IOD and a decreasing effect of the ENSO. The findings from this study further improve our understanding of the tree-ring delta O-18 response to the ASM, at multi-time scales, and shed light on the impact of the ASM on regional hydroclimate variability, across the transitional zone of the ASM.

DT Article
AB Coping with global change, providing clean water for growing populations, and disposing of nuclear waste are some of the most difficult public policy challenges of our time. Unknowns in the physical sciences are one source of the difficulty. Real difficulties in meeting these challenges also arise in the behavioral sciences. A potentially rich vein of transdisciplinary research is to integrate the psychology of decision making, known as "judgment and decision making," or JDM, with the development of technical information and decision support tools for complex, long-term environmental problems. Practitioners of JDM conduct research on how individuals and groups respond to uncertainty and ambiguity, hedge against risks, anchor decisions to the status quo, compare relative risks and rewards of alternative strategies, and cope with other classes of decisions. Practitioners use a variety of stimuli, chance devices, hypothetical and real choices involving small stakes, scenarios, and questionnaires to measure (directly and indirectly) preferences under varying conditions. These kinds of experiments can help guide choices about the level of complexity required for different types of decision-making processes, the value of new data collection efforts, and the ways in which uncertainty in model outcomes can be cast to minimize decision-making paralysis. They can also provide a scientific basis for interacting with decision makers throughout the model development process, designing better ways of eliciting and combining opinions and of communicating information relevant to public policy issues with the goal of improving the value of the scientific contribution to the social decision.

DT Article
ID SOIL LOSS; EROSION; MODEL
AB Prevention and estimation of soil erosion from forest roads requires an understanding of how road design and maintenance affect sediment production. Seventy-four plots were installed on forest roads in the Oregon Coast Range to examine the relationship between sediment production and road attributes such as distance between culverts, road slope, soil texture, and cutslope height. An additional comparison was made between road segments with cutslopes and ditches freshly cleared of vegetation and segments with established vegetation on cutslopes and in ditches. All road segments were 5 m wide and insloped with aggregate surfacing, light traffic, and no overhanging forest cover. Sediment production was correlated to the product of segment length times road slope squared. Sediment production from aggregate covered roads on a silty clay loam was about 9 times greater than that from roads constructed on a gravelly loam. Sediment production was not correlated to the cutslope height. Road segments where vegetation was cleared from the cutslope and ditch produced about 7 times as much sediment as road segments where vegetation was retained, showing the potential reduction in erosion by revegetation following construction and the potential impact of ditch cleaning during maintenance. Relationships and estimates from this study provide a basis for improved erosion estimates by commonly used empirical procedures.

AB Lakes are an important component of the global weather and climate system, but the modeling of their thermal regimes has shown large uncertainties due to the highly diverse lake properties and model configurations. Here, we evaluate the algorithms of four key lake thermal processes including turbulent heat fluxes, wind-driven mixing, light extinction, and snow density, using a highly diverse lake data set provided by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 2a lake sector. Algorithm codes are configured and run separately within the same parent model to rule out any interference from factors apart from the algorithms examined. Evaluations are based on both simulation accuracy and recalibration complexity for application to global lakes. For turbulent heat fluxes, the non-Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) based, more simplified algorithms perform better in predicting lake epilimnion temperatures and achieve high convergence in the values of the calibrated parameters. For wind-driven mixing, a two-algorithm strategy considering lake shape and season is suggested with the regular mixing algorithm used for spring and earlier summer and the mixing-enhanced algorithm for summer steady stratification and fall overturn periods. There are no evident differences in the simulated thermocline depths using different light extinction algorithms or the observation. Finally, for lake ice phenology, an optimal algorithm is decided for most northern lakes while the Arctic lakes require separate consideration. Our study provides highly practical guides for improving 1-D lake models and feasible parameterization strategies to better simulate global lake thermal regimes.

AB A catastrophic flood event which caused massive economic losses occurred in Thailand, in 2011. Several studies have already been conducted to analyze the Thai floods, but none of them have assessed the impacts of reservoir operation on flood inundation. This study addresses this gap by combining physically based hydrological models to explicitly simulate the impacts of reservoir operation on flooding in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. H08, an integrated water resources model with a reservoir operation module, was combined with CaMa-Flood, a river routing model with representation of flood dynamics. The combined H08-CaMa model was applied to simulate and assess the historical and alternative reservoir operation rules in the two largest reservoirs in the basin. The combined H08-CaMa model effectively simulated the 2011 flood: regulated flows at a major gauging station have high daily NSE-coefficient of 92% as compared with observed discharge; spatiotemporal extent of simulated flood inundation match well with those of satellite observations. Simulation results show that through the operation of reservoirs in 2011, flood volume was reduced by 8.6 billion m(3) and both depth and area of flooding were reduced by 40% on the average. Nonetheless, simple modifications in reservoir operation proved to further reduce the flood volume by 2.4 million m(3) and the depth and area of flooding by 20% on the average. By modeling reservoir operation with a hydrodynamic model, a more realistic simulation of the 2011 Thai flood was made possible, and the potential of reducing flood inundation through improved reservoir management was quantified.

AB This work introduces the derivation and solution of the conservation laws for nonisothermal immiscible two-phase flow in one dimension (1D) with heat loss to surrounding strata. Purely advective flow is assumed so that the method of characteristics can be applied to the fluid flow and thermal equations with an arbitrary relative permeability model. The formulation allows for a wide class of time-dependent models for heat loss into surrounding strata. One-dimensional linear and radial displacements are considered. Thermal losses to the under- and over-burden are modelled using a heat-loss coefficient derived from the classic Lauwerier model. In order to demonstrate the two kinds of solution that may occur, examples are shown for cold methane injection into an aquifer and cold water injection into a natural gas reservoir. Finally the new analytical solutions are compared with two literature models which assume piston-like displacement, and numerical reservoir simulations. The solutions from the proposed model match the thermal profile from the reservoir simulation much better than either of the literature models in the examples considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the correction problem of mean-field bias of radar rain rate was investigated using the concept of linear regression. Three different relationships were reviewed for their slopes to be used as the bias correction factor: Relationship 1 (R1) is based on the conventional linear regression, relationship 2 (R2) is forced to pass the origin and relationship 3 (R3) is the line whose slope is the G/R ratio. In other words, R1 is the regression line connecting the intercept and the mass centre of measurement pairs, R2 is the regression line forced to pass the origin, and R3 is the line connecting the origin and the mass centre. The slopes of all three relationships were reviewed analytically to compare them, and thereby, the effect of zero measurements could be evaluated. Additionally, the effect of using switched independent and dependent variables on the derived slopes was also evaluated. The theoretically derived results were then verified by analysing the rainfall event on 10-11 August 2010 in Korea. Finally, the difference between the bias-corrected radar rain rate and the rain gauge rain rate was quantified by root mean square error and mean error so that it could be used as a measure for the evaluation of bias correction factors. In conclusion, the slope of R2 was found to be the best for the bias correction factor. However, when deciding the slope of this R2, the radar rain rate should be used as the independent variable in the low rain rate region, and the rain gauge rain rate in the high rain rate region above a certain threshold.

ID CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS
AB The science of hydrology is on the threshold of major advances, driven by new hydrologic measurements, new methods for analyzing hydrologic data, and new approaches to modeling hydrologic systems. Here I suggest several promising directions forward, including (1) designing new data networks, field observations, and field experiments, with explicit recognition of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of hydrologic processes, (2) replacing linear, additive "black box'' models with "gray box'' approaches that better capture the nonlinear and non-additive character of hydrologic systems, (3) developing physically based governing equations for hydrologic behavior at the catchment or hillslope scale, recognizing that they may look different from the equations that describe the small-scale physics, (4) developing models that are minimally parameterized and therefore stand some chance of failing the tests that they are subjected to, and (5) developing ways to test models more comprehensively and incisively. I argue that scientific progress will mostly be achieved through the collision of theory and data, rather than through increasingly elaborate and parameter-rich models that may succeed as mathematical marionettes, dancing to match the calibration data even if their underlying premises are unrealistic. Thus advancing the science of hydrology will require not only developing theories that get the right answers but also testing whether they get the right answers for the right reasons.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article

AB Most of the models of alluvial fan and delta morphodynamics to date have used one of two assumptions concerning the upstream boundary condition: (1) a fixed sediment feed point at the vertex or (2) a feed point corresponding to a bedrock-alluvial transition that, e. g., migrates upstream under conditions of constant base level. Here, however, we present both experimental and numerical results pertaining to a new configuration, i.e., one in which the sediment feed point migrates downstream. The research is motivated by the operation of the tailings pond of a mine in which a delta forms. The mine operators must frequently move the outfalls of their slurry pipelines downstream to avoid their burial under sediment as the delta aggrades. This downstream migration results in a characteristic delta configuration. Under the right conditions, as the tailings delta progrades downstream, it does not have time to fill all the available space in the lateral direction, thus leaving unfilled open water on either side. The result is the formation of an elongated delta. Here we use both experiments and numerical modeling to characterize the control of the feed point migration rate on the lateral extent of the prograding deltas. We use these results to obtain a partial explanation of natural elongated deltas. In the case of such deltas, the downstream progradation of natural levees provides an analog to the downstream migration of the outfall of a slurry pipeline.

AB Surface conductance G(s) is a significant parameter for indicating the evaporative and photosynthetic properties of a vegetated surface. When comparing G(s) values between different observation sites, some studies have used G(smax) and others have used (G) over cap (smax) (where G(smax) is the maximum G(s) value measured during the measurement period, and is the maximum G(s) value obtained with a vapour pressure deficit (VPD) of >= 1.0 kPa during the measurement period).
   In this study, we demonstrate a clear justification for using instead of (G) over cap (smax) when comparing G(s) values between different sites. We examined whether both (G) over cap (smax) and G(smax) lead to the same conclusions in classifying vegetated sites. Komatsu (2003b) [Hydrological Processes 17: 2503-2512] reported a clear relationship between canopy height h and (G) over cap (smax) for coniferous forests with a projected leaf area index (LAI) of >= 3-0. We examined not only the relationship between h and G(smax) but also the relationship between h and G(smax) for coniferous forests with a projected LAI of >= 3.0.
   Both (G) over cap (smax) and G(smax) decreased with increasing h. However, the relationship between h and G(s) was less well defined than the relationship between h and (G) over cap (smax) because of biased G(smax) data. Consequently, we conclude that 1 sx is a more appropriate index than G(smax) to represent G(s) for sites with different vegetation. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Stream channel morphology from grain-scale roughness to large meanders drives hyporheic exchange flow. In practice, it is difficult to model hyporheic flow over the wide spectrum of topographic features typically found in rivers. As a result, many studies only characterize isolated exchange processes at a single spatial scale. In this work, we simulated hyporheic flows induced by a range of geomorphic features including meanders, bars and dunes in sand bed streams. Twenty cases were examined with 5 degrees of river meandering. Each meandering river model was run initially without any small topographic features. Models were run again after superimposing only bars and then only dunes, and then run a final time after including all scales of topographic features. This allowed us to investigate the relative importance and interactions between flows induced by different scales of topography. We found that dunes typically contributed more to hyporheic exchange than bars and meanders. Furthermore, our simulations show that the volume of water exchanged and the distributions of hyporheic residence times resulting from various scales of topographic features are close to, but not linearly additive. These findings can potentially be used to develop scaling laws for hyporheic flow that can be widely applied in streams and rivers.

AB Variation in soil moisture content throughout soil profiles during several sequential rainfalls represents the internal hydrological response on a hillslope scale. A multiplex TDR system has been operating on a mountainous hillslope to obtain the time series of soil moisture along two transects in the study area. The soil moisture modeling conducted in this study highlights our understanding of the inter-relationships between soil moistures at identical spatial locations, but at different depths. A sequential procedure was used for the time series modeling to delineate an appropriate model for application to all monitoring points. The feedback relationship of soil wetness between two different depths was expressed with the proposed vector autoregressive model. Based on the successful modeling of 31 coupled soil water histories, the vertical distributions of the stochastic model throughout the study area were obtained. The distribution of the delineated models implied a spatial distribution of the hydrological processes, such as vertical infiltration for the upper soil layers and some of the lower soil layers (38 out of 62 models), lateral redistribution and subsurface flow over bedrock mostly for the lower soil layers (24 out of 62 models) on the steep hillslope. With the use of the resultant models, applications were proposed to improve the data acquisition system, i.e. gap filling for missing data and limited prediction for an ungauged location.

AB This paper provides evidence of the recovery of a small, moorland catchment to a severe drought, the most extreme on record in the UK. We present a detailed water quality time series for the post-drought recovery period, from the first significant storm event at the end of the drought through three very wet months during which time the catchment fully wetted up. High-frequency observations were obtained using pump water samplers, at 15-min intervals for storm events and 2 hourly at other times. There are significant shifts in discharge-concentration response as the catchment wets up; initial behaviour is very different to later storms. Extreme drought may become more common in a warmer world, so it is increasingly important to understand water quality response during and after such episodes, if their impact on water resources and in-stream ecology is to be better anticipated.

AB Technologies that increase the accuracy of soil-moisture monitoring, such as in-situ sensors, have been proposed as a key solution for increasing agricultural water productivity. However, quantifying how uncertainty in soilmoisture estimates lead to irrigation inefficiencies or economic losses has not been explicitly studied. We develop a framework that combines a crop simulation model with a rule-based irrigation decision-making algorithm to assess the impact of soil-moisture uncertainty on irrigation use and farm profits. We apply this modelling framework to a case study of irrigated maize production in Nebraska, United States, a region where improvements in agricultural water productivity are at the forefront of water-policy debates. We consider two main sources of uncertainty that result in a divergence between the farmers' perception of soil-water content and the true water status, namely errors in the knowledge of soil texture and measurement of daily soil-water flux inflows and outflows. Even for very large errors in both soil-texture and water-flux measurements, impacts on water use and profits were marginal (11 ha-mm increase and $27 ha -1 decrease, respectively). In contrast, farmers' choice of irrigation strategy had a much larger impact on water use and profits than uncertainty in soil-moisture information used to implement that strategy. Our findings show that near-optimal irrigation decisions can be made without perfect soil-moisture information. This conclusion suggests that providing farmers with improved irrigation scheduling recommendations - utilizing crop-water models and optimization techniques - would have a larger impact on water-use efficiency than simply providing farmers with technologies to more accurately monitor soil-moisture conditions.

AB Watershed studies often rely on the assumption that interannual storage changes are negligible in the hydrologic balance of a watershed. The assumption can be useful and is sometimes necessary, but it is widely acknowledged as unrealistic. Identifying and understanding systematic deviations from hydrologic steady state has important implications for both hydrologic research and water management. To that end, we evaluated the magnitude of interannual changes in storage for nearly 1000 watersheds in the conterminous United States for the 10-year period 2002 to 2011 using ground-based and remotely sensed data. We evaluated relationships between changes in storage (i.e., deviations from hydrologic steady state), vegetation cover, and hydroclimatic variables. Analysis of results using a Budyko framework revealed that, in general, greater evaporative partitioning led to smaller deviations from hydrologic steady state. Additional analysis using gradient boosted regression tree modeling identified an inverse relationship between forest cover and the magnitude of deviations from hydrologic steady state. In fact, modeling showed forest cover to be a stronger driver of variability in deviations from steady state than any hydroclimatic variable. We discuss ecohydrological feedbacks capable of contributing to steady-state conditions in forested watersheds, and we discuss implications of these results for the coevolution of watersheds, vegetation, and climate.

AB Global warming is expected to change the regime of extreme precipitation. Physical laws translate increasing atmospheric heat into increasing atmospheric water content that drives precipitation changes. Within the literature, general agreement is that extreme precipitation is changing, yet different assessment methods, data sets, and study periods may result in different patterns and rates of change. Here we perform a global analysis of 8,730 daily precipitation records focusing on the 1964-2013 period when the global warming accelerates. We introduce a novel analysis of the N largest extremes in records having N complete years within the study period. Based on these extremes, which represent more accurately heavy precipitation than annual maxima, we form time series of their annual frequency and mean annual magnitude. The analysis offers new insights and reveals (1) global and zonal increasing trends in the frequency of extremes that are highly unlikely under the assumption of stationarity and (2) magnitude changes that are not as evident. Frequency changes reveal a coherent spatial pattern with increasing trends being detected in large parts of Eurasia, North Australia, and the Midwestern United States. Globally, over the last decade of the studied period we find 7% more extreme events than the expected number. Finally, we report that changes in magnitude are not in general correlated with changes in frequency.

TI A coupling concept for two-phase compositional porous-medium and

AB Domains composed of a porous part and an adjacent free-flow region are of special interest in many fields of application. So far, the coupling of free flow with porous-media flow has been considered only for single-phase systems. Here we extend this classical concept to two-component nonisothermal flow with two phases inside the porous medium and one phase in the free-flow region. The mathematical modeling of flow and transport phenomena in porous media is often based on Darcy's law, whereas in free-flow regions the (Navier-) -Stokes equations are used. In this paper, we give a detailed description of the employed subdomain models. The main contribution is the developed coupling concept, which is able to deal with compositional (miscible) flow and a two-phase system in the porous medium. It is based on the continuity of fluxes and the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, and uses the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition. The phenomenological explanations leading to a simple, solvable model, which accounts for the physics at the interface, are laid out in detail. Our model can account for evaporation and condensation processes at the interface and is used to model evaporation from soil influenced by a wind field in a first numerical example.

AB Interrelationships between hydrology and aquatic ecosystems are better understood in streams and rivers compared to their surrounding floodplains. Our goal was to characterize the hydrology of the Everglades ridge and slough floodplain ecosystem, which is valued for the comparatively high biodiversity and connectivity of its parallel-drainage features but which has been degraded over the past century in response to flow reductions associated with flood control. We measured flow velocity, water depth, and wind velocity continuously for 3 years in an area of the Everglades with well-preserved parallel-drainage features (i.e., 200-m wide sloughs interspersed with slightly higher elevation and more densely vegetated ridges). Mean daily flow velocity averaged 0.32 cm s(-1) and ranged between 0.02 and 0.79 cm s(-1). Highest sustained velocities were associated with flow pulses caused by water releases from upstream hydraulic control structures that increased flow velocity by a factor of 2-3 on the floodplain for weeks at a time. The highest instantaneous measurements of flow velocity were associated with the passage of Hurricane Wilma in 2005 when the inverse barometric pressure effect increased flow velocity up to 5 cm s(-1) for several hours. Time-averaged flow velocities were 29% greater in sloughs compared to ridges because of marginally higher vegetative drag in ridges compared to sloughs, which contributed modestly (relative to greater water depth and flow duration in sloughs compared to ridges) to the predominant fraction (86%) of total discharge through the landscape occurring in sloughs. Univariate scaling relationships developed from theory of flow through vegetation, and our field data indicated that flow velocity increases with the square of water surface slope and the fourth power of stem diameter, decreases in direct proportion with increasing frontal area of vegetation, and is unrelated to water depth except for the influence that water depth has in controlling the submergence height of vegetation that varies vertically in its architectural characteristics. In the Everglades the result of interactions among controlling variables was that flow velocity was dominantly controlled by water surface slope variations responding to flow pulses more than spatial variation in vegetation characteristics or fluctuating water depth. Our findings indicate that floodplain managers could, in addition to managing water depth, manipulate the frequency and duration of inflow pulses to manage water surface slope, which would add further control over flow velocities, water residence times, sediment settling, biogeochemical transformations, and other processes that are important to floodplain function.

AB A model combining the efficiency of the pore-network (PN) models and the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is proposed. We introduce a multi-scale approach based on a decomposition of the granular as sembly into small subsets. A tetrahedrization is considered to describe the pore space and extract the subsets. Hydrostatic properties such as entry capillary pressure, liquid morphology and capillary pressure - degree of saturation relationship are evaluated for each pore throat (subset) of the granular system. This information is incorporated into the pore-network model to reproduce the macro-scale effects during a primary drainage. The hybrid method is able to reproduce accurately the capillary pressure - volume relationship and the motion of the interface during the drainage process. The results obtained with the hybrid method evidence the capability of the method to investigate complex phenomena. Additionally, the combination of PN and LBM leads to a significant gain in terms of computation resources. Finally, the results obtained with a fully resolved LBM and the hybrid model help us validate the accuracy of pore-scale methods based on approximations (MS-P and Incircle methods).

AB It is not a compelling argument, solely on the basis of a better fit to solute breakthrough curve (BTC) data, that a temporally nonlocal model is necessary to simulate transport in an advection-dominated system. One may counter that the classical advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is a valid model at some small scale and that the detailed hydraulic conductivity (K) data must be well-represented: then the nonlocality is only a result of upscaling and loss of information. But is the nonlocal model demonstrably necessary at all scales? We examine the experiment conducted by Klise et al. (2008) in which a 30.5 x 30.5 cm slab of relatively homogeneous, cross-bedded sandstone was exhaustively sampled for K. The slab was sealed, saturated with potassium iodide, and X-rayed 10 times while being flushed with fresh water. The 8,649 air-permeameter measurements were down- and upscaled to make finer and coarser grids on which the velocity field was solved and the ADE applied. The optimized parameters in the ADE were found to scale predictably, most notably the longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(L)), which grew linearly with upscaling. But at all levels of up-and downscaling, including the original K measurement scale of 0.33 cm, the ADE did not adequately represent the late-time tails. The temporally nonlocal, time-fractional ADE (t-FADE) was applied and the optimized parameters (alpha(L) and the immobile capacity beta) did not depend on scale. The better fit provided by the t-FADE in the late BTC tails did not bring about a sacrificed fit elsewhere in the BTC. Furthermore, the optimized ADE and t-FADE solutions do not converge at the smallest scale, directly implying that the temporal nonlocality is a necessary model component. We conclude that the logical inference "if the ADE is valid in heterogeneous material, then there is tailing in the BTC" is not a proof that the reverse is true. We provide a clear counterexample. A corollary is that a mismatch between data and a discretized solution to the ADE does not imply that more data will improve fits or predictive ability.

AB We introduce original sensitivity analysis metrics with the aim of assistingdiagnosis of the functioning of a given model. We do so by characterizing model-induced dependencies between a target model output and selected model input(s) through the associated bivariate copuladensity. The latter fully characterizes the dependencies between two random variables at any order (i.e., without being limited to linear dependence), independent of the marginal behavior of the two variables. As a metric to assess sensitivity, we rely on the absolute distance between the copuladensity associated with the target model output and a model input and its counterpart associated with two independent variables. We then provide two sensitivity indices which allow characterizing (i) the global (with respect to the input) value of the sensitivity and (ii) the degree of variability (across the range of the input values) of the sensitivity for each value that the prescribed model output can possibly undertake, as driven by the governing model. In this sense, our approach to sensitivity is global with respect to model input(s) and local with respect to model output, thus enabling one to discriminate the relevance of an input across the entire range of values of the modeling goal of interest. We exemplify the use of our approach and illustrate the type of information it can provide by focusing on an analytical test function and on two scenarios related to flow and transport in porous media.

ID INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS; STABILITY
AB There is a highly coupled space-time hydraulic connection between cascade hydropower stations (CHSs), therefore CHSs cannot stand alone in market competition. Symbiosis is a co-twin way of alliance, which helps to resist variable market risk factors. Thus, this paper proposes a spot quotation alliance modeling method of CHSs based on symbiosis theory. First, based on the components explanation and symbiotic effect evaluation of the cascade hydropower symbiotic system (CHSS), a quotation alliance formation model with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic effect is built. Then, in order to reduce blindness while retaining the autonomy of power producers, a 5-stage power and price declaration strategy is proposed. The case study with eight hydropower stations in Sichuan Province of China shows that the three stations can get an increase of 2.23% in market shares and 2.13% in power generation revenue when forming a quotation alliance, and can help the grid save 16,900 yuan in power purchase cost at the same time. It reveals that jointly participating in market competition with others can not only increase the alliance's market shares and power generation revenue, but also reduce the total power purchase cost of the grid.

AB [ 1] This paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. These strategies include conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. A spatially distributed simulation-optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surface water reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. The simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. The physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. The agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. A profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large-scale constrained gradient-based optimization. The model was applied to a real-world conjunctive surface water/groundwater management problem in the Yaqui Valley, an irrigated agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico. The model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. These reductions were caused by a decline in surface water availability and limited installed pumping capacity. Results indicate that the impact of the historical 8-year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surface water and groundwater resources. Namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surface water allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. Lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. The benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs.

AB Affected by various influencing factors, many time series analysis methods are used to predict irrigation water. However, it is often assumed to be stationary for the hydrologic time series which will result in an insignificant "spurious regression". Actually, irrigation water is largely determined by rainfall and crop water requirement in the irrigation district. With the wavelet analysis method, the varying fluctuation characteristics of rainfall, irrigation water, and crop water requirement with multi-temporal scales are exhibited. The cointegration equilibrium relationship amongst their original time series and decomposed time series are also revealed by the cointegration theory. Combining the wavelet analysis method with the cointegration theory, the wavelet-cointegration prediction model of irrigation water is proposed. The results show that the model has the available prediction accuracy, and the relative errors of all predicted years are less than 5%, except 2004 and 2012. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A shallow flow generally features complex hydrodynamics induced by complicated domain topography and geometry. A numerical scheme with well-balanced flux and source term gradients is therefore essential before a shallow flow model can be applied to simulate real-world problems. The issue of source term balancing has been exhaustively investigated in grid-based numerical approaches, e. g. discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods and finite volume Godunov-type methods. In recent years, a relatively new computational method, smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), has started to gain popularity in solving the shallow water equations (SWEs). However, the well-balanced problem has not been fully investigated and resolved in the context of SPH. This work aims to discuss the well-balanced problem caused by a standard SPH discretization to the SWEs with slope source terms and derive a corrected SPH algorithm that is able to preserve the solution of lake at rest. In order to enhance the shock capturing capability of the resulting SPH model, the Monotone Upwind-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) is also explored and applied to enable Riemann solver based artificial viscosity. The new SPH model is validated against several idealized benchmark tests and a real-world dam-break case and promising results are obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces new methods for simulating subsurface solute and heat transport in heterogeneous media using large-scale lattice-Boltzmann models capable of representing both macroscopically averaged porous media and open channel flows. Previous examples of macroscopically averaged lattice-Boltzmann models for solute and heat transport are only applicable to homogeneous media. Here, we extend these models to properly account for heterogeneous pore-space distributions. For simplicity, in the majority of this paper we assume low Peclet number flows with an isotropic dispersion tensor. Nevertheless, this approach may also be extended to include anisotropic-dispersion by using multiple relaxation time lattice-Boltzmann methods. We describe two methods for introducing heterogeneity into macroscopically averaged lattice-Boltzmann models. The first model delivers the desired behavior by introducing an additional time-derivative term to the collision rule; the second model by separately weighting symmetric and anti-symmetric components of the fluid packet densities. Chapman-Enskog expansions are conducted on the governing equations of the two models, demonstrating that the correct constitutive behavior is obtained in both cases. In addition, methods for improving model stability at low porosities are also discussed: (1) an implicit formulation of the model; and (2) a local transformation that normalizes the lattice-Boltzmann model by the local porosity. The model performances are evaluated through comparisons of simulated results with analytical solutions for one-and two-dimensional flows, and by comparing model predictions to finite element simulations of advection isotropic-dispersion in heterogeneous porous media. We conclude by presenting an example application, demonstrating the ability of the new models to couple with simulations of reactive flow and changing flow geometry: a simulation of groundwater flow through a carbonate system.

AB The relationship between the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater and residence times was used to understand the temporal variability in stream hydrochemistry in Sagehen basin, California. On the basis of the relationship between groundwater age and [Ca2+], the mean residence time of groundwater feeding Sagehen Creek during base flow is approximately 28 years. [Cl-]:[Ca2+] ratios in Sagehen Creek can be used to distinguish between two important processes: changes in the apparent age of groundwater discharging into the creek and dilution with snowmelt. The mean residence time of groundwater discharging into the creek is approximately 15 years during snowmelt periods. The results from this study have implications for hydrograph separation studies as groundwater is not a single, well-mixed chemical component but rather is a variable parameter that predictably depends on groundwater residence time. Most current models of catchment hydrochemistry do not account for chemical and isotopic variability found within the groundwater reservoir. In addition, this study provides valuable insight into the long-term hydrochemical response of a catchment to perturbations as catchment-lushing times are related to the mean residence time of water in a basin.

AB Several studies have tried to link southern oscillation index (Sol) and observed precipitation in Korea and Japan. However, so far no clear relationship between the Sol and the precipitation in the area has been found. In the present study, categorized Sol are used to reveal quantitative and statistically significant influence on monthly precipitation at Busan in Korea and at Fukuoka in Japan. Monthly precipitation data were transformed to cubic root and nonexceedance probability time series. Correlation between the categorized Sol and transformed precipitation was calculated by Kendall's tau and Pearson's r. The results show that significant correlation is at hand when using both approaches. Significant correlation at the 1% level was obtained with lag time of 4 months under the 'Strong La Nina' category (SOI>2) at both stations. The results show that southern Korea and southern parts of Japan are located in the same or very close influence range of Sol. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Investigating flood processes in karst catchments by combining

AB Concentration-Discharge (C-Q) relationship analyses allow better understanding catchment water origin and hydrological process variability across time (from storm-event to pluriannual scale). Though, those approaches mostly include integrative methods that consider catchments as a whole. The aim of this article is to assess the potential of a combined approach to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of flood processes within catchments (across river reaches and seasons), focusing on karst areas. The methodology consists in combining CQ relationship analysis in nested catchments and simulation of lateral exchanges at the reach scale. For that, we analyze high-frequency records of discharge and electrical conductivity (EC) in karst catchments, in which EC informs on water residence time. Contributions of pre-event water (PEW) and event water (EW) during storm events are investigated through hysteresis loop analysis at each gauging station. Combined with lateral EC simulation at the reach scale, they make it possible to infer runoff processes during storms. A unary karst catchment in a temperate/mountainous climate (Loue River) and a binary catchment in a Mediterranean climate (Ce`ze River) were selected in France, and their conceptual models of water origin and hydrological process variability were drawn. In the Loue catchment, summer and fall storm events are characterized by contributions of PEW through piston-type flows, whereas decreasing EC values in winter and spring storm events indicate the major contribution of EW through surface runoff and fast infiltration. Within the catchment, EW contribution increases downstream, due to the canyon river morphology grading into open valleys. Regarding the Ce`ze catchment, contributions of EW are higher, indicating that fast infiltration and surface runoff are the dominant processes, associated with a PEW signature in summer and fall. Within the catchment, PEW contribution is found higher in karstified areas. These results show that flood process seasonality is mainly related to karst aquifer saturation rate, while intra-site variability is linked to karst area extension and river morphology. Results are encouraging to extend this approach to a variety of sites, notably those affected by significant surface watergroundwater interaction and groundwater flooding. Such approach, by providing a discretized information on flood processes, could help refining lumped hydrological models, or facilitate the use of semi-distributed ones.

AB Root-zone soil moisture (0-110cm) was monitored at 21 sites within a cold-region semiarid prairie grazing pasture over multiple growing seasons. There were large differences in the moisture dynamics for different sites, which was related to local-scale impacts of sodium-induced clay dispersion. Sites with high exchangeable sodium percentages, indicative of sodic soils, were characterized by small changes in soil moisture storage. The sites with the largest soil moisture changes had negligible exchangeable sodium percentage. We used this difference to divide the area into sites that participate in the field-scale water balance and those that do not. As a result of this heterogeneity, a unique soil moisture variability-mean relationship was observed; the spatial variability of root-zone soil moisture was lowest during intermediate wetness conditions and highest for wet and dry conditions. Furthermore, the shape of the variability-mean relationship depended on the depth over which soil moisture was integrated. The persistent differences in soil moisture dynamics were also responsible for the presence of two distinct spatial patterns of root-zone soil moisture, representing early and late growing season (i.e., wet and dry conditions). The participating versus nonparticipating framework may be applicable broadly to sodic soils and to other soil types and has practical implications for parameterizing the water balance in hydrological models and for designing representative soil moisture monitoring networks in such environments.

AB In this study, over 36,000 ground-based soil moisture measurements collected during the SGP97, SGP99, SMEX02, and SMEX03 field campaigns were analyzed to characterize the behavior of soil moisture variability across scales. The field campaigns were conducted in Oklahoma and Iowa in the central USA. The Oklahoma study region is sub-humid with moderately rolling topography, while the Iowa study region is humid with low-relief topography. The relationship of soil moisture standard deviation, skewness and the coefficient of variation versus mean moisture content was explored at six distinct extent scales, ranging from 2.5 m to 50 km. Results showed that variability generally increases with extent scale. The standard deviation increased from 0.036 cm(3)/cm(3) at the 2.5-m scale to 0.071 cm(3)/cm(3) at the 50-km scale. The log standard deviation of soil moisture increased linearly with the log extent scale, from 16 m to 1.6 km, indicative of fractal scaling. The soil moisture standard deviation versus mean moisture content exhibited a convex upward relationship at the 800-m and 50-km scales, with maximum values at mean moisture contents of roughly 0.17 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.19 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. An empirical model derived from the observed behavior of soil moisture variability was used to estimate uncertainty in the mean moisture content for a fixed number of samples at the 800-m and 50-km scales, as well as the number of ground-truth samples needed to achieve 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.03 cm(3)/cm(3) accuracies. The empirical relationships can also be used to parameterize surface soil moisture variations in land surface and hydrological models across a range of scales. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document the behavior of soil moisture variability over this range of extent scales using ground-based measurements. Our results will contribute not only to efficient and reliable satellite validation, but also to better utilization of remotely sensed soil moisture products for enhanced modeling and prediction.

AB The majority of the huge annual sediment load of the Yellow River in China is transported by a few hyperconcentrated sediment-laden floods. Being hyperconcentrated, these floods are still so "starved" as to entrain enormous volumes of sediment from the bed, triggering quick and extensive bed-tearing scour. In the recession period of the floods, river blockage might occur as characterized by an abrupt halt of the flow. The physics of these fluvial processes has remained unclear for several decades. Previous hydrodynamic models were built upon simplified conservation laws and are applicable only for processes with weak sediment transport. A complete shallow water hydrodynamic model is deployed here to reveal new insights into the phenomena. A self-amplifying mechanism of the interaction between the flow and bed scour is identified, which explains how bed-tearing scour occurs. River blockage is ascribable to the longitudinally positive pressure gradient due to a non-uniform distribution of sediment concentration. The spatial and temporal development of the system of flow, sediment transport and morphology is far more complicated than represented by previous models that have evolved from fixed-bed, single-phase hydrodynamics or involved a capacity description of sediment transport. The present approach may facilitate a better understanding of active sediment transport by flash floods in ephemeral desert rivers and by subaqueous turbidity currents. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This manuscript reports on a novel field experiment carried out on a microtidal beach in Camargue, France. For the first time in the field, a comprehensive description of the groundwater dynamics under sandy beach swash zone is presented. A cross-shore network of 15 buried pressure sensors is combined with terrestrial LiDAR measurements to study the swash-groundwater dynamics. The presented data focus on the decay of a moderate storm which allows to monitor the evolution of the groundwater pressure field in response to the retreat of the swash zone. Both horizontal and vertical head gradients are measured within the porous sand soil to estimate the groundwater flow field using Darcy's law. Time-averaged analysis demonstrates the presence of a rather consistent groundwater circulation pattern under the swash zone, shifting offshore with the swash zone. The main tendency is an offshore directed flow, with infiltration/exfiltration in the upper/lower parts of the swash zone. Time-resolved analysis highlights the typical groundwater response to swash events which consists mainly of an overall infiltration flow during the bed inundation by the swash tongue, a seaward flow during the swash retreat and, for long backwash events, a localized exfiltration flow under the next incoming uprush.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged shallow water equations (SWE) are widely used to model unsteady free surface flows, such as flooding processes, including those due to dam-break or levee breach. However, the basic hypothesis of small bottom slopes may be far from satisfied in certain practical circumstances, both locally at geometric singularities and even in wide portions of the floodable area, such as in mountain regions. In these cases, the classic 2D SWE might provide inaccurate results, and the steep-slope shallow water equations (SSSWE), in which the restriction of small bottom slopes is relaxed, are a valid alternative modeling option. However, different 2D formulations of this set of equations can be found in the geophysical flow literature, in both global horizontally-oriented and local bottom-oriented coordinate systems. In this paper, a new SSSWE model is presented in which water depth is defined along the vertical direction and flow velocity is assumed parallel to the bottom surface. This choice of the dependent variables combines the advantages of considering the flow velocity parallel to the bottom, as can be expected in gradually varied shallow flow, and handling vertical water depths consistent with elevation data, usually available as digital terrain models. The pressure distribution is assumed linear along the vertical direction and flow curvature effects are neglected. A new formulation of the 2D depth-averaged SSSWE is derived, in which the two dynamic equations represent momentum balances along two spatial directions parallel to the bottom, whose horizontal projections are parallel to two fixed orthogonal coordinate directions. The analysis of the mathematical properties of the new SSSWE equations shows that they are strictly hyperbolic for wet bed conditions and reduce to the conventional 2D SWE when bottom slopes are small. Finally, it is shown that the SSSWE predict a slower flow compared with the conventional SWE in the theoretical case of a 1D dam-break on a frictionless channel with fixed slope. The capabilities of the proposed model are demonstrated in a companion paper on the basis of numerical and experimental tests.

AB Physical barriers are widely used to control seawater intrusion (SWI). Amongst different kinds of physical barriers, mixed physical barriers (MPBs) are shown to be an effective approach to prevent SWI. However, the system may hinder the discharge of fresh groundwater and the removal of residual saltwater trapped in the inland aquifers of MPBs. Herein, using the validated numerical model, for the first time, we investigated the dynamics of residual saltwater and groundwater discharge after the installation of MPBs. For examining the applicability of MPB and its response to structural variations and hydraulic gradient, the comparison with traditional physical barriers and sensitivity analysis was also carried out. The MPB increased the mixing area of freshwater and saltwater at the beginning of the removal process, resulting in the reduction of the saltwater wedge length (R-L) by 74.6% and the removal of total salt mass (R-M) by 62.6% within the 4% of the total removal time. Meanwhile, the groundwater discharge (Q') rose rapidly after a sharp decline from 100% to 40% in the first stage. As the residual saltwater wedge was retreated, the mixing intensity and removal efficiency decreased substantially in the second stage. Similarly, Q' raised with a declining rate at this stage. The removal efficiency was positively correlated with wall depth and hydraulic gradient and there were optimal distance of the middle spacing and height of lower dam to reach the highest efficiency. The groundwater discharge reduced monotonously with the increase of dam height and wall depth as well as the decrease of barrier spacing and hydraulic gradient. Under certain conditions, the efficiency of MPB in removing residual saltwater could be 40%-100% and 0%-56% higher than that of traditional subsurface dam and cutoff wall, respectively. The laboratory scale conclusions provide valuable physical insight for the real field applications regarding dynamic mechanism and regularity. These findings will always help decision makers choose proper engineering measures and protect groundwater resources in coastal areas.

AB A meta-analysis of fractional mobilization data from 14 sets of experiments, totaling 103 different mixed sand and gravel beds and flow conditions, has been carried out in order to identify an expression for effective shear stress, here defined as the component of bed shear stress that is directly involved in transporting each grain size fraction in graded sediment. In doing so we test the assumption that excess stress should be defined solely in terms of a critical stress rather than effective stress, which exhibits sensitivity to the flow stage. In contrast to the approach which evaluates the size-distribution effects on motion threshold by comparing inferred transport rates, an alternative approach is utilized which is based on the skill of reproducing the measured, mobilized particle size distribution. A simple equation is developed for mobilization of sediment mixtures, based on a well-established transport law, and employing a classical "hiding function" approach to the problem of mitigating the bias toward mobilizing fine material in the mixture. We use inverse methods to find the optimal form of the hiding function which provides the best fit with the data. We find that the hiding function is indeed sensitive to the flow and bed composition. On this basis, a simple deterministic equation is proposed for fraction-specific effective stress, which outperforms the next best existing formula based on critical stress by 34% on aggregate.

AB A number of important candidate CO2 reservoirs exhibit sedimentary architecture reflecting fluvial deposition. Recent studies have led to new conceptual and quantitative models for sedimentary architecture in fluvial deposits over a range of scales that are relevant to CO2 injection and storage. We used a geocellular modeling approach to represent this multiscaled and hierarchical sedimentary architecture. With this model, we investigated the dynamics of CO2 plumes, during and after injection, in such reservoirs. The physical mechanism of CO2 trapping by capillary trapping incorporates a number of related processes, i.e., residual trapping, trapping due to hysteresis of the relative permeability, and trapping due to hysteresis of the capillary pressure. Additionally, CO2 may be trapped due to differences in capillary entry pressure for different textural sedimentary facies (e.g., coarser-grained versus finer-grained cross sets). The amount of CO2 trapped by these processes depends upon a complex system of nonlinear and hysteretic characteristic relationships including how relative permeability and capillary pressure vary with brine and CO2 saturation. The results strongly suggest that representing small-scale features (decimeter to meter), including their organization within a hierarchy of larger-scale features, and representing their differences in characteristic relationships can all be critical to understanding trapping processes in some important candidate CO2 reservoirs.

AB The particle shape of sediments, soils, and rocks affects the packing of the material and the subsequent pore geometry; it therefore influences important transport properties, such as electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity, diffusion coefficient, thermal conductivity, and hydraulic conductivity. It is difficult to quantify the "average'' shape characteristics of a granular material so a method, which would capture the three-dimensional shape characteristics of a granular material in regards to its packing geometry, would be of great benefit. In this article we examine the use of the angle of repose and the maximum angle of stability of a slope of granular material poured into water, as a simple and rapid method of quantifying its "effective'' particle shape. A two-stage concept is discussed relating the measured slope angles to the aspect ratio of an equivalent oblate ellipsoidal particle and using this aspect ratio for predicting the effective permittivity and bulk electrical conductivity of isotropic packings of granular materials. The slope angle-aspect ratio relationships were established using measurements of bulk electrical conductivity of monosized spherical glass beads and nonspherical sand and tuff grains packed in water to different porosities. This empirical relationship, the choice of an oblate geometry to represent particle shape, and a heuristic mixing model accounting for the effect of neighboring particles on the internal electrical field were tested using measurements of the effective permittivity for those granular media. Good agreement was found between the model predictions and measurements, indicating the physical significance of the above relationships and quantifiers. We have also tested and found high correlations between slope angles and a shape factor determined by image analysis of two-dimensional particle micrographs. We do not, however, propose to use it for routine particle shape characterization because of the insufficiently informative viewing of oblates from above and because of the expensive equipment and extensive work involve with it. Instead, we propose to use the easily measurable slope angles for routine particle shape characterization because of its simplicity and also because of its beneficial sensitivity to surface roughness and particle angularity effects beyond the aspect ratio of a smooth equivalent ellipsoid.

AB Medium heterogeneity affects reaction kinetics by controlling the mixing of reactant particles, but the linkage between medium properties and reaction kinetics is difficult to build, even for simple, relatively homogeneous media. This study aims to explore the dynamics of bimolecular reactions, aniline+1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-aminobenzene, in relatively homogeneous flow cells. Laboratory experiments were conducted to monitor the transport of both conservative and reactive tracers through columns packed with silica sand of specific diameters. The measured tracer breakthrough curves exhibit subdiffusive behavior with a late-time tail becoming more pronounced with decreasing sand size, probably due to the segregated flow regions formed more easily in columns packed with smaller size sand. Numerical analysis using a novel Lagrangian model shows that subdiffusion has a twofold effect on bimolecular reactions. While subdiffusion enhances the power-law growth rate of product mass by prolonging the exposure of reactant particles in the depletion zone, the global reaction rate is constrained because subdiffusion constrains the mobility of reactant particles. Reactive kinetics in deceptively simple homogeneous media is therefore controlled by subdiffusion, which is sensitive to the dimensions of packed sand.
   Key Points
   Homogeneously packed sand columns build subdiffusion varying with sand size Subdiffuion has a twofold, counterbalanced effect on bimolecular reactions Most parameters in the Lagrangian reaction model are predictable

AB The flow parameters of a natural fracture were estimated by modeling in situ pressure pulses. The pulses were generated in two horizontal boreholes spaced 1 m apart vertically and intersecting a near-vertical highly permeable fracture located within a shallow-fractured carbonate reservoir. Fracture hydromechanical response was monitored using specialized fiber-optic borehole equipment that could simultaneously measure fluid pressure and fracture displacements. Measurements indicated a significant time lag between the pressure peak at the injection point and the one at the second measuring point, located 1 m away. The pressure pulse dilated and contracted the fracture. Field data were analyzed through hydraulic and coupled hydromechanical simulations using different governing flow laws. In matching the time lag between the pressure peaks at the two measuring points, our hydraulic models indicated that (1) flow was channeled in the fracture, (2) the hydraulic conductivity tensor was highly anisotropic, and (3) the radius of pulse influence was asymmetric in that the pulse traveled faster vertically than horizontally. Moreover, our parametric study demonstrated that the fluid pressure diffusion through the fracture was quite sensitive to the spacing and orientation of channels, hydraulic aperture, storativity, and hydraulic conductivity. Comparison between hydraulic and hydromechanical models showed that the deformation significantly affected fracture permeability and storativity and, consequently, the fluid pressure propagation, suggesting that the simultaneous measurements of pressure and mechanical displacement signals could substantially

AB Genetic algorithms (GAs) are well known optimization methods. However, complicated systems with high dimensional variables, such as long-term reservoir operation, usually prevent the methods from reaching optimal solutions. This study proposes a multi-tier interactive genetic algorithm (MIGA) which decomposes a complicated system (long series) into several small-scale sub-systems (sub-series) with GA applied to each sub-system and the multi-tier (key) information mutually interacts among individual sub-systems to find the optimal solution of long-term reservoir operation. To retain the integrity of the original system, over the multi-tier architecture, an operation strategy is designed to concatenate the primary tier and the allocation tiers by providing key information from the primary tier to the allocation tiers when initializing populations in each sub-system. The Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan is used as a case study. For comparison, three long-term operation results of a sole GA search and a simulation based on the reservoir rule curves are compared with that of MIGA. The results demonstrate that MIGA is far more efficient than the sole GA and can successfully and efficiently increase the possibility of achieving an optimal solution. The improvement rate of fitness values increases more than 25%, and the computation time dramatically decreases 80% in a 20-year long-term operation case. The MIGA with the flexibility of decomposition strategies proposed in this study can be effectively and suitably used in long-term reservoir operation or systems with similar conditions.

AB The relationship between actual (E-act) and potential (E-p) transpiration above a grass-covered forest clearing was investigated numerically and experimentally from simultaneous measurements of soil moisture content profiles, mean meteorological conditions, turbulent heat and water vapor fluxes in the atmospheric surface layer, and soil hydraulic properties for two drying periods. The relationship between E-act/E-p was found to be approximately constant and insensitive to variability in near-surface soil moisture content. To explore this near-constant E-act/E-p, a model that relates potential and actual transpiration and accounts for root-uptake efficiency, potential transpiration rate, and root-density distribution was proposed and field-tested. The total amount of water consumed by the root system was integrated and compared with eddy-correlation latent heat flux measurements (field scale) and total water storage changes (local scale). Model calculations suggested that the deeper and more efficient roots are primarily responsible for the total water loss within the root zone when the near-surface soil layer approaches their wilting point.
