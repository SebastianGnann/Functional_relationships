AB The overwhelming increase and variations in the extreme rainfall events demand the use of a nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve for the design and management of water resource infrastructure. Generally, nonstationary IDF curves are developed by incorporating the trend in the distribution parameter using Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV) with time as a covariate. The physical processes influencing the variations in a hydrologic variable can be captured by utilizing relevant climatic variables (climate-informed) as covariates, since time alone cannot be the best covariate. Hence this study investigates the potential climateinformed covariates influencing the extreme rainfall and incorporates the best covariates to develop a realistic nonstationary IDF relationship. Unlike previous studies, a Time Sliding Window (TSW) approach is employed to detect the changing distribution parameters before performing Nonstationary Modeling (NSM). The proposed covariate based TSW-NSM is effectively used to construct IDF curves for seven major metropolitan cities of India. Several models are generated based on the detected changing parameters and combinations of covariates. Then, Bayesian Differential Evolutionary Monte Carlo (DE-MC) algorithm is employed to estimate the uncertainty bound of the nonstationary parameters, and the best model is chosen using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). The results reveal that the best covariate combinations for short duration events are dominated by local processes (i.e., Local temperature changes and diurnal temperature changes), whereas the same for longer duration events are dominated by the global processes (global warming, ENSO Modoki cycle, and IOD). However, the acceptable nonstationary models reveal that all the temperature-based covariates are capable of capturing the dynamic behavior. It is also observed that the local processes carry the signature of global processes. Finally, the return levels computed through the best nonstationary model show that the return periods are decreasing, and the short duration events have undergone drastic changes than the longer duration events. Thus, the results suggest that employing climate-informed covariates based nonstationary IDF curves is indispensable for devising long-term strategies to address the changing climate.

AB Complex network theory (CNT) is an emerging topic based on the paradigm that quite all the natural and man-made physical systems work as networks, namely, their features derive from the internal connectivity among vertices exchanging information through edges. Water distribution infrastructures are networked systems connecting the vertices named nodes, by edges named pipes, and transferring water to customers. Therefore, water distribution networks (WDNs) fall into CNT and belongs to the class of spatial networks due to their urban constraints. CNT proposed several centrality metrics for quantifying the importance of vertex and, sometime, edges. Those metrics can be potentially very useful for analyzing the key features of the physical domain (i.e., the network) where WDN hydraulics occurs, but they need to be tailored to consider that (i) pipes/edges are the relevant physical components of the WDNs, (ii) some nodes/vertices (reservoirs and tanks) play a completely different hydraulic role from the majority of nodes (demand and connection nodes), and (iii) pipes/edges have different characteristics (length, diameter, hydraulic resistance, etc.). Accordingly, this work presents and discusses the need of tailoring the most suitable centrality metrics for spatial networks: betweenness, closeness, and degree. Then the capacity of the WDN-tailored edge betweenness is demonstrated and discussed using two real WDNs, showing that it can extract useful information from the domain, that is, the emerging hydraulic behavior due to the network connectivity structure. Therefore, the WDN-tailored edge betweenness can assist analysis, planning, and management actions before and after the hydraulic analysis.
   Plain Language Summary The aim of the work is to develop a water distribution network (WDN)-tailored centrality metric from complex network theory for the analysis of the domain of the WDN hydraulics. The WDN-tailored edge betweenness is, then, developed. Tailoring is performed considering three specific WDN features: (1) The pipes are the relevant components of such infrastructure systems. This is in contrast with standard complex network theory centrality metrics that generally focus on nodes because they represent the objects exchanging information. (2) Pipes are material components characterized by asset features such as length, diameter, and hydraulic resistance. (3) Each node can represent a different system component. It can be a source of water, a connection among pipes, or a water outflow. Accordingly, the work defines source of water, connection, and demand nodes, respectively.

AB Biomineralization through microbially or enzymatically induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP/EICP) by urea hydrolysis has been widely investigated for various engineering applications. Empirical correlations relating the amount of mineral precipitation to engineering properties like strength, stiffness, or permeability show large variations, which can be partly attributed to the pore-scale characteristics of the precipitated minerals. This study aimed to gain insight into the precipitation kinetics and pore-scale characteristics of calcium carbonate minerals through time lapse imaging of a transparent microfluidic chip, which was flushed 10 times with a reactive solution to stimulate EICP. An image processing algorithm was developed to detect the individual precipitated minerals and separate them from the grains and trapped air. Statistical analysis was performed to quantify the number and size distribution of precipitated minerals during each treatment cycle and the cumulative volume, surface area, bulk precipitation rate, nucleation rate, and supersaturation were calculated and compared with a simple numerical model and more complex theory on precipitation kinetics. The analysis showed that results were significantly affected by the assumed particle shape. The supersaturation, which controls the crystal nucleation and growth rates, was shown to be a function of the hydrolysis rate, the kinetic order and growth rate constant, and available surface area for mineral growth. Possible explanations for observed discrepancies between observations and theory, including diffusion limitations, the presence of inhibiting compounds, local pore clogging or observation bias, and limitations of the methodology, are discussed.

AB Integrated, process-based numerical models in hydrology are rapidly evolving, spurred by novel theories in mathematical physics, advances in computational methods, insights from laboratory and field experiments, and the need to better understand and predict the potential impacts of population, land use, and climate change on our water resources. At the catchment scale, these simulation models are commonly based on conservation principles for surface and subsurface water flow and solute transport (e.g., the Richards, shallow water, and advection-dispersion equations), and they require robust numerical techniques for their resolution. Traditional (and still open) challenges in developing reliable and efficient models are associated with heterogeneity and variability in parameters and state variables; nonlinearities and scale effects in process dynamics; and complex or poorly known boundary conditions and initial system states. As catchment modeling enters a highly interdisciplinary era, new challenges arise from the need to maintain physical and numerical consistency in the description of multiple processes that interact over a range of scales and across different compartments of an overall system. This paper first gives an historical overview (past 50 years) of some of the key developments in physically based hydrological modeling, emphasizing how the interplay between theory, experiments, and modeling has contributed to advancing the state of the art. The second part of the paper examines some outstanding problems in integrated catchment modeling from the perspective of recent developments in mathematical and computational science.

AB A modified advection-aridity model was tested with 24 h averaged data from the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project) Field Experiment-87 and the Cooperative Atmospheric-Surface Exchange Study (CASES) -97 experiments. Two modifications were made. First, the need for humidity measurements in the "drying power" term of the equation was circumvented by assuming the daily average specific humidity for a 24 h day is equal to the specific humidity at the minimum temperature during the day. When compared to measured latent heat fluxes, this modification resulted in no deterioration in advection-aridity estimates compared to versions using measured humidity. A second modification followed previous researchers by formulating the drying power in the Penman equation using Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) theory. However, this version calibrated kB(-1) (equivalent to ln(z(o)/z(ov)) by setting the Priestley-Taylor evapotranspiration rate equal (on average) to the Penman evapotranspiration on several moist days and solving for the value of kB(-1) as the only unknown. The calibration involved no latent heat flux measurements. The results suggest that the advection-aridity model performs modestly better in the calibrated MOS version than with Penman's original wind function. Further investigation is recommended because MOS theory accounts for varying momentum roughness lengths, and the calibration was not done under ideal (well-watered or nearly saturated) conditions that deteriorated the results somewhat with the CASES data set.

AB This study explores the relationship between municipal water use and an array of climate, economic, behavioral, and policy variables across the contiguous U.S. The relationship is explored using Bayesian-hierarchical regression models for over 2,500 counties, 18 covariates, and three higher-level grouping variables. Additionally, a second analysis is included for 83 cities where water price and water conservation policy information is available. A hierarchical model using the nine climate regions (product of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) as the higher-level groups results in the best out-of-sample performance, as estimated by the Widely Available Information Criterion, compared to counties grouped by urban continuum classification or primary economic activity. The regression coefficients indicate that the controls on water use are not uniform across the nation: e.g., counties in the Northeast and Northwest climate regions are more sensitive to social variables, whereas counties in the Southwest and East North Central climate regions are more sensitive to environmental variables. For the national city-level model, it appears that arid cities with a high cost of living and relatively low water bills sell more water per customer, but as with the county-level model, the effect of each variable depends heavily on where a city is located.

AB Pore-network models were found useful in describing important flow and transport mechanisms and in predicting flow properties of different porous media relevant to numerous fundamental and industrial applications. Pore-networks provide very fast computational framework and permit simulations on large volumes of pores. This is possible due to significant pore space simplifications and linear/exponential relationships between effective properties and geometrical characteristics of the pore elements. To make such relationships work, pore-network elements are usually simplified by circular, triangular, square and other basic shapes. However, such assumptions result in inaccurate prediction of transport properties. In this paper, we propose that pore-networks can be constructed without pore shape simplifications. To test this hypothesize we extracted 3292 2D pore element cross-sections from 3D X-ray microtomography images of sandstone and carbonate rock samples. Based on the circularity, convexity and elongation of each pore element we trained neural networks to predict the dimensionless hydraulic conductance. The optimal neural network provides 90% of predictions lying within the 20% error bounds compared against direct numerical simulation results. Our novel approach opens a new way to parameterize pore-networks and we outlined future improvements to create a new class of pore-network models without pore shape simplifications.

AB General circulation models (GCMs), the climate models often used in assessing the impact of climate change, operate on a coarse scale and thus the simulation results obtained from GCMs are not particularly useful in a comparatively smaller river basin scale hydrology. The article presents a methodology of statistical downscaling based on sparse Bayesian learning and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to model streamflow at river basin scale for monsoon period (June, July, August, September) using GCM simulated climatic variables. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data have been used for training the model to establish a statistical relationship between streamflow and climatic variables. The relationship thus obtained is used to project the future streamflow from GCM simulations. The statistical methodology involves principal component analysis, fuzzy clustering and RVM. Different kernel functions are used for comparison purpose. The model is applied to Mahanadi river basin in India. The results obtained using RVM are compared with those of state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) to present the advantages of RVMs over SVMs. A decreasing trend is observed for monsoon streamflow of Mahanadi due to high surface warming in future, with the CCSR/NIES GCM and B2 scenario.

AB The coupling of hydrological distributed models to numerical weather prediction outputs is an important issue for hydrological applications such as forecasting of flood events. Downscaling meteorological predictions to the hydrological scales requires the resolution of two fundamental issues regarding precipitation, namely, (1) understanding the statistical properties and scaling laws of rainfall fields and (2) validation of downscaling models that are able to preserve statistical characteristics observed in real precipitation. In this paper we discuss the first issue by introducing a new multifractal model that appears particularly suitable for random generation of synthetic rainfall. We argue that the results presented in this paper may be also useful for the solution of the second question. Statistical behavior of rainfall in time is investigated through a high-resolution time series recorded in Geneva (Italy). The multifractal analysis shows the presence of a temporal threshold, localized around 15-20 hours, which separates two ranges of anomalous scaling laws. Synthetic time series, characterized by very similar scaling laws to the observed one, are generated with the multifractal model. The potential of the model for extreme rainfall event distributions is also discussed. The multifractal analysis of Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) radar fields have shown that statistical properties of rainfall in space depend on time durations over which precipitation is accumulated. Further analysis of some rainfall fields produced with a meteorological limited area model exhibited the same anomalous scaling as the GATE fields.

AB We investigated the dam-break problem for Herschel-Bulkley fluids: a fixed volume of a viscoplastic material (a polymeric gel called Carbopol ultrez 10) was released and flowed down an inclined flume. Using Particle Image Velocimetry techniques, we measured the velocity profiles far from the sidewalls, the front position as a function of time, and the flow depth evolution at a given place. The experimental data were compared to three models of increasing complexity: the kinematic wave model, an advection diffusion model (lubrication theory), and the one-layer Saint-Venant equations. Surprisingly, the best agreement was obtained with the simplest model (kinematic wave model) even though it could not capture the details of the head profile (regarded as a shock wave, i.e., a discontinuity). Lubrication theory (the advection diffusion model) performed well from a qualitative viewpoint. Computed velocity profiles and depth evolution were in reasonably good agreement with data, but this model overestimated initial acceleration, which resulted in a systematic difference between theoretical and experimental curves of the front position over time. This shortcoming was not fixed when using a more elaborate model (Saint-Venant equations), rather it was exacerbated. The relatively modest performance of the more elaborate models was intriguing (for Newtonian liquids, the best agreement was obtained with the most sophisticated model). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing water demands, higher standards of living, depletion of resources of acceptable quality and excessive water pollution due to agricultural and industrial expansions have caused intense social and political predicaments, and conflicting issues among water consumers. The available techniques commonly used in reservoir optimization/operation do not consider interaction, behavior and preferences of water users, reservoir operator and their associated modeling procedures, within the stochastic modeling framework. In this paper, game theory is used to present the associated conflicts among different consumers due to limited water. Considering the game theory fundamentals, the Stochastic Dynamic Nash Game with perfect information (PSDNG) model is developed, which assumes that the decision maker has sufficient (perfect) information regarding the associated randomness of reservoir operation parameters. The simulated annealing approach (SA) is applied as a part of the proposed stochastic framework, which makes the PSDNG solution conceivable. As a case study, the proposed model is applied to the Zayandeh-Rud river basin in Iran with conflicting demands. The results are compared with alternative reservoir operation models, i.e., Bayesian stochastic dynamic programming (BSDP), sequential genetic algorithm (SGA) and classical dynamic programming regression (DPR). Results show that the proposed model has the ability to generate reservoir operating policies, considering interactions of water users, reservoir operator and their preferences. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The chemical transformation of organic contaminants in natural groundwater systems is clearly dependent upon local geochemistry which determines the thermodynamically favorable degradation reactions and the nature of local microbial populations. Conversely, groundwater geochemistry may be impacted Significantly in terms of pH and redox couple speciation by the chemical transformation of sufficient quantities of organic compounds. Therefore an understanding of the coupling between degradation reactions, local geochemistry, and chemical transport is essential in predicting the chemical evolution of contaminated aquifers. Equilibrium-based reactive chemical transport models are usually:not utilized for problems' involving the transport of degradable organic compounds due to slow reaction kinetics and the persistence of intermediate degradation products. In this study we propose a reactive geochemical transport model which considers these types of degradation reactions. An expert system approach is used to postulate a set of sequential, first-order degradation reactions for the organic compounds based upon thermodynamic considerations and user-defined rules. Redox disequilibrium provides the driving force for the abiotic or microbially mediated transformation of the organic compounds as well as the associated response of groundwater geochemistry. Coupling between local inorganic geochemistry and reacting organic compounds is achieved by assuring conservation of operational valence and mass balance. The composite geochemical model is in turn coupled with an integral finite difference transport algorithm using a two-step sequential Solution approach. The transport equation is solved separately for each inorganic aqueous species, complex, and dissolved organic species, allowing a high degree of flexibility in problem definition. We apply the model to an illustrative example problem concerning the introduction of aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated ethenes into an initially oxidizing aquifer. Modeling results agree well qualitatively with field and laboratory observations reported in the literature in terms of degradation patterns and the effects on groundwater geochemistry.

AB A Bayesian chemical mass balance approach was used to estimate the contributions of potential sources into the suspended sediments in the Mill Stream, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, US. The Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate the uncertainties as a result of measurement errors in the elemental profiles of sources and suspended sediments in the stream and also the heterogeneities of the elemental profiles among samples into the analysis and provides us with probability densities representing the contribution of each source. Based on the obtained results, river bank erosion is the major source of sediments with a contribution estimated to range from 83% to 99% with a 95% credible interval. Also, a 95% credible interval in a range of 0.06% to 8% for cropland and 0.1% to 14% for forestland was provided. Hence, while the contribution of sediments from cropland or forestland cannot be ruled out, the model does not definitively demonstrate a significant contribution from either source.

AB When the governing equations of a problem are known, the non-dimensionalization of these equations (applied in their classical form) is a useful and widely used method that can be used to identify the dimensionless groups that rule the solution. However, neither this technique nor dimensional analysis necessarily provides the most precise solution in terms of the sought numbers. The use of discrimination, a qualitative rather than quantitative extension of the non-dimensionalization method, has demonstrated notable advantages over the classical method because it invariably provides a more precise set of dimensionless groups. The basis for the correct application of discrimination depends on a deep understanding of the phenomena involved in the problem, particularly in complex (coupled) problems. In this paper, discriminated non-dimensionalization is applied to investigate a mixed convection problem in porous media, the Yusa problem. The derived discriminate groups are compared with those already known in the literature and deduced by classical methods. A number of scenarios are numerically solved to check the reliability of the discriminated groups in contrast with classical groups. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A data set of 2890 field measurements was used to test the ability of several conventional flow resistance equations to predict mean flow velocity in gravel bed rivers when used with no calibration. The tests were performed using both flow depth and discharge as input since discharge may be a more reliable measure of flow conditions in shallow flows. Generally better predictions are obtained when using flow discharge as input. The results indicate that the Manning-Strickler and the Keulegan equations show considerable disagreement with observed flow velocities for flow depths smaller than 10 times the characteristic grain diameter. Most equations show some systematic deviation for small relative flow depth. The use of new definitions for dimensionless variables in terms of nondimensional hydraulic geometry equations allows the development of a new flow resistance equation. The best overall performance is obtained by the Ferguson approach, which combines two power law flow resistance equations that are different for deep and shallow flows. To use this approach with flow discharge as input, a logarithmic matching equation in terms of the new dimensionless variables is proposed. For the domains of intermediate and large-scale roughness, the field data indicate a considerable increase in flow resistance as compared with the domain of small-scale roughness. The Ferguson approach is used to discuss the importance of flow resistance partitioning for bed load transport calculations at flow conditions with intermediate- and large-scale roughness in natural gravel, cobble, and boulder bed streams.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB We propose an approach for imaging the dynamics of complex hydrological processes. The evolution of electrically conductive fluids in porous media is imaged using time-lapse electrical resistance tomography. The related dynamic inversion problem is solved using Bayesian filtering techniques; that is, it is formulated as a sequential state estimation problem in which the target is an evolving posterior probability density of the system state. The dynamical inversion framework is based on the state space representation of the system which involves the construction of a stochastic evolution model and an observation model. The observation model that we use in this paper consists of the complete electrode model for ERT, with Archie's law relating saturations to electrical conductivity. The evolution model is an approximate model for simulating flow through partially saturated porous media. Unavoidable modeling and approximation errors in both the observation and evolution models are considered by computing approximate statistics for these errors. These models are then included in the construction of the posterior probability density of the estimated system state. This approximation error method allows the use of approximate, and therefore computationally efficient, observation and evolution models in the Bayesian filtering. We conside7r a synthetic example and show that the incorporation of an explicit model for the model uncertainties in the state space representation can yield better estimates than the frame-by-frame imaging approach.

AB Determining the effective permeability (k(eff)) of geological formations has broad applications to site remediation, aquifer discharge or recharge, hydrocarbon production, and enhanced oil recovery. The objectives of this study are: (1) to explore an approach to estimating k(eff) at the reservoir scale using the critical path analysis (CPA), (2) to evaluate the accuracy of this new approach by comparing the estimated k(eff) to the numerically simulated effective permeability, and (3) to compare the performance of CPA estimates of k(eff) with estimates by three other models i.e., perturbation theory (PT), effective-medium approximation (EMA), and renormalization group theory (RGT). We construct two- and three-dimensional random (uncorrelated) geologic formations based on permeability measurements from the Borden site and assume that the permeability distribution conforms to the lognormal probability density function over a wide range of means and standard deviations. Comparing k(eff) estimated via CPA to k(eff) values derived from numerical flow simulations indicates that CPA provides accurate estimations in both two and three dimensions over a wide range of heterogeneity levels, similar to RGT. Intermodel comparisons show that although PT and EMA provide reasonable k(eff )estimations in rather homogeneous formations, they substantially overestimate the effective permeability in highly heterogeneous formations.

AB Modeling of water vapor transport through a dry soil layer (DSL), typically formed in the top soil during dry seasons in arid and semi-arid areas, is still problematic. Previous laboratory experiments in controlled environments showed that the only vapor transport process through the DSL is by Fick's law of diffusion. However, field experiments exhibited consistently higher evaporation rates than predicted by diffusion flow only. Some proposed reasons for the mismatch were: (a) daily cycles of condensation and evaporation in the DSL due to changes in solar radiation; (b) wind effects on air movement in the DSL; (c) atmospheric pressure fluctuations; (d) nonlinear influence of the DSL thickness on the evaporation process. To link the laboratory experiments with field observations, we performed soil column experiments in the laboratory with thick (>50 cm) DSL, and with different wind speeds, two radiative lamp schedules (continuous and 12 h daily cycles) and different thicknesses of DSL. Atmospheric pressure, air temperature and humidity were measured continuously. The results show that the evaporation rates observed are larger than those predicted by diffusion flow only. We found that it was possible to model the evaporation rates as a function of atmospheric pressure fluctuations. In conclusion, atmospheric pressure fluctuations can induce evaporation rates in DSL larger than estimated by diffusion flow only, possibly explaining the discrepancy between laboratory and field evaporation rates.

AB Benthic (streambed) biofilms metabolize a substantial fraction of particulate organic matter and nutrient inputs to streams. These microbial communities comprise a significant proportion of overall biomass in headwater streams, and they present a primary control on the transformation and export of labile organic carbon. Biofilm growth has been linked to enhanced fine particle deposition and retention, a feedback that confers a distinct advantage for the acquisition and utilization of energy sources. We quantified the influence of biofilm structure on fine particle deposition and resuspension in experimental stream mesocosms. Biofilms were grown in identical 3 m recirculating flumes over periods of 18-47 days to obtain a range of biofilm characteristics. Fluorescent, 8 mu m particles were introduced to each flume, and their concentrations in the water column were monitored over a 30 min period. We measured particle concentrations using a flow cytometer and mesoscale (10 mu m to 1 cm) biofilm structure using optical coherence tomography. Particle deposition-resuspension dynamics were determined by fitting results to a stochastic mobile-immobile model, which showed that retention timescales for particles within the biofilm-covered streambeds followed a power-law residence time distribution. Particle retention times increased with biofilm areal coverage, biofilm roughness, and mean biofilm height. Our findings suggest that biofilm structural parameters are key predictors of particle retention in streams and rivers.

AB [ 1] Both rainfall intensity and duration take part in determining the hydrologic conditions favorable to the occurrence of shallow landslides. Hydrogeomorphic models of slope stability generally account for the dependence of landsliding on soil mechanical and topographic factors, while the role of rainfall duration is seldom considered within a process-based approach. To investigate the effect of different climate drivers on slope stability, we developed a modeling framework that accounts for the variability of extreme rainfall rate with the duration of rainfall events. The slope stability component includes the key characteristics of the soil mantle, i.e., angle of shearing resistance, void ratio, and specific gravity of solids. Hillslope hydrology is modeled by coupling the conservation of mass of soil water with the Darcy's law used to describe seepage flow. This yields a simple analytical model capable of describing combined effect of duration and intensity of a precipitation episode in triggering shallow landslides. Dimensionless variables are introduced to investigate model sensitivity. Finally, coupling this model with the simple scaling model for the frequency of storm precipitation can help in understanding the climate control on landscape evolution. This leads to predict the temporal scale of hillslope evolution associated with the occurrence of shallow landslides. Model application is shown for the Mettman Ridge study area in Oregon, United States.

AB Hydrological connectivity inside the soil is related to the spatial patterns inside the soil (i.e., the structural connectivity). This, in turn, is directly associated with the physical and the chemical processes at a molecular level (i.e., the functional connectivity). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry can be successfully applied to reveal both structural and functional components of soil hydrological connectivity. In the present study, the low field NMR relaxometry was applied on water suspended soils sampled at the upstream-and downstream-end of three different length plots. Also the sediments collected from the storage tanks at the end of each plot were water suspended and monitored by NMR relaxometry. The results from the NMR investigations were elaborated by using amathematical approach in order to quantify both the functional and structural connectivity components. In particular, following integration of the T1 distribution curve, an S-shaped curve was obtained. It revealed two plateaus corresponding to the shortest (low component) and the longest (high component) intervals of relaxation times, respectively. According to relaxometry theory, the twoT1 intervals, associated to the different plateaus, were attributed to micro and macro soil pores, respectively. The two T1 intervals were used to define a functional connectivity index, while the central part of the S-shaped distribution was used to define a structural connectivity index. Here we provide the physical meaning of the our mathematical approach, thereby revealing that functional connectivity index increases with plot length, as a result of a selective eroded particle transport. Moreover, the relationship structural connectivity index versus plot length resulted quasi-independent of grainsize distribution, whereas the values of the structural connectivity index for the sediment samples resulted lower than those obtained for the corresponding soils.

AB Reservoir storage-area-depth relationships are the most important factors controlling thermal stratification in reservoirs and, more broadly, the water, energy, and biogeochemical dynamics in the reservoirs and subsequently their impacts on downstream rivers. However, most land surface or Earth system models do not account for the gradual changes of reservoir surface area and storage with the changing depth, inhibiting a consistent and accurate representation of mass, energy, and biogeochemical balances in reservoirs. Here we present a physically coherent parameterization of reservoir storage-area-depth data set at the global scale. For each reservoir, the storage-area-depth relationships were derived from an optimal geometric shape selected iteratively from five possible regular geometric shapes that minimize the error of total storage and surface area estimation. We applied this algorithm to over 6,800 reservoirs included in the Global Reservoir and Dam database. The relative error between the estimated and observed total storage is no more than 5% and 50% for 66% and 99% of all Global Reservoir and Dam reservoirs, respectively. More importantly, the storage-depth profiles derived from the approximated reservoir geometry compared well with remote sensing based estimation at 40 major reservoirs from previous studies and ground-truth measurements for 34 reservoirs in the United States and China. The new global reservoir storage-area-depth data set is critical for advancing future modeling and understanding of reservoir processes and subsequent effects on the terrestrial hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical cycles at the regional and global scales.

AB Mean wind speed profiles were measured in the atmospheric surface layer, using a tethersonde system, above the Ojai Valley Watershed in southern California. The valley is mainly planted with mature avocado and orange trees. The surface shear stress and latent and sensible heat fluxes were measured above the trees which are up to 9 m in height. Near-neutral wind speed profile measurements allowed the determination of the watershed surface roughness (to 1.4 m) and the momentum displacement height (z(0) = 7.0 m). The wind speed measurements obtained under unstable atmospheric stability were analyzed using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. New stability correction functions proposed based on theory and experiments of Kader-Yaglom as well as the now classic Businger-Dyer type functions were tested. The watershed shear stress values calculated using the surface layer wind speed profiles with the new Monin-Obukhov stability functions were found to be improved in comparison with the values obtained with the Businger-Dyer functions under strongly unstable stability conditions. The Monin-Obukhov model with the Businger-Dyer stability correction function underpredicted the momentum flux by 25% under strongly unstable stability conditions, while the new Kader-Yaglom formulation compared well on average (R(2) = 0.77) with the surface eddy correlation measurements for all atmospheric stability conditions. The unstable 100-m drag coefficient was found to be u*(2)/V-100(2) = 0.0182.

AB Rain gauge networks are used to provide estimates of area average, spatial variability and point rainfalls at catchment scale and provide the most important input for hydrological models. Therefore, it is desired to design the optimal rain gauge networks with a minimal number of rain gauges to provide reliable data with both areal mean values and spatial-temporal variability. Based on a dense rain gauge network of 185 rain gauges in Xiangjiang River Basin, southern China, this study used an entropy theory based multi-criteria method which simultaneously considers the information derived from rainfall series, minimize the bias of areal mean rainfall as well as minimize the information overlapped by different gauges to resample the rain gauge networks with different gauge densities. The optimal networks were examined using two hydrological models: The lumped Xinanjiang Model and the distributed SWAT Model. The results indicate that the performances of the lumped model using different optimal networks are stable while the performances of the distributed model keep on improving as the number of rain gauges increases. The results reveal that the entropy theory based multi-criteria strategy provides an optimal design of rain gauge network which is of vital importance in regional hydrological study and water resources management.

AB A novel approach that uses the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy in conjunction with geostatistical covariance functions and simultaneous ensemble Kalman filters is introduced to characterize the hydraulic conductivity fields of aquifers. To verify the performance, several similarity measures between the target and estimated fields are used, including the correlation coefficient, least absolute deviation, least squares, and cross-variance ratio. Three different cases are synthesized through validation with a small-scale domain (40 x 40), in which the hydraulic conductivity fields are stationary, nonstationary, and stationary with reduced prior information. According to these applications, the developed approach produces excellent estimations whether the field is stationary or nonstationary when the conditioning information is sufficient. With limited conditioning information, the performance of the estimation is slightly but not significantly lower. To validate the scalability, the developed approach is applied to larger domains (100 x 100, 150 x 150, and 200 x 200), and a modified approach based on principal components is used. According to this analysis, the developed approach requires low computational cost by making predictions with a limited number of forward-model runs and internal computations. Furthermore, the approach requires a small amount of prior information for the estimation. Based on these applications, this approach shows high potential to create cost-effective estimates that can be used as a reference for the current state-of-the-art geostatistical inversion approaches to improve subsurface characterization.

TI An Information Theory Approach to Identifying a Representative Subset of

AB Uncertainties in hydro-climatic projections are (in part) related to various components of the production chain. An ensemble of numerous projections is usually considered to characterize the overall uncertainty; however in practice a small set of scenario combinations are constructed to provide users with a subset that is manageable for decision-making. Since projections are unavoidably uncertain, and multiple projections are typically informationally redundant to a considerable extent, it would be helpful to identify an informationally representative subset in a large model ensemble. Here a framework rooted in the information theoretic Maximum Information Minimum Redundancy concept is proposed for identifying a representative subset from an available ensemble of hydro-climatic projections. We analyze an ensemble of 16 precipitation and temperature projections for Sweden, and use these as inputs to the HBV hydrological model to project river discharge until the mid of this century. Representative subsets are judged in terms of different statistical properties of three essential climate variables (precipitation, temperature and discharge), whilst we further assess the sensitivity of the optimized subset for different seasons and future periods. Our results indicate that a quarter to a third of the available set of projections can represent more than 80% of the total information of hydro-climatic changes. We find that the representative subsets are sensitive to the regional hydro-climatic characteristics and the choice of variables, seasons and periods of interest. Therefore we recommend that any selection process should not be solely driven by climatic variables but, rather, should also consider variables of the impact model.
   Plain Language Summary The need for better understanding of climate change and its impact has led to an increasing number of climate models and consequently hydro-climatic projections. Using a large set of projections, we present the information content and the redundant information when an ensemble is considered, and hence demonstrate how representative projections can be identified in order to overcome artifacts/biases introduced by a common hand-picking approach. An identified subset reduced by almost 70% from the large ensemble is capable of representing more than 80% of the total information for precipitation, temperature and discharge; however the selected projections are sensitive to choice of variables, seasons, and period of interest. The size of the representative subset is also related to the regional hydro-climatic characteristics.

AB In the shallow subsurface immediately below the land-atmosphere interface, it is widely recognized that the movement of water vapor is closely coupled to thermal processes. However, their mutual interactions are rarely considered in most soil water modeling efforts or in practical applications where it becomes necessary to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture. The validation of numerical models that are designed to capture these processes is difficult due to the scarcity of field or laboratory data with accurately known hydraulic and thermal parameters of soils, limiting the testing and refinement of heat and water transfer theories. The goal of this paper is to perform controlled experiments under transient conditions of soil moisture and temperature and use this data to test existing theories and develop appropriate numerical models. Water vapor flow under varying temperature gradients was implemented on the basis of a concept that allows nonequilibrium liquid/gas phase change with gas phase vapor diffusion. To validate this new approach, we developed a long column apparatus equipped with a network of sensors and generated data under well-controlled thermal boundary conditions at the soil surface. The nonequilibrium approach yielded good agreement with the experimental results, validating the hypothesis that transport in the gas phase is better suited to be modeled with nonequilibrium liquid/gas phase change for highly transient field conditions where the thermal conditions at the land-atmosphere interface are constantly changing.

AB The spatial patterns of stream solute concentrations in a catchment reflect its hydrology and biogeochemistry. The spatial relationship between drainage areas and solute concentrations may be asymptotic or convergent ( large variation in small streams that becomes dampened as they merge into larger streams), probably depending on landscape features and/or solute type. Thus, we investigated the concentration spatial patterns of dissolved silica and major ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NO3-, SO42-, and Cl-) in steep, humid headwaters of a 4.27 km(2) catchment on Tanakami Mountain, central Japan. Because the catchment had a nearly homogenous landscape of incised valley and granitic bedrock covered in forest, we could eliminate any potential effects of variable landscape features. We found convergent relationships between drainage area and solute concentrations for all solutes. The concentrations of all solutes were similar among sampling locations with an area of more than 0.1-1.5 km(2) independent of variable biogeochemical property of measured solutes. When considering only the longitudinal profile, solute concentrations showed a mostly asymptotic pattern. Taken together, these results indicate that longitudinal profiles with asymptotic patterns form convergent solute spatial patterns and suggest that variation in zero-order hollow discharges and the mixing of water from a variety of hillslopes control downstream chemistry.

TI Modeling hydrologic and water quality extremes in a changing climate: A
   statistical approach based on extreme value theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACTS; FLOODS; UNCERTAINTY; WEATHER; EVENTS; TRENDS
AB [1] Although information about climate change and its implications is becoming increasingly available to water utility managers, additional tools are needed to translate this information into secondary products useful for local assessments. The anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle makes quantifying changes to hydrologic extremes, as well as associated water quality effects, of particular concern. To this end, this paper focuses on using extreme value statistics to describe maximum monthly flow distributions at a given site, where the nonstationarity is derived from concurrent climate information. From these statistics, flow quantiles are reconstructed over the historic record and then projected to 2100. This paper extends this analysis to an associated source water quality impact, whereby the corresponding risk of exceeding a water quality threshold is examined. The approach is applied to a drinking water source in the Pacific Northwest United States that has experienced elevated turbidity values correlated with high streamflow. Results demonstrate that based on climate change information from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report, the variability and magnitude of extreme streamflows substantially increase over the 21st century. Consequently, the likelihood of a turbidity exceedance increases, as do the associated relative costs. The framework is general and could be applied to estimate extreme streamflow under climate change at other locations, with straightforward extensions to other water quality variables that depend on extreme hydroclimate.

TI Determination of transport properties from flowing fluid temperature
   logging in unsaturated fractured rocks: Theory and semi-analytical
   solution
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXAMPLE
AB Flowing fluid temperature logging (FFTL) has recently been proposed as a method to locate flowing fractures. We argue that FFTL, backed up by data from high-precision distributed temperature sensors, can be a useful tool in locating flowing fractures and in estimating the transport properties of unsaturated fractured rocks. We have developed the theoretical background needed to analyze data from FFTL. In this article, we present a simplified conceptualization of FFTL in unsaturated fractured rock and develop a semi-analytical solution for spatial and temporal variations of pressure and temperature inside a borehole in response to an applied perturbation (pumping of air from the borehole). We compare the semi-analytical solution with predictions from the TOUGH2 numerical simulator. On the basis of the semi-analytical solution, we propose a method to estimate the permeability of the fracture continuum surrounding the borehole. Using this proposed method, we estimated the effective fracture continuum permeability of the unsaturated rock hosting the Drift Scale Test (DST) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Our estimate compares well with previous independent estimates for fracture permeability of the DST host rock. The conceptual model of FFTL presented in this article is based on the assumptions of single-phase flow, convection-only heat transfer, and negligible change in system state of the rock formation. In a sequel article, we extend the conceptual model to evaluate some of these assumptions. In that paper, we also perform inverse modeling of FFTL data to estimate, in addition to permeability, other transport parameters (such as porosity and thermal conductivity) of unsaturated fractured rocks.

TI MODELING OF SOIL-WATER RETENTION FROM SATURATION TO OVEN DRYNESS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; EQUATION
AB Most analytical formulas used to model moisture retention in unsaturated porous media have been developed for the wet range and are unsuitable for applications in which low water contents are important. We have developed two models that fit the entire range from saturation to oven dryness in a practical and physically realistic way with smooth, continuous functions that have few parameters. Both models incorporate a power law and a logarithmic dependence of water content on suction, differing in how these two components are combined. In one model, functions are added together (model ''sum''); in the other they are joined smoothly together at a discrete point (model ''junction''). Both models also incorporate recent developments that assure a continuous derivative and force the function to reach zero water content at a finite value of suction that corresponds to oven dryness. The models have been tested with seven sets of water retention data that each cover nearly the entire range. The three-parameter sum model fits all data well and is useful for extrapolation into the dry range when data for it are unavailable. The two-parameter junction model fits most data sets almost as well as the sum model and has the advantage of being analytically integrable for convenient use with capillary-bundle models to obtain the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.

TI Characterizing the impact of model error in hydrologic time series

ID BAYESIAN-APPROACH; CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION
AB Hydrologic models are commonly over-smoothed relative to reality, owing to computational limitations and to the difficulty of obtaining accurate high-resolution information. When used in an inversion context, such models may introduce systematic biases which cannot be encapsulated by an unbiased "observation noise" term of the type assumed by standard regularization theory and typical Bayesian formulations. Despite its importance, model error is difficult to encapsulate systematically and is often neglected. Here, model error is considered for an important class of inverse problems that includes interpretation of hydraulic transients and contaminant source history inference: reconstruction of a time series that has been convolved against a transfer function (i.e., impulse response) that is only approximately known. Using established harmonic theory along with two results established here regarding triangular Toeplitz matrices, upper and lower error bounds are derived for the effect of model error on time series recovery for both well-determined and over-determined inverse problems. It is seen that use of additional measurement locations does not improve expected performance in the face of model error. A Monte Carlo study of a realistic hydraulic reconstruction problem is presented, and the lower error bound is seen informative about expected behavior. A possible diagnostic criterion for blind transfer function characterization is also uncovered.

ID PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CALIBRATION; BLUEPRINT; MODELS
AB We present a new method for simulating and predicting hydrologic variables with uncertainty assessment and provide example applications to river flows. The method is identified with the acronym "Bluecat" and is based on the use of a deterministic model which is subsequently converted to a stochastic formulation. The latter provides an adjustment on statistical basis of the deterministic prediction along with its confidence limits. The distinguishing features of the proposed approach are the ability to infer the probability distribution of the prediction without requiring strong hypotheses on the statistical characterization of the prediction error (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity), and its transparent and intuitive use of the observations. Bluecat makes use of a rigorous theory to estimate the probability distribution of the predictand conditioned by the deterministic model output, by inferring the conditional statistics of observations. Therefore Bluecat bridges the gaps between deterministic (possibly physically based, or deep learning-based) and stochastic models, as well as between rigorous theory and transparent use of data with an innovative and user oriented approach. We present two examples of application to the case studies of the Arno river at Subbiano and Sieve river at Fornacina. The results confirm the distinguishing features of the method along with its technical soundness. We provide an open software working in the R environment, along with help facilities and detailed instructions to reproduce the case studies presented here.

AB A model of pore water flow induced by pressure fluctuations from a turbulent boundary layer flow over a permeable sediment bed is presented. The bed has a smooth or rough flat surface without bed forms. Pressure and velocity fluctuations that penetrate from the sediment/water interface into the sediment pore system and affect mass (solute) transfer are described as periodic in space and time. The amplitude (p(0)) is determined from a study of the turbulent kinetic energy balance for wall turbulence; the wave number (chi) and the period (T) are given as functions of the shear velocity (U-*) based on the near-bed coherent motions. The flow field in the sediment is described by the continuity equation and Darcy's law. Simulation results show that pore water velocity is faster when the shear velocity (U-*) on the sediment bed and/or the permeability of the sediment bed (k) are increased. Accordingly, the exchange velocity of water or solute transfer rate across the sediment/water interface (V-0) becomes larger when (U*) and (k) are increased. However, the penetration depth of pore water velocity fluctuations into the sediment bed becomes smaller when (U-*) is larger, i.e., when the period of fluctuating pressure is short. Overall, this paper provides new and quantitative information on the enhancement of pore water flow in a flat sediment bed over which a turbulent current is flowing.

AB Transport processes in a physical model of a natural stream with a composite cross-section (compound channel) are investigated by means of a Lagrangian analysis based on nonlinear dynamical system theory. Two-dimensional free surface Eulerian experimental velocity fields of a uniform flow in a compound channel form the basis for the identification of the so-called Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Lagrangian structures are recognized as the key features that govern particle trajectories. We seek for two particular class of Lagrangian structures: Shear and shearless structures. The former are generated whenever the shear dominates the flow whereas the latter behave as jet-cores. These two type of structures are detected as ridges and trenches of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents fields, respectively. Besides, shearlines computed applying the geodesic theory of transport barriers mark Shear Lagrangian Coherent Structures. So far, the detection of these structures in real experimental flows has not been deeply investigated. Indeed, the present results obtained in a wide range of the controlling parameters clearly show a different behaviour depending on the shallowness of the flow. Shear and Shearless Lagrangian Structures detected from laboratory experiments clearly appear as the flow develops in shallow conditions. The presence of these Lagrangian Structures tends to fade in deep flow conditions.

ID HYDROLOGY; CATCHMENT
AB [1] A systematic approach is described for determining the minimum level of model complexity required to predict runoff in New Zealand catchments, with minimal calibration, at decreasing timescales. Starting with a lumped conceptual model representing the most basic hydrological processes needed to capture water balance, model complexity is systematically increased in response to demonstrated deficiencies in model predictions until acceptable accuracy is achieved. Sensitivity and error analyses are performed to determine the dominant physical controls on streamflow variability. It is found that dry catchments are sensitive to a threshold storage parameter, producing inaccurate results with little confidence, while wet catchments are relatively insensitive, producing more accurate results with more confidence. Sensitivity to the threshold parameter is well correlated with climate and timescale, and in combination with the results of two previous studies, this allowed the postulation of a qualitative relationship between model complexity, timescale, and the climatic dryness index (DI). This relationship can provide an a priori understanding of the model complexity required to accurately predict streamflow with confidence in small catchments under given climate and timescales and a conceptual framework for model selection. The objective of the paper is therefore not to present a perfect model for any of the catchments studied but rather to present a systematic approach to modeling based on making inferences from data that can be applied with respect to different model designs, catchments and timescales.

AB Water quality evaluation entails both randomness and fuzziness. Two hybrid models are developed, based on the principle of maximum entropy ( POME) and engineering fuzzy set theory ( EFST). Generalized weighted distances are defined for considering both randomness and fuzziness. The models are applied to 12 lakes and reservoirs in China, and their eutrophic level is determined. The results show that the proposed models are effective tools for generating a set of realistic and flexible optimal solutions for complicated water quality evaluation issues. In addition, the proposed models are flexible and adaptable for diagnosing the eutrophic status.

ID HYDRAULIC RELIABILITY; DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS;
   OPTIMIZATION; MODEL
AB Flow entropy is a measure of uniformity of pipe flows in water distribution systems. By maximizing flow entropy one can identify reliable layouts or connectivity in networks. In order to overcome the disadvantage of the common definition of flow entropy that does not consider the impact of pipe diameter on reliability, an extended definition of flow entropy, termed as diameter-sensitive flow entropy, is proposed. This new methodology is then assessed by using other reliability methods, including Monte Carlo Simulation, a pipe failure probability model, and a surrogate measure (resilience index) integrated with water demand and pipe failure uncertainty. The reliability assessment is based on a sample of WDS designs derived from an optimization process for each of the two benchmark networks. Correlation analysis is used to evaluate quantitatively the relationship between entropy and reliability. To ensure reliability, a comparative analysis between the flow entropy and the new method is conducted. The results demonstrate that the diameter-sensitive flow entropy shows consistently much stronger correlation with the three reliability measures than simple flow entropy. Therefore, the new flow entropy method can be taken as a better surrogate measure for reliability and could be potentially integrated into the optimal design problem of WDSs. Sensitivity analysis results show that the velocity parameters used in the new flow entropy has no significant impact on the relationship between diameter-sensitive flow entropy and reliability.

AB The analysis of hydrological hazards usually relies on asymptotic results of extreme value theory, which commonly deals with block maxima or peaks over threshold (POT) data series. However, data quality and quantity of block maxima and POT hydrological records do not usually fulfill the basic requirements of extreme value theory, thus making its application questionable and results prone to high uncertainty and low reliability. An alternative approach to better exploit the available information of continuous time series and nonextreme records is to build the exact distribution of maxima (i.e., nonasymptotic extreme value distributions) from a sequence of low-threshold POT. Practical closed-form results for this approach do exist only for independent high-threshold POT series with Poisson occurrences. This study introduces new closed-form equations of the exact distribution of maxima taken from low-threshold POT with magnitudes characterized by an arbitrary marginal distribution and first-order Markovian dependence, and negative binomial occurrences. The proposed model encompasses and generalizes the independent-Poisson model and allows for analyses relying on significantly larger samples of low-threshold POT values exhibiting dependence, temporal clustering, and overdispersion. To check the analytical results, we also introduce a new generator (called Gen2Mp) of proper first-order Markov chains with arbitrary marginal distributions. An illustrative application to long-term rainfall and streamflow data series shows that our model for the distribution of extreme maxima under dependence takes a step forward in developing more reliable data-rich-based analyses of extreme values.

AB Recent years have witnessed global massive property losses and casualties caused by extreme precipitation and its subsequent natural disasters, including floods and landslides. China is one of the countries deeply affected by these casualties. If the statistical characteristics and laws of extreme precipitation could be clearly grasped, then the negative impacts triggered by it may be minimized. China is a vast country and diverse in climate and terrain, hence different regions may be suitable for different analyses and research methods. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the research progress, methods and current status of extreme precipitation across the country. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of techniques and methods used in extreme precipitation research and engineering practice and their applications. The literature is reviewed focusing on seven aspects: (1) annual maxima method (AM), (2) peaks over threshold method (POT), (3) probable maximum precipitation (PMP), (4) non-stationary analysis of precipitation extremes, (5) intensity-duration-frequency curves (IDF), (6) uncertainty in extreme precipitation frequency analysis, and (7) spatial variability of extreme precipitation. Research on extreme precipitation in China is generally based or centered on the above seven aspects. The current study aims to provide ideas for further research on extreme precipitation frequency analysis and its response to climate change and human activities.

AB We compare various methods for resolving steady flow within three-dimensional discrete fracture networks, including direct methods, Krylov subspace methods with and without preconditioning, and multi-grid methods. We compared the performance of the methods based on compute times and scaling of the solution as a function of the number of grid nodes and log-variance of the hydraulic aperture. The methods are applied to three test cases: (a) variable density of networks with a truncated power-law distribution of fracture lengths, (b) a fixed network composed of monodisperse fracture sizes but varied permeability/aperture heterogeneity, (c) and a network based on field site in Nevada, US. We chose these cases to allow us to study the impact of the mesh size and flow properties, as well as to demonstrate our conclusions on a large-scale, realistic problem (more than 40 million mesh nodes). A direct solution using Cholesky factorization outperformed other methods for every example but was closely followed in performance by some algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. Among the Krylov methods, conjugate gradients (CG) with an AMG preconditioner performs the best. Generally, Cholesky factorization is recommended, but CG with an AMG preconditioner may be suitable for very large problems beyond 40 million nodes where the entire linear system cannot reside in memory.

AB Environmental measurements generate great volumes of high-dimensional data (often noisy and with missing values) from which meaningful messages may be extracted through appropriate organisation and summarisation. The self-organizing map (SOM) is an artificial neural network popular for recognizing patterns, relationships and clusters in such data. Through the finetuning of configuration and training parameters, the SOM can be tailored to best suit a specific data set. Presently, most hydrologic applications continue to rely on heuristics, software defaults or arbitrarily chosen parameters, forfeiting some of the potential benefits of the method, and often resulting in an output that does not best represent the actual features of the data. This paper guides researchers through the knowledgeable creation and interpretation of an appropriately customised SOM relevant to their particular high-dimensional, nonlinear data set. An understanding of the effects that parameter selection and training options have on the extracted information is developed, practical guidance is given for appropriately modifying parameter sets, and comparisons are made with closely-related methods. Data pre-processing, parameter selection, initialisation, training, visualisation and interpretation of the output map for pattern extraction and clustering are discussed. Through individually customised SOMs, more meaningful information can be gained from data-driven exploratory analysis of the inter-component relationships involved in water resource systems.

AB Vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes are major components of terrestrial ecosystems, and they interact strongly with each other. Studies of hydrological responses to vegetation dynamics are usually conducted on a long-term scale, whereas the hydrological responses within a single year have rarely been studied. In the present study, Poyang Lake runoff (PYL-R) model, a new hydrological model coupled with leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing products, was established and applied to simulate the runoff process in the Poyang Lake Watershed. The simulation results obtained in three sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake Watershed (Ganjiang Watershed, Xinjiang Watershed, and Fuhe Watershed) agreed well with the observations (Nash efficiency coefficient values and R values exceeded 0.6 and 0.9, respectively). The PYL-R experiment (PYL-R-E) model was designed as a contrast model without considering the impact of LAI. The simulated monthly runoff results obtained using the PYL-R and PYL-R-E models were compared, and the within-year changes in the differences between the two results were analysed to evaluate and quantify the impact of vegetation dynamic on runoff. From January to July, when LAI values increased by around 2.6 m(2) m(-2), monthly runoff depth differences between PYL-R and PYL-R-E results increased by 35.25, 27.98, and 29.14 mm in the Ganjiang, Xinjiang, and Fuhe watersheds, respectively. Dense vegetation caused high interception and evapotranspiration during summer, which largely reduced runoff. By contrast, during winter, the effect of vegetation was weaker on runoff process whereas the impacts of other factors (e.g., precipitation) were higher. The sensitivity of monthly runoff to vegetation dynamics varied greatly throughout the whole year. In particular, during August and September, the LAI-caused runoff changes were very high, accounting for 28-42% of monthly runoff in the sub-watersheds. Our findings clarify the effects of changes in vegetation on hydrological processes over short time scales, thereby providing insights into the effects of scale on eco-hydrological processes.

AB This article presents a methodology for planning new water resources infrastructure investments and operating strategies in a world of climate change uncertainty. It combines a real options (e.g., options to defer, expand, contract, abandon, switch use, or otherwise alter a capital investment) approach with principles drawn from robust decision-making (RDM). RDM comprises a class of methods that are used to identify investment strategies that perform relatively well, compared to the alternatives, across a wide range of plausible future scenarios. Our proposed framework relies on a simulation model that includes linkages between climate change and system hydrology, combined with sensitivity analyses that explore how economic outcomes of investments in new dams vary with forecasts of changing runoff and other uncertainties. To demonstrate the framework, we consider the case of new multipurpose dams along the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. We model flexibility in design and operating decisionsthe selection, sizing, and sequencing of new dams, and reservoir operating rules. Results show that there is no single investment plan that performs best across a range of plausible future runoff conditions. The decision-analytic framework is then used to identify dam configurations that are both robust to poor outcomes and sufficiently flexible to capture high upside benefits if favorable future climate and hydrological conditions should arise. The approach could be extended to explore design and operating features of development and adaptation projects other than dams.

AB This paper is focused on the contribution that the two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations could provide in respect to the fields of research devoted to the river networks analysis. The novelty introduced in this work is represented, in particular, by the hydraulic characterization of the river drainage networks, starting from flow patterns simulated by the two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations on high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) through the analysis of water depths flowing down the hillslopes, channelized in both the main river and in all the tributaries or stored in small depressions. The first finding of this research is the determination of scaling laws that describe the relations between the water depth threshold, used to identify the network cells, and a dimensionless area, related to the total area of the network cells themselves. The observed bimodal scaling behavior has been considered as representative of the flow patterns belonging to the channel networks (CN) and hillslope plus channel networks (HCN), the physical and geomorphological interpretation of which has been provided from a multifractal point of view. In particular, the analysis of the multifractal spectra highlights significant variations in the multifractal signatures, between the CN and the HCN structures, leading to the proposal of a novel criterion for channels heads detection that has provided encouraging predictions of field observations.

AB Anomalous transport is ubiquitous in a wide range of disordered systems, notably in fractured porous formations. We quantitatively identify the structural controls on anomalous tracer transport in a model of a real fractured geological formation that was mapped in an outcrop. The transport, determined by a continuum scale mathematical model, is characterized by breakthrough curves (BTCs) that document anomalous (or "non-Fickian") transport, which is accounted for by a power law distribution of local transition times psi(t) within the framework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW). We show that the determination of psi(t) is related to fractures aligned approximately with the macroscopic direction of flow. We establish the dominant role of fracture alignment and assess the statistics of these fractures by determining a concentration-visitation weighted residence time histogram. We then convert the histogram to a probability density function (pdf) that coincides with the CTRW psi(t) and hence anomalous transport. We show that the permeability of the geological formation hosting the fracture network has a limited effect on the anomalous nature of the transport; rather, it is the fractures transverse to the flow direction that play the major role in forming the long BTC tail associated with anomalous transport. This is a remarkable result, given the complexity of the flow field statistics as captured by concentration transitions.

AB The time required at a field site to obtain a few measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) will allow for many measurements of soil air permeability (k(a)). This study investigates if k(a) measured in situ (k(a,in) (situ)) can be a substitute for measurement of K-s in relation to infiltration and surface runoff modelling. Measurements of k(a,in situ) were carried out in two small agricultural catchments. A spatial correlation of the log-transformed values existed having a range of approximately 100 m. A predictive relationship between K-s and k(a) measured on 100-cm(3) soil samples in the laboratory was derived for one of the field slopes and showed good agreement with an earlier suggested predictive K-s-k(a) relationship. In situ measurements of K-s and k(a) suggested that the predictive relationships also could be used at larger scale. The K-s-k(a) relationships together with the k(a,in situ) data were applied in a distributed surface runoff (DSR) model, simulating a high-intensity rainfall event. The DSR simulation results were highly dependent on whether the geometric average of k(a,in situ) or kriged values of k(a,in situ) was used as model input. When increasing the resolution of K, in the DSR model, a limit of 30-40 m was found for both field slopes. Below this limit, the simulated runoff and hydrograph peaks were independent of resolution scale. If only a few randomly chosen values of K-s were used to represent the spatial variation within the field slope, very large deviations in repeated DSR simulation results were obtained, both with respect to peak height and hydrograph shape. In contrast, when using many predicted K-s values based on a K-s-k(a) relationship and measured k(a,in situ) data, the DSR model generally captured the correct hydrograph shape although simulations were sensitive to the chosen K-s-k(a) relationship. As massive measurement efforts normally will be required to obtain a satisfactory representation of the spatial variability in K-s, the use of k(a,in situ) to assess spatial variability in K-s appears a promising alternative.

AB Numerical tests indicate that Hortonian runoff mechanisms benefit from scaling effects that non-Hortonian runoff mechanisms do not share. This potentially makes Hortonian watersheds more amenable to physically based modelling provided that the physically based model employed properly accounts for rainfall distribution and initial soil moisture conditions, to which these types of model are highly sensitive. The distributed Hortonian runoff model CASC2D has been developed and tested for the US Army over the past decade. The purpose of the model is to provide the Army with superior predictions of runoff and stream-flow compared with the standard lumped parameter model HEC-1. The model is also to be used to help minimize negative effects on the landscape caused by US armed forces training activities. Development of the CASC2D model is complete and the model has been tested and applied at several locations. These applications indicate that the model can realistically reproduce hydrographs when properly applied. These applications also indicate that there may be many situations where the model is inadequate. Because of this, the Army is pursuing development of a new model, GSSHA, that will provide improved numerical stability and incorporate additional stream-flow-producing mechanisms and improved hydraulics.

AB The cerrados of Brazil cover 2 million km(2). Despite the extent of these seasonally dry ecosystems, little watershed research has been focused in this region, particularly relative to the watersheds of the Amazon Basin. The cerrado shares pedogenic characteristics with the Amazon Basin in draining portions of the Brazilian shield and in possessing Oxisols over much of the landscape. The objective of this research was to quantify the stream water geochemical relationships of an undisturbed 1200 ha cerrado watershed for comparison to river geochemistry in the Amazon. Furthermore, this undisturbed watershed was used to evaluate stream discharge versus dissolved ion concentration relationships. This research was conducted in the Corrego Roncador watershed of the Reserva Ecologica do Roncador (RECOR) of the Instituto Brasileiro Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) near Brasilia, Brazil. Bulk precipitation and stream water chemistry were analysed between May 1998 and May 2000. The upland soils of this watershed are nutrient poor possessing total stocks of exchangeable elements in the upper 1 m of 81 +/- 13, 77 +/- 4, 25 +/- 3, and 1 +/- 1 kg ha(-1) of K, Ca, Mg, and P, respectively. Bulk precipitation inputs of dissolved nutrients for this watershed are low and consistent with previous estimates. The nutrient-poor soils of this watershed, however, increase the relative importance of precipitation for nutrient replenishment to vegetation during episodes of ecosystem disturbance. Stream water dissolved loads were extremely dilute with conductivities ranging from 4 to 10 mu S cm(-1) during periods of high- and low-flow, respectively. Despite the low concentrations in this stream, geochemical relationships were similar to other Amazonian streams draining shield geologies. Discharge-concentration relationships for Ca and Mg in these highly weathered soils developed from igneous rocks of the Brazilian shield demonstrated a significant negative relationship indicating a continued predominance of groundwater baseflow contributions these cationic elements.

AB To investigate the effects of wave shape on cohesive sediment flux in shallow water environments, a one-dimensional vertical (1DV) model for cohesive sediment transport previously validated with field measurement is applied to conditions of skewed and asymmetric oscillatory flows. Cohesive sediments usually portray behaviors different from those of noncohesive sediments. This is mainly due to the flocculation process through which the density and the size of cohesive sediment change continuously. Therefore, a robust flocculation model is incorporated with a 1DV model in this study. Under the condition of skewed oscillatory flow (second-order Stokes wave-type oscillatory flow), the flux of cohesive sediment is significantly affected by the change of flow skewness, whereas the flux of noncohesive sediment of which size is 100 mu m does not show a clear relationship with skewness. Under the condition of forward-leaning asymmetric oscillatory flow (saw-tooth wave-type oscillatory flow), the direction of cohesive sediment flux is negative, whereas the flux of noncohesive sediment shows the positive direction. The phase-lag effect is considered as the main mechanism of these behaviors. The interactional relationship between the settling velocity, the variation of concentration profile, and hydrodynamics of carrier fluid enhances the phase-lag effect and causes different behaviors in cohesive sediment compared to the flux of fine noncohesive sediment.

AB Dams and reservoirs provide decision-makers and managers with appropriate control on the available water resources, allowing the implementation of various strategies for the most efficient usage of the available water resources. In areas where water supply exhibits significant temporal variation when compared with the demand, the challenge is to bridge the gap and achieve an optimal match between the water supply and demand patterns. Therefore, the release of water from reservoirs should be controlled to ensure that the operation rule for the available water storage in the reservoir is optimized to satisfy the future water demands. This level of optimal control can only be achieved using an efficient optimization algorithm to optimally derive the operation rule for such a complex water system. Herein, two main methods have been considered to tackle this water resource management problem. First, three different optimization algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and whale optimization algorithm, have been applied. In addition, two different optimization algorithms, namely crow search algorithm and master-slave algorithm, have been introduced to generate an optimal rule for water release policy. Further, the proposed optimization algorithms have been applied to one of the most critical dam and reservoir water systems, namely the Aswan High Dam (AHD), which controls almost 95% of Egypt's water resources. The current operation of AHD using the existing optimization rules resulted in a mismatch between the water supply and water demand. In other words, the water availability could be higher than the water demand during a certain period, whereas it could be less than the water demand during another period. The results denoted that the master-slave algorithm outperforms the remaining algorithms and generates an optimization rule that minimizes the mismatch between the water supply and water demand.

AB High-resolution geologic models that incorporate observed state data are expected to effectively enhance the reliability of reservoir performance prediction. One of the major challenges faced is how to solve the large-scale inverse modeling problem, i.e., to infer high-resolution models from the given observations of state variables that are related to the model parameters according to some known physical rules, e.g., the flow and transport partial differential equations. There are typically two difficulties, one is the high-dimensional problem and the other is the inverse problem. A multiscale inverse method is presented in this work to attack these problems with the aid of a gradient-based optimization algorithm. In this method, the model responses (i.e., the simulated state data) can be efficiently computed from the high-resolution model using the multiscale finite-volume method. The mismatch between the observations and the multiscale solutions is then used to define a proper objective function, and the fine-scale sensitivity coefficients (i.e., the derivatives of the objective function with respect to each node's attribute) are computed by a multiscale adjoint method for subsequent optimization. The difficult high-dimensional optimization problem is reduced to a one-dimensional one using the gradient-based gradual deformation method. A synthetic single-phase transient flow example problem is employed to illustrate the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the multiscale framework presented is not only computationally efficient but also can generate geologically consistent models. By preserving spatial structure for inverse modeling, the method presented overcomes the artifacts introduced by the multiscale simulation and may enhance the prediction ability of the inverse-conditional realizations generated.

AB Soil moisture statistical fractal is an important tool for downscaling remotely-sensed observations and has the potential to play a key role in multi scale hydrologic modeling. The fractal was first introduced two decades ago, but relatively little is known regarding how its scaling exponents evolve in time in response to climatic forcings. Previous studies have neglected the process of moisture re-distribution due to regional groundwater flow, in this study we used a physically-based surface-subsurface processes model and numerical experiments to elucidate the patterns and controls of fractal temporal evolution in two U.S. Midwest basins. Groundwater flow was found to introduce large-scale spatial structure, thereby reducing the scaling exponents (tau), which has implications for the transferability of calibrated parameters to predict tau. However, the groundwater effects depend on complex interactions with other physical controls such as soil texture and land use. The fractal scaling exponents, while in general showing a seasonal mode that correlates with mean moisture content, display hysteresis after storm events that can be divided into three phases, consistent with literature findings: (a) wetting, (b) re-organizing, and (c) dry-down. Modeling experiments clearly show that the hysteresis is attributed to soil texture, whose "patchiness" is the primary contributing factor. We generalized phenomenological rules for the impacts of rainfall, soil texture, groundwater flow, and land use on tau evolution. Grid resolution has a mild influence on the results and there is a strong correlation between predictions of tau from different resolutions. Overall, our results suggest that groundwater flow should be given more consideration in studies of the soil moisture statistical fractal, especially in regions with a shallow water table.

AB We develop a simple stochastic theory for erosion and sediment transport, based on the Poisson pulse rainfall model, in order to analyze how variability in rainfall and runoff influences drainage basin evolution. Two cases are considered: sediment transport by runoff in rills and channels and particle detachment from bedrock or cohesive soils. Analytical and numerical results show that under some circumstances, rainfall variability can have an impact equal to or greater than that of mean rainfall amount. The predicted sensitivity to rainfall variability is greatest when (1) thresholds for runoff generation and/or particle detachment are significant and/or (2) erosion and transport are strong nonlinear functions of discharge. In general, sediment transport capacity is predicted to increase with increasing rainfall variability. Depending on the degree of nonlinearity, particle detachment capacity may either increase or decrease with increasing rainfall variability. These findings underscore the critical importance of hydrogeomorphic thresholds and other sources of nonlinearity in process dynamics. The morphologic consequences of rainfall variability are illustrated by incorporating the pulse rainfall theory into a landscape simulation model. The simulation results imply that, all else being equal, catchments experiencing a shift toward greater climate variability will tend to have (1) higher erosion rates, (2) higher drainage density (because of increased runoff erosion efficiency), and ultimately (3) reduced relief. The stochastic approach provides a useful method for incorporating physically meaningful climate data within the current generation of landscape evolution models.

AB This study develops an explicit two-step Lagrangian scheme based on the renewal-reward process to capture transient anomalous diffusion with mixed retention and early arrivals in multidimensional media. The resulting 3-D anomalous transport simulator provides a flexible platform for modeling transport. The first step explicitly models retention due to mass exchange between one mobile zone and any number of parallel immobile zones. The mobile component of the renewal process can be calculated as either an exponential random variable or a preassigned time step, and the subsequent random immobile time follows a Hyper-exponential distribution for finite immobile zones or a tempered stable distribution for infinite immobile zones with an exponentially tempered power-law memory function. The second step describes well-documented early arrivals which can follow streamlines due to mechanical dispersion using the method of subordination to regional flow. Applicability and implementation of the Lagrangian solver are further checked against transport observed in various media. Results show that, although the time-nonlocal model parameters are predictable for transport with retention in alluvial settings, the standard time-nonlocal model cannot capture early arrivals. Retention and early arrivals observed in porous and fractured media can be efficiently modeled by our Lagrangian solver, allowing anomalous transport to be incorporated into 2-D/3-D models with irregular flow fields. Extensions of the particle-tracking approach are also discussed for transport with parameters conditioned on local aquifer properties, as required by transient flow and nonstationary media.

AB Variability and nonstationarity in flood regimes of cold regions are examined using data from hydrometric reference streamflow gauging stations from 27 natural watersheds in Canada and adjacent areas of the United States. Choosing stations from reference networks with nearly 100 years of data allows for the investigation of changes that span several phases of some of the atmospheric drivers that may influence flood behavior. The reference hydrologic networks include only stations considered to have good quality data and were screened to avoid the influences of regulation, diversions, or land use change. Changes and variations in flood regimes are complex and require a multifaceted approach to properly characterize the types of changes that have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Peaks over threshold (POT) data are extracted from daily flow data for each watershed, and changes to the magnitude, timing, frequency, volume, and duration of threshold exceedences are investigated. Seasonal statistics are used to explore changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing of flood threshold exceedences. A variety of measures are developed to infer flood regime shifts including from a nival regime to a mixed regime and a mixed regime to a more pluvial-dominated regime. The flood regime at many of the watersheds demonstrates increased prominence of rainfall floods and decreased prevalence of snow-melt contributions to flood responses. While some individual stations show a relationship between flood variables and climate indices, these relationships are generally weak.

AB Climate change can result in changes to floods and flood regimes, but the relationship between floods and climate change is complex and poorly understood. The flood regime influences the nature, severity, and timing of flood events for any watershed. Flood regimes should be viewed as a continuum with completely nival (snowmelt-driven) watersheds at one end of the continuum and purely pluvial (rainfall-driven) watersheds at the other. Flood regimes are important for the operation of flood defenses and to better understand how changes in the flood regime can affect the magnitude of flood events. Data from 46 long term streamflow gauging stations from reference hydrologic networks (RHNs) in Canada (23) and the US (23), are examined to detect changes that have occurred, or are continuing to occur, in flood regimes from watersheds responding only to climate variations and changes. Peaks over Threshold (POT) flood events are used to investigate changes in the timing of flood events. Seasonality measures, using circular statistics, illustrate changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing and regularity of flood threshold exceedences. A nival fraction is determined for each watershed and for each year based on a clustering of the flood events into two groups, representing nival and pluvial events. Changes to the flood regime over time, and based on annual temperature, are determined from logistic regression of the number of nival and pluvial events for each year. While strongly nival watersheds show no changes, roughly 15% of the stations exhibit significant changes that represent shifts towards the pluvial end of the flood regime continuum, which has implications for design flood estimation and the operation of flood control infrastructure.

AB The radar reflectivity (Z)-rain intensity (R) relationship fluctuates in both temporal and spatial scales. The dynamic factor analysis (DFA) and min/max autocorrelation factor analysis (MAFA) was specifically designed for considering various space-time integrations of gauge rainfall and radar reflectivity. We detect representative radar reflectivity observed around rainfall stations that were most responsible for rainfall intensity and identify the crucial patterns of the radar reflectivity in the Kaoping River watershed during Typhoon Morakot. Result shows that the MAFA and DFA can reduce the uncertainty of the dynamic Z-R relationship effectively. The MAFA separates an entire area into two subareas (southern and northern areas) according to the relationships between the radar reflectivity and min/max autocorrelation factor (MAF) axes. For both areas, the different extents of temporal rainfall correlated with the radar reflectivity were determined using DFA. Especially in the northern area, the radar reflectivity was significantly related to the rainfall intensity for most stations without mountain blockage. Mountain blockages associated with the presence of terrain and wind direction were inferred the major factors that affected the relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity in the mountainous watershed. Further study can consider the terrain effect and meteorological information, such as wind speed and direction in the DFA model, with the dominant radar reflectivity to estimate the temporal rainfall patterns.

AB Climate change impacts on hydroclimatology are becoming increasingly apparent around the world. It is unknown how annual variations in precipitation and air temperature alter the model-inferred importance of hydrological processes and how this varies across watersheds. To examine this, we used parsimonious rainfall-runoff model and applied time-varying sensitivity analysis across 30 Californian watersheds for a 33-year period (1981-2014). We calculated annual total order sensitivity indices for five performance metrics: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) and model error in simulating hydrologic signatures (runoff ratio, slope of flow duration curve, baseflow index, and timing of streamflow centroid). Sensitivity of hydrological signatures to the parameters differed by signature, while parameter importance with respect to KGE was much more spatially and temporally variable. Variations in parameter sensitivity with respect to KGE were either correlated with air temperature (snow-dominated sites in the Sierra Nevada) or precipitation (lower elevation sites < 1,300 m). Across error metrics and signatures, parameter sensitivity strongly differed between wet and dry years for a subset of our study sites. While parameter importance varied through time, parameter sensitivity variations across watersheds were much more pronounced. This suggests that parameter controls on model performance are much more a reflection of watershed properties as opposed to being dominantly shaped by shifts in precipitation and air temperature. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding simulated watershed responses to fluctuating annual conditions, as this conceptual knowledge is necessary to anticipate similarities and differences in response across even relatively proximal watersheds in the face of growing extreme conditions.
   Plain Language Summary Computer models are useful tools that can be used to analyze what inputs matter most to ensuring that model output is similar to observed conditions. In order to understand how very wet years versus very dry years impact which model inputs (called parameters) are most important to matching good predictions, we simulated streamflow using a simple mathematical model many thousands of times. We used these outputs to determine how variations in predictions of streamflow (output from the model) are related to variations in model parameters, to identify which parameters are most important for ensuring reasonable model predictions. We focused on watersheds that are close together, but that may experience different average conditions and interannual variability. We found that which parameters are important varied across different watersheds and also varied with total annual precipitation and watershed elevation. In addition, we found that drought impacted the importance of processes in the model, especially in mountainous watersheds. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding how watersheds respond to varying annual conditions, as this type of knowledge is essential to anticipate the future of streamflow availability and inform the management style that needs to be implemented to predict water availability in these systems.

AB Flow-duration curve (FDC) based streamflow estimation methods involve estimating an FDC at an ungaged or partially gaged location and using the time series of nonexceedance probabilities estimated from donor streamgage sites to generate estimates of streamflow. We develop a mathematical framework to illustrate the connection between copulas and prior FDC-based approaches. The performance of copula methods is compared to several other streamflow estimation methods using a decade of daily streamflow data from 74 sites located within two river basins in the southeast United States with different climate characteristics and physiographic properties. We show that copula approaches: (1) outperform other methods in the limiting case of perfect information with regard to the rank-based correlation structure and FDCs across the gaging network; (2) provide a hedge against poor performance when donor information becomes sparser and less informative; (3) outperform other methods when used for partially gaged sites with several years of available data; and (4) remain a competitive albeit nondominating method for ungaged sites and partially gaged sites with limited data when realistic error is introduced in the estimation of FDCs and correlations across the gaging network.

AB Evaporation is an important component of the soil water balance. It is composed of water flow and transport processes in a porous medium that are coupled with heat fluxes and free air flow. This work provides a comprehensive review of model concepts used in different research fields to describe evaporation. Concepts range from nonisothermal two-phase flow, two-component transport in the porous medium that is coupled with one-phase flow, two-component transport in the free air flow to isothermal liquid water flow in the porous medium with upper boundary conditions defined by a potential evaporation flux when available energy and transfer to the free airflow are limiting or by a critical threshold water pressure when soil water availability is limiting. The latter approach corresponds with the classical Richards equation with mixed boundary conditions. We compare the different approaches on a theoretical level by identifying the underlying simplifications that are made for the different compartments of the system: porous medium, free flow and their interface, and by discussing how processes not explicitly considered are parameterized. Simplifications can be grouped into three sets depending on whether lateral variations in vertical fluxes are considered, whether flow and transport in the air phase in the porous medium are considered, and depending on how the interaction at the interface between the free flow and the porous medium is represented. The consequences of the simplifications are illustrated by numerical simulations in an accompanying paper.

AB [ 1] The purpose of the present work is to quantify the correlation structure of simulated velocity fields in heterogeneous permeability fields and to discuss how to represent it in upscaled transport models. We investigate the velocity field correlation structure for multinormal log permeability fields. The simulated velocity distributions are analyzed in a Lagrangian framework, i.e., along the particles' paths. To quantify the different spatial organization of low- and high-velocity zones, we condition the estimated velocity correlation length and time on the initial particle velocity. The velocity correlation length is found to increase with the initial particle velocity, following a power law. Such an effect is likely due to the channeling of high-velocity zones, which implies that particles keep memory of their initial velocity over longer distances for high initial velocities than for low initial velocities. Two distinct regimes are identified for the velocity correlation time. For low initial particle velocity the correlation time is controlled by the large time needed to escape from the low- velocity zones. For high initial particle velocity it is controlled by the large time needed for particles to sample the whole velocity field, in particular low- velocity zones. One of the consequences of these results is that for such velocity fields the nonlinear dependence of both the correlation length and time on the particle initial velocity restricts the use of spatial or temporal Markovian assumptions for modeling velocity transitions in effective transport models.

AB The width function captures the essential features of the catchment's GIUH's response. This paper aims to identify the morphometric properties which control the shape of the width function, and assess whether these properties can be used as similarity indices for catchment comparison. A new deterministic iterative model of the width function is proposed on the basis of a conceptualization of the topology of the channel network, and exploiting the morphometric characteristics of internal and external nodes. Tests are carried out on eleven French catchments and compared to the reference Peano catchment. Results show that the morphometric properties of three main internal and external nodes such as the drained area, the distance to the outlet, and the position on the channel network are useful descriptors for modeling the width function and for representing the scaling properties of a channel network. While the GIUHs based on Horton- Strahler ratios are strongly related to the method used to extract the channel network from the DEM, the new indices are independent of the method used. They are sufficient descriptors to reproduce the main shape of the width function, the peak, the time to peak, and the main properties such as non- negativity, non- stationarity, and power law decay of the spectrum. They may be used to establish catchment typology,to compare catchments, and to classify the width function peaks for catchment regionalization.

TI Grid digital elevation model based algorithms for determination of
   hillslope width functions through flow distance transforms
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Recently developed hillslope storage dynamics theory can represent the essential physical behavior of a natural system by accounting explicitly for the plan shape of a hillslope in an elegant and simple way. As a result, this theory is promising for improving catchment-scale hydrologic modeling. In this study, grid digital elevation model (DEM) based algorithms for determination of hillslope geometric characteristics (e.g., hillslope units and width functions in hillslope storage dynamics models) are presented. This study further develops a method for hillslope partitioning, established by Fan and Bras (1998), by applying it on a grid network. On the basis of hillslope unit derivation, a flow distance transforms method (TD infinity) is suggested in order to decrease the systematic error of grid DEM-based flow distance calculation caused by flow direction approximation to streamlines. Hillslope width transfer functions are then derived to convert the probability density functions of flow distance into hillslope width functions. These algorithms are applied and evaluated on five abstract hillslopes, and detailed tests and analyses are carried out by comparing the derivation results with theoretical width functions. The results demonstrate that the TD infinity improves estimations of the flow distance and thus hillslope width function. As the proposed procedures are further applied in a natural catchment, we find that the natural hillslope width function can be well fitted by the Gaussian function. This finding is very important for applying the newly developed hillslope storage dynamics models in a real catchment.

AB Bed load transport is a highly stochastic, multiscale process, where particle advection and diffusion regimes are governed by the dynamics of each sediment grain during its motion and resting states. Having a quantitative understanding of the macroscale behavior emerging from the microscale interactions is important for proper model selection in the absence of individual grain-scale observations. Here we develop a semimechanistic sediment transport model based on individual particle dynamics, which incorporates the episodic movement (steps separated by rests) of sediment particles and study their macroscale behavior. By incorporating different types of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of particle resting times T-r, under the assumption of thin-tailed PDF of particle velocities, we study the emergent behavior of particle advection and diffusion regimes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For exponential PDFs of resting times Tr, we observe normal advection and diffusion at long time scales. For a power-law PDF of resting times (i.e., f(T-r) similar to T-r(-v)), the tail thickness parameter v is observed to affect the advection regimes (both sub and normal advective), and the diffusion regimes (both subdiffusive and superdiffusive). By comparing our semimechanistic model with two random walk models in the literature, we further suggest that in order to reproduce accurately the emerging diffusive regimes, the resting time model has to be coupled with a particle motion model able to produce finite particle velocities during steps, as the episodic model discussed here.

AB Bacterial adhesion and motility are studied at the pore scale by focusing on two interrelated aspects of transport: wall attachment/detachment (reversible sorption) and the role of convection and pore geometry on adhesion. Motility is also examined through use of Brownian dynamics. Bacteria motility and reversible attachment/detachment are incorporated with a numerical laminar flow solver. Since individual bacteria are modeled, the results apply to low concentrations/coverage. Pore geometries consistent with a microflow cell of variable cross sectional area are used. This exploratory modeling work precedes an ongoing microflow cell experimental study and more detailed Levy particle models. Adsorption reactions occurring over different time scales are modeled as multimodal distributions with power law tails. Computations show the relative magnitude of bacterial motility to advection controls the average number of collisions against solid walls. Variable cross section in pore geometry changes hydrodynamic conditions for deposition (e.g., variable shear stress). In regions of reduced cross sectional area, the ratio of bacteria motility to average velocity is smaller and results in less collisions and reduced retardation. Additionally, reduced cross sectional area increases both wall shear stress and vorticity which should be considered in adhesive models. While the shear forces acting on a particle deposited at the wall work on a spatial scale of the microbe's size, adhesive forces may be confined to tens of nanometers. Multimodal adhesion causes the first passage time distributions to have long tails. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture processes exhibit a strong variability in space and time due to the variability of the meteorological forcing and the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties. This study aims at providing a statistical description of soil moisture variability by analyzing data from nine in situ stations located over an West-East gradient in southwestern France (SMOSMANIA stations, distributed over an area of about 300 x 200 km). For each station, four time series of soil moisture observed at four different depths ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm are analyzed. First, possible scaling properties are investigated within the Fourier domain with the help of spectral analysis tools. Red noise-like (1/f(2)) scaling properties could be noticed over a fairly wide scale range (1000 h-1 h) with relatively homogeneous scaling parameters for 5 cm depth soil moistures regardless of the station. These properties are confirmed at other depths with slightly steeper spectra and more heterogeneity across stations. In a second step, multifractal analysis has been carried out on the same data. Multifractal scaling is observed over a narrower scaling range (128 h-1 h). Moment scaling functions can be parameterized within the framework of Universal Multifractals: typical parameters are C-1 approximate to 0.25 and alpha approximate to 1.6-1.8 for surface data while both parameters are subject to strong changes (C-1 increases and a decreases) as the depth increases. In a third step, Multiscale Entropy (MSE) analysis has been applied in order to analyze the dataset from an information theory point of view and to infer whether multifractal properties could have a signature on MSE estimates. The MSE function has been found to follow a power law of the aggregation time with a scaling exponent close to 0.3-0.4 for surface data. These exponents were generally close to the Hurst exponent H estimated by first-order structure functions. While it is already known that MSE should follow scaling properties in the case of monofractal signals, the results suggest that the latter property holds for natural multifractal processes. Finally, complementary numerical tests based on synthetic multifractal time series are done in order to assess the relationship between the MSE scaling exponent H' and multifractal parameters C-1, alpha and H. A dependency on the three multifractal parameters has been observed, yet in practice the approximation H' approximate to H seems somewhat acceptable for processes with relatively large Hurst exponents and/or low multifractal intermittency (C-1). On a more broad perspective, the existence of relationships between multifractal scaling and MSE properties could help to refine the physical interpretation of observed scaling properties in many geophysical processes.

AB To quantify the interplay between scalar sources and sinks (S-c) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), "forward" and "inverse" approaches have been proposed. The canonical form of forward approaches is a one-dimensional ecophysiological-radiative transfer scheme coupled to turbulent transport theory. In contrast, inverse approaches strictly rely on turbulent transport theory and mean scalar concentration as their primary input to infer S-c and NEE. While the formulation of both approaches have evolved over the past decade, no systematic comparison between them was undertaken for the same data set, and over a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Our objective is to compare the predicted S-c and NEE from these two approaches with eddy-covariance measurements. The results show that the forward method outperformed all three inverse methods for unstable and neutral conditions on short time scales (similar to30 min) but yielded comparable results at longer time scales. Poor agreement was obtained under stable conditions for all models. Hence, for modeling event-based flux variations, forward models are preferred. Since the forward method requires detailed knowledge of ecophysiological, drag, radiative transfer and other canopy attributes, all of which are difficult to obtain on a routine basis, a symbiotic use of forward and inverse approaches is most advantageous.

AB Complexities in river discharge, variable rainfall regime, and drought severity merit the use of advanced optimization tools in multi-reservoir operation. The gravity search algorithm (GSA) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions. This paper explores the GSA's efficacy for solving benchmark functions, single reservoir, and four-reservoir operation optimization problems. The GSA's solutions are compared with those of the well-known genetic algorithm (GA) in three optimization problems. The results show that the GSA's results are closer to the optimal solutions than the GA's results in minimizing the benchmark functions. The average values of the objective function equal 1.218 and 1.746 with the GSA and GA, respectively, in solving the single-reservoir hydropower operation problem. The global solution equals 1.213 for this same problem. The GSA converged to 99.97% of the global solution in its average-performing history, while the GA converged to 97% of the global solution of the four-reservoir problem. Requiring fewer parameters for algorithmic implementation and reaching the optimal solution in fewer number of functional evaluations are additional advantages of the GSA over the GA. The results of the three optimization problems demonstrate a superior performance of the GSA for optimizing general mathematical problems and the operation of reservoir systems.

AB An analytical model is proposed in this study to describe transient drawdown induced by non-Darcian flow in a confined aquifer with a single well circulation groundwater heat pump system. The Izbash equation and a linearization method are employed to describe non-Darcian flow in the horizontal direction of a confined aquifer and to approximate the nonlinear term in the governing equation, respectively. By applying a combination of the Laplace and Fourier cosine transforms, an approximate analytical solution in the Laplace domain is obtained, which is numerically inverted to obtain transient drawdown in the time domain using the Stehfest algorithm method. The results of the derived analytical solution for the special case of Darcian flow (m = 1) correspond well with the existing solution derived using Darcy's law. The steady-state analytical solution in the time domain is obtained by applying the Fourier cosine transform. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of selected parameters, such as the power index m , the radial hydraulic conductivity K-r , the aquifer specific storage S , and the length of the sealed section d(2) , on drawdown. The results show that each parameter has its influence period on drawdown, and that drawdown is more sensitive to the power index m compared to other parameters.

AB We propose a new cosimulation algorithm for simulating a primary attribute using one or several secondary attributes known exhaustively on the domain. This problem is frequently encountered in surface and groundwater hydrology when a variable of interest is measured only at a discrete number of locations and when the secondary variable is mapped by indirect techniques such as geophysics or remote sensing. In the proposed approach, the correlation between the two variables is modeled by a joint probability distribution function. A technique to construct such relation using underlying variables and physical laws is proposed when field data are insufficient. The simulation algorithm proceeds sequentially. At each location of the domain, two conditional probability distribution functions (cpdf) are inferred. The cpdf of the main attribute is inferred in a classical way from the neighboring data and a model of spatial variability. The second cpdf is inferred directly from the joint probability distribution function of the two attributes and the value of the secondary attribute at the location to be simulated. The two distribution functions are combined by probability aggregation to obtain the local cpdf from which a value for the primary attribute is randomly drawn. Various examples using synthetic and remote sensing data demonstrate that the method is more accurate than the classical collocated cosimulation technique when a complex relation relates the two attributes.

AB A new method for the statistical description and simulation of two-dimensional rainfall radar images is proposed. It is based on the theory of multiaffine random fields and the bounded lognormal cascade model. The model has three free parameters, which are shown to provide a parsimonious and robust statistical description of rainfall images. The parameters retrieved from the analysis of the real rainfall data by fitting the one- and two-point statistics are used for simulation. The simulated rainfall fields are in good statistical and visual agreement with their real counterparts.

AB Flow-vegetation interaction affects fluid flow hydraulics and associated material transport in river corridors. Concomitant changes in pressure within the flow field due to the presence of vegetation may act as a driver for the formation of hyporheic flow across the sediment-water interface. This potentially important process, however, has yet to be studied. In order to investigate vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange, a series of numerical models of interlinked surface-subsurface flow modified by plant stems was conducted. Periodically staggered plant stem arrays on a flat sediment bed were considered within a coupled multiphysics computational fluid dynamics approach. Plants were idealized as rigid cylinders and arranged in different streamwise and spanwise spacing distances. Each vegetation array was then subjected to a broad range of flow Reynolds Numbers (Re). The results showed that hyporheic flow occurs in all conditions with the presence of vegetation. The vegetation-induced hyporheic flux is found to be a function of Re via a power law. The flux increases with interstem space until the space reaches the distance that rigid stems no longer affect the flow structures in the vicinity of each other. Larger intervegetation distances lead to a larger hyporheic zone. A direct comparison with bedform-induced hyporheic flow showed that vegetation can induce higher hyporheic flux through relatively shallower exchange zones. The results of all the simulations were synthesized into predictive models for hyporheic flux, bulk residence time and exchange depth based on drag coefficient, vegetation density, and Reynolds Number.

AB This study proposes a Bayesian model averaging ( BMA) method to address parameter estimation uncertainty arising from nonuniqueness in parameterization methods. BMA is able to incorporate multiple parameterization methods for prediction through the law of total probability and to obtain an ensemble average of hydraulic conductivity estimates. Two major issues in applying BMA to hydraulic conductivity estimation are discussed. The first problem is using Occam's window in usual BMA applications to measure approximated posterior model probabilities. Occam's window only accepts models in a very narrow range, tending to single out the best method and discard other good methods. We propose a variance window to replace Occam's window to cope with this problem. The second problem is the Kashyap information criterion (KIC) in the approximated posterior model probabilities, which tends to prefer highly uncertain parameterization methods by considering the Fisher information matrix. With sufficient amounts of observation data, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is a good approximation and is able to avoid controversial results from using KIC. This study adopts multiple generalized parameterization (GP) methods such as the BMA models to estimate spatially correlated hydraulic conductivity. Numerical examples illustrate the issues of using KIC and Occam's window and show the advantages of using BIC and the variance window in BMA application. Finally, we apply BMA to the hydraulic conductivity estimation of the "1500-foot'' sand in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.

AB Urban river systems are particularly sensitive to precipitation-driven water temperature surges and fluctuations. These result from rapid heat transfer from low-specific heat capacity surfaces to precipitation, which can cause thermally polluted surface run-off to enter urban streams. This can lead to additional ecological stress on these already precarious ecosystems. Although precipitation is a first-order driver of hydrological response, water temperature studies rarely characterize rain event dynamics and typically rely on single gauge data that yield only partial estimates of catchment precipitation. This paper examines three precipitation measuring methods (a statutory automatic weather station, citizen science gauges, and radar estimates) and investigates relationships between estimated rainfall inputs and subhourly surges and diurnal fluctuations in urban river water temperature. Water temperatures were monitored at 12 sites in summer 2016 in the River Rea, in Birmingham, UK. Generalized additive models were used to model the relationship between subhourly water temperature surges and precipitation intensity and subsequently the relationship between daily precipitation totals and standardized mean water temperature. The different precipitation measurement sources give highly variable precipitation estimates that relate differently to water temperature fluctuations. The radar catchment-averaged method produced the best model fit (generalized cross-validation score [GCV] = 0.30) and was the only model to show a significant relationship between water temperature surges and precipitation intensity (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.69). With respect to daily metrics, catchment-averaged precipitation estimates from citizen science data yielded the best model fit (GCV score = 0.20). All precipitation measurement and calculation methods successfully modelled the relationship between standardized mean water temperature and daily precipitation (P < 0.001). This research highlights the potential for the use of alternative precipitation datasets to enhance understanding of event-based variability in water quality studies. We conclude by recommending the use of spatially distributed precipitation data operating at high spatial (<1 km(2)) and temporal (<15 min) resolutions to improve the analysis of event-based water temperature and water quality studies.

TI Comment on "An integrated hydrologic Bayesian multimodel combination
   framework: Confronting input, parameter, and model structural
   uncertainty in hydrologic prediction'' by Newsha K. Ajami et al.
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Uncertainty in the rainfall inputs, which constitute a primary forcing of hydrological systems, considerably affects the calibration and predictive use of hydrological models. In a recent paper, Ajami et al. [2007] proposed the Integrated Bayesian Uncertainty Estimator (IBUNE) to quantify input, parameter and model uncertainties. This comment analyzes two interpretations of the IBUNE method and compares them to the Bayesian Total Error Analysis (BATEA) method [Kavetski et al., 2002, 2006a]. It is shown that BATEA and IBUNE are based on the same hierarchical conceptualization of the input uncertainty. However, in interpretation A of IBUNE, the likelihood function, and hence the posterior distribution, are random functions of the inferred variables, which violates a standard requirement for probability density functions (pdf). A synthetic study shows that IBUNE-A inferences are inconsistent with the correct parameter values and model predictions. In the second interpretation, IBUNE-B, it is shown that a specific implementation of IBUNE is equivalent to a special Metropolis-Hastings sampler for the full Bayesian posterior, directly including the rainfall multipliers as latent variables (but not necessarily storing their samples). Consequently, IBUNE-B does not reduce the dimensionality of the sampling problem. Moreover, the jump distribution for the latent variables embedded in IBUNE-B is computationally inefficient and leads to prohibitively slow convergence. Modifications of these jump rules can cause convergence to incorrect posterior distributions. The primary conclusion of this comment is that, unless the hydrological model and the structure of data uncertainty allow specialized treatment, Bayesian hierarchical models invariably lead to high-dimensional computational problems, whether working with the full posterior (high-dimensional sampling problem) or with the marginal posterior (high-dimensional integration problem each time the marginal posterior is evaluated).

AB The study quantifies the relationships at local scale between phenology and determinants of climate and soil water resources at two sites located along the latitudinal gradient of West Africa, one in the central Sahel (Mali), the other in the Sudanian bioclimatic zone (Benin). The aim is to improve our knowledge on possible vegetation response to possible climate change. Within the Sudanian site, average annual rainfall is 1200 mm, extending from April to October, while, in the Sahelian site, it is 370 mm, occurring from June to September. Physical data were collected from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis research programme. The phenology of the dominant species was monitored in four types of vegetation cover at the wetter site, and in three types of vegetation cover at the drier site. For each sampled plant, leafing, flowering and fruiting were recorded as binary variables in terms of the presence/absence of phenophases. A small proportion of the variability of each phenophase occurrence is explained by the logit models. However, rainfall rise is significantly linked to leafing probability increase in the Sahelian site but not in the Sudanian site. Day length extension and temperature decrease are significantly correlated with an increase in leafing in the Sudanian site, but not in the Sahelian. On both sites, the increase in cumulative rainfall is not found to be linked to an increased probability of reproductive phenophases (negative or non-significant relationships). Air temperature is positively correlated with flowering rate in the Sudanian site, but, all other factors being constant, no climate factors are found to be highly significant of flowering occurrence in the Sahel. Fruiting probability is positively correlated mainly with temperature within the Sahelian site. Leafing occurrence is positively correlated with soil moisture in the 0-1 m layer for the Sudanian site, but not for the Sahelian site. Significant relationships between fruiting occurrence and soil moisture may reflect a prior selection of plants on fruiting period that maximizes seed dispersion and germination differently at the two sites. While vegetative and reproduction schedules may be determined by specific genetic factors, the physical environment controls the possibility of their expression. Reduction of the rainfall amount and intensity may increase reproduction rates in wet areas. Although this factor should decrease leafing rate, it does not influence reproduction at dry sites, except through the decrease in air humidity. In wetter areas, increasing temperature may reduce leafing, but may increase reproduction rates. Cover reduction may have an impact on local physical factors and, consequently, probably also affects vegetation phenology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Difficulty in solving the transient advection-diffusion equation (ADE) stems from the relationship between the advection defivatives and the time derivative. For a solution method to be viable. it must account for this relationship by being accurate in both space and time. This research presents a unique method for solving the time-dependent ADE that does not discretize the derivative terms but rather solves the equation analytically in the space-time domain. The method is computationally efficient and numerically accurate and addresses the common limitations of numerical dispersion and spurious oscillations that can be prevalent in other solution methods. The method is based on the improved finite analytic (IFA) solution method [Lowry TS. Li S-G. A characteristic based finite analytic method for solving the two-dimensional steady-state advection-diffusion equation. Water Resour Res 38 (7)2 10.1029/ 2001WR000518] in space coupled with a Laplace transformation in time. In this way, the method has no Courant condition and maintains accuracy in space and time, performing well even at high Peclet numbers. The method is compared to a hybrid method of characteristics, a random walk particle tracking method, and an Eulerian-Lagrangrian Localized Adjoint Method using various degrees of flow-field heterogeneity across multiple Peclet numbers. Results show the IFALT method to be computationally more efficient while producing similar or better accuracy than the other methods. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB In conjunctive use management models, the surface and subsurface components must be simultaneously simulated because of the hydraulic interactions and to the combined operating rules inherent to such schemes. When many management alternatives have to be simulated over long time horizon or when optimizing complex large-scale systems, an efficient tool for surface water body-aquifer interaction simulation is needed. In this paper, we present a parsimonious conceptual model as an alternative approach to simulate aquifer storage and surface water body-aquifer interaction for linear aquifers (linear response of head to stresses). The formulation is deduced from a finite difference model preserving its approach of the geometry, boundary conditions, hydrodynamic parameters (heterogeneity), and spatial distribution of the stresses. It does not require any additional assumption. The solution, obtained using eigenvalue techniques, is formulated with an explicit state equation that is a function of time and does not need to be calculated in a sequential way (that is, time is not discretized). The structure of the solution finally deduced allows a simple conceptual interpretation of surface water body-aquifer interaction phenomenon as the drainage of a number of independent linear reservoirs. The parameters and initial conditions of each linear reservoir are mathematically defined in a univocal way from the original calibrated finite difference model preserving its characteristics. In most practical cases, an accurate solution can be obtained with a reduced number of linear reservoirs. Therefore this multireservoir conceptual definition enables an important reduction in the dimension of the model matrices and provides a straightforward means of incorporating the accuracy of more complex calibrated distributed-parameter numerical models for simulating surface water body-aquifer interaction within conjunctive use management models and with a minimum computational cost. Several case studies (synthetic and real world cases) are used to illustrate the applicability of the methodology.

AB The subject of environmental engineering is currently of great interest. Field experiments as well as numerical models have proven their worth in this research field. An introduction to hydrodynamic modelling, coupled to the modelling of vegetation biomass is described. The developed Strive (STream RIVer Ecosystem) model is set up in the Femme ('Flexible Environment for Mathematically Modelling the Environment') environment and has already proven its worth in a large number of calculations (De Doncker et al., 2006, 2008b). Discharges and water levels are modelled together with modelling of electrical conductivity (EC). Extensive measurement campaigns are carried out to collect a large number of observations and calibration of the model is based on this data set. Furthermore, calibration methods and the discussion of this process are displayed. As a result, it is seen that the developed Strive model can model both, hydrodynamic and ecological processes, in an accurate way. The work highlights the importance of detailed determination of Manning's coefficient, dependent on discharge and amount of biomass, as an important calibration parameter for accurate modelling.

AB The heterogeneity of field scale soils poses a challenge to predictive large scale flow and transport modeling. The theory of effective macroscale parameters holds good and is applicable in dealing with such problems. But the validity of the analytic stochastic solutions obtained for randomly heterogeneous soils is debatable, as the test cases under which they are validated are of limited scope due to linearization and perturbation approximations. In this study, samples of heterogeneous soils are generated using sets of spatially correlated random field parameters that are either geometrically isotropic, or else, geometrically anisotropic with either horizontal or vertical stratification (perfect or imperfect). Several combinations of ratios of correlation length and capillary dispersion lengths are considered. Numerical simulations of unsaturated flow are performed on each randomly heterogeneous soil sample. The principal components (K) over cap (ii)(Psi) of the macroscale effective unsaturated conductivity are then obtained as a function of the mean suction Psi of the sample. They are compared to stochastic spectral perturbation theory, and to a probabilistic semi-empirical Power Average Model (PAM). They are also compared with arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean conductivity-suction curves. The numerically upscaled principal conductivity curves match quite well the PAM, better than the classical means (Arithmetic, Geometric, Harmonic), and also somewhat better than the curves obtained from stochastic spectral perturbation theory. It is observed that the upscaled principal components K-ii(psi), obtained numerically and with the PAM along directions "i" orthogonal/parallel to perfect stratification coincide with the harmonic/arithmetic mean curves at low suctions (i.e., near saturation), but deviate from it and come closer to the geometric mean at higher suctions. The PAM appears suitable for generation of approximate upscaled conductivity curves, e.g., for obtaining the mesh-scale or block-scale conductivity curves in large scale simulation codes. Transient solute transport simulations are then performed on the detailed random velocity fields obtained from the steady state simulations of unsaturated flow in the randomly heterogeneous soil samples. Snapshots of solute concentration C(x,z,t) are taken at different times. The temporal evolution of spatial moments of concentration is analyzed in order to characterize the macroscale advection and dispersion of the unsaturated concentration plume, and in particular, its macro-dispersion coefficient (D) and dispersivity length scale (A). For the synthetic soil samples considered in this study, the macro-dispersive spreading of the solute is stronger for flow parallel to vertical stratification, compared to flow perpendicular to horizontal stratification, and also, compared to flow in statistically isotropic non-stratified soil.

AB This paper examines the ground subsidence caused by the uniform extraction of fluids from a disc-shaped region located within a poroelastic halfspace. Biot's theory of poroelasticity is used to examine the problem. The fluid extraction over the circular region at the interior of the poroelastic domain induces time-dependent axisymmetric surface settlements. The theoretical results are also used to examine the accuracy of a multi-physics computational scheme that can be used to examine more complex geological settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work the process of coarse-graining in complex subsurface hydrologic systems is discussed, with a particular effort made to examine the difference between the mathematical process of averaging as distinct from the process of upscaling. It is possible to show that the process of averaging itself is not sufficient to reduce the number of degrees of freedom required to describe a complex heterogeneous system. The reduction of the number of degrees of freedom is accomplished entirely by the subsequent scaling laws that one assumes are valid filters for eliminating redundant (or low value) information in the system. A specific example is given for the upscaling of the effective dispersion tensor in a randomly heterogeneous porous medium. It is shown that: (1) generally, an averaged description can be developed, but the system does not contain any less information than the original problem; (2) by adopting a number of scaling laws, a nonlocal in time and in space formulation can be obtained that is identical to results obtained previously, and (3) by making one additional assumption, a local macroscale transport equation can be obtained.

AB We have previously presented evidence that higher rates of evapotranspiration (ET) associated with irrigation in the U.S. High Plains has likely caused an increased downwind precipitation (P). July P over the Midwest increased by 20%-30% from the preirrigation period (1900-1950) to the postirrigation (1950-2000) period. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the increased July P has had hydrologic consequences, possibly increasing groundwater storage and streamflow. Seasonal analyses of hydrologic variables over Illinois suggest that the water table and streamflow response lags P - ET by 1-2 months, indicating August and September as the months when the increased July P may be detected. We analyzed long-term observations of water table depth at 10 wells in Illinois and streamflow at 46 gauges in Illinois-Ohio basins. The Mann-Kendal test for trends suggests field significant increases in groundwater storage and streamflow in August-September over the period of irrigation expansion. Examination of soil moisture response to present-day above-normal July P suggests that the increased July P can reach the water table in normal to wet years. Mann-Kendall tests suggest that there has been no change in pan evaporation and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. This implies that soil water availability is the driver of changes in ET, and the increased P may have possibly increased ET. Other studies in the literature give further evidence of increased ET due to increased P. By ruling out a reduction in ET, we suggest that the observed increase in groundwater storage and streamflow in the Midwest is linked to the increased July precipitation attributed to High Plains irrigation. We note that the increases in late summer streamflow are rather small when placed in the context of seasonal dynamics, but they are conceptually important in that they point to a different cause of change.

AB Understanding relationships between stream chemistry and watershed factors: land use/land cover, climate, and lithology are crucial to improving our knowledge of critical zone processes that influence water quality. We compiled major ion data from >100 monitoring stations collected over 60 years (1958-2018) across the Colorado River Watershed in Texas (103,000 km(2)). We paired this river chemistry data with complementary lithology, land use, climate, and stream discharge information. Machine learning techniques were used to produce new insights on controls of stream water chemical behavior, which were validated using traditional multivariate analyses. Studies on stream flow and chemistry in the American west and globally have shown strong relationships between major ion chemical composition, climate, and lithology which hold true for the Colorado River basin in this study. Reactive minerals, including carbonates and evaporites, dominate major ion chemistry across the upper, low-precipitation regions of the watershed. Upstream and middle reaches of the Colorado River showed shifts from Na-Cl-SO4 dominated water from multiple sources including dissolution of gypsum and halite in shallow groundwater, and agricultural activities, to Ca-HCO3 water types controlled by carbonate dissolution. In the lower portion of the watershed multiple analyses demonstrate that stream chemistry is more influenced by greater precipitation and the presence of silicate minerals than the middle and upstream reaches. This study demonstrates the power of applying machine learning approaches to publicly available long term water chemistry data sets to improve the understanding of watershed interactions with surficial lithology, salinity sources, and anthropogenic influences of water quality.

AB Approximating the three-dimensional structure of a fault network at depth in the subsurface is key for robust estimates of fluid flow. However, only observations of two-dimensional outcrops are often available. To shed light on the relationship between two- and three-dimensional measurements of fracture networks, we examine data from a unique set of 11 X-ray synchrotron triaxial compression experiments that reveal the evolving three-dimensional fracture network throughout loading. Using machine learning, we derive relationships between the two- and three-dimensional measurements of three properties that control fluid flow: the porosity, and volume and tortuosity of the largest fracture at a particular differential stress step. The models predict the porosity and volume of the largest fracture with R-2 scores of >0.99, but predict the tortuosity with maximum R-2 scores of 0.68. To test the assumption that different rock types may require different equations between the two- and three-dimensional properties, we develop models for both individual rock types (granite, monzonite, marble, sandstone) and all of the experiments. Models developed using all of the experiments perform better than models developed for individual rock types, suggesting fundamental similarities between fracture networks in rocks often analyzed separately. Models developed with several parallel two-dimensional observations perform similarly to models developed with several perpendicular two-dimensional observations. When the models are developed with statistics of the two-dimensional observations, the models primarily depend on the mean and median when they predict the porosity, and minimum when they predict the volume and tortuosity.

AB Vegetation change can significantly alter evapotranspiration (ET), an important component of the terrestrial water balance, and consequently influences other hydrological processes. With no direct measurement techniques available at large spatial scales, the accurate estimation of ET under changing forest landscapes and climate is challenging. In this study, we used an improved method based on Fuh's equation (a functional form of the Budyko framework) to investigate ET responses to cumulative forest disturbance and climate in the snow-dominated interior of British Columbia, Canada. First, we divided the study region into three distinct climate groups, and then related the watershed parameter m in Fuh's equation to vegetation change (represented by cumulative equivalent clearcut area (CECA)) and watershed properties, with independent calibration and validation watersheds. The validated relationships were used to examine regional ET variations (similar to 380,000 km(2)). Our results showed that ET in moderate climates had the highest sensitivity to CECA, characterized by wetness index between 1 and 2 (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). ET in dry climates (wetness index <1) was also significantly related to CECA, but with reduced sensitivity compared to the moderate climates. Wetter climates (wetness index >2) did not show a significant relationship with CECA, suggesting an insensitivity of ET to forest change. Simulations under future climate and vegetation disturbance scenarios demonstrated that ET would be further decreased in most of the study region. Forest management should consider reducing disturbance in the dry to moderate climate areas to mitigate negative impacts on hydrological processes and functions.

AB The earlier formulation based on surface renewal (SR) analysis for estimating the sensible (or buoyant) heat flux (H) of a surface without requiring calibration involved canopy parameters to simultaneously estimate H and the friction velocity (u*). A SR- based formulation is derived that allows estimating u* and subsequently H that, at most, involves the zero- plane displacement. Regardless of the measurement height above the canopy and the stability case, u* and H estimates were closed to values measured using the eddy covariance method for either homogeneous or sparse (orchards) canopies. The proposed SR analysis can be potentially considered for gap filling in half- hourly eddy covariance series of u* and H and to estimate parameters useful for land surface modeling, such as the roughness length for momentum, the roughness lengths for momentum, and heat and the turbulent Prandtl number.

AB Approaches to modeling the continuous hydrologic response of ungauged basins use observable physical characteristics of watersheds to either directly infer values for the parameters of hydrologic models, or to establish regression relationships between watershed structure and model parameters. Both these approaches still have widely discussed limitations, including impacts of model structural uncertainty. In this paper we introduce an alternative, model independent, approach to streamflow prediction in ungauged basins based on empirical evidence of relationships between watershed structure, climate and watershed response behavior. Instead of directly estimating values for model parameters, different hydrologic response behaviors of the watershed, quantified through model independent streamflow indices, are estimated and subsequently regionalized in an uncertainty framework. This results in expected ranges of streamflow indices in ungauged watersheds. A pilot study using 30 UK watersheds shows how this regionalized information can be used to constrain ensemble predictions of any model at ungauged sites. Dominant controlling characteristics were found to be climate (wetness index), watershed topography (slope), and hydrogeology. Main streamflow indices were high pulse count, runoff ratio, and the slope of the flow duration curve. This new approach provided sharp and reliable predictions of continuous streamflow at the ungauged sites tested. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently developed stochastic macro-dispersion models enable computationally inexpensive flow and transport predictions for highly heterogeneous formations with statistically non-stationary conductivity and flow statistics. So far, the random processes at the heart of these models have been calibrated numerically based on velocity statistics from Monte Carlo simulation studies. In this work, we provide a more rigorous foundation to some of these models by analytically relating the process definition to given velocity statistics from classical first-order perturbation expansions.

AB The strengths and weaknesses of different statistical methodologies for attributing changes in streamflow to land cover are still poorly understood. We examine the relationships between high (Q(99)), mean (Q(mean)), and low (Q(01)) streamflow and urbanization or tree cover change in 729 catchments in the United States between 1992 and 2018. We apply two statistical modeling approaches and compare their performance. Panel regression models estimate the average effect of land cover changes on streamflow across all sites, and show that on average, a 1%-point increase in catchment urban area results in a small (0.6%-0.7%), but highly significant increase in mean and high flows. Meanwhile, a 1%-point increase in tree cover does not correspond to strongly significant changes in flow. We also fit a generalized linear model to each individual site, which results in highly varied model coefficients. The medians of the single-site coefficients show no significant relationships between either urbanization or tree cover change and any streamflow quantile (although at individual sites, the coefficients may be statistically significant and positive or negative). On the other hand, the GLM coefficients may provide greater nuance in catchments with specific attributes. This variation is not well represented through the panel model estimates of average effect, unless moderators are carefully considered. We highlight the value of statistical approaches for large-sample attribution of hydrological change, while cautioning that considerable variability exists.

AB This study aims to experimentally investigate the possibility of combining two extended continuum theories for two-phase flow. One of these theories considers interfacial area as a separate state variable, and the other explicitly discriminates between connected and disconnected phases. This combination enhances our potential to effectively model the apparent hysteresis, which generally dominates two-phase flow. Using optical microscopy, we perform microfluidic experiments in quasi-2D artificial porous media for various cyclic displacement processes and boundary conditions. Specifically for a number of sequential drainage processes, with detailed image (post-)processing, pore-scale parameters such as the interfacial area between the phases (wetting, non-wetting, and solid), and local capillary pressure, as well as macroscopic parameters like saturation, are estimated. We show that discriminating between connected and disconnected clusters and the concept of the interfacial area as a separate state variable can be an appropriate way of modeling hysteresis in a two-phase flow scheme. The drainage datasets of capillary pressure, saturation, and specific interfacial area, are plotted as a surface, given by f (P-c, s(w), a(wn)) = 0. These surfaces accommodate all data points within a reasonable experimental error, irrespective of the boundary conditions, as long as the corresponding liquid is connected to its inlet. However, this concept also shows signs of reduced efficiency as a modeling approach in datasets gathered through combining experiments with higher volumetric fluxes. We attribute this observation to the effect of the porous medium geometry on the phase distribution. This yields further elaboration, in which this speculation is thoroughly studied and analyzed.

AB Fluid mixing in permeable media is essential in many practical applications. The mixing process is a consequence of velocity fluctuations owing to geological heterogeneities and mobility contrast of fluids. Heterogeneities in natural rocks are often spatially correlated, and their properties, such as permeability, may be described using fractal distributions. This work models the fractal characteristics of such permeability fields in which the covariance function is expressed as a power-law function. A generalized scaling relation is derived relating various fractal permeability fields using the magnitude of their fluctuations. This relation reveals the self-similar behavior of two-phase flow in such permeable media. To that end, a recently developed, high-resolution numerical simulator is employed to validate the analytically derived scaling relations. Two flow problems are considered in which flow is governed by (1) a linear and (2) a nonlinear transport equation. Due to the probabilistic representation of the fractal permeability fields, a sensitivity study is conducted for each flow scenario to determine the number of realizations required for statistical convergence. Scaling analysis is performed using ensemble averages of simulated saturation profiles and their mixing lengths. Results support the validity of the developed scaling relation across the range of investigated flow conditions at intermediate times. The dynamics of linear flow in the asymptotic regime is affected by the correlation structure of heterogeneity. In nonlinear flow, scaling behavior appears to be dominated by the degree of nonlinearity.

TI Critical evaluation of parameter consistency and predictive uncertainty
   in hydrological modeling: A case study using Bayesian total error
   analysis
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CALIBRATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB The lack of a robust framework for quantifying the parametric and predictive uncertainty of conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) models remains a key challenge in hydrology. The Bayesian total error analysis (BATEA) methodology provides a comprehensive framework to hypothesize, infer, and evaluate probability models describing input, output, and model structural error. This paper assesses the ability of BATEA and standard calibration approaches (standard least squares (SLS) and weighted least squares (WLS)) to address two key requirements of uncertainty assessment: (1) reliable quantification of predictive uncertainty and (2) reliable estimation of parameter uncertainty. The case study presents a challenging calibration of the lumped GR4J model to a catchment with ephemeral responses and large rainfall gradients. Postcalibration diagnostics, including checks of predictive distributions using quantile-quantile analysis, suggest that while still far from perfect, BATEA satisfied its assumed probability models better than SLS and WLS. In addition, WLS/SLS parameter estimates were highly dependent on the selected rain gauge and calibration period. This will obscure potential relationships between CRR parameters and catchment attributes and prevent the development of meaningful regional relationships. Conversely, BATEA provided consistent, albeit more uncertain, parameter estimates and thus overcomes one of the obstacles to parameter regionalization. However, significant departures from the calibration assumptions remained even in BATEA, e. g., systematic overestimation of predictive uncertainty, especially in validation. This is likely due to the inferred rainfall errors compensating for simplified treatment of model structural error.

AB This work presents an efficient mathematical/numerical model to compute the sensitivity coefficients of a predefined performance measure to model parameters for one-dimensional steady-state sequentially coupled radionuclide transport in a finite heterogeneous porous medium. The model is based on the adjoint sensitivity approach that offers an elegant and computationally efficient alternative way to compute the sensitivity coefficients. The transport parameters include the radionuclide retardation factors due to sorption, the Darcy velocity, and the effective diffusion/dispersion coefficients. Both continuous and discrete adjoint approaches are considered. The partial differential equations associated with the adjoint system are derived based on the adjoint state theory for coupled problems. Physical interpretations of the adjoint states are given in analogy to results obtained in the theory of groundwater flow. For the homogeneous case, analytical solutions for primary and adjoint systems are derived and presented in closed forms. Numerically calculated solutions are compared to the analytical results and show excellent agreements. Insights from sensitivity analysis are discussed to get a better understanding of the values of sensitivity coefficients. The sensitivity coefficients are also computed numerically by finite differences. The numerical sensitivity coefficients successfully reproduce the analytically derived sensitivities based on adjoint states. A derivative-based global sensitivity method coupled with the adjoint state method is presented and applied to a real field case represented by a site currently being considered for underground nuclear storage in Northern Switzerland, "Zurich Nordost", to demonstrate the proposed method. The results show the advantage of the adjoint state method compared to other methods in term of computational effort.

Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is used in conjunction with a theoretical scalar roughness length for bluff rough surfaces in the formulation of the drying power of air. The robustness of the model is evaluated with lysimeter measurements of wet bare soil evaporation for a range of atmospheric conditions, Instances where radiation or local advection dominated were measured and modeled. Good agreement (r2 = 0.96) was obtained overall between the Penman-Brutsaert derived evaporation rates and values measured by the lysimeters.

AB Groundwater evapotranspiration (ETg) links various ecohydrological processes and is an important component in regional water budgets. In this study, an extensive monitoring network was established in a semiarid riparian area to investigate various controls on the spatiotemporal pattern of water table fluctuations (WTFs) and ETg induced by riparian vegetation. Along a vegetation gradient (approximate to 1200 m), diurnal WTFs were observed during a growing season in areas covered by woody species (Populus sect. Aigeiros and Juniperus virginiana) and wet slough vegetation (Panicum virgatum and Bromus inermis) with deeper root systems; whereas, no diurnal WTFs were found in the middle section with shallower-rooted grasses (Poa pratensis and Carex sp.). The occurrence of diurnal WTFs was related to temperature-controlled plant phenology at seasonal scales and to radiation at subdaily scales. Daily ETg in the mid-growing season was calculated using the White method. The results revealed that depth to water table (DTWT) was the dominant control on ETg, followed by potential evapotranspiration (ETp). By combining the effects of DTWT and ETp, it was found that at shallower depths, ETg was more responsive to changes in ETp, due to the closer linkage of land surface processes with shallower groundwater. Finally, exponential relationships between ETg/ETp and DTWT were obtained at the study site, although those relationships varied considerably across the sites. This study demonstrates the complex interactions of WTFs and ETg with surrounding environmental variables and provides further insight into modeling ETg over different time scales and riparian vegetation.

AB The modeling and prediction of heat transfer in fractured media is particularly challenging as hydraulic and transport properties depend on a multiscale structure that is difficult to resolve. In addition to advection and dispersion, heat transfer is also impacted by thermal attenuation and lag time, which results from fracture-matrix thermal exchanges. Here we derive analytical expressions for thermal lag time and attenuation coefficient in fractured media, which quantify the effect of fracture geometry on these key factors. We use the developed expressions to interpret the results of single-well thermal and solute tracer tests performed in a crystalline rock aquifer at the experimental site of Ploemeur (H+ observatory network). Thermal breakthrough was monitored with fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS), which allows temperature monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution. The observed thermal response departs from the conventional parallel plate fracture model but is consistent with a channel model representing highly channelized fracture flow. These findings, which point to a strong reduction of fracture-matrix exchange by flow channeling, show the impact of fracture geometry on heat recovery in geothermal systems. This study also highlights the advantages to conduct both thermal and solute tracer tests to infer fracture aperture and geometry.

AB The role of groundwater in sustaining plant transpiration constitutes an important but not well-understood aspect of the interactions between groundwater, vegetation, the land surface, and the atmosphere. The effect of the hydraulic redistribution (HR) process by plant roots on the interplay between plant transpiration and groundwater dynamics under water-limited climates is investigated by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity Plus (VIC+) land surface model. Numerical experiments, with or without explicitly considering HR, are conducted on soil columns over a range of groundwater table depths (GWTDs) under different vegetative land covers, soil types, and precipitation conditions. When HR is not included, this study obtains transpiration-GWTD relationships consistent with those from watershed studies that do not include HR. When HR is included, the transpiration-GWTD relationships are modified. The modification introduced by HR is manifested in the soil moisture of the root zone. The mechanism of HR is explained by detailing the roles of the hydraulically redistributed water, the upward diffusion of soil water, and the daytime root uptake. We have found that HR is particularly important in water-limited climates under which plants have high transpiration demand. At the beginning stage of a dry period, HR modulates the severe impacts that climate has on plant transpiration. Only after a prolonged dry period, impacts of HR are lessened when the groundwater table drops below the depth of water uptake by roots and are diminished when plant transpiration is decoupled from groundwater dynamics.

AB Watershed Best Management Practices (BMPs) are often designed to reduce loading from particle-borne contaminants, but the temporal lag between BMP implementation and improvement in receiving water quality is difficult to assess because particles are only moved downstream episodically, resting for long periods in storage between transport events. A theory is developed that describes the downstream movement of suspended sediment particles accounting for the time particles spend in storage given sediment budget data (by grain size fraction) and information on particle transit times through storage reservoirs. The theory is used to define a suspended sediment transport length scale that describes how far particles are carried during transport events, and to estimate a downstream particle velocity that includes time spent in storage. At 5 upland watersheds of the mid-Atlantic region, transport length scales for silt-clay range from 4 to 60 km, while those for sand range from 0.4 to 113 km. Mean sediment velocities for silt-clay range from 0.0072 km/yr to 0.12 km/yr, while those for sand range from 0.0008 km/yr to 0.20 km/yr, 4-6 orders of magnitude slower than the velocity of water in the channel. These results suggest lag times of 100-1000 years between BMP implementation and effectiveness in receiving waters such as the Chesapeake Bay (where BMPs are located upstream of the characteristic transport length scale). Many particles likely travel much faster than these average values, so further research is needed to determine the complete distribution of suspended sediment velocities in real watersheds.

AB This paper introduces the sediment bed passive flux meter (SBPFM) as a new tool for in situ measurements of vertical volumetric water and contaminant mass fluxes across hyporheic and hypolentic zones (i.e., stream or lake bed sediments that function as the contiguous zone between the overlying surface water body and the underlying aquifer). The device is a direct-push probe which contains a permeable internal sorbent located between two screened intervals. In the presence of a vertical hydraulic gradient the screens allow water flow through the SBPFM's internal sorbent matrix that is impregnated with resident tracers. These tracers are displaced from the sorbent at rates proportional to the water flux through the sorbent. At the same time, dissolved contaminants present in the intercepted sediment water are retained on the SBPFM sorbent at rates proportional to the ambient contaminant mass flux in the hyporheic zone. Potential flow theory is applied to convert observations of water and contaminant fluxes through the SBPFM into estimates of undisturbed ambient vertical water and contaminant fluxes in the sediment. To validate the theory and demonstrate the SBPFM as a potential site characterization tool, multiple bench-scale sediment bed experiments are performed. Results demonstrate that water and contaminant mass fluxes are accurately measured in the laboratory and that future field tests are warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transport processes and pathways through many hydrodynamic systems vary over time, often driven by variations in total water storage. This paper develops a very general approach to modeling unsteady transport through an arbitrary control volume (such as a watershed) that accounts for temporal variability in the underlying transport dynamics. Controls on the selection of discharge from stored water are encapsulated in probability distributions Q(ST,t) of age-ranked storage S-T (the volume of water in storage ranked from youngest to oldest). This framework is applied to a long-term record of rainfall and streamflow chloride in a small, humid watershed at Plynlimon, UK. While a time-invariant gamma distribution for (Q) produced a good fit to data, the fit was significantly improved when the distribution was allowed to vary with catchment storage. However, the variation was inverse to that of a well-mixed system where storage has a pure dilution effect. Discharge at high storage was predicted to contain a larger fraction of recent event water than at low storage. The effective volume of storage involved in transport was 3411 mm at mean catchment wetness, but declined by 71 mm per 1 mm of additional catchment storage, while the fraction of event water in discharge increased by 1.4%. This inverse storage effect is sufficient to reproduce the observed long-memory 1/f fractal spectral structure of stream chloride. Metrics quantifying the strength and direction of storage effects are proposed as useful signatures, and point toward a unified framework for observing and modeling coupled watershed flow and transport.

AB Northern China has been facing severe water scarcity as a result of vigorous economic growth, population expansion and changing lifestyles. A typical case is Shandong province whose water resources per capita is approximately only a sixth of the national average and a twentieth of the global average. It is useful to assess the implications of the province's growth and trade patterns for water use and water conservation strategies. This study quantitatively analyses relationships between regional economic sectors and water use in Shandong using an input-output model for virtual water resources. The changes in key indicators for 1997-2007 are tracked and the effects of water-saving policies on these changes are examined. The results highlight the benefits of applying a virtual water trade analysis on a water-scarce region where water resources exhibit highly heterogeneous temporal and geographical distributions. The net export of virtual water in Shandong was initially large, but this declined over the years and the province has recently become a net importer. Between 1997 and 2002, water use in most sectors increased due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Since then, water use in all Shandong economic sectors exhibit a downward trend despite continued increases in goods and services net exports, a trend which can be attributed to the vigorous implementation of water-saving policies and measures, especially water use quotas. Economic sectors consume water directly and indirectly and understanding the pattern of virtual water trade implied by sectoral relationships is important for managing water scarcity problems. This study fills the knowledge gap in the existing literature created by the lack of case studies that dynamically assess virtual water trade and analyse the effects of water-saving policies and measures. The study draws policy recommendations that are relevant for future water planning in Shandong and other regions in northern China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The threshold stress for bed sediment transport exerts a primary control on the geometry and stability of coarse-grained rivers (diameter >= 5 mm). Understanding how riverbed mobility couples to channel form is a key mechanistic link for predicting river response to external perturbations such as land use practices and changing climate. Unfortunately, determination of a representative threshold stress is notoriously difficult in the field. Empirical studies have observed that the critical dimensionless shear (Shields) stress (tau(*c)) is correlated with channel slope, a property that is substantially easier to estimate. Mechanistic models have been developed to explain the observed correlation; however, limited field data preclude the widespread application of these models. For practical reasons, the empirical regressions between slope and tau(*c) are utilized as predictive models. Through a large compilation of field data, we demonstrate that there are two significant problems with using the empirical regressions: (1) they are based on a partial sampling of the observed parameter space of coarse-grained rivers, and (2) they do not capture the covariation between the bankfull Shields stress (tau(*bf)) and tau(*c). These regressions provide spurious predictions for the bankfull transport capacity (tau(*bf)/tau(*c)) of gravel-bed rivers. When site-specific empirical measurements of tau(*c) are made, coarse-grained rivers exhibit a remarkably constant transport capacity that is in close agreement with equilibrium channel theory (tau(*bf) = 1.2 tau(*c)). From these data we advocate that, in the absence of measurements, tau(*c) can be reasonably estimated from the tau(*bf) using equilibrium channel theory.

AB This study presents an analysis of up to 30years of hydrological variables and selected water quality parameters (pH, SO4, Fe, Cu, and As) in the upper area of the Elqui River basin in North-Central Chile. A correlation analysis determined statistically significant positive relationship for SO4-Cu, Fe-As, and Fe-Cu. In terms of historical behaviour, no statistically significant trends were detected for precipitation or temperature. In contrast, for flow, there is an overall decreasing pattern for the entire area of study, although only in one case this trend was statistically significant. Along with the aforementioned analysis, a characterization of the flow-water quality relationships is considered for the time period analyzed. Although erratic behaviours were confirmed, a negative (i.e., inverse) flow-concentration relationship was identified for SO4, a positive (i.e., direct) relationship for Fe, and undefined relationships for As and Cu were obtained. From these analyses and based on previous studies on projections regarding climate change for the Andean region, and in particular for the upper Elqui zone, an estimation of the possible effects of the change in water regimes on water quality in the area of study is developed. It is likely that a decrease in surface flow, as a consequence of climate change could translate into improvements in water quality in terms of Fe and eventually As and Cu, but into an impairment in the case of SO4. In any case, this is a complex situation that demands special attention in the face of industrial activities that could be developed in tributaries like the Claro River, which currently play an important role in depurating or diluting contaminants in the waters of the Elqui River. Finally, it should be noted that this study addresses an issue that goes beyond the local interest and could be used as a reference to compare other transitional environments containing sulphide ores or areas of hydrothermal alterations, which are considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change and variability.

AB Time-lapse applications of electrical methods have grown significantly over the last decade. However, the quantitative interpretation of tomograms in terms of physical properties, such as salinity, temperature or saturation, remains difficult. In many applications, geophysical models are transformed into hydrological models, but this transformation suffers from spatially and temporally varying resolution resulting from the regularization used by the deterministic inversion. In this study, we investigate a prediction-focused approach (PFA) to directly estimate subsurface physical properties with electrical resistance data, circumventing the need for classic tomographic inversions. First, we generate a prior set of resistance data and physical property forecast through hydrogeological and geophysical simulations mimicking the field experiment. We reduce the dimension of both the data and the forecast through principal component analysis in order to keep the most informative part of both sets in a reduced dimension space. Then, we apply canonical correlation analysis to explore the relationship between the data and the forecast in their reduced dimension space. If a linear relationship can be established, the posterior distribution of the forecast can be directly sampled using a Gaussian process regression where the field data scores are the conditioning data. In this paper, we demonstrate PFA for various physical property distributions. We also develop a framework to propagate the estimated noise level in the reduced dimension space. We validate the results by a Monte Carlo study on the posterior distribution and demonstrate that PFA yields accurate uncertainty for the cases studied.

AB Benchmarking the quality of river discharge data and understanding its information content for hydrological analyses is an important task for hydrologic science. There is a wide variety of techniques to assess discharge uncertainty. However, few studies have developed generalized approaches to quantify discharge uncertainty. This study presents a generalized framework for estimating discharge uncertainty at many gauging stations with different errors in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology utilizes a nonparametric LOWESS regression within a novel framework that accounts for uncertainty in the stage-discharge measurements, scatter in the stage-discharge data and multisection rating curves. The framework was applied to 500 gauging stations in England and Wales and we evaluated the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at low, mean and high flow points on the rating curve. The framework was shown to be robust, versatile and able to capture place-specific uncertainties for a number of different examples. Our study revealed a wide range of discharge uncertainties (10-397% discharge uncertainty interval widths), but the majority of the gauging stations (over 80%) had mean and high flow uncertainty intervals of less than 40%. We identified some regional differences in the stage-discharge relationships, however the results show that local conditions dominated in determining the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at a gauging station. This highlights the importance of estimating discharge uncertainty for each gauging station prior to using those data in hydrological analyses.

TI An assessment of the effect of horizontal soil moisture heterogeneity on

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE hydrogeophysics; near surface; intermediate-scale measurements
AB The cosmic-ray neutron probe measures soil moisture over tens of hectares, thus averaging spatially variable soil moisture fields. A previous paper described how variable soil moisture profiles affect the integrated cosmic-ray neutron signal from which depth-average soil moisture is computed. Here, we investigate the effect of horizontal heterogeneity on the relationship between neutron counts and average soil moisture. Observations from a distributed sensor network at a site in southern Arizona indicate that the horizontal component of the total variance of the soil moisture field is less variably in time than the vertical component. Using results from neutron particle transport simulations we show that 1-D binary distributions of soil moisture may affect both the mean and variance of neutron counts of a cosmic-ray neutron detector placed arbitrarily in a soil moisture field, potentially giving rise to an underestimate of the footprint average soil moisture. Similar simulations that used 1-D and 2-D Gaussian soil moisture fields indicate consistent mean and variances of a randomly placed detector if the correlation length scales are short (less than approximate to 30 m) and/or the soil moisture field variance is small (<0.032 m(6) m(-6)). Taken together, these soil moisture observations and neutron transport simulations show that horizontal heterogeneity likely has a small effect on the relationship between mean neutron counts and average soil moisture for soils under natural conditions.

TI On the basin-scale detection and attribution of human-induced climate
   change in monsoon precipitation and streamflow
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID RAINFALL; MODELS; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; ORISSA
AB Detecting and quantifying the presence of human-induced climate change in regional hydrology is important for studying the impacts of such changes on the water resources systems as well as for reliable future projections and policy making for adaptation. In this article a formal fingerprint-based detection and attribution analysis has been attempted to study the changes in the observed monsoon precipitation and streamflow in the rain-fed Mahanadi River Basin in India, considering the variability across different climate models. This is achieved through the use of observations, several climate model runs, a principal component analysis and regression based statistical downscaling technique, and a Genetic Programming based rainfall-runoff model. It is found that the decreases in observed hydrological variables across the second half of the 20th century lie outside the range that is expected from natural internal variability of climate alone at 95% statistical confidence level, for most of the climate models considered. For several climate models, such changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. However, unequivocal attribution to human-induced climate change cannot be claimed across all the climate models and uncertainties in our detection procedure, arising out of various sources including the use of models, cannot be ruled out. Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic activities are considered as other plausible natural external causes of climate change. Time evolution of the anthropogenic climate change "signal'' in the hydrological observations, above the natural internal climate variability "noise'' shows that the detection of the signal is achieved earlier in streamflow as compared to precipitation for most of the climate models, suggesting larger impacts of human-induced climate change on streamflow than precipitation at the river basin scale.

AB We examined physiological parameter tradeoffs in modeling stomatal control of transpiration from a number of forest species. Measurements of sapflux, micrometeorology, and leaf area index were made in stands representing 85% of the forest ecosystems around the WLEF eddy flux tower in northern Wisconsin. A Jarvis-based canopy conductance model was used to simulate canopy transpiration (E-C) for five tree species from these stands. They consisted of conifers and deciduous species in both upland and wetland locations. Parameter estimation was used to assess the tradeoffs between physiological parameters used in the calculation of stomatal conductance. These tradeoffs were then evaluated against current theory on stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The results show that the best simulations of E-C were obtained with values of maximum stomatal conductance (g(Smax)) and stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit (delta) that closely followed this hydraulic theory. The model predictions reveal a large variation in the strategies used to regulate water potential among species. Aspen showed the greatest tendency towards efficiency, indicating that it has high E-C under low vapor pressure deficit (D) conditions, but is susceptible to rapid E-C decline at moderate to high D. Other species showed more conservative water use. The results indicate that inter-specific differences in dynamic response to D can produce large spatial variation in E-C under typical environmental conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Cost-effective control of nitrogen loadings in long island sound
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID POLLUTION CONTROL; NONPOINT
AB Long Island Sound is plagued by conditions of severe hypoxia (low levels of dissolved oxygen) during the summer months because of the existence of excessive amounts of nitrogen. A new proposal that would allow sewage treatment plants to buy or sell nitrogen discharge credits is currently being evaluated by the states of Connecticut and New York. Existing theory suggests that a trading program for nitrogen emissions would be a cost-effective means of addressing the problem. We estimate the costs associated with several trading scenarios and find that the potential for cost savings is substantial and that cost savings rise as the scope of trading expands.

TI Catchments as simple dynamical systems: A case study on methods and data
   requirements for parameter identification
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; CALIBRATION
AB In many rainfall-runoff models, at least some calibration of model parameters has to take place. Especially for ungauged or poorly gauged basins this can be problematic, because there is little or no data available for calibration. A possible solution to overcome the problems caused by data scarcity is to set up a measurement campaign for a limited time period. In this study, we determine the minimum amount of data required to determine robust parameter values for a simple model with two parameters. The model is constructed such that the parameters can be determined not only with automatic calibration, but also by recession analysis and a priori from Boussinesq theory. The model has been applied to a research catchment in Switzerland. For automatic calibration and recession analysis, one season ( 5 months) is found to be sufficient to give robust parameters for simulation of high flows over the full observation period. For automatic calibration, this should be the season with the highest precipitation, for recession analysis the season with least evapotranspiration. The Boussinesq equation is able to give good parameter estimates for modeling high flows, but detailed in situ knowledge of the catchment is required. Automatic calibration outperforms recession analysis and Boussinesq theory by far when it comes to parameter estimation with a focus on prediction of low flows. It was shown that a single set of parameters cannot simultaneously describe high and low flows with a reasonable accuracy, suggesting that more than two parameters are needed to characterize subsurface properties.

AB Streaming potential is a passive hydrogeophysical method that can be used to monitor water flow in porous media. However, a quantitative use of this method requires a good understanding of the streaming potential generation in water saturated porous media. In this work, we used the Critical Path Analysis (CPA) method to propose a new model to estimate the streaming potential coupling coefficient (SPCC) in porous media. By comparing the proposed model with 109 experimental data points for both unconsolidated samples such as uniform glass bead and sand packs and consolidated samples such as sandstones, carbonates and with 36 simulated data points, we demonstrated that the CPA is applicable to model the SPCC for porous media with both narrow and broad pore size distributions. Additionally, from the obtained result for the uniform grain packings, we found the r(c)-d relationship between the critical pore radius r(c )and grain diameter d that was validated by using 70 experimental data points available in literature. The obtained r(c)-d relationship may be helpful for applications of CPA-based models for uniform grain packings. We believe that the CPA-based model is an useful alternative approach for modeling the streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media along with two other models available in literature.

AB Rapidly rising river stages induced by flood events lead to considerable river water infiltration into aquifers and carry surface-borne solutes into hyporheic zones which are widely recognized as an important place for the biogeochemical activity. Existing studies for surface-groundwater exchanges induced by flood events usually limit to a river-aquifer cross section that is perpendicular to river channels, and neglect groundwater flow in parallel with river channels. In this study, surface-groundwater exchanges to a flood event are investigated with specific considerations of unconfined flow in direction that is in parallel with river channels. The groundwater flow is described by a two-dimensional Boussinesq equation and the flood event is described by a diffusive-type flood wave. Analytical solutions are derived and tested using the numerical solution. The results indicate that river water infiltrates into aquifers quickly during flood events, and mostly returns to the river within a short period of time after the flood event. However, the rest river water will stay in aquifers for a long period of time. The residual river water not only flows back to rivers but also flows to downstream aquifers. The one-dimensional model of neglecting flow in the direction parallel with river channels will overestimate heads and discharge in upstream aquifers. The return flow induced by the flood event has a power law form with time and has a significant impact on the base flow recession at early times. The solution can match the observed hydraulic heads in riparian zone wells of Iowa during flood events.

DE Stochastic; Rainfall; Disaggregation; Copula; Storm profile; Daily
ID STOCHASTIC DISAGGREGATION; TIME-SERIES
AB It has been demonstrated in this paper that observed scaled daily storm profiles (OSDSPs) can be used at a different climatic site to disaggregate daily rainfall data into fine timescales by following some selection rules. For a given daily rainfall depth, the normal copula model predicts the total daily wet periods' duration, capturing the seasonal variation of the copula and marginal lognormal model parameters by a first harmonic Fourier series. An OSDSP type, defined according to whether the first and/or last periods of the day are wet, is selected based on whether the day is an isolated wet day or in a cluster of wet days. For two consecutive wet Julian days, a transition probability is used to ascertain whether rainfall will cross midnight and spread to the next Julian day. A pool of the selected OSDSP type having the same, or close, numerical value of the copula predicted total daily wet periods' duration is created. From the pool is selected one OSDSP that has the closest value of lag-1 autocorrelation of the natural logarithm of the wet period depths to a simulated value conditioned on the total daily wet periods' duration. Multiplication of the OSDSP's period depths by the daily rainfall depth gives the complete daily storm profile. The applicability of the OSDSP based disaggregation model is demonstrated by using two case study sites and OSDSPs from Australian State capital cities situated in different climates. Using the capital cities' OSDSPs independently, and also together, predicted quite well the monthly gross rainfall statistics down to 6 min. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To describe the water retention and transfer properties of an unsaturated soil over the whole range of matric suction, it is necessary to account for both capillary and adsorption phenomena. Existing models combine well-known empirical functions for capillary water at lower suctions and more physically based ones for adsorptive water at higher suctions. To determine their full set of parameters, they however require different optimization procedures, among which those coming from capillary models are empirical. In this context, the main objective of this work is to develop a simple and robust physically based model of the water retention and transfer properties of unsaturated soils valid from saturation to oven dryness. To do so, new capillary-based water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions founded on the fractal approach have been derived from the pore size distribution, by means of the Young-Laplace law and Mualem's model. To describe adsorption phenomena, these functions are combined with those used in the Peters-Iden-Durner (PID) model, providing a model along the full range of suctions, with less parameters than the existing models. Our work also shows that some parameters are directly determined from the experimental grain size distribution data (the fractal dimension), or from the water retention data (air entry suction and residual water content), leaving only two parameters to be optimized. The model was successfully validated with respect to published experimental data from 10 different coarse, sandy, and clayey soils.

AB Models used for data interpretation of constant rate tests (CRTs) are commonly derived with the assumption of Darcian flow in an idealized geometry, hence disregarding the non-Darcian nature of fluid flow and the complexity of flow geometry. In this study, an Izbash's law-based analytical model is proposed by means of Laplace transform and linearization approximation for interpretation of non-Darcian flow in a generalized radial formation where the flow dimension may become fractional between 1 and 3. The source storage and skin effects are also considered in the model development. The proposed model immediately reduces to Barker's (1988) model for Darcian flow in the generalized radial formation and to Wen et al.' s (2008a) model for non-Darcian flow in a two-dimensional confined aquifer. A comparison with numerical simulations shows that the proposed model behaves well in low non-Darcian flow condition or at late times. The proposed model is finally applied for data interpretation of the constant rate pumping tests performed at Ploemeur, showing that the estimated hydraulic properties (i. e., hydraulic conductivity, specific storage coefficient, non-Darcy exponent, and the dimension of flow geometry) are well representative of the hydrogeologic conditions on the field scale at the test site after the exploitation of groundwater. The proposed model is an extension of the generalized radial flow (GRF) model, which would be of significance in the problem of choosing an appropriate dimension of flow geometry in which non-Darcian flow occurs.

AB While stochastic subsurface hydrology has been tremendously successful in understanding how the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity affects conservative solute transport in idealized settings, it has gained little impact in practice. This is the case because typical assumptions needed for the derivation of analytical expressions are too restrictive for practical applications and often geologically implausible, small-scale variation of hydraulic conductivity is by far not the only cause of uncertainty when considering the fate and remediation of pollutants, and the research community has not developed enough methods that can directly be used by practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose putting more emphasis on providing easy-to-use tools to generate realistic realizations of subsurface properties that are conditioned on all data measured at a site, extending the focus from hydraulic conductivity only to all parameters and processes relevant for reactive transport, making use of self-organizing principles of reactive transport to conceptually simplify the problem, and addressing conceptual uncertainty by stochastic methods.

AB Operational ground-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) do not adequately explain spatial variability in mountainous terrain. To address this problem, we combine satellite-based retrievals of fractional snow cover for the period 2000 to 2011 with spatially distributed energy balance calculations to reconstruct SWE values throughout each melt season in the Sierra Nevada of California. Modeled solar radiation, longwave radiation, and air temperature from NLDAS drive the snowmelt model. The modeled solar radiation compares well to ground observations, but modeled longwave radiation is slightly lower than observations. Validation of reconstructed SWE with snow courses and our own snow surveys shows that the model can accurately estimate SWE at the sampled locations in a variety of topographic settings for a range of wet to dry years. The relationships of SWE with elevation and latitude are significantly different for wet, mean and dry years as well as between drainages. In all the basins studied, the relationship between remaining SWE and snow-covered area (SCA) becomes increasingly correlated from March to July as expected because SCA is an important model input. Though the SWE is calculated retrospectively SCA observations are available in near-real time and combined with historical reconstructions may be sufficient for estimating SWE with more confidence as the melt season progresses.

AB Three evapotranspiration models using the complementary relationship approach for estimating areal actual evapotranspiration were evaluated and compared in three study regions representing a large geographic and climatic diversity: NOPEX region in Central Sweden (cool temperate, humid), Baixi catchment in Eastern China (subtropical, humid), and the Potamos tou Pyrgou River catchment in Northwestern Cyprus (semiarid to arid). The models are the CRAE model of Morton, the advection-aridity (AA) model of Brutsaert and Stricker, and the GG model proposed by Granger and Gray using the concept of relative evapotranspiration (the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration). The calculation was made on a daily basis and comparison was made on monthly and annual bases. The study was performed in two steps: First, the three evapotranspiration models with their original parameter values were applied to the three regions in order to test their general applicability. Second, the parameter values were locally calibrated based on the water balance study. The results showed that (1) using the original parameter values all three complementary relationship models worked reasonably well for the temperate humid region, while the predictive power decreases in moving toward regions of increased soil moisture control, i.e. increased aridity. In such regions, the parameters need to be calibrated. (2) Using the locally calibrated parameter values all three models produced the annual values correctly. For the monthly values there was a time shift for the appearance of maximum monthly values between the evapotranspiration model estimations and water balance calculations, and the drier the region, the larger the difference. Further examination of the water balance components showed that while the actual evapotranspiration is controlled by several hydrometeorological factors in warmer and drier months the soil moisture is the dominating factor.

AB The ensemble Bayesian forecasting system (EBFS), whose theory was published in 2001, is developed for the purpose of quantifying the total uncertainty about a discrete-time, continuous-state, non-stationary stochastic process such as a time series of stages, discharges, or volumes at a river gauge. The EBFS is built of three components: an input ensemble forecaster (IEF), which simulates the uncertainty associated with random inputs; a deterministic hydrologic model (of any complexity), which simulates physical processes within a river basin; and a hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP), which simulates the hydrologic uncertainty (an aggregate of all uncertainties except input). It works as a Monte Carlo simulator: an ensemble of time series of inputs (e.g., precipitation amounts) generated by the IEF is transformed deterministically through a hydrologic model into an ensemble of time series of outputs, which is next transformed stochastically by the HUP into an ensemble of time series of predictands (e.g., river stages). Previous research indicated that in order to attain an acceptable sampling error, the ensemble size must be on the order of hundreds (for probabilistic river stage forecasts and probabilistic flood forecasts) or even thousands (for probabilistic stage transition forecasts). The computing time needed to run the hydrologic model this many times renders the straightforward simulations operationally infeasible. This motivates the development of the ensemble Bayesian forecasting system with randomization (EBFSR), which takes full advantage of the analytic meta-Gaussian HUP and generates multiple ensemble members after each run of the hydrologic model; this auxiliary randomization reduces the required size of the meteorological input ensemble and makes it operationally feasible to generate a Bayesian ensemble forecast of large size. Such a forecast quantifies the total uncertainty, is well calibrated against the prior (climatic) distribution of predictand, possesses a Bayesian coherence property, constitutes a random sample of the predictand, and has an acceptable sampling error which makes it suitable for rational decision making under uncertainty.

AB This study explores whether it is possible to reconstruct the frequency of extreme precipitation occurrence across the contiguous United States (CONUS) using the Living Blended Drought Atlas (LBDA), a 500 year paleoclimate reconstruction of the summer (June-August) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). We first identify regions of the country where the LBDA may reflect the occurrence of extremes based on their seasonality and contribution to total annual moisture delivery. Correlation measures are used to assess the relationship between the frequencies of extreme precipitation occurrence and both the instrumental monthly PDSI and the annual LBDA-estimated PDSI. Extreme precipitation is found to account for a large portion of total precipitation west of the Mississippi River and clusters in particular seasons (winter and summer), supporting a strong relationship with the LBDA without much information loss from the instrumental PDSI data. Dimension reduction techniques are used to explore the joint spatiotemporal structure of extreme precipitation occurrence and LBDA across the country. The primary modes of variability of the LBDA and extreme precipitation occurrence relate remarkably well for a region centered over the southwest that exhibits an ENSO-like time-frequency structure. Generalized linear models (GLMs) are used to demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing the annual extreme precipitation frequency over the 500 year prehistoric record at two sites in the southwest and Southern Plains. GLM-based reconstructions show a high degree of structured variability in the likelihood of extreme precipitation occurrences over the prehistoric record.

ID OPERATION; SYSTEMS
AB We develop a flow path model for the optimization of a regional water distribution system. The model simultaneously describes a water distribution system in two parts: (1) the water delivery relationship between suppliers and receivers and (2) the physical water delivery network. In the first part, the model considers waters from different suppliers as multiple commodities. This helps the model clearly describe water deliveries by identifying the relationship between suppliers and receivers. The physical part characterizes a physical water distribution network by all possible flow paths. The flow path model can be used to optimize not only the suppliers to each receiver but also their associated flow paths for supplying water. This characteristic leads to the optimum solution that contains the optimal scheduling results and detailed information concerning water distribution in the physical system. That is, the water rights owner, water quantity, water location, and associated flow path of each delivery action are represented explicitly in the results rather than merely as an optimized total flow quantity in each arc of a distribution network. We first verify the proposed methodology on a hypothetical water distribution system. Then we apply the methodology to the water distribution system associated with the Tou-Qian River basin in northern Taiwan. The results show that the flow path model can be used to optimize the quantity of each water delivery, the associated flow path, and the water trade and transfer strategy.

AB This study reports on two strategies for accelerating posterior inference of a highly parameterized and CPU-demanding groundwater flow model. Our method builds on previous stochastic collocation approaches, e.g., Marzouk and Xiu (2009) and Marzouk and Najm (2009), and uses generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) theory and dimensionality reduction to emulate the output of a large-scale groundwater flow model. The resulting surrogate model is CPU efficient and serves to explore the posterior distribution at a much lower computational cost using two-stage MCMC simulation. The case study reported in this paper demonstrates a two to five times speed-up in sampling efficiency.

AB We develop a theory that explains the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity K, due to biological clogging of porous media. Experiments show that discontinuous microcolonies in fine-textured soils decrease K-s more severely than biofilms do. However, most existing models for biological clogging assume that bacteria cells form biofilms which uniformly cover pore walls. We propose a mathematical model for biological clogging with a quantitative evaluation of the nonuniform microbial distribution of colonies. A series of equations describing the relation between the biological clogging and the saturated hydraulic conductivity are derived. The data of previous researchers are used to validate the model.

AB Correlations between rainfall amount and water content in coarse soils were studied. Situations were registered in which the intensity of the gravity-driven flow in the soil exhibited irregular oscillations which could not be explained within the scope of the standard Richards' theory. The problem was analyzed by means of a set of laboratory experiments. It seems that the observed global (macroscopic) oscillations can be qualitatively explained as a result of correlated behavior of the local (microscopic) flows. The search for a satisfactory quantitative description of those effects promises to be a field of useful and interesting research activities.

AB The presence of solute concentration fluctuations at spatial scales much below the scale of resolution is a major challenge for modeling reactive transport in porous media. Overlooking small-scale fluctuations, which is the usual procedure, often results in strong disagreements between field observations and model predictions, including, but not limited to, the overestimation of effective reaction rates. Existing innovative approaches that account for local reactant segregation do not provide a general mathematical formulation for the generation, transport, and decay of these fluctuations and their impact on chemical reactions. We propose a Lagrangian formulation based on the random motion of fluid particles carrying solute concentrations whose departure from the local mean is relaxed through multirate interaction by exchange with the mean (MRIEM). We derive and analyze the macroscopic descriptionof the local concentration covariance that emerges from the model, showing its potential to simulate the dynamics of mixing-limited processes. The action of hydrodynamic dispersion on coarse-scale concentration gradients is responsible for the production of local concentration covariance, whereas covariance destruction stems from the local mixing process represented by the MRIEM formulation. The temporal evolution of integrated mixing metrics in two simple scenarios shows the trends that characterize fully resolved physical systems, such as a late-time power law decay of the relative importance of incomplete mixing with respect to the total mixing. Experimental observations of mixing-limited reactive transport are successfully reproduced by the model.

AB Truncated Gaussian fields provide a flexible model for defining binary media with dispersed (as opposed to layered) inclusions. General properties of excursion sets on these truncated fields are coupled with a distance-based upscaling algorithm and approximations of point process theory to develop an estimation approach for effective conductivity in two-dimensions. Estimation of effective conductivity is derived directly from knowledge of the kernel size used to create the multiGaussian field, defined as the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), the truncation threshold and conductance values of the two modes. Therefore, instantiation of the multiGaussian field is not necessary for estimation of the effective conductance. The critical component of the effective medium approximation developed here is the mean distance between high conductivity inclusions. This mean distance is characterized as a function of the FWHM, the truncation threshold and the ratio of the two modal conductivities. Sensitivity of the resulting effective conductivity to this mean distance is examined for two levels of contrast in the modal conductances and different FWHM sizes. Results demonstrate that the FWHM is a robust measure of mean travel distance in the background medium. The resulting effective conductivities are accurate when compared to numerical results and results obtained from effective media theory, distance-based upscaling and numerical simulation.

AB Groundwater is an increasingly important water supply source globally. Understanding the amount of groundwater used versus the volume available is crucial to evaluate future water availability. We present a groundwater stress assessment to quantify the relationship between groundwater use and availability in the world's 37 largest aquifer systems. We quantify stress according to a ratio of groundwater use to availability, which we call the Renewable Groundwater Stress ratio. The impact of quantifying groundwater use based on nationally reported groundwater withdrawal statistics is compared to a novel approach to quantify use based on remote sensing observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Four characteristic stress regimes are defined: Overstressed, Variable Stress, Human-dominated Stress, and Unstressed. The regimes are a function of the sign of use (positive or negative) and the sign of groundwater availability, defined as mean annual recharge. The ability to mitigate and adapt to stressed conditions, where use exceeds sustainable water availability, is a function of economic capacity and land use patterns. Therefore, we qualitatively explore the relationship between stress and anthropogenic biomes. We find that estimates of groundwater stress based on withdrawal statistics are unable to capture the range of characteristic stress regimes, especially in regions dominated by sparsely populated biome types with limited cropland. GRACE-based estimates of use and stress can holistically quantify the impact of groundwater use on stress, resulting in both greater magnitudes of stress and more variability of stress between regions.

AB Models of dual-domain mass transfer (DDMT) are used to explain anomalous aquifer transport behavior such as the slow release of contamination and solute tracer tailing. Traditional tracer experiments to characterize DDMT are performed at the flow path scale (meters), which inherently incorporates heterogeneous exchange processes; hence, estimated effective parameters are sensitive to experimental design (i.e., duration and injection velocity). Recently, electrical geophysical methods have been used to aid in the inference of DDMT parameters because, unlike traditional fluid sampling, electrical methods can directly sense less-mobile solute dynamics and can target specific points along subsurface flow paths. Here we propose an analytical framework for graphical parameter inference based on a simple petrophysical model explaining the hysteretic relation between measurements of bulk and fluid conductivity arising in the presence of DDMT at the local scale. Analysis is graphical and involves visual inspection of hysteresis patterns to (1) determine the size of paired mobile and less-mobile porosities and (2) identify the exchange rate coefficient through simple curve fitting. We demonstrate the approach using laboratory column experimental data, synthetic streambed experimental data, and field tracer-test data. Results from the analytical approach compare favorably with results from calibration of numerical models and also independent measurements of mobile and less-mobile porosity. We show that localized electrical hysteresis patterns resulting from diffusive exchange are independent of injection velocity, indicating that repeatable parameters can be extracted under varied experimental designs, and these parameters represent the true intrinsic properties of specific volumes of porous media of aquifers and hyporheic zones.

AB Using data collected at the Mero catchment during three hydrological years (2005/06-2007/08), an analysis of rainfall-runoff relationships was performed at annual, seasonal, monthly, and event scales. At annual scale, the catchment showed low runoff coefficients (23-35%), due to high water storage capacity soils as well as high runoff inter-annual variability. Rainfall variability was the main responsible for the differences in the inter-annual runoff. At seasonal and monthly scales, there was no simple relationship between rainfall and runoff. Seasonal dynamics of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in conjunction with different rainfall distribution during the study years could be the key factors explaining the complex relationship between rainfall and runoff at monthly and seasonal scale. At the event scale, the results revealed that the hydrological response was highly dependent on initial conditions and, to a lesser extent, on rainfall amount. The shapes of the different hydrographs, regardless of the magnitude, presented similar characteristics: a moderate rise and a prolonged recession, suggesting that subsurface flow was the dominant process in direct runoff. Moreover, all rainfall-runoff events had a higher proportion of baseflow than of direct runoff. A cluster-type analysis discriminated three types of events differentiated mainly by rainfall amount and antecedent rainfall conditions. The study highlights the role of the antecedent rainfall and the need for caution in extrapolating relationships between rainfall amount and hydrological response of the catchment.

AB In this work, the influence of wettability on the fluid-fluid interfacial area (a(nw)) in a three-dimensional (3D) self-affine rough fracture during non-wetting phase invasion was studied using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The capillary pressure (P-c)-saturation (S-w)-interfacial area (P-c-S-w-a(nw)) relationship, irreducible water saturation, and a(nw) at non-wetting phase breakthrough time and at irreducible water saturation were determined for four different contact angles. The lower contact angles led to increases in both P-c and a(nw) for a given water saturation. The irreducible water saturation increased as contact angle decreased and the corresponding a(nw) at irreducible saturation also increased as contact angle decreased. Decreasing the contact angle with the corresponding increase in non-wetting phase entry pressures increased the number of fracture regions in which water became surrounded by NAPL and isolated. This consequently increased a(nw) for a given water saturation and increased the irreducible water saturation. The a(nw)-S-w curves from LBM for different contact angles were compared with a thermodynamically based model for the a(nw)-S-w relationship. The energy dissipation factors varied with contact angle, and were higher than typical values for porous media, indicating predictions of less energy dissipation in the fractures modeled than for previously studied porous media.

AB Because physics-based models of dynamical systems are constrained to obey conservation laws, they must typically be fed long sequences of temporally consecutive (TC) data during model calibration and evaluation. When memory time scales are long (as in many physical systems), this requirement makes it difficult to ensure distributional similarity when partitioning the data into independent, TC, calibration and evaluation subsets. The consequence can be poor and/or uncertain model performance when applied to new situations. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy for achieving robust and transferable model performance. Instead of partitioning the data into TC calibration and evaluation periods, the model is run in continuous simulation mode for the entire period, and specific time steps are assigned (via a deterministic data-allocation approach) for use in computing the calibration and evaluation metrics. Generative adversarial testing shows that this approach results in consistent calibration and evaluation data subset distributions. When tested using three conceptual rainfall-runoff models applied to 163 catchments representing a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions, the proposed "distributionally consistent (DC)" strategy consistently resulted in better overall performance than achieved using the traditional "TC" strategy. Testing on independent data periods confirmed superior robustness and transferability of the DC-calibrated models, particularly under conditions of larger runoff skewness. Because the approach is generally applicable to physics-based models of dynamical systems, it has the potential to significantly improve the confidence associated with prediction and uncertainty estimates generated using such models.

AB We investigated how geomorphological structures shape Transit Time Distributions (TTDs) in shallow aquifers. Extensive three-dimensional simulations were performed to determine the TTDs for synthetic convergent, straight, and divergent hillslopes with a constant slope. The uniform recharge applied on top of the aquifer is transferred to the receiving stream through steady-state groundwater flows, return flows and saturation excess overland flows. Without seepage, TTDs evolve from uniform- to power law-like- distributions depending on the average distance of the groundwater volume to the river (barycenter). Remarkably, the coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) of the TTDs scales linearly with the barycenter in agreement with a theoretical prediction based on three analytical approximations derived for specific cases. With seepage, the TTD has three separate modes corresponding to rapid saturation excess overland flows, to the intermediate flow paths ending in seepage area and to the slower flow paths going all the way to a discharge in the river. The coefficient of variation additionally depends on the extent of the seepage area. For a natural hillslope in the crystalline basement of Normandy (France), the same synthetic analysis demonstrates that the coefficient of variation is not only determined by the extent of the seepage zone but also by its structure in relation to the local and global geomorphological organization. The results suggest the possibility to assess the variability of transit times by combining geomorphological analysis, surface soil saturation observations and environmental tracers.

AB Nowadays, national and international requirements and laws emphasize the "natural" development of river-floodplain systems. One goal is to increase the connectivity between the river and its floodplains and thus reactivate floodplains as flooding areas, which potentially increases the mobility of fine sediments. The objective of this study is to analyze the long-term effects of reactivated floodplains on the mobility of floodplain deposits of small rivers based on two river restoration scenarios: elevating the riverbed or lowering the floodplains. Past channel fixation and degradation as well as the subsequent increase in the floodplain elevation led to the decoupling of the channel and floodplain morphodynamics associated with the reduction of the habitat connectivity. Here, the floodplain sedimentation rates were determined using a numerical model based on the Delft3D software. The novelty of these numerical investigations is the morphological long-term analysis over timescales of decades, which is not comparable to other short-term hydrodynamic and morphodynamic studies for small meandering lowland rivers. The results of 11 river restoration scenarios show that lowering the floodplain and raising the riverbed elevation both lead to an increase in the fine sediment deposition on the floodplain. However, lowering the floodplain elevation is generally more effective. Based on the numerical model results and the assumption of a fixed river channel, only anthropogenic activity might have increased the amount of fine sediments deposited on floodplains and has accelerated the decoupling of the floodplains from the riverbed in the past centuries.

ID TURBULENT-FLOW STRUCTURES; ROUGHNESS; MOTION; LAYER
AB A series of flume experiments were conducted to study the effect of bed form dynamics on the flow over a gravel bed comprising a wide distribution of grain sizes. Instantaneous high-frequency streamwise flow velocities were sampled using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a frequency of 200 Hz, while the simultaneous bed elevations were sampled using sonar transducers at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for a duration of 20 h. Spectral analysis of the measured velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regimes. At high frequencies, an inertial subrange of turbulence with similar to-5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed. At low frequencies, another scaling regime with spectral slope of about -1.1 is found. We interpret this range as the signature of the evolving multiscale bed topography on the near-bed velocity fluctuations. The two scaling ranges are separated by a spectral gap, i.e., a range of intermediate scales with no additional energy contribution. The high-frequency limit of the spectral gap corresponds to the integral scale of turbulence. The low-frequency end of the gap corresponds to the scale of the smallest bed forms identified by the velocity sensor, which depends on the position of the sensor. Our results also show that the temporal scales of the largest bed forms can be potentially identified from spectral analysis of low-resolution velocity measurements collected near the channel bed.

ID LOCAL PRECIPITATION
AB In order to link the monthly areal precipitation to large-scale circulation patterns, a fuzzy indexing technique is used in conjunction with a fuzzy rule-based technique and also a standard linear regression. After clustering the lag-correlation centers, fuzziness is introduced, and several representative indices of the monthly areal precipitation in Arizona are calculated and interpreted. The relation between the indices and the precipitation is analyzed to develop the fuzzy model and then a multivariate linear regression model. To measure the forecasting capability of the models, the data are divided into a calibration period (1947-79) and a validation period (1980-1988), A comparison of the results shows that the fuzzy rule-based model performs better than the regression model and has potential for monthly precipitation forecasting. Moreover, an adaptive fuzzy rule-based framework is described so that the model can be used under climate change.

AB Fluctuations of groundwater levels were used to predict soluble phosphorus concentrations. In-situ observations showed a decrease in soluble phosphorus during groundwater recession and an increase with groundwater rise. A spatial analysis of the simulated soluble phosphorus and groundwater levels indicated similarity of patterns (spatial correlation) 99% of the time. A geographically weighted multivariate analysis of soluble phosphorus using groundwater levels, phosphorus levels of the Kissimmee River, and distance from the Kissimmee River as predictors showed a goodness of fit (R-2) ranging from 0.2 to 0.7. Results indicated no significant difference between the simulated and observed soluble phosphorus levels at a p value of 0.01. Among the parameters, the groundwater level explained 70% of the soluble phosphorus variability. The distance to surface waterbodies and their phosphorus levels had significant weights only within a 5-km range from the waterbody. A model generalization is further required to simulate the spatiotemporal groundwater-phosphorus dynamics over meaningful temporal ranges - at least for 3 to 5years - for conclusiveness of the data.

AB The study of fluid flow in non-Darcy porous medium subjected to Hall current is very important in scientific and engineering applications such as water filters, groundwater discharge in aquifers, petroleum engineering, MHD generators and chemical engineering. Forchheimer model is needed at high flow rate, where, flow will exhibit non-linearity with respect to velocity which make Darcy law inapplicable at these conditions. In this case, the momentum equations become non-linear. The classical differential transformation method transforms the nonlinear differential equations to a non-linear algebraic system which gives more than one solution and may be unstable that leads to divergence of the required solution. The novelty of present method that it is a power series solution avoiding solution multiplicity and divergence by a linearization technique that is applied on non-linear governing equations to obtain the unique and convergent solution. The uniqueness, convergence and stability of the new technique are tested by comparisons with previously available works and it is also verified by a fourth order accurate finite difference (FOFDM) solution. The effects flow parameters on the velocity and friction factor are illustrated. The values of parameters in the present work are chosen according to: the available previous results, the power of the persent method to compute over a lagre range of parameters and the distinctiveness between curves in figures.

AB Sediment yields from the rolling hills area of the Loess Plateau in northern China (10 000-25 000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) are amongst the highest in the world. The sediment is believed to derive from both the deep gullies that dissect the rolling plateau and the steep cultivated fields on the slopes of the mounds between the gullies. However, there are few reliable data for erosion rates on the cultivated fields and it is suspected that current estimates (10 000-16 000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) based on empirical relationships (derived from erosion plot studies) exceed the true values. This study sought to address the need for more information concerning erosion of the cultivated fields through derivation of erosion rates from measurements of rill volume and caesium-137 (Cs-137) inventories for typical fields near the village of Ansai, Shaanxi Province. The derived erosion rates are discussed and compared with estimates based on empirical relationships derived from erosion plot data.
   Where erosion rate estimates based on both rill volume data and Cs-137 inventories are available, they show good agreement in the pattern of downslope variation. Both show a sharp decline in erosion rates at a slope length of c. 50 m. This is tentatively attributed to a change from transport-limited to detachment-limited conditions, where rill incision reaches the undisturbed loess at the base of the plough layer. No such decline is visible in the predictions based on empirical relationships derived from erosion plot data, Further evidence is presented that supports the suggestion that these empirical relationships overestimate erosion rates at slope lengths in excess of c. 50 m. It is tentatively suggested that the rates of soil erosion from sloping cultivated fields in the rolling hills area are more likely to lie in the range 8000-10 000 t km(-2) yr(-1) than in the higher range suggested by the empirical relationships.

AB We present advances in compositional modeling of two-phase multi-component flow through highly complex porous media. Higher-order methods are used to approximate both mass transport and the velocity and pressure fields. We employ the Mixed Hybrid Finite Element (MHFE) method to simultaneously solve, to the same order, the pressure equation and Darcy's law for the velocity. The species balance equation is approximated by the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach, combined with a slope limiter. In this work we present an improved DG scheme where phase splitting is analyzed at all element vertices in the two-phase regions, rather than only as element averages. This approximation is higher-order than the commonly employed finite volume method and earlier DG approximations. The method reduces numerical dispersion, allowing for an accurate capture of shock fronts and lower dependence on mesh quality and orientation. Further new features are the extension to unstructured grids and support for arbitrary permeability tensors (allowing for both scalar heterogeneity, and shear anisotropy). The most important advancement in this work is the self-consistent modeling of two-phase multi-component Fickian diffusion. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the powerful features of our combined MHFE-dg method with respect to lower-order calculations, ranging from simple two component fluids to more challenging real problems regarding CO2 injection into a vertical domain saturated with a multicomponent petroleum fluid.

AB The shallow and deep hypothesis suggests that stream concentration-discharge (CQ) relationships are shaped by distinct source waters from different depths. Under this hypothesis, baseflows are typically dominated by groundwater and mostly reflect groundwater chemistry, whereas high flows are typically dominated by shallow soil water and mostly reflect soil water chemistry. Aspects of this hypothesis draw on applications like end member mixing analyses and hydrograph separation, yet direct data support for the hypothesis remains scarce. This work tests the shallow and deep hypothesis using co-located measurements of soil water, groundwater, and streamwater chemistry at two intensively monitored sites, the W-9 catchment at Sleepers River (Vermont, United States) and the Hafren catchment at Plynlimon (Wales). At both sites, depth profiles of subsurface water chemistry and stream CQ relationships for the 10 solutes analyzed are broadly consistent with the hypothesis. Solutes that are more abundant at depth (e.g., calcium) exhibit dilution patterns (concentration decreases with increasing discharge). Conversely, solutes enriched in shallow soils (e.g., nitrate) generally exhibit flushing patterns (concentration increases with increasing discharge). The hypothesis may hold broadly true for catchments that share such biogeochemical stratifications in the subsurface. Soil water and groundwater chemistries were estimated from high- and low-flow stream chemistries with average relative errors ranging from 24% to 82%. This indicates that streams mirror subsurface waters: stream chemistry can be used to infer scarcely measured subsurface water chemistry, especially where there are distinct shallow and deep end members.

AB The publicly available global discharge database is limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Although regional exceptions exist, the population of the database has declined over the past several years. As discharge is one of the most important parameters for modeling hydrological interactions, alternative measuring techniques must be sought. In the recent past, satellite altimetry has been investigated as an alternative for monitoring inland water level. In the present study, altimetry footprints in the vicinity of river gauging stations for the Amazon, Amur, Brahmaputra, Danube, Don, Mekong, Niger, Ob, and Vistula rivers are analyzed for a functional relationship between the water level measurements from altimetry and discharge from the gauging stations. Such a functional relationship is conventionally established via a rating curve computed using simultaneous data. This study proposes a statistical approach based on quantile functions to infer this functional relation without the need for having synchronous data sets. The statistical approach provides the opportunity of extracting discharge values from altimetry data for rivers like the Mekong, Brahmaputra, Don, and Vistula for which the discharge measurements at the selected gauges were made before the age of satellites. The algorithm is then validated over those rivers which do have discharge measurements available within periods of altimetry. Our validation shows that our algorithm is in the same quality range as the conventional approach. We are thus able to salvage presatellite altimetry discharge data and turn them into active use for the satellite altimetry time frame.

AB Wetlands play an important role in watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry. A geographically isolated wetland (GIW) module for Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics to characterize hydroperiod. The new GIW module includes the following features: (1) a flexible geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area, volume, and depth; (2) a revised algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces in wetlands; (3) application of the Richards equation to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics; (4) use of Darcy's law with an effective hydraulic conductivity parameter to simulate groundwater discharge. We tested the GIW module using observed daily water level data from four wetlands at two sites (including restored and natural wetlands with and without a low-permeability soil layer) in the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. The results show that the wetland module reasonably reproduced observed water levels for both restored and natural wetlands with and without a lowpermeability soil layer. The module was also able to reasonably simulate saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods. The ability of the GIW module to describe inundation conditions for wetlands holds promise to enhance the understanding and quantification of hydrological and biogeochemical roles of GIWs in a watershed context.

TI Predicting the topographic limits to a gully network using a digital
   terrain model and process thresholds
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EROSION THRESHOLDS; CHANNEL INITIATION; MORPHOLOGY
AB A digital terrain model is used with process thresholds to predict the extent of a stable gully network in a 5 km(2) catchment of the southeastern highlands of Australia. The model, developed by Dietrich et al. [1992, 1993], predicts the topographic controls on channel networks and interprets these in terms of a critical shear stress for channel incision (tau(c)) applied by saturation overland flow. We adapt the model slightly to compare the shear stress applied by Hortonian overland flow to that applied by saturation overland flow. The limits to gully erosion in the catchment are controlled strongly by a topographic threshold that has an inverse relationship between upslope catchment area and local gradient. The topographic threshold for channel incision is reproduced using a simple model of Hortonian overland flow and a tau(c) appropriate for incision into a degraded grass surface (tau(c) = 245 dyn/cm(2)). This is consistent with historical evidence for the timing of gully erosion. The study confirms a strong topographic control on the extent of the channel network in a catchment significantly different from the western North America catchments where the topographic threshold was first demonstrated. Despite its simplicity, the model for incision by overland flow appears capable of distinguishing the hydrological processes responsible for channel incision when these are reflected in the relationship between channel network and landscape morphology. The model requires relatively simple inputs, suggesting it may be useful for mapping gully erosion hazard in actively eroding catchments.

TI A Lagging Model for Describing Drawdown Induced by a Constant-Rate
   Pumping in a Leaky Confined Aquifer
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB This study proposes a generalized Darcy's law with considering phase lags in both the water flux and drawdown gradient to develop a lagging flow model for describing drawdown induced by constant-rate pumping (CRP) in a leaky confined aquifer. The present model has a mathematical formulation similar to the dual-porosity model. The Laplace-domain solution of the model with the effect of well bore storage is derived by the Laplace transform method. The time-domain solution for the case of neglecting the wellbore storage and well radius is developed by the use of Laplace transform and Weber transform. The results of sensitivity analysis based on the solution indicate that the dravvdown is very sensitive to the change in each of the transmissivity and storativity. Also, a study for the lagging effect on the drawdown indicates that its influence is significant associated with the lag times. The present solution is also employed to analyze a data set taken from a CRP test conducted in a fractured aquifer in South Dakota, USA. The results show the prediction of this new solution with considering the phase lags has very good fit to the field data, especially at early pumping time. In addition, the phase lags seem to have a scale effect as indicated in the results. In other words, the lagging behavior is positively correlated with the observed distance in the Madison aquifer.

AB Spatially integrated transport models have been applied widely to model hydrologic transport. However, we lack simple and process-based theoretical tools to predict the transport closures-transit time distributions (TTDs) and StorAge Selection (SAS) functions. This limits our ability to infer characteristics of hydrologic systems from tracer observations and to make first-order estimates of SAS functions in catchments where no tracer data is available. Here we present a theoretical framework linking TTDs and SAS functions to hydraulic groundwater theory at the hillslope scale. For hillslopes where the saturated hydraulic conductivity declines exponentially with depth, analytical solutions for the closures are derived that can be used as hypotheses to test against data. In the simplest form, the hillslope SAS function resembles a uniform or exponential distribution (corresponding to flow pathways in the saturated zone) offset from zero by the storage in the unsaturated zone that does not contribute to discharge. The framework is validated against nine idealized virtual hillslopes constructed using a 2-D Richards equation-based model, and against data from tracer experiments in two artificial hillslopes. Modeled internal age, life expectancy, and transit time structures reproduce theoretical predictions. The experimental data also support the theory, though further work is needed to account for the effects of time-variability. The shape and tailing of TTDs and their power spectra are discussed. The theoretical framework yields several dimensionless numbers that can be used to classify hillslope scale flow and transport dynamics and suggests distinct water age structures for high or low Hillslope number.

AB [1] Transport and retention of sorbing tracers in a single, altered crystalline rock fracture on a 5 m scale is investigated. We evaluate the results of a comprehensive field study ( referred to as Tracer Retention Understanding Experiments, first phase ( TRUE- 1)), at a 400 m depth of the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory ( Sweden). A total of 16 breakthrough curves are analyzed, from three test configurations using six radioactive tracers with a broad range of sorption properties. A transport- retention model is proposed, and its applicability is assessed based on available data. We find that the conventional model with an asymptotic power law slope of - 3/ 2 ( one- dimensional diffusion into an unlimited rock matrix) is a reasonable approximation for the conditions of the TRUE- 1 tests. Retention in the altered rock of the rim zone appears to be significantly stronger than implied by retention properties inferred from generic ( unaltered) rock samples. The effective physical parameters which control retention ( matrix porosity and retention aperture) are comparable for all three test configurations. The most plausible in situ ( rim zone) porosity is in the range 1% - 2%, which constrains the effective retention aperture to the range 0.2 - 0.7 mm. For all sorbing tracers the estimated in situ sorption coefficient appears to be larger by at least a factor of 10, compared to the value inferred from through- diffusion tests using unaltered rock samples.

AB The natural drainage network ill a region is analyzed in order to investigate scaling properties and the form of the probability distribution for basin areas along a coastal boundary. The Horton/Strahler approach used in the classical description of the drainage network within a single basin is extended to a series of independent though conterminous basins with outlet to the sea, assuming that a regional area ratio R-A, analogous to the Hortonian area ratio, holds for independent basins. A multiplicative factor R-C is also defined as the average ratio between the number of independent basins of a given order omega and those of order omega + 1. The cumulative area distribution (CAD) for drainage basins that drain along the coastal boundary is obtained as a power law in the form P[A > a] proportional to a(-gamma), with gamma log R-C/log R-A, The derived form and parameters of the CAD are shown to hold for the Liguria region of Italy (similar or equal to 5700 km(2) in the northern Mediterranean) as well as for the whole continental Italy (similar or equal to 250,000 km(2)). The fractal dimension of the regional system encompassing all drainage areas of basins with outlet to the sea is derived in the form D = 1/gamma. The analytical results obtained are shown to agree with the theoretical expressions already available in the literature for optimal channel networks.

AB The ecosystem function of vegetation to attenuate export of nutrients is of substantial importance for securing water quality. This ecosystem function is at risk of deterioration due to an increasing risk of large-scale forest dieback under climate change. The present study explores the response of the nitrogen (N) cycle of a forest catchment in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, in the face of a severe bark beetle (Ips typographus Linnaeus) outbreak and resulting large-scale forest dieback using top-down statistical-mechanistic modeling. Outbreaks of bark beetle killed the dominant tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) in stands accounting for 55% of the catchment area. A Bayesian hierarchical model that predicts daily stream NO3 concentration (C) over three decades with discharge (Q) and temperature (T) (C-Q-T relationship) outperformed alternative statistical models. A catchment model was subsequently developed to explain the C-Q-T relationship in top-down fashion. Annually varying parameter estimates provide mechanistic interpretations of the catchment processes. Release of NO3 from decaying litter after the dieback was tracked by an increase of the nutrient input parameter c(s0). The slope of C-T relation was near zero during this period, suggesting that the nutrient release was beyond the regulating capacity of the vegetation and soils. Within a decade after the dieback, the released N was flushed out and nutrient retention capacity was restored with the regrowth of the vegetation.

AB We used multiple sources of remotely sensed and ground based information to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of snowpack accumulation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) throughout the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, USA. Relationships between these variables were used to establish baseline values of expected forest productivity given water and energy inputs. Although both the snow water equivalent (SWE) and a snow aridity index (SAI), which used SWE to normalize PET, were significant predictors of the long-term (1989-2012) NDVI, SAI explained 11% more NDVI variability than SWE. Deviations from these relationships were subsequently explored in the context of widespread forest mortality due to bark beetles. Over the entire study area, NDVI was lower per unit SAI in beetle-disturbed compared to undisturbed areas during snow-related drought; however, both SAI and NDVI were spatially heterogeneous within this domain. As a result, we selected three focus areas inside the larger study area within which to isolate the relative impacts of SAI and disturbance on NDVI using multivariate linear regression. These models explained 66%-85% of the NDVI and further suggested that both SAI and disturbance effects were significant, although the disturbance effect was generally greater. These results establish the utility of SAI as a measure of moisture limitation in snow-dominated systems and demonstrate a reduction in forest productivity due to bark beetle disturbance that is particularly evident during drought conditions resultant from low snow accumulation during the winter.

AB In Alpine regions, especially when energy production by run-of-river plants is subsidized through state incentives, the indiscriminate growth of small plants built in cascade along the same river threatens aquatic ecosystems by depleting significant fractions of the river network. This paper compares the economic profitability of small run-of-river power plants and the ensuing hydrologic disturbance between the intake and the outflow, as resulting from the adoption of two alternative management strategies, namely the minimum flow discharge and a percent-of-flow rule. The capacity that maximizes the produced energy or the economic value of the plant, as well as the flow regime between the intake and the outflow, are analytically expressed as a function of the frequency distribution of the available streamflows. A quantitative framework relying on a set of synthetic hydrologic and economic indices is then proposed to compare the effectiveness of management strategies. The application of the method to three case studies in North-Eastern Italy evidences that the compliance of the minimum flow discharge does not prevent huge alterations of some key attributes of the flow regime, especially the temporal flow correlation. For a given and equal economic profitability of the investment, the two management strategies produce similar ecodeficits and an analogous reduction of the mean discharge between the intake and the outflow. However, the percent-of-flow strategy allows a reduced disturbance on the temporal correlation and the skewness of river discharges. Furthermore, when a percent-of-flow strategy is implemented, possible policy redefinitions aimed at reducing the hydrologic disturbance of the plant in the reach between the intake and the outflow can be complied with at reduced costs in terms of missed energy production. The framework developed may be a valuable tool to assess the ability of water management strategies to trade between hydrologic disturbance and anthropogenic uses of fresh water.

TI Dynamics of shallow lateral shear layers: Experimental study in a river

ID 3-DIMENSIONAL FLOW STRUCTURE; STREAM CONFLUENCES; EXCHANGE
AB Shallow lateral shear layers forming between flows with different velocities, though essential for mixing processes in natural streams, have been examined only in laboratory settings using smooth, fixed-bed channels. This paper reports the results of an experimental study of a shear layer in a straight reach of a natural river where the layer, in contrast to the two-dimensional structure observed in the laboratory, is highly three-dimensional. The study included pronounced transverse pressure gradients, which influenced shear layer structure compared to flume experiments. It also introduces an analysis that complements conventional theory on mixing layers. The lateral velocity gradient between the flows downstream from a splitter plate placed in the river, the principal controlling factor, was adjusted for three experimental runs to determine the influence of different gradients on shear-layer dynamics. In each run, detailed three-dimensional measurements of mean and turbulent characteristics were obtained at five cross sections downstream from the splitter plate. Although experimental results agreed with conventional mixing-layer theories with respect to turbulence, the dynamics of the shear layers were dominated by the mean lateral fluxes of momentum. After re-examining the governing equations, we developed a parabolic equation describing the shear layer evolution and several scaling relations for essential terms of the energy budget: mean and turbulent lateral fluxes of momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rates. The study also provides insight into the spectral dynamics of turbulence in the shear layer and clarifies previous observations reported for confluences in natural streams.

AB The water balance of drained floodplains is highly dynamic with complex groundwater-surface water interactions operating over varying spatial and temporal scales. Here we hypothesize that the majority of groundwater discharge will follow flood events in a modified wetland. To test this hypothesis, we developed a detailed water balance that quantifies the contribution of groundwater discharge to the annual water budget of an extensively drained agricultural floodplain. A clear relationship between surface water radon measurements and groundwater level indicated alternating connection-disconnection dynamics between the drains and shallow groundwater. This relationship was used to develop a radon mass balance to quantitatively model groundwater discharge continuously throughout the year. Groundwater discharge varied by four orders of magnitude over the study period, with daily average rates ranging from 0 to 27,200 m(3) d(-1), peaking just a few hours after floods receded. Flood events occurred only 12% of the time yet contributed 72-76% of the total groundwater discharge. During flood recession periods, aerial groundwater discharge rates reached up to 325 cm d(-1) which were some of the highest rates ever estimated. We proposed that the high drainage density of this site (12.4 km constructed drains km(-2) catchment area) enhanced groundwater discharge during wet periods due to increased connectivity with the soil. Overall, groundwater discharge contributed 30-80% to the total surface water discharge. This study offers insight into the dynamic behavior of groundwater within an extensively drained floodplain, and the importance of capturing flood events to quantify total groundwater contribution to floodplain water balances.

AB Changes in the dynamics of sediment transport in a Mediterranean lake (sediment fluidization events) are linked to atmospheric circulations patterns (trough monthly precipitation). In the basins of Lake Banyoles, located in the northeast of Spain, water enters mainly through subterranean springs, and associated fluctuations in the vertical migration of sediment distribution (fluidization events) present episodic behavior as a result of episodic rainfall in the area. The initiation of the fluidization events takes place when the monthly rainfall is similar to 2.7 times greater than the mean monthly rainfall of the rainiest months in the area, especially in spring (April and May), October, and December. The duration of these events is found to be well correlated with the accumulated rainfall of the preceding 10 months before the process initiation. The rainfall, in turn, is mainly associated with six atmospheric circulation patterns among the 19 fundamental circulations that emerged in an earlier study focused on significant rainfall days in Mediterranean Spain. Among them, accentuated surface lows over the northeast of Spain, general northeasterly winds by low pressure centered to the east of Balearic Islands and short baroclinic waves over the Iberian Peninsula, with easterly flows over the northeastern coast of Spain, are found the most relevant atmospheric circulations that drive heavy rainfall events.

AB This paper investigates three categories of models that are derived from the equilibrium temperature concept to estimate water temperatures in the Loire River in France and the sensitivity to changes in hydrology and climate. We test the models' individual performances for simulating water temperatures and assess the variability of the thermal responses under the extreme changing climate scenarios that are projected for 2081-2100. We attempt to identify the most reliable models for studying the impact of climate change on river temperature (T-w). Six models are based on a linear relationship between air temperatures (T-a) and equilibrium temperatures (T-e), six depend on a logistic relationship, and six rely on the closure of heat budgets. For each category, three approaches that account for the river's thermal exchange coefficient are tested. In addition to air temperatures, an index of day length is incorporated to compute equilibrium temperatures. Each model is analysed in terms of its ability to simulate the seasonal patterns of river temperatures and heat peaks. We found that including the day length as a covariate in regression-based approaches improves the performance in comparison with classical approaches that use only T-a. Moreover, the regression-based models that rely on the logistic relationship between T-e and T-a exhibit root mean square errors comparable (0.90 degrees C) with those obtained with a classical five-term heat budget model (0.82 degrees C), despite a small number of required forcing variables. In contrast, the regressive models that are based on a linear relationship T-e=f(T-a) fail to simulate the heat peaks and are not advisable for climate change studies. The regression-based approaches that are based on a logistic relationship and the heat balance approaches generate notably similar responses to the projected climate changes scenarios. This similarity suggests that sophisticated thermal models are not preferable to cruder ones, which are less time-consuming and require fewer input data. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Hydrology in many agricultural landscapes around the world is changing in unprecedented ways due to the development of extensive surface and subsurface drainage systems that optimize productivity. This plumbing of the landscape alters water pathways, timings, and storage, creating new regimes of hydrologic response and driving a chain of environmental changes in sediment dynamics, nutrient cycling, and river ecology. In this work, we nonparametrically quantify the nature of hydrologic change in the Minnesota River Basin, an intensively managed agricultural landscape, and study how this change might modulate ecological transitions. During the growing season when climate effects are shown to be minimal, daily streamflow hydrographs exhibit sharper rising limbs and stronger dependence on the previous-day precipitation. We also find a changed storage-discharge relationship and show that the artificial landscape connectivity has most drastically affected the rainfall-runoff relationship at intermediate quantiles. Considering the whole year, we show that the combined climate and land use change effects reduce the inherent nonlinearity in the dynamics of daily streamflow, perhaps reflecting a more linearized engineered hydrologic system. Using a simplified dynamic interaction model that couples hydrology to river ecology, we demonstrate how the observed hydrologic change and/or the discharge-driven sediment generation dynamics may have modulated a regime shift in river ecology, namely extirpation of native mussel populations. We posit that such nonparametric analyses and reduced complexity modeling can provide more insight than highly parameterized models and can guide development of vulnerability assessments and integrated watershed management frameworks.

TI Optimizing water supply headworks operating rules under stochastic
   inputs: Assessment of genetic algorithm performance
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID RESERVOIR SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Realistic optimization of the operation of urban water supply headworks systems requires that the issues of system complexity and stochasticity be addressed. A promising way of achieving this is to couple probabilistic search methods such as genetic algorithms (GAs) with Monte Carlo simulation models. However, the objective function surface, characteristic of this genre of problem, exhibits piecewise flat regions separated by steep slopes. The size of these flat regions is affected by the frequency of droughts sampled in the Monte Carlo simulation. Although an earlier study proposed a GA variant that appears to robustly negotiate such objective function surfaces, the assessment was limited to a simple one-reservoir system. There remains therefore a legitimate concern that for more complex systems the GA may converge prematurely producing decisions of little practical value. This study assesses the ability of the GA to optimize key operating rules for a complex urban headworks system with nine reservoirs and interbasin transfers subject to a highly variable climate. Eight decisions affecting restriction rules, pump marks, and contingent desalination were optimized using an objective function that minimized expected annual costs. It is shown that the GA produced results that are judged consistent with the strategy that minimizes total expected costs. In addition, the sensitivity of the GA results to the length of the Monte Carlo simulation was investigated.

AB [ 1] This is an age of transition in groundwater policy. The ownership and control of aquifers, changing groundwater quality, and the impact of groundwater on the environment command the attention of policy makers around the globe. Substantial pressure exists for change in the laws and regulations governing groundwater, which are critical to the management of this critical resource. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the practical policy debate from an economic perspective. This study begins by outlining the basic stages of change in groundwater policy and their economic relevance. A set of physical, economic, and institutional indicators are suggested that may help to understand various country issues. The indicators are used to describe some actual experiences in groundwater policy in the United States and Spain that are examined for insights into common policy questions. This study suggests that the public authority to initiate groundwater policy innovations often results from the physical ties between surface and groundwater. In contexts rich with spatial and temporal externalities the situation is more complex, but this increases the social benefits that result from successful reform. A credible threat of losing rights is often necessary to create enough incentives to firm existing rights. Reductions in overall use are better achieved through purchasing and retiring rights, rather than through compensation for nonuse. Finally, the policy issues important to groundwater are often more fundamental than pricing alone. These insights may help policy makers adapt to emerging groundwater management problems.

AB Soil moisture is a critical environmental variable, as it significantly affects infiltration, evapotranspiration and surface and subsurface runoff processes. Measurement of soil moisture, however, has only recently become possible over large scales. In modelling applications, the spatial distribution of soil moisture is typically assumed to mirror that of a terrain attribute such as the wetness index of [Beven KJ, Kirkby MJ. A physically based, variable contributing area model of basin hydrology. Hydrol Sci Bull 1979;24(1):43-69] (e.g. TOPMODEL [2]. Intense ground-based measurements of the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the root zone have been conducted in Australia and New Zealand, allowing examination of the predictive power of various terrain attributes with respect to soil moisture. Here a method is developed that enables the generation of realistic spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture based on the changing importance of spatial attributes with average wetness condition (theta) over bar (t). Maps of terrain and other spatial attributes are combined and weighted according to relationships dependent on (theta) over bar (t) to generate simulated spatial patterns of soil moisture. The method is presently based on field data and requires spatial patterns of soil moisture for a range of (theta) over bar (t) conditions in order to establish relationships between (theta) over bar (t) and the attributes. Observed variability is introduced by adding an error term whose statistics are also a function of (theta) over bar (t). Ultimately generalised weightings could be derived, based on the literature or subjective assessment by the user. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many studies investigate river floods by analyzing annual maximum series that record the largest flow of each year, including many within-bank events inconsequential for human communities. Fewer focus on larger floods, especially at the continental scale. Using 473 streamgages across the conterminous United States with near-natural flow from 1966 to 2015, we characterized the seasonality, occurrence, and climatic associations of the 10 largest and 2 largest floods at each site. These are often overbank events that have ecosystem functions and pose risks to humans. We grouped sites into 14 clusters corresponding to climatic and physiographic regions and characterized their flood seasonality at a monthly resolution using a probabilistic method. We then evaluated annual occurrence regionally and nationally, and seasonal occurrence regionally, by complementing a traditional approach to trend analyses with a novel method based on expected occurrence. Relationships between flood occurrence and climate indices were also investigated. Large floods have strong seasonality in some regions, but in areas with numerous flood-generating mechanisms, seasonality is more complex. There is little evidence nationally that large riverine floods are more or less frequent than expected in recent years and only two regions show significant trends in annual counts; few show seasonal trends. We found some regional relationships between flood counts and climate indices, annually and seasonally; nationally the Pacific North American pattern is related to annual counts of the 2 largest floods. Large-flood occurrence was generally stable across the United States in the last five decades; this may or may not continue with projected warming.

ID SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; INDIAN-OCEAN; EL-NINO;
   ATMOSPHERE; DATASET; ICE
AB Southeastern Australia has been experiencing ongoing rainfall deficits since 1997. The spatial extent of the current drought closely corresponds to those regions where rainfall is influenced by interannual variations in the intensity of the subtropical ridge. An upward trend in the intensity of the subtropical ridge thus provides an explanation for the recent rainfall deficit. The possibility that slow variations in tropical modes of variability that are known to influence rainfall in the region, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, may have contributed to southeastern Australia rainfall deficits is investigated using a tripole sea surface temperature index. This index takes into account key influences on Australian climate from variations in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The tripole index correlates well with rainfall variations across southeastern Australia on interannual to decadal time scales in winter and spring but not in autumn when most of the recent rainfall deficits have occurred. The influence of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variations associated with the tripole on southeastern Australian rainfall is explained in terms of Rossby wave propagation, which helps us to understand why the impact is stronger in the southern half of the Murray-Darling Basin and why there is no relationship in autumn. On the basis of the linear relationship between the tripole SST variation and rainfall across the Murray-Darling Basin, we conclude that tropical SSTs have not contributed to the observed rainfall deficiencies in southeast Australia since 1997 but did contribute to the 1935-1945 rainfall deficits.

AB We carried out a laboratory experiment to examine the relationship between local rate of dissolution and local aperture during flow of a slightly acidic aqueous solution through a rough fracture in Carrara marble under a confining pressure of 0.2 MPa. Fracture surfaces were digitized in three dimensions before the fluid flow tests and after the tests.,Digital reconstruction of the aperture then allowed numerical simulation of flow patterns, and digital comparison of surfaces before and after dissolution allowed mapping of patterns of dissolution. We observed that bath mean aperture and fracture permeability decreased as a result of dissolution. Despite the low confining pressure, the experiments thus simulate dissolution in deeply buried formations, in contrast to the gaping and karst formation that occur under vanishingly low confining pressure in the shallow crust. We observed that the growth of new pathways for flow changed from stable to unstable as length scale increased. At the millimeter scale the fracture aperture evolved in stable fashion from a strongly heterogeneous arrangement of tortuous flow channels to a smoother topography, while at the scale of the full rock (50 mm), the aperture developed a single, broad flow channel. The scale dependence of the dissolution pattern may be the result of changes with scale in extent of reaction (i.e., the Damkohler number) and in the relative importance of diffusion (the Peclet number). Finally, we also see evidence of a negative relationship between local fluid flux and local rate of dissolution in some locations in the fracture.

AB Modeling to accurately predict river phytoplankton distribution and abundance is important in water quality and resource management. Nevertheless, the complex nature of eutrophication processes in highly connected river systems makes the task challenging. To model dynamics of river phytoplankton, represented by chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that explicitly accommodates seasonality and upstream-downstream spatial gradient in the structure. The utility of our model is demonstrated with an application to the Nakdong River (South Korea), which is a eutrophic, intensively regulated river, but functions as an irreplaceable water source for more than 13 million people. Chl a is modeled with two manageable factors, river flow, and total phosphorus (TP) concentration. Our model results highlight the importance of taking seasonal and spatial context into account when describing flow regimes and phosphorus delivery in rivers. A contrasting positive Chl a-flow relationship across stations versus negative Chl a-flow slopes that arose when Chl a was modeled on a station-month basis is an illustration of Simpson's paradox, which necessitates modeling Chl a-flow relationships decomposed into seasonal and spatial components. Similar Chl a-TP slopes among stations and months suggest that, with the flow effect removed, positive TP effects on Chl a are uniform regardless of the season and station in the river. Our model prediction successfully captured the shift in the spatial and monthly patterns of Chl a.

ID RATING CURVES
AB Most sediment toads are estimated from sediment-rating curves created by performing a Linear least-square regression on log-transformed sediment load-discharge data. When log-transformed sediment load-discharge data plots result in concave or convex curves, such regressions under- or overestimate sediment toads. Conflicting results exist regarding the accuracy/utility of using nonlinear regression to estimate loads. A nonlinear regression technique (optimized/constrained two different ways) was compared with the linear regression method at 26 United States Geological Survey gaging stations throughout the Upper Mississippi River basin. Sensitivity analyses were conducted at two stations, one having a concave sediment toad-discharge plot and one having a convex sediment toad-discharge plot, to determine each rating curve's ability, based on varying amounts of data, to predict annual and cumulative suspended sediment yields. With a 5-year calibration dataset, a nonlinear maximized r(2) statistic curve produced the best estimates for a station with a convex sediment Load-discharge retationship, while a nonlinear load-constrained curve produced the best estimates for a station with a concave sediment load-discharge relationship. At both stations (using 5-year calibration datasets), annual yield errors ranged from -54% to 112%, while 15- and 18-year cumulative yield errors ranged from about -21% to 13%. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

ID RAINFALL
AB This study presents an investigation of the time to peak of unit response functions for design flood studies. It is based on an empirical analysis of observed rainfall-runoff data for 49 basins in the UK and explores the relationship between unit response time to peak (t(p)) and flood peak magnitude (Q(p)). The results show that t(p) varies significantly between events but suggest a systematic relationship between t(p) and Q(p). The relationships which have been developed suggest that t(p) decreases with flood magnitude and approaches to an asymptotic value for very large values of Q(p). These findings confirm numerous physical and field investigations and also support the reduction in response time for probable maximum flood (PMF) recommended in the Soil Conservation Services method, the Flood Studies Report method and the Flood Estimation Handbook. The findings also suggest that t(p) should be modified in unit hydrograph methods of design flood analysis for return periods that differ from those used in deriving unit hydrographs. A simple correction curve has been developed for adjusting t(p) according to the design flood return period. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Capillary pressure (P-c)-saturation (S)-relative permeability (k(r)) relationships must be quantified to accurately predict non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) distribution in the subsurface. Several experimental techniques are presented here for two-fluid P-c-S-k(r) relationships for various saturation paths to better define the effect of fractional wettability on these relationships. During the primary drainage path of the P-c-S curves, the air-water system showed no distinct trend as a function of the fraction of sand treated by organosilane (S) to render it non-water wetting. In a NAPL-water system, however, a consistent decrease of capillary pressure with increase of the fraction of non-water wetting sands was observed. The much lower contact angle for air-water (a-w) system may result in the observed insensitivity of the a-w P-c-S curves to fractional wettability, at least for the PD pathway. For the main imbibition path of NAPL-water system, capillary pressure decreased as the fraction of the S component increased, requiring forced imbibition (negative capillary pressures) for a certain range of saturations. Systems with an increasing percentage of the S component also exhibited a higher water k(r) and lower NAPL or air k(r) at a given saturation for the primary drainage and main imbibition paths in both air water and NAPL-water systems. The increase of water kr with increase of the fraction of the S component can be explained by the ability of water to occupy larger and highly conductive pores in such a system. Experimental k(r)-S data for the primary drainage path of NAPL-water system presented here were used to test the Bradford et al. [Bradford SA, Abriola LM, Leij FJ. Wettability effects on two- and three-fluid relative permeabilities. J Contam Hydrol 1997;28:171-91] model and the modified Mualern model for estimating the k(r)-S curves from measured P-c-S data as a function of fractional wettability. Both models predicted significantly less variation in the k(r)-S curves than measured indicating that they did not adequately represent the system under investigation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

(2005) for river systems exhibiting branching and nonlinear damages. The Hung-Shaw scheme is robust to nonlinear damages, but not to hot spots occurring at the confluence of two branches. The Farrow et al. (2005) scheme is robust to branching, but not to nonlinear damages. We also compare the two schemes to each other. Neither dominates from a welfare perspective, but the comparison appears to tilt in favor of the Farrow et al. scheme.

AB Understanding how a watershed's physio-climatic characteristics affect its vulnerability to environmental (climatic and land use) change is crucial for managing these complex systems. In this study, we combine the strengths of recently developed exploratory modeling frameworks and comparative hydrology to quantify the relationship between watershed's vulnerability and its physio-climatic characteristics. We propose a definition of vulnerability that can be used by a diverse range of water system managers and is useful in the presence of large uncertainties in drivers of environmental change. This definition is related to adverse climate change and land use thresholds that are quantified using a recently developed exploratory modeling approach. In this way, we estimate the vulnerability of 69 watersheds in the United States to climate and land use change. We explore definitions of vulnerability that describe average or extreme flow conditions, as well as others that are relevant from the point of view of instream organisms. In order to understand the dominant controls on vulnerability, we correlate these indices with watershed's characteristics describing its topography, geology, drainage, climate, and land use. We find that mean annual flow is more vulnerable to reductions in precipitation in watersheds with lower average soil permeability, lower baseflow index, lower forest cover, higher topographical wetness index, and vice-versa. Our results also indicate a potential mediation of climate change impacts by regional groundwater systems. By developing such relationships across a large range of watersheds, such information can potentially be used to assess the vulnerability of ungauged watersheds to uncertain environmental change.

AB This study focuses on the effect of projected changes in rainfall, snow accumulation and snowmelt, and consequent changes in the timing of runoff on NYC water supply system storage and operation as simulated by the NYC reservoir system Operational Analysis and Simulation of Integrated Systems (OASIS) model. The Generalized Watershed Loading Functions-Variable Source Area (GWLF-VSA)-watershed model is used with future climate scenarios derived from different General Circulation Models (GCMs) to simulate future inflows to reservoirs that are part of the New York City Water Supply System (NYCWSS). Future scenarios that use current system operation rules and demands, but changed reservoir inflows, suggest that changes in precipitation and snowmelt will affect regional water availability on a seasonal basis. The combined effect of projected increases in winter air temperatures, increased winter rain, and earlier snowmelt may result in more runoff during winter. This will cause reservoir storage levels, water releases and spills to increase during the winter and earlier reservoir refill in the spring. An overall increase in precipitation will result in a reduction in number of days the system is under drought conditions, despite increased evapotranspiration later in the year. Copyright.

AB The role of stream networks and their hydrologic interaction with hillslopes and shallow groundwater in modifying and transporting watershed signals is an area of active research. One of the primary ways that stream networks can modify watershed signals is through spatially variable stream gains and losses, described herein as hydrologic turnover. We measured hydrologic gain and loss at the reach scale using tracer experiments throughout the Bull Trout watershed in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. We extended the results of reach scale experiments to the stream network using empirical relationships between (1) watershed area and stream discharge and (2) stream discharge and percent stream water loss to the groundwater system. We thus incorporate linkages between (1) hillslopes and stream networks via lateral inflows and (2) stream networks and shallow groundwater via hydrologic exchange. We implemented these relationships within a concise analytical framework to simulate hydrologic turnover across stream networks and estimate the variable influence exerted by upstream reaches and streamflow source locations on stream water composition across stream networks. Application to six natural Sawtooth watersheds and seven synthetic watersheds with varying topographic structure and stream network geometry indicated that contributions to discharge from any upstream source depend on the magnitude of the initial input, but also on the distribution of hydrologic turnover occurring along the stream network. The evolution of stream water source compositions along stream networks was unique in each watershed due to the combination of watershed structure and stream network geometry. Our results suggest that a distributed representation of hydrologic turnover at the stream network scale can improve understanding of how the stream network can modify source water compositions along the stream.

TI Subgrid parameterization for snow depth over mountainous terrain from
   flat field snow depth

   WEATHER; SCALE; ALPS
AB Snow depth is an important variable for a variety of models including land-surface, meteorological, and climate models. Various measurement networks were therefore developed to measure snow depth on the ground. Measurement stations are generally located in gentle terrain (flat field measurements) most often at lower or mid elevation. While these sites have provided a wealth of information, various studies have questioned the representativity of such flat field measurements for the surrounding topography, especially in alpine regions. Using highly resolved snow depth maps at the peak of winter from two distinct climatic regions in Switzerland and in the Spanish Pyrenees, we developed two parameterizations to estimate domain-averaged snow depth in coarse-scale model applications over complex topography using easy to derive topographic parameters. The first parameterization uses a commonly applied linear lapse rate. Removing the dominant elevation gradient in mean snow depth revealed remaining underlying correlations with other topographic parameters, in particular the sky view factor. The second parameterization combines a power law elevation trend scaled with the subgrid parameterized sky view factor. Using a variety of statistic measures showed that the more complex parameterization performs better when using mean high-resolution flat field snow depth. The performances slightly decreased when formulating the parameterizations for a single flat field snow depth measurement. Nevertheless, the more complex parameterization still outperformed the linear lapse rate model. As the parameterization was developed independently of a specific geographic region, we suggest it could be used to assimilate flat field snow depth or snowfall into coarse-scale snow model frameworks.

AB Forest harvesting often increases catchment quickflow (QF, water delivered rapidly to the stream channel), a metric of high-flow events controlling a catchment's solute and sediment export. Nevertheless, our understanding of QF responses to various silvicultural strategies (e.g., clearcutting, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) is incomplete. We present a 31-year examination of QF delivery from treatment (clearcut, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) and control catchments in a deciduous forest landscape in central Ontario, Canada. Growing season root-zone storage capacity was estimated using a water balance approach to evaluate temporal changes in QF response to precipitation (P) for pretreatment and posttreatment periods. Threshold relationships between QF and P were assessed for control and treatment catchments for pretreatment and posttreatment periods using piecewise regression. Root-zone storage capacity demarcated shifts in the hydrologic regime arising from forest harvesting and subsequent regeneration. This was particularly pronounced for clearcutting where postharvest decline in root-zone storage capacity was followed by a rise to preharvest values. Similar pretreatment threshold relationships between QF and P, and near-identical P thresholds for producing significant QF, reflected similar soil and overburden depths in the catchments. Harvesting effects were indicated by increases in QF/P ratios for relative small P and the number of P events that generated QF, thus changing treatment QF vs. P threshold relationships. Prior to harvesting there was no significant increase in QF with P below a threshold P of 35-45 mm; however, there was a significant QF vs. P relationship below this threshold for all treatments postharvest. Clearcutting increased the number of QF events for the entire postharvest period and the first 9-year postharvest compared to the other treatments; nevertheless, evidence for intertreatment differences in total QF depth delivered from the catchments during the growing season was inconclusive. Our work suggests that changes in threshold relationships between QF and P, coupled with knowledge of the physical processes underlying them, are useful when evaluating hydrologic responses to forest harvesting.

AB In a literature review of the recent advancements in mathematical hydrologic models applied in fractured karstic formations, we highlight the necessary improvements in the fluid dynamic equations that are commonly applied to the flow in a discrete fracture network (DFN) via channel network models. Fluid flow and pollutant transport modeling in karst aquifers should consider the simultaneous occurrence of laminar, nonlaminar, and turbulent fluxes in the fractures rather than the laminar flow by the cubic law that has been widely applied in the scientific literature. Some simulations show overestimations up to 75% of the groundwater velocity when non-laminar flows are neglected. Moreover, further model development is needed to address the issues of tortuosity of preferential saturated fluid flow in fractures suggesting adjustments of the size of the mean aperture in DFN models. During the past decade, DFN mathematical models have been significantly developed aimed at relating the three-dimensional structure of interconnected fractures within rocky systems to the specific fracture properties measurable on the rock outcrops with the use of reliefs, tracer/pumping tests, and geotechnical field surveys. The capabilities and limitations of previous reported hydrological models together with specific research advancements and findings in modeling equations are described herein. New software is needed for creating three-dimensional contour maps in fractured aquifers corresponding to the outputs of particle tracking simulations. Existing software based on the equivalent continuum or multiple-interacting continua cannot delineate the spread of pollutant migrations affected by the tortuous preferential flow pathways that occur in DFNs.

AB There are a number of challenges associated with the determination of relative permeability and capillary pressure. It is difficult to measure both parameters simultaneously on the same sample using conventional methods. Instead, separate measurements are made on different samples, usually with different flooding protocols. Hence, it is not certain that the pore structure and displacement processes used to determine relative permeability are the same as those when capillary pressure was measured. Moreover, at present, we do not use pore-scale information from high-resolution imaging to inform multiphase flow properties directly. We introduce a method using pore-scale imaging to determine capillary pressure from local interfacial curvature. This, in combination with pressure drop measurements, allows both relative permeabilities and capillary pressure to be determined during steady state coinjection of two phases through the core. A steady state waterflood experiment was performed in a Bentheimer sandstone, where decalin and brine were simultaneously injected through the core at increasing brine fractional flows from 0 to 1. The local saturation and the curvature of the oil-brine interface were determined. Using the Young-Laplace law, the curvature was related to a local capillary pressure. There was a detectable gradient in both saturation and capillary pressure along the flow direction. The relative permeability was determined from the experimentally measured pressure drop and average saturation obtained by imaging. An analytical correction to the brine relative permeability could be made using the capillary pressure gradient. The results for both relative permeability and capillary pressure are consistent with previous literature measurements on larger samples.

AB Hyporheic exchange plays a key role in the biogeochemical evolution of water and in ecosystem functioning at the local, reach, and watershed scales. Residence time is a fundamental metric to describe the possible transformation taking place in this exchange zone. With this in mind, we use a simple conceptual model to explore the residence time distributions (RTDs) of sinuosity-driven hyporheic zones (HZs) and to discriminate the individual effect of sinuosity (sigma), valley slope (J(x)), hydraulic conductivity (K), aquifer dispersivity (alpha(L)), and the biogeochemical timescales ( BTSs) that characterize the degradation of dissolved organic carbon in these hydrologic systems. We find that RTDs are characterized by one early mode and a late time power law behavior. For a given aquifer dispersivity, the shape of these distributions is stretched or compressed by changes in J(x), K, and sigma, having a strong influence on the net biogeochemical transformations within the HZ. Using BTSs proposed in previous studies and sensitivity analyses, we show the potential of sigma, J(x), and K to classify meander HZs as net sinks of nitrates or only modulators of the residence times in the subsurface where nitrate reduction is negligible. These findings can be used as predictive tools to quantify the potential of meanders as biogeochemical reactors at the watershed scale with the aid of remote sensing data and GIS processing techniques. These tools can guide experimental design, suggesting important locations to visit, sample, and/or instrument. Also, hyporheic restoration projects can use them for initial site selection and design of channel modifications.

AB Sixteen small catchments in the Maroondah region of Victoria, Australia were analysed using rainfall, temperature and streamflow time series with a rainfall-runoff model whose parameters efficiently characterize the hydrological response of a catchment. A set of catchment attributes for each of these catchments was then compared with the associated set of hydrological response characteristics of the catchments as estimated by the model. The time constant governing quickflow recession of streamflow (tau(q)) was related to the drainage network and catchment area. The time constant governing slowflow recession of streamflow (tau(s)) was related to the slope and shape of the catchment. The parameter governing evapotranspirative losses (f) was related to catchment gradient and vegetative water use. Forestry activities in the catchments changed evapotranspirative losses and thus total volume of streamflow, but did not affect the rate of streamflow recession.

AB Threshold behavior of stormflow response is an emergent pattern observed in several studies demonstrating subsurface storage controls on catchment rainfall-runoff dynamics. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition from negligible stormflow discharge response to rapid, linearly increasing stormflow identified by a single, uniquely defined threshold as a basic catchment attribute that relates to geophysical properties. Utilizing precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture data spanning 15 years from three catchments at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), we analyze how threshold behavior forms and varies at several timescales. We pose three hypotheses: (1) stormflow thresholds form at CHL as a function of antecedent soil moisture and gross precipitation, (2) thresholds vary seasonally and interannually, and (3) threshold variation through time implies greater long-term complexity of runoff controls beyond catchment geophysical properties, including forest canopy ecohydrologic feedbacks. We isolate threshold behavior of stormflow using piecewise regression analysis in short to long-term data sets with respect to antecedent soil moisture index and gross precipitation. We use this to investigate threshold variation over seasonal, interannual, and decadal timescales that encompass hydroclimatic extremes. Seasonal analysis reveals that thresholds are more variable between growing seasons than between dormant seasons. In growing seasons with greater water stress, stormflow thresholds are lower after controlling for soil moisture storage suggesting more complex, long-term rainfall-runoff relationships as a result of forest canopy response to water stress. We present a conceptual model of how vegetation-climate interactions influence long-term rainfall-runoff relationships creating interannual variability of stormflow thresholds and linear stormflow response.

AB Increased loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural and urban intensification has led to severe degradation of inland and coastal waters. Lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands (lentic systems) retain these nutrients, thus regulating their delivery to downstream waters. While the processes controlling N and P retention are relatively well-known, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how these processes manifest across spatial scales. We synthesized data from 600 lentic systems around the world to gain insight into the relationship between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nutrient retention. Our results indicate that the first-order reaction rate constant, k [T-1], is inversely proportional to the hydraulic residence time, tau [T], across 6 orders of magnitude in residence time for total N, total P, nitrate, and phosphate. We hypothesized that the consistency of the relationship points to a strong hydrologic control on biogeochemical processing, and validated our hypothesis using a sediment-water model that links major nutrient removal processes with system size. Finally, the k-tau relationships were upscaled to the landscape scale using a wetland size-frequency distribution. Results suggest that small wetlands play a disproportionately large role in landscape-scale nutrient processing-50% of nitrogen removal occurs in wetlands smaller than 10(2.5) m(2) in our example. Thus, given the same loss in wetland area, the nutrient retention potential lost is greater when smaller wetlands are preferentially lost from the landscape. Our study highlights the need for a stronger focus on small lentic systems as major nutrient sinks in the landscape.
   Plain Language Summary Excess nutrient pollution from intensive fertilizer use and farming operations poses an increasing threat to water quality worldwide. Lakes, streams, and wetlands restrict the movement of nutrients, and thus protect downstream waters. We have a limited understanding, however, of how removal processes are affected by the size and type of the water body. Based on a synthesis of data from lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands worldwide, we found that smaller water bodies tend to have higher nutrient removal rates. We applied our findings to the landscape scale and found that for the same wetland area lost, the loss of small wetlands corresponds to a greater loss in wetland nutrient removal potential. Such findings are significant to wetland protection and restoration efforts, which have historically focused on maximizing total wetland area rather than on preserving a distribution of different wetlands sizes within a landscape.

ID BED SHEAR-STRESS; VELOCITY DISTRIBUTIONS; PROBABILISTIC APPROACH;
   SEDIMENT; FLOW
AB Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) can be mounted horizontally at a river bank, yielding single-depth horizontal array observations of velocity across the river. This paper presents a semideterministic, semistochastic method to obtain continuous measurements of discharge from horizontal ADCP (HADCP) data in a tidal river. In the deterministic part, single-depth velocity data are converted to specific discharge by applying the law of the wall, which requires knowledge of local values of the bed roughness length (z(0)). A new filtration technique was developed to infer cross-river profiles of z(0) from moving boat ADCP measurements. Width-averaged values of z(0) were shown to be predominantly constant in time but differed between ebb and flood. In the stochastic part of the method, specific discharge was converted to total discharge on the basis of a model that accounts for the time lag between flow variation in the central part of the river and flow variation near the banks. Model coefficients were derived using moving boat ADCP data. The consistency of mutually independent discharge estimates from HADCP measurements was investigated to validate the method, analyzing river discharge and tidal discharge separately. Inaccuracy of the method is attributed primarily to mechanisms controlling transverse exchange of momentum, which produce temporal variation in the discharge distribution over the cross section. Specifically, development of river dunes may influence the portion of the discharge concentrated within the range of the HADCP.

TI Numerical model linking bed and bank evolution of incisional channel
   created by dam removal
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FORMED STRAIGHT RIVERS; EQUILIBRIUM BANKS; MOBILE BED; GRAVEL
AB This paper is devoted to a morphodynamic model of incision into a reservoir deposit driven by partial or total removal of the associated dam. The model considers the erosional processes upstream of the position of the former dam, rather then the deposition that occurs downstream. A theory is developed to predict the evolution of both the width and depth of the incisional channel that develops as erosion progresses. The theory is implemented in a numerical model, which is tested against and verified with flume experiments on sudden, complete removal of a dam. In these experiments a channel of a given initial width is allowed to freely incise into a noncohesive reservoir deposit after sudden dam removal. These experiments show a phenomenon that we refer to as '' erosional narrowing.'' That is, as a channel of a given initial width rapidly incises into the deposit, it can become narrower. As the rate of incision slows, this short period of rapid narrowing is followed by a longer period of widening. In the model the incisional channel is abstracted to a trapezoidal channel with well- defined bed and bank regions, both of which are allowed to erode. Balance between bed and bank erosion plays a key role in the morphodynamics of the channel. More specifically, rapid erosion of the bed can cause the channel to narrow even as bank erosion progresses. As the rate of bed erosion slows, bank erosion causes channel widening. This observed pattern is explained in the context of a theoretical model tested against the experiments.

TI Nonparametric method for estimating the effects of climatic and

ID ANNUAL WATER-BALANCE; RAINFALL SEASONALITY; VEGETATION CHANGES;
   DIMENSION; REGRESSION; YIELD
AB It is now well known that forested catchments have higher evapotranspiration than grassed catchments. Models for mean annual evapotranspiration have been developed to quantify catchment scale differences in mean annual evapotranspiration. Zhang et al. (2001) developed a simple, one parameter, model for the relationships between evapotranspiration and vegetation cover by evaluating the differences of model parameter values for different vegetation covers. However, other factors such as climate and catchment topography may also affect evapotranspiration and therefore the model parameter. Simple models acknowledging only categorical vegetation cover (forested, mixed, and grassed) may introduce some uncertainty, and more seriously, lead to inconsistent conclusions regarding relationships between vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Zhang et al. (2004) investigated possible inclusion of climatic factors and catchment characteristics to improve the estimation of mean annual evapotranspiration by modeling the residuals of the model parameter via a stepwise linear regression. In this paper we propose the use of a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) model for estimating the model parameter. In contrast to a simple stepwise regression, the MARS model provides not only insight into the interactions between explanatory factors but also a potential for prediction for ungauged basins as long as the values of explanatory factors are within the domain of calibration catchments. The MARS model is able to determine statistically significant factors and therefore is a powerful tool to identify important factors and their interactions. Using 241 Australian catchments where climate factors and catchment characteristics are available, we found the following significant terms affecting the mean annual evapotranspiration. (1) The functional relationship with the number of months that peak precipitation follows peak potential evapotranspiration (PfE) states that closer phase between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration results in less streamflow. (2) The interactions between coefficient of variation of precipitation and average storm depth shows that the value of the model parameter is smaller when the coefficient of variance of precipitation is larger than 2.24 and the average storm depth is less than 8.70 mm d(-1). (3) The interaction between relief ratio and average storm depth term shows that both larger average storm depth in flat catchments and smaller average storm depth in hilly catchments result in more streamflow. (4) The interaction between relief ratio and forest coverage reveals that for flat catchments with reasonable forest cover, increasing forest cover generally results in more mean annual evapotranspiration and less mean annual streamflow. The performance of the MARS model was assessed by a calibration-testing procedure to support its usage for prediction for ungauged basins.

AB The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the size of western Lake Erie cyanobacteria blooms, renewing concerns over phosphorus loading, a common driver of freshwater productivity. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the phosphorus load-bloom relationship, because of other biophysical factors that influence bloom size, and because the observed bloom size is not necessarily the true bloom size, owing to measurement error. In this study, we address these uncertainties by relating late-summer bloom observations to spring phosphorus load within a Bayesian modeling framework. This flexible framework allows us to evaluate three different forms of the load-bloom relationship, each with a particular combination of statistical error distribution and response transformation. We find that a novel implementation of a gamma error distribution, along with an untransformed response, results in a model with relatively high predictive skill and realistic uncertainty characterization, when compared to models based on more common statistical formulations. Our results also underscore the benefits of a hierarchical approach that enables assimilation of multiple sets of bloom observations within the calibration processes, allowing for more thorough uncertainty quantification and explicit differentiation between measurement and model error. Finally, in addition to phosphorus loading, the model includes a temporal trend component indicating that Lake Erie has become increasingly susceptible to large cyanobacteria blooms over the study period (2002-2013). Results suggest that current phosphorus loading targets will be insufficient for reducing the intensity of cyanobacteria blooms to desired levels, so long as the lake remains in a heightened state of bloom susceptibility.

AB Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is a fundamental soil property that regulates the fate of water in soils. Its measurement, however, is cumbersome and instead pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are routinely used to estimate it. Despite much progress over the years, the performance of current generic PTFs estimating K-s remains poor. Using machine learning, high-performance computing, and a large database of over 18,000 soils, we developed new PTFs to predict K-s. We compared the performances of four machine learning algorithms and different predictor sets. We evaluated the relative importance of soil properties in explaining K-s. PTF models based on boosted regression tree algorithm produced the best models with root-mean-squared log-transformed error in ranges of 0.4 to 0.3 (log(10)(cm/day)). The 10th percentile particle diameter (d(10)) was found to be the most important predictor followed by clay content, bulk density (rho(b)), and organic carbon content (C). The sensitivity of K-s to soil structure was investigated using rho(b) and C as proxies for soil structure. An inverse relationship was observed between rho(b) and K-s, with the highest sensitivity at around 1.8 g/cm(3) for most textural classes. Soil C showed a complex relationship with K-s with an overall positive relation for fine-textured and midtextured soils but an inverse relation for coarse-textured soils. This study sought to maximize the extraction of information from a large database to develop generic machine learning-based PTFs for estimating K-s. Models developed here have been made publicly available and can be readily used to predict K-s.

AB Natural and anthropogenic fractured aquifers and reservoirs are dual porosity matrix-fracture systems, where the fracture network provides highly-conductive flow pathways and the low-permeability matrix stores most of the fluid. The coupling between flow and mechanical deformation in fractured media is often modeled using the classical theory of dual-porosity poroelasticity (DPP), based on Barenblatt's hypothesis of pressure equilibrium inside the rock matrix blocks. Equilibrium can be expected if the matrix blocks are small and the matrix diffusion time is comparable to the flow time scales along the fractures. In practice, matrix blocks may be large enough so that diffusion time scales are long, and the equilibrium hypothesis breaks down. Here, we study nonequilibrium effects in coupled flow and deformation in fractured media. We compare analytical predictions and modeling results of coupled flow and deformation in heterogeneous fractured porous media. The theoretical analysis is a nonequilibrium, dual-porosity model. We use this theory to (a) Reveal the limitations of classical DPP formulations. (b) Obtain the scalings for drainage and displacement to be expected for coupled flow and deformation in highly heterogeneous, fractured media. (c) Identify what behavior to expect in fractured aquifers and reservoirs regarding flow and deformation. We observe strong tailing in fluid fluxes and land subsidence that cannot be captured by the classical DPP approach or a single porosity effective medium approach. We show that theoretical predictions from the multirate DPP model and high-fidelity models agree, even for highly heterogeneous matrix-fracture systems, and reproduce the observed nonequilibrium effects.

ID PAYMENT BEHAVIOR; SERVICES; QUALITY; MODEL
AB This paper investigates nonpayment behavior in Guatemala. Determinants of nonpayment behavior are identified through zero-inflated negative binomial regression models in order to take into account particular distributional characteristics of the amount of outstanding payments. Findings indicate that nonpayment behavior is a demonstration of consumer dissatisfaction with current water services. The amount of outstanding bill payments also responds to system unreliability. Results also suggest that nonpayment behaviors are more prominent in community-managed systems than in municipal systems. No evidence was found on a potential relationship between nonpayment behavior and household income. Policy implications are discussed.

The model is of the Biot type and incorporates the capillary pressure relationship. The finite element method is used for the discrete approximation of the partial differential equations governing the problem. The temporal discretization error, iteration error and stability error are evaluated. The model is validated with respect to a documented experiment on semisaturated soil behavior. Other examples involving an air storage problem in an aquifer and a flexible footing resting on a semisaturated soil are also presented.

ID SYSTEMS
AB A combined simulation-genetic algorithm (GA) optimization model is developed to determine optimal reservoir operational rule curves of the Nam Don Reservoir and Irrigation Project in Thailand. The GA and simulation models operate in parallel over time with interactions through their solution procedure. A GA is selected as an optimization model, instead of traditional techniques, owing to its powerful and robust performance and simplicity in combining with a simulation technique. A GA is different from conventional optimization techniques in the way that it uses objective function information and does not require its derivatives, whereas in real-world optimization problems the search space may include discontinuities and may often include a number of sub-optimum peaks. This may cause difficulties for calculus-based and enumerative schemes, but not in a GA. The simulation model is run to determine the net system benefit associated with state and control variables. The combined simulation-GA model is applied to determine the optimal upper and lower rule curves on a monthly basis for the Nam Oon Reservoir, Thailand. The objective function is maximum net system benefit subject to given constraints for three scenarios of cultivated areas. The monthly release is calculated by the simulation model in accordance with the given release policy, which depends on water demand. The optimal upper and lower rule curves are compared with the results of the HEC-3 model (Reservoir System Analysis for Conservation model) calculated by the Royal Irrigation Department, Thailand, and those obtained using the standard operating policy. It was found that the optimal rule curves yield the maximum benefit and minimum damages caused by floods and water shortages. The combined simulation-GA model shows an excellent performance in terms of its optimization results and efficient computation. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We present a numerical scheme for the computation of conservative fluid velocity, pressure and temperature fields in a porous medium. For the velocity and pressure we use the primal-dual mixed finite element method of Trujillo and Thomas while for the temperature we use a cell-centered finite volume method. The motivation for this choice of discretization is to compute accurate conservative quantities. Since the variant of the mixed finite element method we use is not commonly used, the numerical schemes are presented in detail.

AB Meltwater from glaciers is not only a stable source of water but also affects downstream streamflow dynamics. One of these dynamics is the interannual variability of streamflow. Glaciers can moderate streamflow variability because the runoff in the glacierized part, driven by temperature, correlates negatively with the runoff in the non-glacierized part of a catchment, driven by precipitation, thereby counterbalancing each other. This is also called the glacier compensation effect (GCE), and the effect is assumed to depend on relative glacier cover. Previous studies found a convex relationship between streamflow variability and glacier cover of different glacierized catchments, with lowest streamflow variability at a certain optimum glacier cover. In this study, we aim to revisit these previously found curves to find out if a universal relationship between interannual streamflow variability and glacier cover exists, which could potentially be used in a space-for-time substitution analysis. Moreover, we test the hypothesis that the dominant climate drivers (here precipitation and temperature) switch around the suggested optimum of the curve. First, a set of virtual nested catchments, with the same absolute glacier area but varying non-glacierized area, were modelled to isolate the effect of glacier cover on streamflow variability. The modelled relationship was then compared with a multi-catchment data set of gauged glacierized catchments in the European Alps. In the third step, changes of the GCE curve over time were analysed. Model results showed a convex relationship and the optimum in the simulated curve aligned with a switch in the dominant climate driver. However, the multi-catchment data and the time change analyses did not suggest the existence of a universal convex relationship. Overall, we conclude that GCE is complex due to entangled controls and changes over time in glacierized catchments. Therefore, care should be taken to use a GCE curve for estimating and/or predicting interannual streamflow variability in glacierized catchments.

AB The closure problem of representing hydrological boundary fluxes given the state of the system has been described as the scientific Holy Grail' of hydrology. This relationship between storage state and flux should be hysteretic and scale dependent because of the differences between velocities and celerities in a hydrological systemeffectively velocities are storage controlled, and celerities are controlled by storage deficits. To improve our understanding of the nature of these relationships a new hydrology model is used (the Multiple Interacting Pathways or MIPs model) to explore the influence of catchment scale on storage-flow-transport relationships, and their non-linearities. The MIPs model has been shown to produce acceptable simulations of both flow and tracer, i.e. of both celerities and velocities, at the Gardsjon catchment in Sweden. In this study the model is used to simulate scaled versions of the Gardsjon catchment to allow us for the first time to investigate the influence of scale on the non-linearities in storage-flow-transport relationships, and help us steer the quest for the scientific hydrological Holy Grail'. The simulations reveal the influence of scale on flow response in the nature of storage-discharge hysteresis and its links with antecedent storage; fractal-like systematic change of mean output travel times with scale; the effect of scale on input, output and storage residence time distributions; hysteric relations between storage and output travel times and links between storage and water table level hysteresis.

DE aquifer; groundwater; nonlinear hydraulic conductivity; transmissivity;
   large diameter well
AB Darcian flow law in aquifers assumes that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is constant and the groundwater movement is due only to the piezometric level changes through hydraulic gradient. In practice, after the well development the aquifer just around the well has comparatively larger hydraulic conductivity and gradient. Patchy aquifer solutions in the literature consider sudden hydraulic conductivity changes with distance for the steady state flow. The change of transmissivity is demonstrated by the application of slope-matching procedure to actual field data. It is the main purpose of this paper to derive simple analytical expressions for aquifer parameter evaluations with steadily decreasing hydraulic conductivity around the well. Spatial nonlinear hydraulic conductivity changes around a large-diameter well within the depression cone of a confined aquifer are considered as exponentially decreasing functions of the radial distance.

AB We study the seasonal dynamics of the eastern Pacific (CHOCO) and Caribbean low-level jets (LLJ), and aerial rivers (AR) acting on tropical and subtropical South America. Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979-2012), we show that the convergence of both LLJs over the eastern Pacific-western Colombia contributes to the explanation of the region's world-record rainfall. Diverse variables involved in the transport and storage of moisture permit the identification of an AR over northern South America involving a midtropospheric easterly jet that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Andes, with stronger activity in April to August. Other major seasonal AR pathways constitute part of a large gyre originating over the tropical North Atlantic, veering to the southeast over the eastern Andes and reaching regions of northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. We illustrate the distribution of average seasonal precipitation along the LLJs and AR pathways with data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (1998-2011), combined with considerations of CAPE, topography, and land cover. In addition, the theory of the biotic pump of atmospheric moisture (BiPAM) is tested at seasonal time scales, and found to hold in 8 out of 12 ARs, and 22 out of 32 forest-covered tracks (64% in distance) along the ARs. Deviations from BiPAM's predictions of rainfall distribution are explained by the effects of topography, orography, and land cover types different from forests. Our results lend a strong observational support to the BiPAM theory at seasonal time scales over South American forested flat lands.

AB With increasing concerns about the impact of warming temperatures on water resources, more attention is being paid to the relationship between runoff and precipitation, or runoff efficiency. Temperature is a key influence on Colorado River runoff efficiency, and warming temperatures are projected to reduce runoff efficiency. Here, we investigate the nature of runoff efficiency in the upper Colorado River (UCRB) basin over the past 400 years, with a specific focus on major droughts and pluvials, and to contextualize the instrumental period. We first verify the feasibility of reconstructing runoff efficiency from tree-ring data. The reconstruction is then used to evaluate variability in runoff efficiency over periods of high and low flow, and its correspondence to a reconstruction of late runoff season UCRB temperature variability. Results indicate that runoff efficiency has played a consistent role in modulating the relationship between precipitation and streamflow over past centuries, and that temperature has likely been the key control. While negative runoff efficiency is most common during dry periods, and positive runoff efficiency during wet years, there are some instances of positive runoff efficiency moderating the impact of precipitation deficits on streamflow. Compared to past centuries, the 20th century has experienced twice as many high flow years with negative runoff efficiency, likely due to warm temperatures. These results suggest warming temperatures will continue to reduce runoff efficiency in wet or dry years, and that future flows will be less than anticipated from precipitation due to warming temperatures.

AB A mathematical model is advanced to simulate dynamically and spatially varied shallow water flow and soil detachment, transport, and deposition in rills. The model mimics the dynamic process of rill evolution, including variable rates of sediment redistribution along the bed and changes in local bed morphology. The sediment source term in the model uses a point scale, probabilistic relationship based on turbulent flow mechanics and a recently developed sediment transport relationship for rills based on stream power. The interdependent feedback loops between channel bed morphology, local flow hydraulics, and local scour and deposition, within the framework of the full hydrodynamic equations with inertial terms, constitute a mathematical model with the capacity to represent spatial variability and temporal evolution of the rill. Finite elements were applied to numerically solve the hydrodynamic and sediment continuity equations. A series of laboratory flume experiments were performed to evaluate the model. Initial bed slopes were 3, 5, and 7% with step increases of water inflow rates of 7.6, 11.4, and 15.2 L min(-1). The soil material used in the flume was a kaolinitic, sandy-clay loam. The rill model equations were solved for increasingly complex cases of spatial and temporal variabilities. The model followed measured patterns of morphological changes as the rill evolved, which suggests that the feedback loops in the model between erosion, bed morphological changes, and hydraulics were adequate to capture the essence of rill evolution.

TI Role of Bioroughness, Bioirrigation, and Turbulence on Oxygen Dynamics

AB Models that have been developed to quantify the oxygen flux at the sediment-water interface (SWI) generally do not explicitly consider the influence of bioroughness (mounds and burrows) and bioirrigation. We performed a numerical study of the influence of overlying water velocity, bioroughness, and bioirrigation on the oxygen flux across the SWI. We found that compared with a flat bed, bioroughness significantly increases O-2 transport at the SWI as a result of enhanced turbulence and pressure differences across the roughness. Bioirrigation can also enhance O-2 transport across the SWI by a factor of up to 10 when the roughness Reynolds number (Re-*) is low, but the influence of bioirrigation decreases with increasing Re-*. Burrows increase O-2 penetration depth, and bioirrigation causes asymmetric distributions of O-2 along burrows. Despite the complexity of O-2 distribution in sediments, the net exchange across the SWI can be described by the relationship of O'Connor and Harvey (2008, https://doi.org/10.1029/2008WR007160) (D-e/D-m/Re*Pe1:2 = a = 0:0005) when the shape is two-dimensional or when the burrow density is low. When the burrow density is large, flow is three-dimensional and flow interactions between burrows become important. Under these conditions the net exchange across the SWI increases by up to a factor of 4. A burrow number is introduced, Bu = [burrow density](1/2) [burrow height], to correct the coefficient in O'Connor and Harvey's relationship, that is, a = 0.005 for Bu < 0.05 and a = 0.02 for Bu >> 0.1.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, but estimating ET in mountainous regions is challenging. In this study, the performance of a generalized nonlinear formulation of the complementary principle while estimating daily ET was evaluated, and the spatial-temporal variation of ET was analyzed across four vegetation types along an elevation gradient on Mount Gongga, Southwest China. The values of the calibrated Priestley and Taylor coefficients for each of the four sites ranged from 0.98 to 1.13. The correlation coefficients between the estimated and observed daily actual evapotranspiration for each of the four sites ranged from 0.71 to 0.92. A markedly asymmetrical complementary relationship existed among the four studied sites, and the values showed less scattered during the wet season. The annual ET rates were 779.12, 781.63, 701.77, and 625.17 mm/yr in the broadleaf forest (BLF), broadleaf and coniferous mixed forest (BCF), coniferous forest (CF), and shrub land (SL), respectively, and showed a decreasing trend of 9.72 mm per 100 m along the elevation gradient. After recalibration of the seasonal (e) values, the estimated annual ET rates increased and were closer to the observed values in BLF and BCF. The results indicate that daily ET in mountainous areas can be estimated using the generalized nonlinear formulation of the complementary relationship together with routine meteorological data alone, but seasonal changes in (e) values should be taken into consideration in forests with deciduous trees.

AB The effect of groundwater nutrient inputs on river and estuary water quality and the potential impacts of urbanization on groundwater are central concerns in many coastal areas. It has been previously identified that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can be the dominant form of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in some aquifers. However, there is a paucity of evidence about the sources and flow paths of DON, relative to inorganic nitrogen in groundwater. DON and dissolved organic carbon/DON were first compared against different landscape variables in this study, and no significant relationships were found. However, the relationships became statistically significant when shallow samples (sampling depth < 10 m) were separated from deep samples. A random forest model and sensitivity analysis were then applied to further our understanding of the ecohydrological drivers and seasonal patterns that shape DON variability. The random forest algorithm was built to classify 171 groundwater wellbores into three classes (low: <0.5 mg/L; medium: 0.5-2.5 mg/L; and high: >2.5 mg/L) which achieved 72% classification accuracy using landscape characteristics, hydrological conditions, and temporal information. The results indicated that the effects of landscapes on sandy shallow groundwater DON were controlled both by certain landscape characteristics and depth to groundwater. A conceptual model of groundwater DON is therefore proposed where the balance of exposure and processing time scales from the surface to groundwater is the critical control on the preservation of landscape signatures; we expect that this conceptual model would be applicable for other sandy, shallow groundwater areas.

DE cold regions; critical zone; northern environments; stable isotopes;
   soil isotopes; xylem isotopes
AB We compared stable isotopes of water in plant stem (xylem) water and soil collected over a complete growing season from five well-known long-term study sites in northern/cold regions. These spanned a decreasing temperature gradient from Bruntland Burn (Scotland), Dorset (Canadian Shield), Dry Creek (USA), Krycklan (Sweden), to Wolf Creek (northern Canada). Xylem water was isotopically depleted compared to soil waters, most notably for deuterium. The degree to which potential soil water sources could explain the isotopic composition of xylem water was assessed quantitatively using overlapping polygons to enclose respective data sets when plotted in dual isotope space. At most sites isotopes in xylem water from angiosperms showed a strong overlap with soil water; this was not the case for gymnosperms. In most cases, xylem water composition on a given sampling day could be better explained if soil water composition was considered over longer antecedent periods spanning many months. Xylem water at most sites was usually most dissimilar to soil water in drier summer months, although sites differed in the sequence of change. Open questions remain on why a significant proportion of isotopically depleted water in plant xylem cannot be explained by soil water sources, particularly for gymnosperms. It is recommended that future research focuses on the potential for fractionation to affect water uptake at the soil-root interface, both through effects of exchange between the vapour and liquid phases of soil water and the effects of mycorrhizal interactions. Additionally, in cold regions, evaporation and diffusion of xylem water in winter may be an important process.

TI Application of the Beer-Lambert Model to Attenuation of

AB Models of primary production in aquatic systems must include a means to estimate subsurface light. Such models often use the Beer-Lambert law, assuming exponential attenuation of light with depth. It is further assumed that the diffuse attenuation coefficient may be estimated as a summation of scattering/absorbing constituent concentrations multiplied by their respective specific attenuation coefficients. While theoretical deviations from these assumptions have been documented, it is useful to consider the empirical performance of this common approach. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels and water quality conditions were recorded weekly from six to eight monitoring stations in western Lake Erie between 2012 and 2016. Exponential PAR extinction models yielded a mean attenuation coefficient of 1.55m (interquartile range=0.74-1.90m). While more complex light attenuation models are available, analysis of residuals indicated that the simple Beer-Lambert model is adequate for shallow, eutrophic waters similar to western Lake Erie (R-2>0.9 for 96% of samples). Three groups of water quality variables were predictive of PAR attenuation: total and nonvolatile suspended particles, dissolved organic substances (dissolved organic carbon and chromophoric dissolved organic matter), and organic solids (volatile suspended solids and chlorophyll). Multiple regression models using these variables predicted 3-90% of the variability in PAR attenuation, with a median adjusted R-2=0.86. Explanatory variables within these groups may substitute for each other while maintaining similar model performance, indicating that various combinations of water quality variables may be useful to predict PAR attenuation, depending on availability within a model framework or monitoring program.

AB The determination of effective diffusion coefficients of gases or solutes in the water-saturated pore space of mudrocks is time consuming and technically challenging. Yet reliable values of effective diffusion coefficients are important to predict migration of hydrocarbon gases in unconventional reservoirs, dissipation of (explosive) gases through clay barriers in radioactive waste repositories, mineral alteration of seals to geological CO2 storage reservoirs, and contaminant migration through aquitards. In this study, small-angle and very small angle neutron scattering techniques have been utilized to determine a range of transport properties in mudrocks, including porosity, pore size distributions, and surface and volume fractal dimensions of pores and grains, from which diffusive transport parameters can be estimated. Using a fractal model derived from Archie's law, we calculate effective diffusion coefficients from these parameters and compare them to laboratory-derived effective diffusion coefficients for CO2, H-2, CH4, and HTO on either the same or related mudrock samples. The samples include Opalinus Shale from the underground laboratory in Mont Terri, Switzerland, Boom Clay from a core drilled in Mol, Belgium, and a marine claystone cored in Utah, USA. The predicted values were compared to laboratory diffusion measurements. The measured and modeled diffusion coefficients show good agreement, differing generally by less than factor 5. Neutron or X-ray scattering analysis is therefore proposed as a novel method for fast, accurate estimation of effective diffusion coefficients in mudrocks, together with simultaneous measurement of multiple transport parameters including porosity, pore size distributions, and surface areas, important for (reactive) transport modeling.

AB Understanding the efficacy of revised watershed management methods is important to mitigating the impacts of urbanization on streamflow. We evaluated the influence of land use change, primarily as urbanization, and stormwater control measures on the relationship between precipitation and stream discharge over an 8-year period for five catchments near Clarksburg, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. A unit-hydrograph model based on a temporal transfer function was employed to account for and standardize temporal variation in rainfall pattern, and properly apportion rainfall to streamflow at different time lags. From these lagged relationships, we quantified a correction to the precipitation time series to achieve a hydrograph that showed good agreement between precipitation and discharge records. Positive corrections appeared to include precipitation events that were of limited areal extent and therefore not captured by our rain gages. Negative corrections were analysed for potential causal relationships. We used mixed-model statistical techniques to isolate different sources of variance as drivers that mediate the rainfall-runoff dynamic before and after management. Seasonal periodicity mediated rainfall-runoff relationships, and land uses (i.e. agriculture, natural lands, wetlands and stormwater control measures) were statistically significant predictors of precipitation apportionment to stream discharge. Our approach is one way to evaluate actual effectiveness of management efforts in the face of complicating circumstances and could be paired with cost data to understand economic efficiency or life cycle aspects of watershed management.

AB Pore-scale velocity and turbulence structures near streambeds may control solute transport and dispersion in streams. In this study, pore-scale flow and transport simulations are performed to investigate the effects of porescale processes on anomalous transport, which is often manifested by remarkably long residence times of solute particles, in coupled free-flow and porous media systems. By solving the 2D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations integrated with a renormalization group k - epsilon turbulence model, we resolve complex pore-scale flows featured by vortices and preferential flows. Then, we incorporate the simulated velocity and turbulence fields into a Lagrangian particle tracking model that considers advection, turbulent diffusion, and molecular diffusion. Simulation results reveal that the interplay between pore-scale vortices and turbulence structures near the free-flow-permeable bed interface controls anomalous transport. High porosity induces strong turbulence penetration and preferential flow paths within permeable beds. The enhanced subsurface turbulence facilitates the escape of solute particles from recirculation zones via turbulent diffusion, causing steep power-law slopes in breakthrough curves (BTCs). In contrast, low porosity introduces heavy tailing in BTCs from particles that are trapped in the near-interface recirculation zones characterized by low velocities and limited turbulence. We upscale and predict particle transport via a Spatial Markov model (SMM) honoring the interplay between Lagrangian velocity distribution and velocity correlation. The SMM reproduces anomalous transport behaviors obtained from the numerical simulations. These results demonstrate that Lagrangian velocity statistics effectively encode anomalous transport mechanisms in the coupled systems.

AB Assessing the water budget closures and source of water budget imbalances is fundamental to improving the understanding of changes in the hydrological system and their associated impacts. We analyzed the long-term (1982-2016) water budget for 1,561 watersheds by using various observed data sets for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), observed streamflow (Q), and total water storage change (Delta TWS). The results show that 93%, 79%, 44%, and 20% of watersheds show water imbalances ratio less than 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5% of their corresponding precipitation. The average absolute water imbalance ratio for all watersheds is 14.2% of P. Watersheds showing large water imbalance ratio values are mostly located in biomes of Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Boreal Forests/Taiga, and Tundra. Different P, ET, and Q data set combinations result in different degrees of water imbalance. The water budget imbalance ratio shows a significant negative relationship with humidity index and vegetation coverage, while a positive relationship with the proportions of irrigation area and watershed area. Showing small water imbalances for most watersheds, reanalysis precipitation data set (ERA5 and MSWEP), MTE evapotranspiration data set performed better than other data sets in water budget analyses in most biomes. The uncertainties of P, ET, Q, and Delta TWSGRACE contribute to 40.1%, 14.3%, 26.6%, and 19% of the water budget imbalance on average, respectively. Improving the accuracy of P and ET estimates, and streamflow measurements are critical to better understanding the water budget and improves modeling of hydrological processes.

AB Flooding in forested areas can release nutrients via organic matter flushing and organic matter decomposition and contribute to nutrient loading in aquatic ecosystems. Organic matter content may set an upper limit for nutrient release during flooding, but variation in timing, depth, duration of inundation, and site organic matter substrate inhibit comparison across sites and events. We used data collected during a whole-ecosystem flooding experiment conducted at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario to examine the relationship between site organic matter content and nutrient release on both a short-term (first 3 weeks) and annual scale (open-water season). Three upland forest sites with differing amounts of organic matter stored in soil and vegetation were flooded to create experimental reservoirs. We hypothesized that the magnitude of nutrient release would be related to the organic matter content in each site. We found that nutrient concentrations increased relative to low-nutrient water pumped into each reservoir at both scales, but there was no relationship between site organic matter content and short-term total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations or annual TN and TP fluxes. Additionally, N and P release rates differed, decreasing TN:TP ratios in reservoirs and outflows relative to inflows. Nutrient concentrations increased immediately after inundation each year and continued for 5 years of repeated flooding. Predicted increases in flooding due to changing precipitation patterns and reservoir creation may cause forested areas to be a long-term nutrient source to aquatic ecosystems. Over time, nutrient accumulation may affect water quality, shift biological communities, and influence ecosystem functioning.

AB Using data collected from collocated hillslopes in central Iowa, the United States, the authors (1) explored the spatial variability of runoff coefficient at the event scale by examining the relationships between the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of runoff coefficient and the mean and (2) analyzed the temporal persistence of spatial pattern of runoff coefficient using Spearman rank and Pearson correlation coefficient. This study considered 12 cropland hillslopes with 0-20% native prairie vegetation coverage distributed at different hillslope locations. Seventy runoff events over the period 2008-2011 were investigated, of which 51 occurred during crop active growing season, when the hydrologic responses of crops and prairie vegetation are similar. For these events, the spatial coefficient of variation had a median value of 0.80, which indicate high variation of event-scale runoff coefficients across neighboring hillslopes. This spatial variation largely cannot be consistently explained by the individual hillslope structural properties investigated. The standard deviation and mean of runoff coefficient showed a convex upward relationship across the range of runoff coefficients, with the maximum standard deviation value at the mean runoff coefficient of about 0.48. The coefficient of variation exponentially decreased with increasing runoff coefficient. For 71% of the cases, the results of both correlation analyses were statistically significant (p0.05), which indicate stable spatial pattern of runoff coefficient across events. This temporal persistence could be disrupted under extremely dry and wet conditions. The spatial variation-mean empirical relation and the temporal persistence of spatial pattern provide insight for parameterizing spatial variability of runoff coefficient in distributed hydrologic models.

AB Storm events in montane catchments are the main cause of mobilization of solutes and particulates into and within stream channels in coastal California. Nonlinear behavior of nutrients and suspended sediments during storms is evident in the hysteresis that arises in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships. We examined patterns in the C-Q hysteresis of nutrients (NO3, NH4+, DON, and PO43) and total suspended solids (TSS) during storms across 10 sites and water years 2002-2015 by quantifying the slope of the C-Q relationship and the rotational pattern of the hysteresis loop. We observed several hysteresis types in the similar to 400 storms included in our study. Concentrations of constituents associated with sediment transport (PO43 and TSS) peaked during high flows. Conversely, nitrogen species had hysteretic responses such as dilution with clockwise rotation in urban sites and enrichment with anticlockwise rotation in undeveloped sites. The wide range of C-Q responses that occurred among sites and seasons reflected the variable hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics of catchments and storms. Responses for nitrate in nested catchments differed in slope and rotation of C-Q hysteresis. Upland undeveloped and lowland urban sites had anticlockwise rotation at the onset of the rainy season following a dry year, which implied a delay in the transport of this solute to the streams. Slopes by the middle of the rainy season showed that the urban site switched from dilution to enrichment, and then again to dilution with clockwise rotation at the end of the season, which implied high initial concentrations and proximal sources.

AB Human alterations to hydrology have globally impacted wetland ecosystems. Preventing or reversing these impacts is a principal focus of restoration efforts. However, restoration effectiveness is often hampered by limited information on historical landscape properties and hydrologic regime. To help address this gap, we developed a novel statistical approach for inferring flows and inundation frequency (i.e., hydroperiod, HP) in wetlands where changes in spatial vegetation and geomorphic patterns have occurred due to hydrologic alteration. We developed an analytical expression for HP as a transformation of the landscape-scale stage-discharge relationship. We applied this model to the Everglades "ridge-slough'' (RS) landscape, a patterned, lotic peatland in southern Florida that has been drastically degraded by compartmentalization, drainage, and flow diversions. The new method reliably estimated flow and HP for a range of RS landscape patterns. Crucially, ridge-patch anisotropy and elevation above sloughs were strong drivers of flow-HP relationships. Increasing ridge heights markedly increased flow required to achieve sufficient HP to support peat accretion. Indeed, ridge heights inferred from historical accounts would require boundary flows 3-4 times greater than today, which agrees with restoration flow estimates from more complex, spatially distributed models. While observed loss of patch anisotropy allows HP targets to be met with lower flows, such landscapes likely fail to support other ecological functions. This work helps inform restoration flows required to restore stable ridge-slough patterning and positive peat accretion in this degraded ecosystem, and, more broadly, provides tools for exploring interactions between landscape and hydrology in lotic wetlands and floodplains.

AB Fluvial landscapes are dissected by channels, and at their upstream termini are channel heads. Accurate reconstruction of the fluvial domain is fundamental to understanding runoff generation, storm hydrology, sediment transport, biogeochemical cycling, and landscape evolution. Many methods have been proposed for predicting channel head locations using topographic data, yet none have been tested against a robust field data set of mapped channel heads across multiple landscapes. In this study, four methods of channel head prediction were tested against field data from four sites with high-resolution DEMs: slopearea scaling relationships; two techniques based on landscape tangential curvature; and a new method presented here, which identifies the change from channel to hillslope topography along a profile using a transformed longitudinal coordinate system. Our method requires only two user-defined parameters, determined via independent statistical analysis. Slope-area plots are traditionally used to identify the fluvial-hillslope transition, but we observe no clear relationship between this transition and field-mapped channel heads. Of the four methods assessed, one of the tangential curvature methods and our new method most accurately reproduce the measured channel heads in all four field sites (Feather River CA, Mid Bailey Run OH, Indian Creek OH, Piedmont VA), with mean errors of -11, -7, 5, and -24 m and 34, 3, 12, and -58 m, respectively. Negative values indicate channel heads located upslope of those mapped in the field. Importantly, these two independent methods produce mutually consistent estimates, providing two tests of channel head locations based on independent topographic signatures.

AB The development of the unconventional gas and CO2 sequestration is moving to deep formations. Because of the small flow pathways in the matrix, the Knudsen number might be high even though the gas is dense. In fact, due to the relatively high pressure at in situ conditions, gas flow in microfractures usually manifests a strong slip and nonideal gas effects. Therefore, understanding the coupling mechanism of these two on gas flow in rough-walled microfractures is required to accurately model subsurface flow behavior. In this study, pressure-driven gas flow in rough-walled microfracture is analyzed in depth. Starting from the local governing equations for gas flow, a local flow model that includes gas slip and nonideal gas effects is derived by solving the Stokes equation with a first-order slip boundary condition. Focusing at the representative elementary volume scale, the upscaled solutions to gas flow in a fracture with sinusoidal surface are derived to obtain the apparent permeability. The impact of nonideal gas effects, fracture roughness and aperture, and the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient on CH4 and CO2 flow is analyzed. The results show that fracture roughness introduces a high degree of heterogeneity in gas flow. At in situ conditions effects of gas slip, fracture roughness and tangential momentum accommodation coefficient on gas flow are reduced. The ideal gas law is capable of estimating CH4 flow to some extent. However, it fails to estimate CO2 flow in microfractures.

AB Despite the intensive research over the past two decades in the field of stochastic subsurface hydrology, a substantial gap remains between theory and application. The most popular stochastic theories are still based on closed-form solutions that apply, strictly speaking. only for statistically uniform flows. In this paper, we present an efficient, nonstationary spectral approach for modeling complex stochastic flows in moderately heterogeneous media. Specifically, we reformulate the governing stochastic equations and introduce a new transfer function to characterize the propagation of system uncertainty. The new transfer function plays a similar role as the commonly used Green's functions in classical stochastic perturbation methods but is more amenable to numerical solution. The compact transfer function can be used to construct efficiently various spatial statistics of interest, such as covariances, cross-covariances, variances, and mean closure fluxes. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach by applying it to a number of nonstationary problems, including a large, complex problem that is difficult to solve by traditional methods. In particular, we focus in this paper on demonstrating the new approach's ability to compute efficiently covariances and cross-covariances critical for measurement conditioning, monitoring network analyses, and stochastic transport modeling in the presence of complex mean flow nonstationarities (caused, e.g., by complex trends in aquifer properties, boundary conditions, and sources and sinks). This paper is an extension of our recent work that illustrated the basic approach for modeling nonlocal and nonstationary scale effects and uncertainty propagation in relatively simple situations.

AB Natural disasters such as droughts and floods originate as a consequence of excessive high or low precipitation amount and/or frequency. Due to the temporal persistence of the latter, the disasters tend to cluster in time. Because global ocean-atmosphere teleconnection patterns with (multi-) decadal oscillations are tightly related with the precipitation variability, it is useful to analyse precipitation variability at the same timescale to understand any possible connection between them. In this study, decadal oscillations of daily extreme precipitation are investigated using quantile perturbation method for 65 stations in Turkey for the period 1955-2014. Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and Western Mediterranean Oscillation teleconnection patterns are examined for their relation with the extreme precipitation variability. The analyses are conducted for four climatic seasons and seven subregions. According to the analysis based on single drivers, NAO is identified as the most effective driver of Turkish extreme precipitation variability in winter, especially over regions influenced by the Mediterranean climate, whereas AO has a similar effect. When the teleconnection patterns are investigated in pairs, the combination of the NAO and SOI results in the strongest influence on the winter extremes. Though obvious differences are not recorded between the results of linear and nonlinear methods for single driver analysis, the nonlinear method is superior for the multiple driver analysis.

AB Spatial patterns in the physical controls of groundwater depth and flux are assessed quantitatively using results from a first of its kind, integrated groundwater surface water simulation over the majority of the contiguous US. We apply a novel, k-regression algorithm to the simulated system to simultaneously identify spatial subsets of grid cells with similar relationships between explanatory variables and groundwater metrics while quantifying behavior using multiple linear regression. The combination of this statistical approach with the results of a large-scale, high-resolution groundwater simulation allows us to evaluate the ability to represent complex groundwater behavior with simple linear models across an unprecedented range of climates and physical settings. In almost all of the eight major basins considered, we identify at least some areas where the coefficient of determination for the linear regression model is larger than 0.7, and in many cases this is achieved for more than 50% of the total basin area. In general, we show that water table depth is most strongly related to location within a basin and slope, while conductivity and recharge are more important predictors for groundwater flux metrics. Results also illustrate spatial variability in these relationships; further demonstrating the historic difficulty in developing spatially contiguous classifications of groundwater behavior. This work highlights the potential to combine new statistical techniques with integrated hydrologic models to help improve our understanding of complex heterogeneous systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The original and revised versions of the generalized complementary relationship (GCR) of evaporation (ET) were tested with six-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC6) level long-term (1981-2010) water balance data (sample size of 334). The two versions of the GCR were calibrated with Parameter Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) mean annual precipitation (P) data and validated against water-balance ET (ETwb) as the difference of mean annual HUC6-averaged P and United States Geological Survey HUC6 runoff (Q) rates. The original GCR overestimates P in about 18% of the PRISM grid points covering the contiguous United States in contrast with 12% of the revised version. With HUC6-averaged data the original version has a bias of -25 mm yr(-1) vs the revised version's -17 mm yr(-1), and it tends to more significantly underestimate ETwb at high values than the revised one (slope of the best fit line is 0.78 vs 0.91). At the same time it slightly outperforms the revised version in terms of the linear correlation coefficient (0.94 vs 0.93) and the root-mean-square error (90 vs 92 mm yr(-1)). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Traditional design flood estimation approaches have focused on peak discharges and have often neglected other hydrograph characteristics such as hydrograph volume and shape. Synthetic design hydrograph estimation procedures overcome this deficiency by jointly considering peak discharge, hydrograph volume, and shape. Such procedures have recently been extended to allow for the consideration of process variability within a catchment by a flood-type specific construction of design hydrographs. However, they depend on observed runoff time series and are not directly applicable in ungauged catchments where such series are not available. To obtain reliable flood estimates, there is a need for an approach that allows for the consideration of process variability in the construction of synthetic design hydrographs in ungauged catchments. In this study, we therefore propose an approach that combines a bivariate index flood approach with event-type specific synthetic design hydrograph construction. First, regions of similar flood reactivity are delineated and a classification rule that enables the assignment of ungauged catchments to one of these reactivity regions is established. Second, event-type specific synthetic design hydrographs are constructed using the pooled data divided by event type from the corresponding reactivity region in a bivariate index flood procedure. The approach was tested and validated on a dataset of 163 Swiss catchments. The results indicated that 1) random forest is a suitable classification model for the assignment of an ungauged catchment to one of the reactivity regions, 2) the combination of a bivariate index flood approach and event-type specific synthetic design hydrograph construction enables the consideration of event types in ungauged catchments, and 3) the use of probabilistic class memberships in regional synthetic design hydrograph construction helps to alleviate the problem of misclassification. Event-type specific synthetic design hydrograph sets enable the inclusion of process variability into design flood estimation and can be used as a compromise between single best estimate synthetic design hydrographs and continuous simulation studies.

AB The volume of water stored in seasonal wetlands is a fundamental but difficult to measure variable for developing a physical understanding of wetland behavior. For seasonal wetlands that are a major source of water for rice and fish production, this physical understanding is key to planning for water-food security and ecosystem services. This study quantified variations in volumetric storage for the numerous seasonal wetlands of northeastern Bangladesh, locally known as "haors." These haors receive transboundary runoff from densely vegetated and mountainous terrain in India and face persistent monsoonal cloud cover as they become full. We estimated volumetric storage for 13 haors by using extensive remote sensing data on water surface extent and elevation that was complemented with citizen-contributed gauge data. Assuming a trapezoidal bathymetry, an area-volume relationship was developed for selected haors. This relationship was assumed to be valid for extrapolating volumetric estimations over all the haors in the region. Results suggested that as haors get filled with the onset of monsoon rains, total estimated storage relative to the lowest observable level varied from 6.5 (+/- 0.4) km(3) in May to 30.9 (+/- 2.0) km(3) in July (peak of monsoon). Choosing a rectangular bathymetry can lead to 47% higher estimates compared to trapezoidal cross section. Estimating this intra-annual/interannual increase in storage is important for the region to plan water management policies that balance the human and ecosystem needs. Our analytical approach has potential for application to wetlands worldwide in light of the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

AB The main goal of this study is to explore whether the ideas established by surface water hydrologists in the context of predictions in ungauged basins can be useful in hydrogeology. The concrete question is whether it is possible to create predictive models for groundwater systems with no or few observations based on knowledge derived from similar groundwater systems which are well observed. To do so, this study analyzes the relationship between temporal dynamics of groundwater levels and climatic and physiographic characteristics. The analysis is based on data from 341 wells in Southern Germany with 10-year daily groundwater hydrographs. Observation wells are used in confined and unconfined sand and gravel aquifers from narrow mountainous valleys as well as more extensive lowland alluvial aquifers. Groundwater dynamics at each location are summarized with 46 indices describing features of groundwater hydrographs. Besides borehole log-derived geologic information, local and regional morphologic characteristics as well as topography-derived boundary and climatic descriptors were derived for each well. Regression relationships were established by mining the data for associations between dynamics and descriptors with forward stepwise regression at a confidence level >95%. The most important predictors are geology and boundary conditions and, secondarily, climate, as well as some topographic features, such as regional convergence. The multiple regression models are in general agreement with process understanding linked to groundwater dynamics in unconfined aquifers. This systematic investigation suggests that statistical regionalization of groundwater dynamics in ungauged aquifers based on map-derived physiographic and climatic controls may be feasible.

AB During the past 30 years, water ceased to flow in the lower reaches of the Tarim River in northwest China. A project was initiated that aims for ecosystem recovery and rehabilitation by means of transporting water through an open canal to the lower reaches of the Tarim River. In this study, the ecohydrological responses of this rare type project are assessed. Water loss-runoff relationships and an index model for water loss rates and runoff are analyzed. The detected ecohydrological responses of the canal project include that water diversion dominates the dynamics of ( 1) the groundwater depth and ( 2) the tempo-spatial variation of riparian vegetation close to the water channel. The relationships between groundwater depth, vegetation coverage, species richness and soil water content are clearly the main factors contributing to the riparian vegetation. Variations of water mineralization are significant, both temporally and spatially, at each sampling station within the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The study provides basic information on water diversion and stream corridor restoration in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The results show associated mechanisms between riparian vegetation and hydrological variation in arid zone. This lays the theoretical and practical foundation for improving the evaluation system for supplementary water delivery and comprehensive improvement in the Tarim Basin. It also provides information on strengths and weakness in current practices. These are needed for the planning of ecological recovery and rehabilitation of damaged ecosystems in this and other arid areas in western and northern China.

AB Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely used for modeling hydrological processes that are embedded with high nonlinearity in both spatial and temporal scales. The input-output functional relationship does not remain the same over the entire modeling domain, varying at different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, a novel neural network model called the spiking modular neural networks (SMNNs) is proposed. An SMNN consists of an input layer, a spiking layer, and an associator neural network layer. The modular nature of the SMNN helps in finding domain-dependent relationships. The performance of the model is evaluated using two distinct case studies. The first case study is that of streamflow modeling, and the second case study involves modeling of eddy covariance-measured evapotranspiration. Two variants of SMNNs were analyzed in this study. The first variant employs a competitive layer as the spiking layer, and the second variant employs a self-organizing map as the spiking layer. The performance of SMNNs is compared to that of a regular feed forward neural network (FFNN) model. Results from the study demonstrate that SMNNs performed better than FFNNs for both the case studies. Results from partitioning analysis reveal that, compared to FFNNs, SMNNs are effective in capturing the dynamics of high flows. In modeling evapotranspiration, it is found that net radiation and ground temperature alone can be used to model the evaporation flux effectively. The SMNNs are shown to be effective in discretizing the complex mapping space into simpler domains that can be learned with relative ease.

AB There is a growing consensus that gravel-bed roughness should be parameterized based on bed-surface topography, not only sediment size. One benefit is the possible identification of various spatial scales of surface roughness and evaluation of their respective contributions to flow resistance (and also to bedload transport). The absence of relationships between roughness at the different scales is apparent in previous work, which currently limits roughness parameterization from topography and application in flow modeling. This study examines the use of moving-window detrending on gravel-bed digital elevation models (DEMs) for isolating roughness scales and their respective signatures. A large data set of 35 water-worked gravel-bed patches from both the laboratory and the field was used for the analysis. The measured bed topography was separated into two distinct DEMs: one representing grains, the other representing small bedforms. For all DEMs, bed-elevation parameters measuring vertical roughness, imbrication, and spatial correlations were determined. Our results show distinct topographic signatures between grain and bedform DEMs. We show strong positive linear relationships between grain vertical roughness and the size of the bed-surface material. Surface sediment arrangement also determined bedform shape, with groupings of coarse sediment forming humps on the surface, and finer sediment sheltered in hollows. Patch-scale vertical roughness could not be estimated simply as the sum of grain and bedform vertical roughness. Instead, our results suggest weighted summation and the existence of universal weighting coefficients. Practical applications for studies on gravel-bed roughness and flow modeling using DEMs are discussed.

AB In Earth and ecological sciences, an important, crosscutting issue is the relationship between scale and the processes of runoff and erosion. In drylands, understanding this relationship is critical for understanding ecosystem functionality and degradation processes. Recent work has suggested that the effects of scale may differ depending on the extent of degradation. To test this hypothesis, runoff and sediment yield were monitored during a hydrological year on 20 plots of various lengths (1-15 m). These plots were located on a series of five reclaimed mining slopes in a Mediterranean-dry environment. The five slopes exhibited various degrees of vegetative cover and surface erosion. A general decrease of unit area runoff was observed with increasing plot scale for all slopes. Nevertheless, the amount of reinfiltrated runoff along each slope varied with the extent of degradation, being highest at the least degraded slope and vice versa. In other words, unit area runoff decreased the least on the most disturbed site as plot length increased. Unit area sediment yield declined with increasing plot length for the undisturbed and moderately disturbed sites, but it actually increased for the highly disturbed sites. The different scaling behavior of the most degraded slopes was especially clear under high-intensity rainfall conditions, when flow concentration favored rill erosion. Our results confirm that in drylands, the effects of scale on runoff and erosion change with the extent of degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of soil and water from disturbed systems, which could reinforce the degradation process through feedback mechanisms with vegetation.

AB New experimental techniques are allowing, for the first time, direct visualization of mass and momentum transport across the sediment-water interface in streams. These experimental insights are catalyzing a renaissance in our understanding of the role stream turbulence plays in a host of critical ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling. In this commentary, we briefly review the nature of stream turbulence and its role in hyporheic exchange and nutrient cycling in streams. A simple process-based model, borrowed from biochemical engineering, provides the link between empirical relationships for grain-scale turbulent mixing and nutrient processing at reach, catchment, continental, and global scales.

AB Dust aerosols can suppress rainfall by increasing the number of cloud condensation nuclei in warm clouds and affecting the surface radiation budget and boundary layer instability. The extent to which atmospheric dust may affect precipitation yields and the hydrologic cycle in semiarid regions remains poorly understood. We investigate the relationship between dust aerosols and rainfall in the West African Sahel where the dust-rainfall feedback has been speculated to contribute to sustained droughts. We find that the amount of dust loadings is negatively correlated with rainfall values, suggesting that dust entrained in the atmosphere can significantly inhibit rainfall in this region.

AB [ 1] This paper reviews the problem of the incipient motion of cohesionless particles in a high sloping water stream. A theoretical analysis of the equilibrium of a gravel particle is developed by a deterministic approach with the introduction of the relative degree of exposure of the particle itself to the stream flow. The parameter, relative degree of exposure, relates the positioning of a particle with the upstream one. The problem of velocity distribution and the definition of drag coefficient is also revised to better account for low submergence. The results of the theory are compared with a series of ad hoc experiments performed by C. Gregoretti.

AB [1] We propose a new physical interpretation of the diffusion process for the piezometric head h(x, t) in heterogeneous aquifers based on the continuous time random walk (CTRW) theory. For the typical heterogeneities considered in this work, we find that a CTRW based diffusion equation for h(x, t) provides better fits to the transient flow simulations than the classical diffusion equation (DE). The DE is found to be a special case of the CTRW diffusion equation. The results of this work have clear implications for the interpretation of pumping tests and what information can be extracted from them.

AB In this study, we use observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to evaluate freshwater storage trends in the north-central Middle East, including portions of the Tigris and Euphrates River Basins and western Iran, from January 2003 to December 2009. GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately -27.2 +/- 0.6 mm yr(-1) equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km(3) during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of "best current capabilities" in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3 +/- 2.1 mm yr(-1) equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3 +/- 10.9 km(3) in volume. Furthermore, results raise important issues regarding water use in transboundary river basins and aquifers, including the necessity of international water use treaties and resolving discrepancies in international water law, while amplifying the need for increased monitoring for core components of the water budget.

AB We performed power-spectral analyses on 133 globally distributed lake-level time series after removing annual variability. Lake-level power spectra are found to be power-law functions of frequency over the range of 20 d(-1) to 27 yr(-1), suggesting that lake levels are globally a f(-beta)-type noise. The spectral exponent (beta), i.e., the best-fit slope of the logarithm of the power spectrum to the logarithm of frequency, is a nonlinear function of lake surface area, indicating that lake size is an important control on the magnitude of water-level variability over the range of time scales we considered. A simple cellular model for lake-level fluctuations that reproduces the observed spectral-scaling properties is presented. The model (an adaptation of a surface-growth model with random deposition and relaxation) is based on the equations governing flow in an unconfined aquifer with stochastic inputs and outputs of water (e.g., random storms). The agreement between observation and simulation suggests that lake surface area, spatiotemporal stochastic forcing, and diffusion of the groundwater table are the primary factors controlling lake water-level variability in natural (unmanaged) lakes. Water-level variability is generally considered to be a manifestation of climate trends or climate change, yet our work shows that an input with short or no memory (i.e., weather) gives rise to a long-memory nonstationary output (lake water-level). This work forms the basis for a null hypothesis of lake water-level variability that should be disproven before water-level trends are to be attributed to climate.

AB [ 1] Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration ( ET) can be difficult to interpret and use for validating model calculations in the presence of land cover heterogeneity. Land surface fluxes, soil moisture (theta), and surface temperatures (T-s) data were collected by an eddy correlation-based tower located at the Orroli ( Sardinia) experimental field ( covered by woody vegetation, grass, and bare soil) from April 2003 to July 2004. Two Quickbird high-resolution images ( summer 2003 and spring 2004) were acquired for depicting the contrasting land cover components. Aprocedure is presented for estimating ET in heterogeneous ecosystems as the residual term of the energy balance using Ts observations, a two-dimensional footprint model, and the Quickbird images. Two variations on the procedure are successfully implemented: a proposed two-source random model (2SR), which treats the heat sources of each land cover component separately but computes the bulk heat transfer coefficient as spatially homogeneous, and a common two-source tile model. For 2SR, new relationships between the interfacial transfer coefficient and the roughness Reynolds number are estimated for the two bare soil - woody vegetation and grass - woody vegetation composite surfaces. The ET versus theta relationships for each land cover component were also estimated, showing that that the woody vegetation has a strong tolerance to long droughts, transpiring at rates close to potential for even the driest conditions. Instead, the grass is much less tolerant to theta deficits, and the switch from grass to bare soil following the rainy season had a significant impact on ET.

AB Assessing the impact of parameter estimation accuracy in models of heterogeneous, three-dimensional (3-D) groundwater systems is critical for predictions of solute transport. A unique experimental data set provides concentration breakthrough curves (BTCs) measured at a 0.25(3) cm(3) scale over the 13 x 8 x 8 cm(3) domain (similar to 53,000 measurement locations). Advective transport is used to match the first temporal moments of BTCs (or mean arrival times, m(1)) averaged at 0.25(3) and 1.0 cm(3) scales through simultaneous inversion of highly parameterized heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) and porosity (phi) fields. Pilot points parameterize the fields within eight layers of the 3-D medium, and estimations are completed with six different models of the K-phi relationship. Parameter estimation through advective transport shows accurate estimation of the observed m(1) values. Results across the six different K-phi relationships have statistically similar fits to the observed m(1) values and similar spatial estimates of m(1) along the main flow direction. The resulting fields provide the basis for forward transport modeling of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Using the estimated K and phi fields demonstrates that advective transport coupled with inversion using dense spatial field parameterization provides an efficient surrogate for the ADE. These results indicate that there is not a single set of model parameters, or a single K-phi relationship, that leads to a best representation of the actual experimental sand packing pattern (i.e., nonuniqueness). Additionally, knowledge of the individual sand K and phi values along with their arrangement in the 3-D experiment does not reproduce the observed transport results at small scales. Small-scale variation in the packing and mixing of the sands causes large deviations from the expected transport results as highlighted in forward ADE simulations. Highly parameterized inverse estimation is able to identify those regions where variations in mixing and packing alter the expected property values and significantly improve results relative to the naive application of the experimentally derived property values. Impacts of the observation scale, the scale over which results are averaged and the number of observations and parameters on the final estimations are also examined. Results indicate existence of a representative element volume (REV) at 0.25 cm(3), the existence of subgrid scale heterogeneity that impacts transport and the accuracy of highly parameterized models with even relatively small amounts of observations. Finally, this work suggests that local-heterogeneity features below the REV scale are difficult to incorporate into parameterized models, highlighting the importance of addressing prediction uncertainty for small-scale variability (i.e., uncaptured variability) in modeling practice.

AB The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is the most common method for fitting the delta H-2-delta O-18 relationship. Recently, various studies compared the OLS regression with the Reduced Major Axis (RMA) and Major Axis (MA) regression for precipitation data. However, no studies have investigated so far the differences among the OLS, RMA, and MA regressions for water types prone to evaporation, mixing, and redistribution processes. In this work, we quantified the differences in terms of slopes and intercepts computed by the OLS, RMA, and MA methods for rainfall, snow and ice, stream, spring, groundwater, and soil water, and investigated whether the magnitude of such differences is significant and dependent on the water type, the datasets statistics, geographical or climatic characteristics of the study catchments.
   Our results show that the differences between the regression methods were largest for the isotopic data of some springs and some stream waters. Conversely, for rainfall, snow, ice, and melt waters datasets, all the differences were small and, particularly, smaller than their standard deviation. Slopes and intercepts computed using the different regression methods were statistically different for stream water (up to 70.4%, n = 54), followed by groundwater, springs, and soil water. The results of this study indicate that a thorough analysis of the delta H-2-delta O-18 relationship in isotope hydrology studies is recommended, as well as considering the measurement errors for both delta H-2 and delta O-18, and the presence of outliers. In case of small measurement errors and no significant differences between the slopes computed through the three methods, we suggest the application of the widely used OLS regression. Conversely, if the computed slopes are significantly different, we recommend investigating the possible reasons for such discrepancies and prefer the RMA over the MA approach, as the latter tends to be more sensitive to data with high leverage (i.e., data points with extreme delta O-18 values).

AB We report on a series of soil erosion experiments performed on the 2-m x 6-m EPFL erosion flume. Total sediment concentrations and the concentrations of seven size fractions (< 2, 2-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-315, 315-1000, and > 1000 mu m) were measured during 14 high-intensity (47.5-52.5 mm/h) rainfall experiments on three different slopes (2.2-12.4%). The short-time and long-time analytical solutions for the Hairsine-Rose erosion model were rewritten to account for infiltration. The newly collected data were used to test the model under conditions that had not been explored before (steeper slopes, infiltration, more realistic soil composition). The analytical solutions could predict the observed total sediment concentration well. However, the observed sediment concentrations for the individual size classes could be predicted only when adjusted settling velocities were used. The adjusted settling velocities were estimated through manual optimization. The optimized settling velocities for the smallest and midsize particles (< 100 mu m) were larger than calculated from Stokes' law or measured in a 0.47-m tube, while the optimized settling velocities for the largest particles (> 315 mu m) were smaller than measured. The effective settling velocities could also be calculated from the calculated amount of material in the shield of each size class at the end of the experiments. This calculated settling velocity distribution agreed very well with the optimized settling velocities. This study moves the Hairsine-Rose model another step closer to an operational soil erosion model for field applications.

AB The continuous wavelet transform is applied to the analysis of curvature signals from both synthetic meanders and 52 realizations from 16 natural meanders ranging from class B to class G (Brice classification), thus providing information on the spatial distribution of their arc-wavelength spectrum, and therefore, representing an objective characterization of meanders. Past research has studied the meander dynamics by using the centerline (short-term frame) and the valley centerline (long-term frame). The present study introduces a medium term frame, termed the mean center (MC), which is defined as the medium term coherent wave being present in the meander planimetry for a period that is strongly governed by the occurrence of cutoff events; although in the absence of them, it is present for similar to 10 to similar to 30 years. The MC is obtained by using a methodology that combines the capabilities of the principal component analysis and the discrete wavelet transforms. The application of wavelet cross correlation shows that peaks in the centerline curvature are strongly correlated with those of the MC suggesting that (1) a linear relationship between them may be associated to bank processes and, (2) in all other cases, a higher nonlinear relationship may be induced by autogenic hydrodynamic processes. In freely meandering rivers, compound bends, multiple loops, and cutoff events are associated to peaks in the MC local curvature. We define the planform amplitudes as the orthogonal distance of the centerline from mean center. Planform amplitudes (orthogonal distance of the centerline from mean center) are normally distributed and ranges from 2 to 20 river mean widths.

AB A major challenge in surface hydrology involves predicting streamflow in ungauged catchments with heterogeneous vegetation and spatiotemporally varying evapotranspiration (ET) rates. We present a top-down approach for quantifying the influence of broad-scale changes in forest structure on ET and hence streamflow. Across three catchments between 18 and 100 km(2) in size and with regenerating Eucalyptus regnans and E. delegatensis forest, we demonstrate how variation in ET can be mapped in space and over time using LiDAR data and commonly available forest inventory data. The model scales plot-level sapwood area (SA) to the catchment-level using basal area (BA) and tree stocking density (N) estimates in forest growth models. The SA estimates over a 69 year regeneration period are used in a relationship between SA and vegetation induced streamflow loss (L) to predict annual streamflow (Q) with annual rainfall (P) estimates. Without calibrating P, BA, N, SA, and L to Q data, we predict annual Q with R-2 between 0.68 and 0.75 and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 0.44 and 0.48. To remove bias, the model was extended to allow for runoff carry-over into the following year as well as minor correction to rainfall bias, which produced R-2 values between 0.72 and 0.79, and NSE between 0.70 and 0.79. The model under-predicts streamflow during drought periods as it lacks representation of ecohydrological processes that reduce L with either reduced growth rates or rainfall interception during drought. Refining the relationship between sapwood thickness and forest inventory variables is likely to further improve results.

AB Remote sensing has gained attention as a novel source of primary information for estimating river discharge, and the Mass-conserved Flow Law Inversion (McFLI) approach has successfully estimated river discharge in ungauged basins solely from optical satellite data. However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates and (2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily "ungauged" baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using similar to 1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28% normalized root mean square error, 0.50 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling-Gupta efficiency where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92% of these originally poorly modeled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5% of reaches and 26% of simulated days. Our results suggest that the combination of McFLI and state-of-the-art hydrology models can improve flow estimations in ungauged basins globally.

AB The Three-Layer Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC-3L) land surface model is extended to include biological and hydrological processes important to water, energy, and carbon budgets under water-limited climatic conditions: (1) movement of soil water from wet to dry regions through hydraulic redistribution (HR); (2) groundwater dynamics; (3) plant water storage; and (4) photosynthetic process. HR is represented with a process-based scheme and the interaction between HR and groundwater dynamics is explicitly considered. The impact of frozen soil on HR in the cold season is also represented. Transpiration is calculated by combining an Ohm's law analogy, where flow from the soil to leaves is buffered by plant water storage, with the Penman-Monteith method, where stomatal conductance is linked with photosynthesis. In this extended model (referred to as VIC+), water flow in plants and in the unsaturated and saturated zones, transpiration and photosynthesis are closely coupled, and multiple constraints are simultaneously applied to the transpiration process. VIC+ is evaluated with an analytical solution under simple conditions and with observed data at two AmeriFlux sites. Scenario simulations demonstrate the following results: (1) HR has significant impacts on water, energy, and carbon budgets during the dry season; (2) Rise of groundwater table, increase of root depth, HR, and plant water storage are favorable to dry-season latent heat flux; (3) Plant water storage can weaken the intensity of upward HR; (4) Frozen soil can restrict downward HR in the wet winter and reduce the soil water reserves for the dry season.

AB This paper presents a new technique for mapping detention basins and measuring their spatial attributes using high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. An efficient least-cost search algorithm is employed to identify surface depressions from a bare-earth LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM). Surface depressions are automatically delineated into hydrological objects using the connected component identification and indexing algorithm. Various spatial attributes are derived for these hydrologic objects, including location, perimeter, surface area, depth, storage volume and shape properties. Based on spatial attributes, a rule-based classifier is established to separate detention basins from other types of surface depressions. We have successfully applied our technique to an urban watershed in the Houston Metropolitan area, Texas. Detention basins at regional and residential subdivision levels are mapped out for the watershed, and measurements on the spatial attributes are derived for each detention basin. The quantitative information derived from LiDAR data provides a scientific basis for formulating an appropriate management plan for detention basins and for assessing their effects on flood control and storm water quality treatment.

AB Transit time distributions (TTDs) exert important controls on biogeochemical processes in watershed systems. TTDs are often assumed to follow time-invariant exponential, lognormal, or heavy-tailed power law distributions in headwater or low-order streams. However, under dynamic hydrological forcing, transit time could exhibit more complex distribution patterns with strong spatial and temporal variability. In this study, we used a numerical particle tracking approach to characterize TTDs along the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River under the influences of river stage fluctuations and evaluate the associated effects on biogeochemical reaction potentials within the river corridor. Particle tracking was conducted using velocity fields simulated by high-resolution three-dimensional groundwater flow models that capture both the river stage fluctuations and physical heterogeneity. Our results revealed that multifrequency flow variations led to multimodal TTDs that varied in time and space. Such characteristics can only be captured by multiyear numerical simulations supported by multiyear field monitoring. Dam-induced high-frequency (subweekly) flow variations increased additional hydrologic exchange flows with short (subweekly) transit times, which accounted for up to 44% of reactant consumption in the river corridor along the Hanford Reach. The dam-induced river stage fluctuations have more significant impacts on faster biogeochemical reactions because they cause a larger fraction of shorter transit times. Numerical particle tracking provides an efficient alternative for characterizing TTDs for large complex systems where in situ field experiments are not feasible. Such a numerical approach is thus essential for improving large-scale biogeochemical modeling from watersheds to basins.

AB Anomalous transport in advection-dominated convergent flow tracer tests can occurs due to small-scale heterogeneities in aquifer hydraulic properties. These result in fluctuations of the groundwater velocity field and complex connectivity patterns between injection and extraction wells. While detailed characterization of heterogeneity is often not possible in practice, a proper understanding of what fundamental physical mechanisms can give rise to macroscopic behaviors that are measurable is essential for proper upscaling of solute transport processes. We analyze here how heavy-tailed breakthrough curves can arise in radially convergent flow to a well. The permeability fields are three-dimensional multi-Gaussian fields with varying statistical geometry and degrees of heterogeneity. We consider transport of conservative tracers from multiple injection locations by varying distance and angle from the extraction well. Anomalous power law tailing in breakthrough curves is attributed to a variety of features including the initial vertical stratification of the solute that arises due to a flux-weighted injection, the injection distance to the well relative to the depth of the aquifer, and the statistics of the heterogeneity field as defined by the correlation length and variance of the permeability. When certain conditions cooccur for a given injection, such as strong connectivity contrasts between aquifer layers, injection distances comparable to the horizontal heterogeneity integral scales, and large global variances, breakthrough curves tend to scale as a PL with unit slope at late time. These findings offer new insights to understand what physical processes must be understood to develop and choose appropriate upscaling approaches that might reproduce such anomalous transport in heterogeneous advection-dominated systems.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID FLOW
AB Fixed side-looking Doppler current profilers (H-ADCP) recently emerged as an innovating technique for the continuous monitoring of river discharges. The discharge can be computed from the flow velocities measured by the H-ADCP along a horizontal profile across the section. This paper reports a field assessment of the quality of velocities and discharges provided by a 3-narrow-beam Teledyne RD Instruments, Inc. (RDI) 300 kHz H-ADCP installed at the Saint-Georges gauging station (Saone river in Lyon, France). Reference velocity and discharge values were established from 18 conventional ADCP river gauging campaigns over an extended discharge range (100-1800 m(3)/s). The comparison with ADCP data revealed that H-ADCP velocity measurements were reliable (deviations < 5%) in a near-field range only (60 m out of a 95 m total section width). In the far field (beyond 60 m), H-ADCP velocity measurements showed negative bias of up to -50% 90 m from the instrument. For section-averaged velocities lower than 0.4 m/s approximately, H-ADCP velocity measurements were found to be significantly underestimated over the whole cross section. The performances of several strategies (index velocity method and velocity profile method) for computing discharge were tested, compared, and discussed. For the velocity profile method, several profile laws and far-field extrapolation methods were implemented. Both methods gave acceptable discharge values (deviations < 5% typically) excepted at low-flow conditions. The reasons why H-ADCP velocities were unacceptably biased low in the far field and for low flow conditions require further investigation in order to define correcting measures.

TI Use of groundwater lifetime expectancy for the performance assessment of

AB Long-term solutions for the disposal of toxic wastes usually involve isolation of the wastes in a deep subsurface geologic environment. In the case of spent nuclear fuel, if radionuclide leakage occurs from the engineered barrier, the geological medium represents the ultimate barrier that is relied upon to ensure safety. Consequently, an evaluation of radionuclide travel times from a repository to the biosphere is critically important in a performance assessment analysis. In this study, we develop a travel time framework based on the concept of groundwater lifetime expectancy as a safety indicator. Lifetime expectancy characterizes the time that radionuclides will spend in the subsurface after their release from the repository and prior to discharging into the biosphere. The probability density function of lifetime expectancy is computed throughout the host rock by solving the backward-in-time solute transport adjoint equation subject to a properly posed set of boundary conditions. It can then be used to define optimal repository locations. The risk associated with selected sites can be evaluated by simulating an appropriate contaminant release history. The utility of the method is illustrated by means of analytical and numerical examples, which focus on the effect of fracture networks on the uncertainty of evaluated lifetime expectancy.

TI Field testing of the universal calibration function for determination of
   soil moisture with cosmic-ray neutrons
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOMASS
AB The semitheoretical universal calibration function (UCF) for estimating soil moisture using cosmic-ray neutron sensors was tested by comparing to field measurements made with the same neutron detector across a range of climates, soil, latitude, altitude, and biomass. There was a strong correlation between neutron intensity and the total amount of hydrogen at each site; however, the relationship differed from that predicted by the UCF. A linear fit to field measurements explained 99% of the observed variation and provides a robust empirical means to estimate soil moisture at other sites. It was concluded that measurement errors, neutron count corrections, and scaling to remove altitudinal and geomagnetic differences were unlikely to explain differences between observations and the UCF. The differences may be attributable to the representation of organic carbon, biomass or detector geometry in the neutron particle code, or to differences in the neutron energy levels being measured by the cosmic-ray sensor and modeled using the particle code. The UCF was derived using simulations of epithermal neutrons; however, lower energy thermal neutrons may also be important. Using neutron transport code, we show the differences in response of thermal and epithermal neutrons to the relative size of the hydrogen pool. Including a thermal neutron component in addition to epithermal neutrons in a modified UCF provided a better match to field measurements; however, thermal neutron measurements are needed to confirm these results. A simpler generalized relationship for estimating soil moisture from neutron counts was also tested with encouraging results for low biomass sites.

TI Study on the agricultural crop drought index based on weights of growth

AB Drought is one of the main natural disasters affecting economic development and food security. Drought monitoring and identification are the premise of disaster risk management, and the drought index is the main means of monitoring and identifying drought. The paper proposes a new drought index, the agricultural crop drought index (ACDI), which is suitable for rainfed agriculture in arid areas. ACDI calculates water deficit from precipitation and evapotranspiration and considers the weight of crop growth stage. The weight of growth stage and water deficit constitute the weighted data series. The fitting distribution is optimized by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the data are standardized to obtain ACDI. The weight of growth stage is determined by the multiple correlation coefficient between meteorological factors and grain yield. A large weight is equivalent to a large coefficient, large coefficient means that meteorological factors in this growth stage will have a greater impact on grain yield, so the water deficit in this growth stage should play a more important role in defining drought index to better identify agricultural drought from the perspective of crops. Finally, Qiqihar, a semiarid area in Northeast China, is selected as the research area for the case study. Comparing ACDI with standard precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and crop water deficit index (CWDI), the standard deviation of ACDI is larger, which indicates that the difference between index values is larger and it is relatively good in distinguishing the degree of drought. In addition, the correlation coefficient between ACDI and climate grain yield passed the test with a significance level of 0.05, while the other three indexes did not pass the test, which shows that the relationship between ACDI and grain yield is higher than the other three drought indexes. For arid areas, grain yield can reflect the impact of drought. Therefore, ACDI looks more promising to identify agricultural drought from the perspective of crops. ACDI provides a reference for monitoring agricultural drought from the perspective of crop growth stage, and enriches the drought index theory.

AB Prevailing theory suggests that stream temperature warms asymptotically in a downstream direction, beginning at the temperature of the source in the headwaters and levelling off downstream as it converges to match meteorological conditions. However, there have been few empirical examples of longitudinal patterns of temperature in large rivers due to a paucity of data. We constructed longitudinal thermal profiles (temperature vs distance) for 53 rivers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) using an extensive data set of remotely sensed summertime river temperatures and classified each profile into one of five patterns of downstream warming: asymptotic (increasing then flattening), linear (increasing steadily), uniform (not changing), parabolic (increasing then decreasing), or complex (not fitting other classes). We evaluated (1) how frequently profiles warmed asymptotically downstream as expected, and (2) whether relationships between river temperature and common hydroclimatic variables differed by profile class. We found considerable diversity in profile shape, with 47% of rivers warming asymptotically and 53% having alternative profile shapes. Water temperature did not warm substantially over the course of the river for coastal parabolic and uniform profiles, and for some linear and complex profiles. Profile classes showed no clear geographical trends. The degree of correlation between river temperature and hydroclimatic variables differed among profile classes, but there was overlap among classes. Water temperature in rivers with asymptotic or parabolic profiles was positively correlated with August air temperature, tributary temperature and velocity, and negatively correlated with elevation, August precipitation, gradient and distance upstream. Conversely, associations were less apparent in rivers with linear, uniform or complex profiles. Factors contributing to the unique shape of parabolic profiles differed for coastal and inland rivers, where downstream cooling was influenced locally by climate or cool water inputs, respectively. Potential drivers of shape for complex profiles were specific to each river. These thermal patterns indicate diverse thermal habitats that may promote resilience of aquatic biota to climate change. Without this spatial context, climate change models may incorrectly estimate loss of thermally suitable habitat. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB It is shown how to derive explicitly an exponential dependence of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K, on relative saturation, S, and under what conditions such a relationship holds. An earlier derivation of the same result was so restrictive, that it appeared that realistic realizations were not possible, but the present derivation demonstrates the contrary. From existing results, the implication is that the steady-state unsaturated hydraulic conductivity will be log-normally distributed. The log-normal distribution, as well as an exponential dependence on moisture content, have been reported from the same experiment on the same field. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A model describing immiscible fluid-fluid displacements in partially saturated porous media is presented. This is based on a phase field approach that interprets the mixture of wetting (liquid water) and non-wetting (air) fluids within the pore space as a single saturating non-uniform pore fluid characterized by a phase field parameter, which is considered to be the saturation degree of the wetting fluid. While the standard retention curve provides for the retention properties of the pore walls, a Cahn-Hilliard like double-well energy is employed to describe the possible co-existence of the immiscible fluid phases. An enhanced description of the macroscopic surface tension between the fluid phases is obtained naturally within the phase field framework due to a regularization that depends on the spatial gradient of the water content. A generalized Darcy's law is used to describe dissipation due to fluid flow driven by the gradient of a generalized chemical potential. Thus, in the context of soil hydrology this model is interpreted as an extension to the classical Richards equation governing the spatio-temporal evolution of the phase field parameter. Employing a convex-concave flux function it is shown, using one-dimensional analysis, that both imbibition and drainage fronts can be modeled in this phase field framework. The non-monotonicities observed in the resolved solutions are explained using a combination of asymptotic matching techniques and dynamical systems analysis.

AB Large-scale models of fluid flow through fractures are almost exclusively based on Poiseuille flow (the cubic law). When the fracture aperture is time and/or spatially varying, flow is transient, and/or flow rates are modest (Re >= 1), Poiseuille flow predictions can deviate substantially from the full Navier-Stokes solution and generally do not satisfy conservation of energy. A new Reduced Dimension Fracture Flow (RDFF) model is derived which more accurately predicts transient fracture flow for incompressible fluids with modest Reynolds numbers. The RDFF model is derived from the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and yields a two-field model (fluid flux and pressure) governed by conservation of mass and momentum. The RDFF model conserves energy and is shown to include both Poiseuille flow and Forchheimer flow as limiting cases. The performance of the RDFF model is compared to the existing Poiseuille flow model and the solution to the full Navier- Stokes equations in three benchmarks problems. The RDFF model demonstrates complex transient and inertial behaviours not previously captured and produces up to 400% improvements in error over Poiseuille flow in steady-state flow conditions for 1 <= Re <= 100. The RDFF model is demonstrated to be superior in application where the Reynold's number is modest and when aperture varies in space and/or time.

AB Recent advances in the simulation of free surface flows over mobile bed have shown that accurate and stable results in realistic problems can be provided if an appropriate coupling between the shallow water equations (SWE) and the Exner equation is performed. This coupling can be done if using a suitable Jacobian matrix. As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions. The effects of the approximations made are tested against experimental data which include transient problems over erodible bed. The simplified model is formulated under a general framework able to insert any desirable discharge solid load formula. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies revealed that peak discharges (Q) observed in a nested drainage network following a run-off-generating rainfall event exhibit power law scaling with respect to drainage area (A) as Q(A) = alpha A(theta). However, multiple aspects of how rainfall-runoff process controls the value of the intercept (alpha) and the scaling exponent (theta) are not fully understood. We use the rainfall-runoff model CUENCAS and apply it to three different river basins in Iowa to investigate how the interplay among rainfall intensity, duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, channel flow velocity, and the drainage network structure affects these parameters. We show that, for a given catchment: (1) rainfall duration and hillslope overland flow velocity play a dominant role in controlling theta, followed by channel flow velocity and rainfall intensity; (2) alpha is systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall intensity, duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, and channel flow velocity, which highlights that it is the combined effect of these factors that controls the exact values of alpha and theta; and (3) a scale break occurs when runoff generated on hillslopes runs off into the drainage network very rapidly and the scale at which the break happens is determined by the interplay among rainfall duration, hillslope overland flow velocity, and channel flow velocity.

AB This paper concerns the development of high-order accurate centred schemes for the numerical solution of one-dimensional hyperbolic systems containing non-conservative products and source terms. Combining the PRICE-T method developed in [Toro E, Siviglia A. PRICE: primitive centred schemes for hyperbolic system of equations. Int J Numer Methods Fluids 2003:42:1263-91] with the theoretical insights gained by the recently developed path-conservative schemes [Castro M, Gallardo J. Pares C. High-order finite volume schemes based on reconstruction of states for solving hyperbolic systems with nonconservative products applications to shallow-water systems. Math Comput 2006;75:1103-34; Pares C. Numerical methods for nonconservative hyperbolic systems: a theoretical framework. SIAM J Numer Anal 2006;44:300-21], we propose the new PRICE-C scheme that automatically reduces to a modified conservative FORCE scheme if the underlying PDE system is a conservation law. The resulting first-order accurate centred method is then extended to high order of accuracy in space and time via the ADER approach together with a WENO reconstruction technique. The well-balanced properties of the PRICE-C method are investigated for the shallow water equations. Finally, we apply the new scheme to the shallow water equations with fix bottom topography and with variable bottom solving an additional sediment transport equation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We use a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model to study colloid transport in porous media. Unlike many existing numerical models, the DPD model directly couples dynamics of the fluid and colloidal particles. In the model, fluid, colloids, and soil grains are all represented by DPD particles. The interaction between particles is modeled by central and non-central DPD forces, which conserve both linear and angular momentums exactly. Additional van der Waals forces are applied between colloids and collectors. Other transport processes, including gravitational sedimentation, interception of colloids by soil grains (acting as colloid collectors) due to a finite size of colloids, and the Brownian diffusion of colloids are also included in the DPD model.
   We use the DPD model to study the contact efficiency in colloid filtration in saturated porous media and compare our results with empirical models based on filtration theory. Results of the DPD model agree well with the empirical models for low-concentration suspensions and colloids being small relative to the collector size. For colloid suspensions with larger colloids (relative to the collector size) and/or higher concentration, the agreement between the DPD model and the empirical models deteriorates. In the transport of a concentrated suspension of large colloids, the fluid flow is strongly affected by the linear and angular motions of the colloids, which are mainly disregarded in filtration theory. On the other hand, the DPD model fully couples the fluid flow and colloid transport and, thus, is expected to be accurate for a wide range of colloid sizes and concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrological applications require robust and periodic spatially distributed soil moisture data. Radiometer-based soil moisture (similar to 30-60-km resolution), after being appropriately downscaled (<5-km resolution), can be a valuable resource for providing such data globally. However, the accuracy of available downscaling algorithms is severely affected by subgrid variability in geophysical factors and precipitation within a satellite footprint. In this work, we introduce a scaling nomograph that incorporates the scale and site specific dependence of soil moisture on geophysical heterogeneity and antecedent wetness conditions to overcome this limitation. We developed functional scaling relationships to estimate the semivariogram of downscaled soil moisture change without any available fine-scale soil moisture data. The nomograph enables these relationships to be specific to the geophysical heterogeneity and antecedent wetness within a radiometer-based satellite footprint through footprint specific heterogeneity and wetness indices. The heterogeneity index quantifies the subgrid scale variability and covariability of soil, vegetation, and topography within the footprint, and the wetness index is a measure of antecedent precipitation. The nomograph was developed for Arizona, Iowa, and Oklahoma and can enable downscaling to scales varying between 0.8 and 6.4km. The true power of the nomograph is to enable the use of static dominant factors like soil to define dynamic scale specific scaling relationships for soil moisture for different kinds of land use and land cover in a data driven yet scientific approach, thus providing spatial transferability to the downscaling scheme. The spatial transferability of the nomograph was validated by downscaling Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity data in Manitoba, Canada.
   Plain Language Summary The launch of numerous satellites like National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite and European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity satellite has opened avenues for the use of remotely sensed soil moisture in operational modeling scenarios. However, these data sets require some degree of downscaling before being effectively incorporated into models for operational use. In this study, we devised a new technique to downscale satellite based remotely sensed soil moisture data to useful operational scales. The technique proposed in this study is a first demonstration for a data-driven method to incorporate subgrid variability of land-surface heterogeneity and precipitation into the scaling technique which have extensively been established as limiting factors for the performance of scaling algorithms. The technique is based on a novel nomograph (look-up graph) introduced in this study that enables the scaling algorithm to be dynamic based on the local heterogeneity and prevalent wetness conditions and has the potential for spatial transferability.

AB One of the vexing questions in rainfall research is the role of intermittency and its nonuniversal signature in anomalous scaling functions. Whether this lack of universal behavior is due to the bursting patterns in rainfall intensity or the alternation between long dry periods and highly clustered wet phases (or both) remains an open issue. To progress on a narrower scope of this problem, the effects of intermittency originating from rainfall occurrence are first separated from rainfall intermittency induced by intensity variability. Across five climatic regimes considered here, it was shown that the rainfall occurrence process (OP) exhibits (1) a near-constant spectral slope, (2) a near-constant clustering exponent, and (3) a probability density function of dry phases displaying a power law behavior with an exponent beta approximate to 1.5, consistent with other studies for timescales commensurate with frontal and storm systems. Also for the OP, the scaling exponents of the normalized higher order structure functions reveal an extensive monofractal scaling at all five climatic regimes. When taken together, these intersite results are suggestive that rainfall intensity modulations are the main cause of the nonuniversal anomalous scaling and not the clustering properties associated with the support. The nature of these modulations is markedly different when comparing rainfall to a familiar and often interrelated process such as scalar turbulence. In the case of turbulence, amplitude variability of scalar dissipation rates appear to mitigate the intermittency effects connected with anomalous scaling, while for rainfall series, intensity fluctuations seem to amplify them.

AB [1] A high-resolution stratigraphic image of a flume-generated deposit was scaled up to sedimentary basin dimensions where a natural log hydraulic conductivity (ln( K)) was assigned to each pixel on the basis of gray scale and conductivity end-members. The synthetic ln( K) map has mean, variance, and frequency distributions that are comparable to a natural alluvial fan deposit. A geostatistical analysis was conducted on selected regions of this map containing fluvial, fluvial/ floodplain, shoreline, turbidite, and deepwater sedimentary facies. Experimental ln(K) variograms were computed along the major and minor statistical axes and horizontal and vertical coordinate axes. Exponential and power law variogram models were fit to obtain an integral scale and Hausdorff measure, respectively. We conclude that the shape of the experimental variogram depends on the problem size in relation to the size of the local-scale heterogeneity. At a given problem scale, multilevel correlation structure is a result of constructing variogram with data pairs of mixed facies types. In multiscale sedimentary systems, stationary correlation structure may occur at separate scales, each corresponding to a particular hierarchy; the integral scale fitted thus becomes dependent on the problem size. The Hausdorff measure obtained has a range comparable to natural geological deposits. It increases from nonstratified to stratified deposits with an approximate cutoff of 0.15. It also increases as the number of facies incorporated in a problem increases. This implies that fractal characteristic of sedimentary rocks is both depositional process - dependent and problem-scale-dependent.

AB The fate and transport of mercury (Hg) deposited on forested upland soils depends on the biogeochemical and hydrological processes occurring in the soil landscape. In this study, total Hg (THg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured in streamwater from a 7.75 ha upland subcatchment of the METAALICUS watershed in northwestern Ontario, Canada. THg and DOC concentration-discharge relationships were examined at the seasonal-scale and event-scale to assess the role of antecedent moisture conditions on the mobilization of these solutes to receiving waters. At the seasonal-scale, subcatchment discharge poorly explained THg and DOC concentration dynamics; however, the inclusion of antecedent water storage and precipitation metrics in a multiple regression model improved the prediction of THg and DOC concentrations significantly. At the event-scale, a comparison of THg and DOC concentrations for two small summer storms with similar total discharge showed that the storm following the wet snowmelt period had a significantly lower total flux of THg and DOC than the storm following warm and dry conditions in late summer due to a distinct shift in the concentration-discharge relationship. Measurements of soil water and groundwater THg and DOC concentrations, as well as a three-component mixing analysis, suggest that there was an accumulation of potentially-mobile DOC-bound THg in the well-humified organic soil layer in the catchment during the warm and dry summer period and that as the catchment became wetter in the autumn, there was an increase in soil water THg and DOC concentrations and these solutes were subsequently flushed during the autumn storm.

AB Climate change can have strong effects on aquatic ecosystems, including disrupting nutrient cycling and mediating processes that affect primary production. Past studies have been conducted mostly on individual or small groups of ecosystems, making it challenging to predict how future climate change will affect water quality at broad scales. We used a subcontinental-scale database to address three objectives: (1) identify which climate metrics best predict lake water quality, (2) examine whether climate influences different nutrient and productivity measures similarly, and (3) quantify the potential effects of a changing climate on lakes. We used climate data to predict lake water quality in similar to 11,000 north temperate lakes across 17 U.S. states. We developed a novel machine learning method that jointly models different measures of water quality using 48 climate metrics and accounts for properties inherent in macroscale data (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). Our results suggest that climate metrics related to winter precipitation and summer temperature were strong predictors of lake nutrients and productivity. However, we found variation in the magnitude and direction of the relationship between climate and water quality. We predict that a likely future climate change scenario of warmer summer temperatures will lead to increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass across lakes (median similar to 3%-9% increase), whereas increased winter precipitation will have highly variable effects. Our results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity in the response of individual ecosystems to climate and are a caution to extrapolating relationships across space.

AB A three-dimensional multiphase numerical model was used to simulate the infiltration and dissolution of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) release in two experimental flow cells containing different heterogeneous and well-characterized permeability fields. DNAPL infiltration was modeled using Brooks-Corey-Burdine hysteretic constitutive relationships. DNAPL dissolution was simulated using a rate-limited mass transfer expression with a velocity-dependent mass transfer coefficient and a thermodynamically based calculation of DNAPL-water interfacial area. The model did not require calibration of any parameters. The model predictions were compared to experimental measurements of high-resolution DNAPL saturations and effluent concentrations. The predicted concentrations were in close agreement with measurements for both domains, indicating that important processes were effectively captured by the model. DNAPL saturations greatly influenced mass transfer rates through their effect on relative permeability and velocity. Areas with low DNAPL saturation were associated with low interfacial areas, which resulted in reduced mass transfer rates and nonequilibrium dissolution. This was captured by the thermodynamic interfacial area model, while a geometric model overestimated the interfacial areas and the overall mass transfer. This study presents the first validation of the thermodynamic dissolution model in three dimensions and for high aqueous phase velocities; such conditions are typical for remediation operations, especially in heterogeneous aquifers. The demonstrated ability to predict DNAPL dissolution, only requiring prior characterization of soil properties and DNAPL release conditions, represents a significant improvement compared to empirical dissolution models and provides an opportunity to delineate the relationship between source zone architecture and the remediation potential for complex DNAPL source zones.

It foreshadowed increasing competition for water resources in critical areas of Lombok. This study examines preliminary information on local social-institutional arrangements for water allocation in the context of Ostrom's rules for self-governing institutions. We identify robust customary mechanisms for decision-making about water sharing and rules at a local level and suggest areas of further investigation for strengthening multi-level networked and nested frameworks, in collaboration with higher levels of government.

AB The planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, scheduled to launch in 2021, is designed to significantly improve on current lake and reservoir remote monitoring capacity. These improvements are especially important for the Mekong River Basin (MRB), where rapid dam construction puts downstream food security at risk and upstream dam operations are largely unknown to downstream water managers due to lack of upstream hydrologic information. This study aims to answer: How accurately will SWOT estimate reservoir storage change in the MRB? A physically based simulation tool developed by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to mimic SWOT-like observations of water bodies was applied to 20 reservoirs in the MRB and for 17 of those reservoirs, synthetic SWOT-based storage change estimates demonstrated high skill, with errors typically less than 8%. The remaining three reservoirs showed higher errors due to complex neighboring topography or long narrow reservoir shape. In comparison with current satellite observations of six reservoirs in the MRB, the synthetic SWOT observations showed between 4% and 10% lower storage change normalized root-mean-square error. Finally, the simulated elevation and surface area was successfully used to estimate the area-elevation relationships for each reservoir, with a median percent difference of 6.9%. These relationships are a potential avenue for multisensor cooperation toward improved understanding of reservoir dynamics. Such cooperation, where observations from many difference remote sensors are synthesized to provide a more complete view of human interactions on the river system, is vital for the MRB as more dams as human influence over the system increases.
   Plain Language Summary The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) is a satellite mission scheduled for launch in 2021. It will provide the hydrology community with simultaneous observations of width and height of water bodies that are currently not available. Such unprecedented capability is expected to be very useful in reservoir monitoring. In this study, we assess how useful SWOT data are likely to be for the Mekong River Basin that is now undergoing rapid dam development. We find that SWOT, with its wide spatial coverage, can effectively monitor most of the reservoirs of its storage change and outflow. We also find that a one-year period of observation is typically sufficient to build an effective area-elevation relationship for a reservoir which can then be useful for predicting reservoir dynamics. Overall, our study indicates that SWOT combined with other satellite sensors can make upstream and transboundary reservoir operations much more transparent for the downstream water manager.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB Rainfall-runoff processes appear to be highly nonlinear in Bayinbluk watersheds of the northwestern China. In this study, the time-scale wavelet transform has been used for the analysis of this nonstationary system. The Haar and Morlet wavelet transform were used to analyse the rainfall-runoff conversion relationship. Wavelet power spectrum and change point methods are also employed to analyse rainfall rates and runoffs measured at daily to half-hourly sampling rate. The four experimental sites (Luoto, Haer, Kuce and Shengl) are located in the Tianshan Mountains (Xinjiang province, China). Correlation analysis and wavelet transform are first applied to runoff process in different underlying surfaces. Wavelet analyses of rainfall rates and runoffs also give meaningful information on the temporal variability of the rainfall-runoff relationship. Change point and wavelet power spectrum analysis provide simple interpretation of energy distribution between different scales. The results indicate that wavelet transform is a good method for analysing the nonlinear relationship of temporal-spatial responses between rainfall and runoff. This method allowed quantification of the processes affecting runoff and provided an insight into their implications in surface water management. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Uncertainty in discharge data must be critically assessed before data can be used in, e. g. water resources estimation or hydrological modelling. In the alluvial Choluteca River in Honduras, the river-bed characteristics change over time as fill, scour and other processes occur in the channel, leading to a non-stationary stage-discharge relationship and difficulties in deriving consistent rating curves. Few studies have investigated the uncertainties related to non-stationarity in the stage-discharge relationship. We calculated discharge and the associated uncertainty with a weighted fuzzy regression of rating curves applied within a moving time window, based on estimated uncertainties in the observed rating data. An 18-year-long dataset with unusually frequent ratings (1268 in total) was the basis of this study. A large temporal variability in the stage-discharge relationship was found especially for low flows. The time-variable rating curve resulted in discharge estimate differences of -60 to +90% for low flows and +/- 20% for medium to high flows when compared to a constant rating curve. The final estimated uncertainty in discharge was substantial and the uncertainty limits varied between -43 to +73% of the best discharge estimate. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The evolution of hydrological drought events is a result of complex (nonlinear) interactions between climate and catchment processes. To investigate such nonlinear relationship, we integrated a machine learning modeling framework based on the random forest (RF) algorithms with an interpretation framework to quantify the role of climate and catchment controls on hydrological drought. More particularly, our framework interprets a built RF machine-learning model to identify dominant variables and visualize their functional dependence and interaction effects on hydrological drought characteristics utilizing concepts of minimal depth, interactive depth, and partial dependence. We test our proposed modeling framework based on a set of 652 continental United States catchments with minimal human interference for a period of 1979-2010. Application of this framework indicated presence of three distinct drought regimes, which includes, Regime 1: droughts with longer duration, less frequent and lesser intensity; Regime 2: droughts with moderate duration, moderate frequency, and moderate intensity; and Regime 3: droughts with shorter duration, more frequent, and more intense. RF algorithm was able to accurately model the drought characteristics (intensity, duration, and number of events) for all the three drought regimes as a function of selected variables. It was observed that the type of dominant variables as well as their nonlinear functional relationship with hydrological droughts characteristics can vary between three selected regimes. Our interpretation framework indicated that catchment characteristics have a significant role in controlling the hydrologic drought for catchments (regime 1), whereas both climate and catchment characteristics control hydrological drought in regimes 2 and 3.

TI Nonlinear Filtering Effects of Reservoirs on Flood Frequency Curves at
   the Regional Scale

   SCENARIOS; EQUALITY; IMPACTS
AB Reservoir operations may alter the characteristics of Flood Frequency Curve (FFC) and challenge the basic assumption of stationarity used in flood frequency analysis. This paper presents a combined data-modeling analysis of reservoir as a nonlinear filter of runoff routing that alters the FFCs. A dimensionless Reservoir Impact Index (RII), defined as the total upstream reservoir storage capacity normalized by the annual streamflow volume, is used to quantify reservoir regulation effects. Analyses are performed for 388 river stations in the contiguous U.S. using the first two moments of the FFC, mean annual maximum flood (MAF) and coefficient of variations (CV), calculated for the pre and post-dam periods. It is found that MAF generally decreases with increasing RII but stabilizes when RII exceeds a threshold value, and CV increases with RII until a threshold value beyond which CV decreases with RII. Hence depending on the magnitude of RII, reservoir regulation acts as a filter to increase or reduce the nonlinearity of the natural runoff routing process and alters flood characteristics. The nonlinear relationships of MAF and CV with RII can be captured by three reservoir models with different levels of complexity, suggesting that they emerge from the basic flood control function of reservoirs. However, the threshold RII values in the nonlinear relationships depend on the more detailed reservoir operations and objectives that can only be captured by the more complex reservoir models. Our conceptual model may help improve flood-risk assessment and mitigation in regulated river systems at the regional scale.

AB Sloping coastal aquifers in reality are ubiquitous and well documented. Steady state sharp-interface analytical solutions for describing seawater intrusion in sloping confined and unconfined coastal aquifers are developed based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation. Specifically, analytical solutions based on the constant-flux inland boundary condition are derived by solving the discharge equation for the interface zone with the continuity conditions of the head and flux applied at the interface between the freshwater zone and the interface zone. Analytical solutions for the constant-head inland boundary are then obtained by developing the relationship between the inland freshwater flux and hydraulic head and combining this relationship with the solutions of the constant-flux inland boundary. It is found that for the constant-flux inland boundary, the shape of the saltwater interface is independent of the geometry of the bottom confining layer for both aquifer types, despite that the geometry of the bottom confining layer determines the location of the interface tip. This is attributed to that the hydraulic head at the interface is identical to that of the coastal boundary, so the shape of the bed below the interface is irrelevant to the interface position. Moreover, developed analytical solutions with an empirical factor on the density factor are in good agreement with the results of variable-density flow numerical modeling. Analytical solutions developed in this study provide a powerful tool for assessment of seawater intrusion in sloping coastal aquifers as well as in coastal aquifers with a known freshwater flux but an arbitrary geometry of the bottom confining layer.

AB The hydraulics of steep mountain streams differ from lower gradient rivers due to shallow and rough flows, energetic subsurface flow, and macro-scale form drag from immobile boulders and channel and bed forms. Heightened flow resistance and reduced sediment transport rates in steep streams are commonly attributed to macro-scale form drag; however, little work has explored steep river hydrodynamics in the absence of complex bed geometries. Here we present theory for the vertical structure of flow velocity in steep streams with planar, rough beds that couples surface and subsurface flow. We test it against flume experiments using a bed of fixed cobbles over a wide range of bed slopes (0.4-30%). Experimental flows have a nearly logarithmic velocity profile far above the bed; flow velocity decreases less than logarithmically toward the bed and is nonzero at the bed surface. Velocity profiles match theory derived using a hybrid eddy viscosity model, in which the mixing length is a function of height above the bed and bed roughness. Subsurface flow velocities are large (>1 m/s) and follow a modified Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer relation that accounts for channel slope and shear from overlying surface flow. Near-bed turbulent fluctuations decrease for shallow, rough flows and scale with the depth-averaged flow velocity rather than bed shear velocity. Flow resistance for rough, planar beds closely matches observations in natural steep streams despite the lack of bed forms or channel forms in the experiments, suggesting that macro-scale form drag is smaller than commonly assumed in stress-partitioning models for sediment transport.

AB [1] A large number of models in hydrology and climate sciences rely on multiple linear regression to explain the link between key variables. The relationship in the physical world may experiment sudden changes because of climatic, environmental, or anthropogenic perturbations. To deal with this issue, a Bayesian method of multiple changepoint detection in multiple linear regression is proposed in this paper. It is an adaptation of the recursion-based multiple changepoint method of Fearnhead (2005, 2006) to the classical multiple linear model. A new class of priors for the parameters of the multiple linear model is introduced, and useful formulas are derived that permit straightforward computation of the posterior distribution of the changepoints. The proposed method is numerically efficient and does not involve time consuming Monte-Carlo Markov Chain simulation as opposed to other Bayesian changepoint methods. It allows fast and straightforward simulation of the probability of each possible number of changepoints as well as the posterior probability distribution of each changepoint conditional on the number of changes. The approach is validated on simulated data sets and then compared to the methodology of Seidou et al. (2006) on two practical problems, as follows: (1) the changepoint detection in the multiple linear relationship between mean basin scale precipitation at different periods of the year and the summer-autumn flood peaks of the Broadback River located in Northern Quebec, Canada; and (b) the detection of trend variations in the streamflows of the Ogoki River located in the province of Ontario, Canada.

AB We conducted a series of four physical modeling experiments of mountain growth at differing rates of uplift and three distinct climates ranging from relatively wet to relatively dry. The spatial and temporal pattern of landscape behavior is characterized by approximate to f(-1) scaling in sediment discharge and power law scaling in the magnitude and frequency of ridge movement in all four experiments. We find that internally generated self-organized critical (SOC) processes generate dynamically stable catchment geometries after approximate to 1 relief depths of erosion: these regularly spaced catchments have an average outlet-spacing ratio of 2.16, well within the range of values reported in field studies. Once formed, large catchment bounding ridges oscillate about a critically balanced mean location, with occasional large-scale changes in catchment size. Ridge movement appears to be driven by the competition for discharge as landslides push ridges back and forth. These dynamics lead to the emergence of a complex twofold scaling in catchment dynamics that is fully established by 1.8 relief depths of erosion; at this stage, a clear threshold has emerged separating two distinct scaling regimes, where large ridge mobility is insensitive to relief and small ridge mobility is relief dependent. Overall, we demonstrate that the development of dynamically stable large-scale landforms is related to the emergence of a complex-system hierarchy in topographic dynamics. Once formed, these landscapes do not evolve; statistical properties such as average topography and discharge become stationary while topography remains highly dynamic at smaller length scales.

TI Process connectivity in a naturally prograding river delta

AB River deltas are lowland systems that can display high hydrological connectivity. This connectivity can be structural (morphological connections), functional (control of fluxes), and process connectivity (information flow from system drivers to sinks). In this work, we quantify hydrological process connectivity in Wax Lake Delta, coastal Louisiana, by analyzing couplings among external drivers (discharge, tides, and wind) and water levels recorded at five islands and one channel over summer 2014. We quantify process connections with information theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the communication of information. We represent process connections as a network; variables serve as network nodes and couplings as network links describing the strength, direction, and time scale of information flow. Comparing process connections at long (105 days) and short (10 days) time scales, we show that tides exhibit daily synchronization with water level, with decreasing strength from downstream to upstream, and that tides transfer information as tides transition from spring to neap. Discharge synchronizes with water level and the time scale of its information transfer compares well to physical travel times through the system, computed with a hydrodynamic model. Information transfer and physical transport show similar spatial patterns, although information transfer time scales are larger than physical travel times. Wind events associated with water level setup lead to increased process connectivity with highly variable information transfer time scales. We discuss the information theory results in the context of the hydrologic behavior of the delta, the role of vegetation as a connector/disconnector on islands, and the applicability of process networks as tools for delta modeling results.
   Plain Language Summary Connectivity is an increasingly important concept in studying the complexity and evolution of landscapes. One aspect of connectivity often overlooked is process connectivity; the interaction between external drivers and system variables such as water level and sediment concentration. A better understanding of deltaic process connectivity would benefit numerical modelers in improving delta simulations. In this work, we apply information theory to directly quantify for the first time the connectivity between discharge, wind, and tides, and water level at five deltaic islands and one channel in Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a prograding delta in coastal Louisiana that is often cast as an analog of a river diversion system. The importance of deltaic islands as areas of increased biogeochemical processing make this analysis particularly relevant to better understand the hydrologic controls on islands. Our results highlight the multi-scale interactions between external drivers and deltaic water level. The role of wind events, tidal regime, and vegetation controls in process connectivity indicate the dynamic nature of deltaic systems. Couplings are characterized in terms of strength, direction, significance, and scale. Process connectivity is visualized as a process network; variables are network nodes and couplings are network links that depict significant information flow.

AB Fracture transmissivity and detailed aperture fields are measured in analog fractures specifically designed to evaluate the utility of the Reynolds equation. We employ a light transmission technique with well-defined accuracy (similar to 1% error) to measure aperture fields at high spatial resolution (similar to 0.015 cm). A Hele-Shaw cell is used to confirm our approach by demonstrating agreement between experimental transmissivity, simulated transmissivity on the measured aperture field, and the parallel plate law. In the two rough-walled analog fractures considered, the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical estimates of fracture transmissivity was sufficiently large (similar to 22-47%) to exclude numerical and experimental errors (<2%) as a source. We conclude that the three-dimensional character of the flow field is important for fully describing fluid flow in the two rough-walled fractures considered and that the approach of depth averaging inherent in the formulation of the Reynolds equation is inadequate. We also explore the effects of spatial resolution, aperture measurement technique, and alternative definitions for link transmissivities in the finite difference formulation, including some that contain corrections for tortuosity perpendicular to the mean fracture plane and Stakes flow. Various formulations for link transmissivity are shown to converge at high resolution (similar to 1/5 the spatial correlation length) in our smoothly varying fracture. At coarser resolutions the solution becomes increasingly sensitive to definition of link transmissivity and measurement technique. Aperture measurements that integrate over individual grid blocks were less sensitive to measurement scale and definition of link transmissivity than point sampling techniques.

TI Optimizing environmental flows for multiple reaches affected by a

AB For reservoirs that are operated for multiple purposes such as water supply, flood control, and power generation, any attempts to incorporate environmental flow targets in the reservoir operation rules need to take into account both the human and ecosystem demands. To date, however, none of the reservoir operation schemes that consider environmental flow requirements includes subdaily flow regimes and is able to optimize for multiple reaches. Here, we address the temporal and spatial issues associated with the optimal environmental flow and operation strategies for a multipurpose reservoir system in Taiwan. We propose an environmental flow proportion strategy and three-period release approach, and multireach operation scenarios that simultaneously optimize reservoir performances and environmental flow objectives at subdaily to interannual timescales for a maximum of three connected reaches. Our results imply that taking into account the environmental flow objectives does not necessarily degrade the overall reservoir performance due to the positive effect on flood control, which in turn would compensate for the adverse effects on domestic water supply and hydropower generation. The three-period release approach benefits mainly the subdaily flow regime, while the environmental flow proportion strategy benefits primarily the daily flow regime. Spatially, a mutual exclusion is observed between the reaches above and below a diversion weir, a fact that revises the conventional perception that restoring the flow regimes of a downstream reach would automatically restore those of upstream reaches. An overall evaluation reveals that the three-reach scenario outperforms the two-reach scenarios, which then outperform the one-reach scenarios. The one-or two-reach scenario that incorporates the midstream reach may be taken as an alternative because such scenario would benefit the upstream or downstream reach in addition to the midstream reach.

AB The movability of water in shale nanopores intensely affects the transport and storage of other fluids and plays an important role in the geological water cycle. To investigate the movability of water, three shale samples were used to conduct flow experiments using the steady state and step-by-step depressurization method. The experimental results show that the movability of water strongly depends on the pressure gradient. Two water-related mechanisms, shear fluidity and electroviscous effect, are primarily responsible for the difference in movability between free water and bound water. The flow of water in these samples deviates from Darcy's law, and the threshold pressure gradient (TPG) is observed. When the pressure gradient is higher than the TPG, water starts to flow, and the permeability increases with increasing pressure gradient. Based on the analysis of the solid-liquid interfacial forces, the water in the shale was quantitatively classified into four types (L1, L2, L3, and L4) according to its movability. The calculation results indicate that most of the water, which could be up to 74.46-89.73%, is immovable under the experimental conditions. The proportion of movable water increases with increasing pressure gradient, and the relation can be expressed by a quadratic function. The moving ratio was defined as the ratio of the volume of water involved in flow to the total pore volume. The correlation between the moving ratio and permeability is a power function with exponents ranging from 1.16 to 1.43, indicating that water permeability is sensitive to the moving ratio.

AB We present an experimental study of pore-scale flow dynamics of liquid CO2 and water in a two-dimensional heterogeneous porous micromodel, inspired by the structure of a reservoir rock, at reservoir-relevant conditions (80 bar, 21 degrees C). The entire process of CO2 infiltration into a water-saturated micromodel was captured using fluorescence microscopy and the micro-PIV method, which together reveal complex fluid displacement patterns and abrupt changes in velocity. The CO2 front migrated through the resident water in an intermittent manner, forming dendritic structures, termed fingers, in directions along, normal to, and even opposing the bulk pressure gradient. Such characteristics indicate the dominance of capillary fingering through the micromodel. Velocity burst events, termed Haines jumps, were also captured in the heterogeneous micromodel, during which the local Reynolds number was estimated to be similar to 21 in the CO2 phase, exceeding the range of validity of Darcy's law. Furthermore, these drainage events were observed to be cooperative (i.e., across multiple pores simultaneously), with the zone of influence of such events extending beyond tens of pores, confirming, in a quantitative manner, that Haines jumps are nonlocal phenomena. After CO2 completely breaks through the porous section, shear-induced circulations caused by flowing CO2 were also observed, in agreement with previous studies using a homogeneous porous micromodel. To our knowledge, this study is the first quantitative measurement that incorporates both reservoir-relevant conditions and rock-inspired heterogeneity, and thus will be useful for pore-scale model development and validation.

AB Shrink-swell soils crack and become compacted as they dry, changing properties such as bulk density and hydraulic conductivity. Multidomain models divide soil into independent realms that allow soil cracks to be incorporated into classical flow and transport models. Incongruously, most applications of multidomain models assume that the porosity distributions, bulk density, and effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil are constant. This study builds on a recently derived soil shrinkage model to develop a new multidomain, dual-permeability model that can accurately predict variations in soil hydraulic properties due to dynamic changes in crack size and connectivity. The model only requires estimates of soil gravimetric water content and a minimal set of parameters, all of which can be determined using laboratory and/or field measurements. We apply the model to eight clayey soils, and demonstrate its ability to quantify variations in volumetric water content (as can be determined during measurement of a soil water characteristic curve) and transient saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s (as can be measured using infiltration tests). The proposed model is able to capture observed variations in K-s of one to more than two orders of magnitude. In contrast, other dual-permeability models assume that K-s is constant, resulting in the potential for large error when predicting water movement through shrink-swell soils. Overall, the multidomain model presented here successfully quantifies fluctuations in the hydraulic properties of shrink-swell soil matrices, and are suitable for use in physical flow and transport models based on Darcy's Law, the Richards Equation, and the advection-dispersion equation.

AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks represent one of the most prevalent deep learning (DL) architectures in current hydrological modeling, but they remain black boxes from which process understanding can hardly be obtained. This study aims to demonstrate the potential of interpretive DL in gaining scientific insights using flood prediction across the contiguous United States (CONUS) as a case study. Two interpretation methods were adopted to decipher the machine-captured patterns and inner workings of LSTM networks. The DL interpretation by the expected gradients method revealed three distinct input-output relationships learned by LSTM-based runoff models in 160 individual catchments. These relationships correspond to three flood-inducing mechanisms-snowmelt, recent rainfall, and historical rainfall-that account for 10.1%, 60.9%, and 29.0% of the 20,908 flow peaks identified from the data set, respectively. Single flooding mechanisms dominate 70.7% of the investigated catchments (11.9% snowmelt-dominated, 34.4% recent rainfall-dominated, and 24.4% historical rainfall-dominated mechanisms), and the remaining 29.3% have mixed mechanisms. The spatial variability in the dominant mechanisms reflects the catchments' geographic and climatic conditions. Moreover, the additive decomposition method unveils how the LSTM network behaves differently in retaining and discarding information when emulating different types of floods. Information from inputs within previous time steps can be partially stored in the memory of LSTM networks to predict snowmelt-induced and historical rainfall-induced floods, while for recent rainfall-induced floods, only recent information is retained. Overall, this study provides a new perspective for understanding hydrological processes and extremes and demonstrates the prospect of artificial intelligence-assisted scientific discovery in the future.

AB Establishing a holistic approach to manage floods and droughts is essential considering the different hydrological conditions. This work aimed to demonstrate how the integrated management of floods and droughts (IMFD) can increase sustainability and decrease the vulnerability of reservoirs against water-related disasters. To do so, a non-integrated management of floods and droughts (NMFD) is compared to an IMFD approach for the optimal operation of a reservoir (Doroudzan dam) to evaluate the sustainability of each scenario, especially the environmental water demand for Bakhtegan lake. Doroudzan dam provides water for different users, especially the environmental water demand. The IMFD and NMFD are differentiated through the development of industrial activities and the construction of a new regulatory dam, respectively. Each management scenario is tested under three hydrological conditions, i.e., dry, normal, and wet, which are determined by the standardized runoff index (SRI). Additionally, in the IMFD scenario, optimal cropping patterns are proposed to farmers by policymakers to increase water use efficiency. The heterogeneity in farmers' response to adopting these cropping patterns is simulated through a well-known behavioral theory, prospect theory (PT). A novel optimization algorithm, NSGAIII, is utilized to determine the optimal operation of the reservoir and a bankruptcy scenario is utilized to share released water from the reservoir between the involved stakeholders. Results show the superiority of the IMFD scenario against the NMFD scenario in terms of decreasing water shortage as well as agricultural and environmental vulnerability, especially in dry conditions due to implementing more sustainable solutions. The average annual financial wealth generated by the IMFD scenario is greater than that of the NMFD scenario by about 68% through development in the industrial activities as a more profitable sector. Also, the utilization of PT shows how downstream and upstream farmers behave distinctly towards policymakers' recommendations because they have different viewpoints about the amount of available water.

AB The coefficient of variation (CV) of maximum annual floods is examined to understand the effects of process controls and catchment size. A derived flood frequency model is used to interpret data from 489 catchments in Austria. At the core of process controls appears to be the interaction of catchment response time and storm duration, but the magnitude is not large, and often this interaction is hidden by other processes. The dependence of rainfall intensity and duration is clearly very important and reduces CV significantly. Increasing channel travel times with catchment scale tend to translate into decreasing CVs with area for small catchments while they tend to translate into increasing CVs with area for larger catchments. Nonlinear runoff processes, including threshold effects, is the main mechanism for increasing CV. They give rise to complex patterns in the relationship between CV and area. Base flow has been used as a surrogate for a number of processes, such as seasonality of streamflow. It always decreases CV and, in particular, leads to a significant decrease of CV with area. Both the observed tendency of CV to decrease with area and the scatter in the data are the result of a complex interplay of a number of processes which allows various alternative interpretations. Depending on which processes dominate under a particular hydrologic regime, different patterns arise. It appears that the explanations of the relationship between CV and catchment scale suggested in the literature are too simplistic. The case is made for using the concept of hydrologic regimes and process studies of the type presented here to help delineate homogeneous regions for regional flood frequency analyses in a physically consistent way.

AB Flow paths and residence times in the hyporheic zone are known to influence biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification. The exchange across the sediment-water interface may involve mixing of surface water and groundwater through complex hyporheic flow paths that contribute to highly variable biogeochemically active zones. Despite the recognition of these patterns in the literature, conceptualization and analysis of flow paths and nitrogen transformations beneath riffle-pool sequences often neglect to consider bed form driven exchange along the entire reach. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) were monitored in the hyporheic zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence on a losing section of the Truckee River, NV. Spatially varying hyporheic exchange and the occurrence of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells are shown to influence concentrations of DO and NO3- and the mean residence time (MRT) of riffle and pool areas. Distinct patterns observed in piezometers are shown to be influenced by the first large flow event following a steady 8 month period of low flow conditions. Increases in surface water discharge resulted in reversed hydraulic gradients and production of nitrate through nitrification at small vertical spatial scales (0.10-0.25 m) beneath the sediment-water interface. In areas with high downward flow rates and low MRT, denitrification may be limited. The use of a longitudinal two-dimensional flow model helped identify important mechanisms such as multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells and spatially varying MRT, an important driver for nitrogen transformation in the riverbed. Our observations of DO and NO3- concentrations and model simulations highlight the role of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells on MRT and nitrogen transformations in the hyporheic zone of riffle-pool sequences.

AB Laboratory experiments have been carried out to study groundwater flow in a single fracture under the conditions of different surface roughness and apertures. We found that the gradient of the Reynolds number versus the average velocity in a single fracture was almost independent of the change of fracture surface roughness, and it decreased when the aperture decreased under the same surface roughness. The experimental results showed that the average flow velocity (V) could be approximated by an empirical exponential function of the hydraulic gradient (1), and the power index of the exponential function was close to 0.5 when the hydraulic gradient is around 0.003 to 0.02. Such a V-I relationship indicated a non-Darcian turbulent flow in the fracture even though the Reynolds number was relatively low (between 333.26 and 1413.62). This finding supports the claims of non-Darcian flow observed in fractures by many recent studies under relatively fast flow condition but disagreed with the Darcian flow and local cubic law assumptions used in some previous studies.

ID PROGRAMMING GRADIENT-METHOD; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Optimal design of a water distribution network is formulated as a two-stage decomposition model. The master (outer) problem is nonsmooth and nonconvex, while the inner problem is linear. A semi-infinite linear dual problem is presented, and an equivalent finite linear problem is developed. The overall design problem is solved globally by a branch and bound algorithm, using nonsmooth optimization and duality theory. The algorithm stops with a solution and a global bound, such that the difference between this bound and the true global optimum is within a prescribed tolerance. The algorithm has been programmed and applied to a number of examples from the literature. The results demonstrate its superiority over previous methods.

AB This study investigates divering overland flow utilizing kinematic wave theory, which does not appear to have been dealt with previously. Explicit analytical solutions are derived in dimensionless form for space-time invariant rainfall. Analytical solutions do not seem to be tractable for time-varying rainfall. Depending upon the duration of rainfall, equilibrium and partial equilibrium cases are distinguished explicitly. The effect of divergence parameter on the hydrograph shape is shown. The adequacy of kinematic approximation for characterization of diverging overland flow is tested against laboratory watershed results. The diverging overland flow model is found to yield results which compare well with observations and with those of a plane model.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are increasing in freshwaters worldwide, with important implications for aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem services. While multiple environmental changes may be responsible for these trends, predicting the occurrence and magnitude of "browning" and relating such trends to changes in DOC sources versus hydrologic transport remain key challenges. We analyzed long-term trends in DOC concentration from the two dominant landscape sources (riparian soils and mire peats) and receiving streams in a boreal catchment to evaluate how browning patterns relate to land cover and hydrology. Increases in stream DOC were widespread but not universal. Browning was most pronounced in small, forested streams, where trends corresponded to twofold to threefold increases in DOC production in riparian soils and increases in annual DOC export from a forested headwater. By contrast, DOC did not change in mire peats or streams draining catchments with high lake or mire cover, nor did we observe trends in DOC export from a mire-dominated headwater. The distinct long-term trends in DOC sources also altered concentration-discharge relationships, with a forested headwater shifting from transport-limited toward chemostasis, and a mire outlet stream shifting from chemostasis to source-limitated. Modified DOC supply to headwaters, together with altered seasonal hydrology and differences in the dominant water source along the stream network gave rise to predictable browning trends and consistent concentration-discharge relationships. Overall, our results show that the sources of DOC to boreal aquatic ecosystems are responding to environmental change in fundamentally different ways, with important consequences for browning along boreal stream networks.

AB Flume experiments were conducted to measure bed morphology adjustments in sand/gravel and sand/silt sediment mixtures during repeated hydrographs and to link these changes to sediment transport patterns over multiple time scales. Sediment composition and hydrograph flow magnitude greatly influenced channel morphology, which impacted sediment yield, hysteresis, and transport predictions. Bed load yields were larger and more variable for the sand/silt mixture, as gravel in the sand/gravel sediment inhibited grain entrainment, limited bed form growth, and acted to stabilize the bed. Hysteresis patterns varied due to bed form and surface structure adjustments, as well as the stabilizing effect of antecedent low flows. Using half the data set, a dimensionless fractional transport equation was derived based on excess shear stress. Dimensionless reference shear stresses were estimated in two ways: as bulk values from all transport measurements and by applying a separate limb approach in which values were estimated for each limb of each hydrograph. For the other half of the data set, transport predictions with the separate limb approach were more accurate than those from six existing transport equations and the fractional relationship applied with bulk reference shear stresses. Thus, hydrograph limb-dependent dimensionless reference shear stress links changing bed morphology and sediment transport, providing a parameter to improve transport predictions during individual flood events and in unsteady flow regimes. This approach represents a framework with which to develop site-specific transport relationships for varying flow regimes, particularly in cases where detailed bed morphology measurements are not feasible and heterogeneous sediment complicates bed structure over time.

AB Satellite remote sensing has been used extensively for many years to monitor the open oceans and coastal waters. These methods have been extended more recently to the study of inland waters. In this study we consider the potential application of data from two ocean color sensors, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), for monitoring the levels of suspended solids in small and intermediate sized lakes and reservoirs. We measured total suspended matter (TSM) in four southwestern United States lakes, Roosevelt Lake, Saguaro Lake, Bartlett Lake, and Lake Pleasant, and compared these field data with images obtained from these medium resolution satellite sensors. Our regression analysis of the complete data set identified a linear relationship between the field TSM values and both MODIS 250 m data (r(2) = 0.461) and MERIS 290 m data (r(2) = 0.521). This relationship improved substantially when data from the smallest lake in the study (Saguaro Lake) were excluded from the analysis (r(2) = 0.819 and r(2) = 0.888, respectively). The resultant linear models produced estimates with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 3.14 mg/L (MODIS) and 2.04 mg/L (MERIS) for all four lakes combined, improving to 1.32 mg/L (MODIS) and 0.47 mg/L (MERIS) for a lake-specific regression. These results suggest that these satellite sensors have the potential to effectively monitor TSM in lakes and reservoirs, although a minimum practical lake size does appear to exist.

AB Basic concepts such as conditional probability distributions, conditional return periods, and joint return periods are important to understand and to interpret multivariate hydrological events such as floods and storms. However, these concepts are not well documented in the open literature. This paper assembles and clarifies these concepts, and illustrates their practical utility. Relationships between joint return periods and univariate return periods are also derived. These concepts and relationships are demonstrated by applying a bivariate extreme value distribution to represent the joint distribution of flood peak and volume from an actual basin.

AB Survival of desert riparian vegetation along the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River in China depends almost entirely on groundwater. The aim of this project was to study the effect of various water table levels on desert riparian forest vegetation and to determine the groundwater threshold under which desert riparian forest vegetation can grow normally. Using data collected from 2 years (2006-2007) of monitoring (groundwater, vegetation plots, and soil profiles) of the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River, the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors was analysed using detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA). The average depth of the groundwater table at the study sites was divided into six ranges (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and > 10 m) to compare the influence of groundwater level on species diversity. Using the ecological suitability theory and data from previous studies of several major plant species in the study area, a logarithm normal distribution relation model was built between the growth of plants and the depth of groundwater. The results of DCCA ordination indicated that groundwater depth (GWD) and soil moisture are the crucial environmental factors affecting the distribution of plants. Species diversity was the highest at the 2-4 m level, followed by the 4-6 m level, and then the 0-2 m level. When the groundwater level dropped to below 6 m, species diversity decreased greatly, and the slope of Hill's index (diversity ordering) tended to level off. Thus, the optimum groundwater level for major plant growth is 2-4 m and the threshold GWD is about 6 m. To restore the vegetation and ecosystem of the lower reaches of the Tarim River, the water table must be kept at a minimum of 6 m in depth. It should also be maintained at 2-4 m in the vicinity of the water way and at 4-6 m for the rest of this arid area. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An Eulerian moment expansion through sigma(v)(N) (sigma(v)(2) is the velocity variance) is developed for reactive chemical transport. in heterogeneous porous media with linear non-equilibrium sorption. Both the hydraulic conductivity and sorption partition coefficients are treated as spatial random variables to account for physical and chemical heterogeneities. The theory provides a self-consistent recursive solution to the closure problem associated with Eulerian methods. The closed form of the mean concentration up to O(sigma(v)(4)) (or second order in terms of sigma(v)(2)) is explicitly expressed in spatial-Fourier and temporal-Laplace space and numerically inverted to v real space via FFT. The second-order transport solution is combined with a first-order solution to the flow equation and used to calculate the mean concentration as well as the spatial moments. The calculated second-order and first-order results are compared with Monte Carlo simulated results. The results demonstrate that the first-order solution is equivalent to a non-local reactive transport theory. The second-order correction to the reactive transport solution slightly decreases the second longitudinal moment, but significantly increases the second transverse moment and decreases the skewness of the plume. The comparison among the first-order, second-order and Monte Carlo simulated results also reveals that the Monte Carlo simulated second longitudinal moment is closer to the second-order corrected longitudinal moment, but the Monte Carlo simulated second transverse moment is much closer to the first-order solution. Moreover, the second-order correction significantly increases the fourth moments, especially in the transverse direction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Headwater streams are critical components of drainage systems, directly connecting terrestrial and downstream aquatic ecosystems. The amount of water in a stream can alter hydrologic connectivity between the stream and surrounding landscape and is ultimately an important driver of what constituents headwater streams transport. There is a shortage of studies that explore concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in headwater systems, especially forested watersheds, where the hydrological and ecological processes that control the processing and export of solutes can be directly investigated. We sought to identify the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of stream chemistry at three points along a forested headwater stream in Northern Michigan and utilize C-Q relationships to explore transport dynamics and potential sources of solutes in the stream. Along the stream, surface flow was seasonal in the main stem, and perennial flow was spatially discontinuous for all but the lowest reaches. Spring snowmelt was the dominant hydrological event in the year with peak flows an order of magnitude larger at the mouth and upper reaches than annual mean discharge. All three C-Q shapes (positive, negative, and flat) were observed at all locations along the stream, with a higher proportion of the analytes showing significant relationships at the mouth than at the mid or upper flumes. At the mouth, positive (flushing) C-Q shapes were observed for dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids, whereas negative (dilution) C-Q shapes were observed for most cations (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and biologically cycled anions (NO3-, PO43-, SO42-). Most analytes displayed significant C-Q relationships at the mouth, indicating that discharge is a significant driving factor controlling stream chemistry. However, the importance of discharge appeared to decrease moving upstream to the headwaters where more localized or temporally dynamic factors may become more important controls on stream solute patterns.

AB Cultural factors - values, beliefs, and norms - provide important insights into the environmental attitudes, risk perceptions, and behaviors of the general population. Little is known, however, about the ostensibly complex relationships linking those elements of culture to climate change risk perceptions, especially in the context of farm level decision in the ground water context. This paper addresses that gap through an analysis of survey data provided by irrigators in the Namoi catchment of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. We use Values-Beliefs-Norms theory to construct multivariate models of the relationship between ground water irrigators' interpretations of climate change risks and their implementation of adaptive water conservation practices. Results indicate that these cultural factors are important explanations of irrigators' climate change risk perceptions, and these risk perceptions are related to adaptive ground water management strategies at the farm level. The implications of the findings are discussed for research on the culture-environment nexus and for outreach designed to encourage agricultural adaptations to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Hydrological modeling in swelling/shrinking peat soils
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID WATER STORAGE; SUBSIDENCE; SHRINKAGE; DYNAMICS; FLOW; DEFORMATION;
   BEHAVIOR
AB [ 1] Peatlands respond to natural hydrologic cycles of precipitation and evapotranspiration with reversible deformations due to variations of water content in both the unsaturated and saturated zone. This phenomenon results in short-term vertical displacements of the soil surface that superimpose to the irreversible long-term subsidence naturally occurring in drained cropped peatlands because of bio-oxidation of the organic matter. These processes cause changes in the peat structure, in particular, soil density and void ratio. The consequential changes in the hydrological parameters need to be incorporated in water flow dynamical models. In this paper, we present a new constitutive relationship for the soil shrinkage characteristic (SSC) in peats by describing the variation of porosity with moisture content. This model, based on simple physical considerations, is valid for both anisotropic and isotropic three-dimensional peat deformations. The capability of the proposed SSC to accurately describe the deformation dynamics has been assessed by comparison against a set of laboratory experimental results recently published. The constitutive relationship has been implemented into a Richards' equation - based numerical code and applied for the simulation of the peat soil dynamics as observed in a peatland south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy, in an ad hoc field experiment where the relevant parameters are continuously measured. The modeling results match well a large set of field data encompassing a period of more than 50 days and demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for a reliable reproduction of the soil vertical displacement dynamics as well as the hydrological behavior in terms of, for example, water flow, moisture content, and suction.

AB Mean sapwood thickness, measured in fifteen 73 year old Eucalyptus regnans and E. delegatensis stands, correlated strongly with forest overstorey stocking density (R-2 0.72). This curvilinear relationship was used with routine forest stocking density and basal area measurements to estimate sapwood area of the forest overstorey at various times in 15 research catchments in undisturbed and disturbed forests located in the Great Dividing Range, Victoria, Australia. Up to 45 years of annual precipitation and streamflow data available from the 15 catchments were used to examine relationships between mean annual loss (evapotranspiration estimated as mean annual precipitation minus mean annual streamflow), and sapwood area. Catchment mean sapwood area correlated strongly (R-2 0.88) with catchment mean annual loss. Variation in sapwood area accounted for 68% more variation in mean annual streamflow than precipitation alone (R-2 0.90 compared with R-2 0.22). Changes in sapwood area accounted for 96% of the changes in mean annual loss observed after forest thinning or clear-cutting and regeneration. We conclude that forest inventory data can be used reliably to predict spatial and temporal variation in catchment annual losses and streamflow in response to natural and imposed disturbances in even-aged forests. Consequently, recent advances in mapping of sapwood area using airborne light detection and ranging will enable high resolution spatial and temporal mapping of mean annual loss and mean annual streamflow over large areas of forested catchment. This will be particularly beneficial in management of water resources from forested catchments subject to disturbance but lacking reliable long-term (years to decades) streamflow records.

AB Fluid flow exerts a critical impact on the convection of thermal energy in geological media, whereas heat transport in turn affects fluid properties, including fluid dynamic viscosity and density. The interplay of flow and heat transport also affects solute transport. To unravel these complex coupled flow, heat, and solute transport processes, here, we present a theory for the idealized scale-dependent Poiseuille flow model considering a constant temperature gradient (del T) along a single fracture, where fluid dynamic viscosity connects with temperature via an exponential function. The idealized scale-dependent model is validated based on the solutions from direct numerical simulations. We find that the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the Poiseuille flow either increases or decreases with scales depending on del T > 0 degrees C/m or del T<0 degrees C/m, respectively. Indeed, the degree of changes in K depends on the magnitude of del T and fracture length. The scale-dependent model provides an alternative explanation for the well-known scale-dependent transport problem, for example, the dispersion coefficient increases with travel distance when del T>0 degrees C/m according to the Taylor dispersion theory, because K (or equivalently flux through fractures) scales with fracture length. The proposed theory unravels intertwined interactions between flow and transport processes, which might shed light on understanding many practical geophysical problems, for example, geothermal energy exploration.

AB The goal of this study is to evaluate the conductivity of random close packings of non-spherical, rodshaped proppant particles under the closure stress using numerical simulation and lab tests, with application to the conductivity of hydraulic fractures created in subterranean formation to stimulate production from oil and gas reservoirs. Numerical simulations of a steady viscous flow through proppant packs are carried out using the lattice Boltzmann method for the Darcy flow regime. The particle packings were generated numerically using the sequential deposition method. The simulations are conducted for packings of spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, and mixtures of spheres with cylinders at various volumetric concentrations. It is demonstrated that cylinders provide the highest permeability among the proppants studied. The dependence of the nondimensional permeability (scaled by the equivalent particle radius squared) on porosity obtained numerically is well approximated by the power-law function: K/R-v(2) = 0. 204 phi(4.58) in a wide range of porosity: 0.3 <= phi <= 0.7. Lattice-Boltzmann simulations are cross-verified against finite-volume simulations using Navier-Stokes equations for inertial flow regime. Correlations for the normalized beta-factor as a function of porosity and normalized permeability are presented as well. These formulae are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements (including packings of rod-shaped particles) and existing laboratory data, available in the porosity range 0.3 <= phi <= 0.5. Comparison with correlations by other authors is also given. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work examines the influence of initial (i.e. post drainage) nonwetting (NW) fluid topology on total residual (i.e. after imbibition) NW phase saturation. Brine and air (used as a proxy for supercritical CO2) flow experiments were performed on Bentheimer sandstone; results were quantified via imaging with X-ray computed microtomography (X-ray CMT), which allows for three dimensional, non-destructive, pore-scale analysis of the amount, distribution, and connectivity of NW phase fluid within the sandstone cores. In order to investigate the phenomenon of fluid connectivity and how it changes throughout flow processes, the Bentheimer sandstone results are compared to previously collected X-ray CMT data from similar experiments performed in a sintered glass bead column, a loose packed glass bead column, and a column packed with crushed tuff. This allows us to interpret the results in a broader sense from the work, and draw conclusions of a more general nature because they are not based on a single pore geometry. Connectivity is quantified via the normalized Euler number of the NW fluid phase; the Euler number of a particular sample is normalized by the maximum connectivity of the media, i.e. the Euler number of the system at 100% NW phase saturation. General connectivity-saturation relationships were identified for the various media. In terms of trapping, it was found that residual NW phase trapping is dependent on initial (i.e. post-drainage) NW phase connectivity as well as imbibition capillary number for the Bentheimer sandstone. Conversely, the sintered glass bead column exhibited no significant relationship between trapping and NW topology.
   These findings imply that for a CO2 sequestration scenario, capillary trapping is controlled by both the imbibition capillary number and the initial NW phase connectivity: as capillary number increases, and the normalized initial Euler number approaches a value of 1.0, capillary trapping is suppressed. This finding is significant to CO2 sequestration, because both the drainage (CO2 injection) and imbibition (subsequent water injection or infiltration) processes can be engineered in order to maximize residual trapping within the porous medium. Based on the findings presented here, we suggest that both the Euler number-saturation and the capillary number-saturation relationships for a given medium should be considered when designing a CO2 sequestration scenario.

AB Nitrate Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships have been used to infer nitrate sources, storage, reactions, and transport in watersheds, and to reveal key processes that control runoff chemistry. Yet, studies on long-term nitrate C-Q relationships are limited due to scarce high frequency (e.g., daily) concentration data. In this paper, using a long-term high-frequency dataset (1976-2019) comprising stream flow and nitrate concentrations, we quantitatively analyzed the long-term variations of event-scale hysteresis patterns (quantified by hysteresis index, HI, and flushing index, FI) to infer the leaching mechanisms of nitrate in an artificially drained agricultural watershed in Mid-western U.S. Our results revealed that most events exhibited anti-clockwise behaviors (HI < 0), regardless of whether nitrate was flushed or diluted during events. This means that water with high levels of nitrate-N reaches the stream network slower than water with lower nitrate concentrations. Long-term mean FI was close to zero but had strong seasonal patterns with dilution patterns observed during Winter and Summer, and flushing patterns during late Spring and Fall. The consistently negative HI values regardless of the FI value gave a strong indication of the preponderant role of the near-drain zone that usually exhibits accelerated leaching and less accumulation of nitrate in the soil profile in these drained agricultural watersheds. Both HI and FI depicted strong but opposite seasonality because of weather patterns and agricultural activities, particularly N fertilization. Overall, our findings suggest a little evidence of the role of deep groundwater and instead a strong evidence of the role of subsurface drainage as the primary pathway for nitrate transport in drained agricultural watersheds. Therefore, artificial drainage could dampen N legacy caused by the historically intensive N fertil-ization in drained agricultural landscapes.

AB One of the main assumptions that renders the stochastic theories applicable to real aquifers is the ergodic hypothesis, i.e. the possibility to exchange ensemble and spatial averages of a variable of interest. The principal aim of this paper is to elucidate the conditions that allow for an exchange between ensemble and spatially averaged second moments of concentration field (S-ij); the fulfillment of the ergodic condition underlies the applicability of the dispersion coefficients or other related quantities obtained by the stochastic theories to actual aquifers. The fulfillment of the ergodic hypothesis is assessed here by analyzing the diminishing of the variance of S-ij as the initial size of the plume V-0 grows, i.e. the tendency of S-ij toward its expected value (S-ij). It is shown that it is not always possible to assume ergodicity for solute plumes in heterogeneous aquifers. For the typical plume configurations encountered in applications, transverse and vertical spreading are the most problematic in this respect. In particular, satisfying the ergodic hypothesis depends largely on the initial plume configuration and size, on one hand, and the direction of the moment of interest, on the other. Numerical simulations based on the analytic element method elucidate the results. The relevance of the results is mostly felt for the inference of macrodispersive parameters, which are often derived through S-ij. The work indicates that S-ij may be a distorted and inadequate measure of the plume spread. This should serve as a warning against application of results based on ensemble averages to real-life plumes, particularly when estimating macrodispersion coefficient from field experiment.

AB Radar rainfall estimation for flash flood forecasting in small, urban catchments is examined through analyses of radar, rain gage and discharge observations from the 14.3 km(2) Dead Run drainage basin in Baltimore County, Maryland. The flash flood forecasting problem pushes the envelope of rainfall estimation to time and space scales that are commensurate with the scales at which the fundamental governing laws of land surface processes are derived. Analyses of radar rainfall estimates are based on volume scan WSR-88D reflectivity observations for 36 storms during the period 2003-2005. Gage-radar analyses show large spatial variability of storm total rainfall over the 14.3 km(2) basin for flash flood producing storms. The ability to capture the detailed spatial variation of rainfall for flash flood producing storms by WSR-88D rainfall estimates varies markedly from event to event. As spatial scale decreases from the 14.3 km 2 scale of the Dead Run watershed to I km 2 (and the characteristic time scale of flash flood producing rainfall decreases from I h to 15 min) the predictability of flash flood response from WSR-88D rainfall estimates decreases sharply. Storm to storm variability of multiplicative bias in storm total rainfall estimates is a dominant element of the error structure of radar rainfall estimates, and it varies systematically over the warm season and with flood magnitude. Analyses of the 7 July 2004 and 28 June 2005 storms illustrate microphysical and dynamical controls on radar estimation error for extreme flash flood producing storms.

AB Peat saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-sat, declines strongly with increasing degree of decomposition, providing a potentially important negative ecohydrological feedback that may buffer peatlands from climate-induced drying. However, the quantitative nature of this relationship is poorly understood. We measured downcore changes in K-sat and carbon-to-nitrogen concentration quotients (C/N) in 14 shallow (approximate to 0.5 m deep, 0.1 m diameter) peat cores from a Swedish raised bog. We used the C/N measurements to approximate the fraction of original peat mass remaining. A linear mixed effects (LME) model predicts log(10)(K-sat) from (i) our C/N-derived estimate of fractional remaining mass; (ii) depth; (iii) microhabitat (hummock, hollow); and (iv) location (treeless bog center, treed bog margin). The LME model indicated no significant random effects or interactions between predictors, so we derived a nonlinear multiple regression (NLMR) model to predict K-sat on its original scale. Both LME and NLMR models predict that K-sat decreases exponentially with depth and that K-sat is lower beneath hollows than beneath hummocks for equivalent depths below the surface. Fractional remaining mass was an important predictor in the LME model, but not in the NLMR model. The distinction between central and marginal areas of the bog was not an important predictor. We demonstrate for the first time that the relationship between fractional remaining mass and K-sat is log-linear, and suggest revisions that should be made to peatland development models. In particular, depthusually ignored in modeling studiesexerted a strong control over K-sat independently of decomposition and should be included explicitly in model algorithms.

AB The classic Kalman filter implementation uses the measurements up to the time of forecast to update the initial conditions of the numerical model, with the updating effect limited to a prediction horizon when the improved initial conditions are washed out. To further enhance the prediction capability, this study proposes a new hybrid data assimilation scheme, which adopts chaos theory to predict the measurements into the forecast phase, and then assimilates the predicted measurements into the numerical model using the ensemble Kalman filter.
   The hybrid data assimilation scheme is applied in a simulated real-time forecast of the Ciliwung river model. It is revealed that the hybrid scheme can further improve the modelling accuracy up to a prediction horizon of 4 days as compared to the update based solely on the ensemble Kalman filter.

   SEDIMENT; CHANNELS; GRAVEL
AB This study investigates numerically the characteristics of upscaling the Manning resistance coefficient (n(t)) for areas covered by partially submerged vegetation elements, such as shrub or tree stems. A number of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations were carried out corresponding to scenarios with different domain slopes (S), inflow rates (Q), bed roughness (n(b)), and vegetation cover fractions (V-f). Using simulations performed at fine space-time scales, two methods were developed for computing the upscaled Manning coefficient, termed "Equivalent Roughness Surface (ERS)" and "Equivalent Friction Slope (EFS)." Results obtained with these two methods indicate that both yield highly correlated estimates of n(t). The effects of four independent variables (Vf, S, Q, and n(b)) on n(t) were further investigated. First, as V-f increases, n(t) also grows. Second, two distinct modes of the relationship between S and n(t) for a fixed V-f and Q emerge: a positive dependence at low-flow rates and a negative dependence at high-flow rates. For a fixed V-f and S, two distinct modes of the relationship between Q and n(t) are also identified: a positive dependence at mild domain slopes and a negative dependence at steep slopes. A regression analysis shows that the two conflicting trends can occur depending on whether the variability of flow depth with respect to S (or Q) is greater than the ratio of h and S (or Q). Third, a rougher soil bed (i.e., larger values of n(b)) implies a higher resistance due to vegetation. Last, the study argues that n(t) increases as h increases and decreases as V increases. A generic regression relation that includes all four of the above variables and the difference n(t) - n(b) (i.e., the additional resistance due to partially submerged vegetation representing the sum of the form and wave resistances) was developed. The range of applicability of this relation is given by the following conditions: V-f <= 0.5, 0.1 <= S <= 1.1, and 0.0001 <= Q <= 0.01. The difference n(t) - n(b) computed from the developed regression relation was compared with estimates reported by five different studies. Furthermore, the simulated wave resistance coefficients were compared with those predicted from an equation in a previous study; the estimates were consistent in the range of experimental conditions for which the latter equation was developed. The relationship is sufficiently general and applicable to other flow conditions with partially submerged roughness elements.

ID FRACTAL FLOW PATTERNS; FIELD; MODEL
AB Experimental results indicate that the traditional form of Darcy's law is not adequate for describing water flow processes in clay media because the observed relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient can be highly non-linear. To capture this non-Darcian flow behavior, we propose a new relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient by generalizing the currently existing relationships. The new relationship is shown to be consistent with experimental observations for both saturated and unsaturated conditions. In this paper, we also develop an empirical relationship between permeability and threshold hydraulic gradient, an important measure of non-Darcian behavior. The latter relationship is practically useful because it can reduce the number of parameters whose values need to be determined from experiment data in order to model non-Darcian behavior. How to incorporate the impacts of temperature and electrolyte concentrations into the proposed relationships needs further research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geophysical length scales determined from complex conductivity (CC) measurements can be used to estimate permeability k when the electrical formation factor F is known. Two geophysical length scales have been proposed: (1) the specific polarizability c(p) normalized by the imaginary conductivity sigma" and (2) the time constant tau multiplied by a diffusion coefficient D+. The parameters c(p) and D+ account for the control of fluid chemistry and/or varying minerology on the geophysical length scale. We evaluated the predictive capability of two CC permeability models: (1) an empirical formulation based on sigma" or normalized chargeability m(n) and (2) a mechanistic formulation based on tau. The performance of the CC models was evaluated against measured k; and further compared against that of well-established k estimation equations that use geometric length scales. Both CC models predict permeability within one order of magnitude for a database of 58 sandstone samples, with the exception of samples characterized by high pore volume normalized surface area S-por. Variations in c(p) and D+ likely contribute to the poor model performance for the high S-por samples, which contain significant dolomite. Two observations favor the implementation of the sigma"-based model over the tau-based model for field-scale k estimation: (1) a limited range of variation in c(p) relative to D+ and (2) sigma" field measurements are less time consuming to acquire relative to s. The need for a reliable field-estimate of F limits application of either model, in particular the sigma" model due to a high power law exponent associated with F.

AB We study the impact of reactive flow on a complex carbonate rock whose pore space was resolved by X-ray mu-CT. A small core plug was imaged in the original and chemically altered states. The morphology of the resolved pore space was quantified using various approaches, such as sample-spanning cluster analysis, capillary drainage transform (CDT), and Minkowski functionals. In particular, we carefully evaluated the changes in macropore connectivity by calculating the fraction of percolated cluster, the Euler characteristic of macroporous phase, and the critical pore diameter in pre- and post-alteration states. We observed that the reactive flow mainly affected larger pores in the macropore region of the sample. More importantly, a huge increase in macropore connectivity, as indicated majorly by the CDT measurements and the Euler characteristic, was observed such that the poorly connected original macropore phase was converted to well-connected ones after the reactive flow. In addition, the increases in the macropore surface area and integral mean curvature indicated that the oomoldic and interooidal pores of the rock were dominantly enlarged by the reactive fluid. Based on direct numerical simulations on the main flow paths (i.e., the macro-connected pore phase), strong correlations were found between changes in transport properties and the evolution of connectivity and length scales of the macropore phase, such that simple power-law models could be used to predict with acceptable accuracy. This suggests that the evolution of transport properties of the rock was mainly controlled by the changes in the macro-connected porosity and the critical pore diameter.

AB To better estimate the radiation energy within and beneath the forest canopy for energy balance snowmelt models, a two stream radiation transfer model that explicitly accounts for canopy scattering, absorption and reflection was developed. Upward and downward radiation streams represented by two differential equations using a single path assumption were solved analytically to approximate the radiation transmitted through or reflected by the canopy with multiple scattering. This approximation results in an exponential decrease of radiation intensity with canopy depth, similar to Beer's law for a deep canopy. The solution for a finite canopy is obtained by applying recursive superposition of this two stream single path deep canopy solution. This solution enhances capability for modeling energy balance processes of the snowpack in forested environments, which is important when quantifying the sensitivity of hydrologic response to input changes using physically based modeling. The radiation model was included in a distributed energy balance snowmelt model and results compared with observations made in three different vegetation classes (open, coniferous forest, deciduous forest) at a forest study area in the Rocky Mountains in Utah, USA. The model was able to capture the sensitivity of beneath canopy net radiation and snowmelt to vegetation class consistent with observations and achieve satisfactory predictions of snowmelt from forested areas from parsimonious practically available information. The model is simple enough to be applied in a spatially distributed way, but still relatively rigorously and explicitly represent variability in canopy properties in the simulation of snowmelt over a watershed.

AB Mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions can significantly alter the porosity and permeability of porous media. While porosity generally increases with dissolution and decreases with precipitation, permeability is controlled by the spatial locations of reactions in discrete pores and pore throats and in the greater pore network. Geochemical reactions have been observed to occur both uniformly and nonuniformly in porous media, driven by parameters such as mineral distribution, grain size, and Peclet and Damkohler numbers. Pore network modeling can be used to simulate the impact of pore-scale alterations on permeability, requiring only pore and pore-throat size distributions and pore connectivity. Here, the impact of variations in pore and pore-throat size distributions on reactive permeability for uniform and nonuniform spatial distributions of reactions is evaluated. A series of pore network models are created and populated with pore and pore-throat size distributions of varying types (skewed, normal, and uniform) to represent differences in network topology and characterization methods. The impacts of these distributions on reactive permeability are then simulated for uniform and nonuniform reaction conditions by increasing or decreasing pore and pore-throat sizes in a prescribed manner to reflect dissolution and precipitation, respectively. Overall, simulations reveal that porosity-permeability evolution varies with reaction scenario and is qualitatively consistent for the different pore and pore-throat size distributions. Common macroscopic porosity-permeability relationships work well for some reaction scenarios but are unable to reflect size-dependent reactions. A new modified version of the Verma-Pruess relationship is created and able to successfully reflect the porosity-permeability evolution for size-dependent reactions.

AB [1] The strange attractor formalism has been used to check whether the flow velocity in idealized three-dimensional porous media could be described by the multifractal approach. The flow velocity magnitude was simulated with a lattice model in six media with different porosities. The results obtained from the analysis of the mass exponent functions and the multifractal and generalized dimensions spectra show that the velocity of the simulated flows has a multifractal type of scaling that becomes stronger as the porosity decreases. A correlation analysis has been performed showing the relationships between the statistical properties and the multifractal parameters of the velocity magnitude distribution.

TI A Diagnostic Framework for Understanding Climatology of Tails of Hourly
   Precipitation Extremes in the United States

   heavy tails; predictive uncertainty; climatology of tails
ID CIRCULATION MODEL OUTPUT; DISTRIBUTIONS; DESIGN; TRENDS
AB Hourly precipitation extremes are crucial in hydrological design. Their frequency and magnitude is encapsulated in the probability distribution tail. Traditional extreme-analysis methods rely on theorems, like the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan, indicating specific type of tails assuming asymptotic convergencea questionable assumption for real-world samples. Moreover, popular stochastic models for hourly precipitation presume light-tailed distributions to facilitate their mathematical formulation. In practice, limited information on hourly precipitation extremes makes identifying and quantifying their tail highly uncertain, especially on a station-by-station basis. Yet no comprehensive regional analysis of tails has been undertaken to quantify a climatology of tails for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Here we undertake such an analysis for the conterminous United States. We introduce a novel Bayesian-adjustment approach to assess the best model between power-type and stretched-exponential tails showing that the latter performs better. We present climatology of the tail and quantify its heaviness in over 4,000 hourly precipitation records across the United States and present three main conclusions. First, we show that hourly precipitation tails are heavier than those commonly used with important implications including underestimation of extremes. Second, we provide spatial maps of the tail behavior which reveal some strikingly coherent spatial patterns that can be used for inference in the absence of local observations. Third, we find a nonlinear increase in the tail heaviness with elevation and we formulate parametric functions to describe this law. These results can improve the accuracy of frequency analysis, probabilistic prediction, rainfall-runoff modeling, and downscaling of historical observations and climate model projections.

AB Current methods to estimate snow accumulation and ablation at the plot and watershed levels can be improved as new technologies offer alternative approaches to more accurately monitor snow dynamics and their drivers. Here we conduct a meta-analysis of snow and vegetation data collected in British Columbia to explore the relationships between a wide range of forest structure variables - obtained from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), hemispherical photography (HP) and Landsat Thematic Mapper - and several indicators of snow accumulation and ablation estimated from manual snow surveys and ultrasonic range sensors. By merging and standardizing all the ground plot information available in the study area, we demonstrate how LiDAR-derived forest cover above 0.5 m was the variable explaining the highest percentage of absolute peak snow water equivalent (SWE) (33%), while HP-derived leaf area index and gap fraction (45 angle of view) were the best potential predictors of snow ablation rate (explaining 57% of variance). This study reveals how continuous SWE data from ultrasonic sensors are fundamental to obtain statistically significant relationships between snow indicators and structural metrics by increasing mean r(2) by 20% when compared to manual surveys. The relationships between vegetation and spectral indices from Landsat and snow indicators, not explored before, were almost as high as those shown by LiDAR or HP and thus point towards a new line of research with important practical implications. While the use of different data sources from two snow seasons prevented us from developing models with predictive capacity, a large sample size helped to identify outliers that weakened the relationships and suggest improvements for future research. A concise overview of the limitations of this and previous studies is provided along with propositions to consistently improve experimental designs to take advantage of remote sensing technologies, and better represent spatial and temporal variations of snow.

AB Suspended sediment yields (SSY) respond strongly to ecological restoration (ER) efforts, and significant improvements in SSY control have been achieved in the Loess Plateau of China. However, it remains challenging to quantify the net impacts of ER on SSY. Here, we formulate the notion of elasticity of sediment discharge, by associating SSY change to climate variability and ER over the period 1950s to 2014. All ten of the subcatchments studied experienced significant decreases in annual SSY, streamflow, and suspended sediment concentration. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that changes to both streamflow volumes and to the suspended sediment concentration versus water discharge (C-Q) relationships result in reduced SSY, so that streamflow is reduced but runs clearer. We find that two of the ER strategies resulted in weaker relative impacts of climate variability, largely by reducing streamflow (by 55% to 75%). Meanwhile, ER predominantly decreased SSY (by 63% to 81%). Regarding ER practices, (i) the predominant measure acting to reduce SSY changed, over time, from engineering to reforestation; (ii) check dams preferentially act to regulate the C-Q relationships, whereas reforestation preferentially acts to moderate streamflow. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of engineering and vegetation measures is critical to achieving high-efficiency ER. While change to the ER strategy increased the efficiency of streamflow for SSY control, the lost water discharge per unit SSY reduction increased from 5.2 to 6.4 m(3)t(-1). Conflicting demands for water necessitate that further ER should target precision management by revegetation of targeted areas in the Loess Plateau.

AB The upscaling of dispersivity in solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers is addressed with a numerical stochastic formulation. This work represents progress toward converting theory into scalable numerical models that can be compared to laboratory experiments. Traditional global assumptions of low variance, ergodicity, single correlation scale, stationarity, and the like are avoided through the use of a flexible Lagrangian numerical, not analytical, framework, which allows assumptions to be local. A method of calculating grid-block upscaled dispersivities is presented. Computational results are obtained for a heterogeneous tank experiment, with reasonable behaviour. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Measurement of the connectivity of runoff source areas as determined by

AB The connectivity of runoff sources is considered one of the main factors controlling the hydrology of sparsely vegetated landscapes. However, the empirical demonstration of this role is very limited, partly because of the scarcity of suitable connectivity metrics. In this work, we derived and tested a spatial metric, Flowlength, for quantifying the connectivity of runoff source areas considering both vegetation pattern and topography. Flowlength is calculated as the average of the runoff pathway lengths from all the cells in a raster-based map of the target site. We evaluated the relationships between the connectivity of runoff sources, measured with Flowlength, and the runoff and sediment yields from six plots and three catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. Flowlength distinguished varying degrees of connectivity between differing vegetation patterns with similar vegetation cover. The connectivity increased with the grain size of the bare areas and was positively related to plot runoff and sediment yields. Flowlength also correctly ranked the three catchments according to total runoff yielded during the study period. The inclusion of microtopographic information in the quantification of Flowlength improved the relationships between the pattern of runoff sources and the measured fluxes, highlighting the importance of topographic features in the connectivity of surface flows. In general, the microtopography had a net decreasing effect on the connectivity, which was mainly attributed to an increase in the amount of runoff sink areas caused by the sediment terracettes developed upslope of plants. Our results confirm that the connectivity of runoff sources is a key factor controlling runoff and erosion in semiarid lands and support the potential of Flowlength as a surrogate for the hydrological functioning of ecosystems with patchy vegetation.

AB The quality of the forecasts, that is, the accuracy in predicting the observed streamflow, affects the decisions that can be taken thus determining the success or failure of hydropower operations, that is, the so-called forecast value. Although preprocessing techniques can be employed to improve forecast quality, the corresponding improvement in forecast value to hydropower is not straightforward to anticipate because of the complex relationship between quality and value, which depends on the hydrometeorological regime and water system features. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the value to hydropower reservoir operations of preprocessed (i.e., bias corrected and downscaled) subseasonal forecasts and to compare the forecast quality and value across and within seasons. We use the forecast ensembles provided by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We assess forecast quality in terms of bias, Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), and forecast value in terms of mean revenue and avoided unproductive spill. We consider daily subseasonal hydrometeorological forecasts covering lead times up to 1 month and a quantile mapping technique to preprocess the hydrometeorological forecasts. Forecasts are then used in a rolling horizon set up to optimize hydropower operations of the Verzasca hydropower system in the Alps (CH). Results show that preprocessing is essential to improve both forecast quality and value. Although hydropower reservoir operations benefit from considering forecasts all the yearlong, the relationship between forecast quality and value is complex and strongly depends on the metrics used to assess forecast quality and value and on the season.

AB This paper reports an experimental investigation of open channel turbulent flow between two inline surface mounted hemispherical obstacles in tandem arrangement. A series of experiments are performed under combined wave-current interaction with seven relative spacing L/h, where L is center to center spacing distance and h is the obstacle height for Reynolds number R-e = 5.38 x 10(4). The observations are particularly focused on the changes induced in the mean velocity components, turbulence intensities and Reynolds shear stress due to superposition of surface waves on the ambient flow, and are compared to that of flat-surface and a single hemisphere. The paper also investigates the dominant turbulent bursting events that contribute to the Reynolds shear stress for different relative depth influenced by hemispheres. It is observed that the contributions to the total shear stress due to ejection and sweep are dominant at the wake region for single and double hemisphere near the bed, while towards the surface outward and inward interactions show significant effect for wave-current interactions which is largely different from that over the flat-surface case. Spectral analysis of the observed velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regime near the bed. At high frequency, an inertial sub-range of turbulence with -5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed for the flat-surface. The spectral slope is calculated to show the shifting of standard Kolmogorov scale for both only current and wave-induced tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study modeling of two-phase flow in highly heterogeneous fractured and porous media. The flow behaviour is strongly influenced by mass transfer between a highly permeable (mobile) fracture domain and less permeable (immobile) matrix blocks. We quantify the effective two-phase flow behavior using a multirate rate mass transfer (MRMT) approach. We discuss the range of applicability of the MRMT approach in terms of the pertinent viscous and capillary diffusion time scales. We scrutinize the linearization of capillary diffusion in the immobile regions, which allows for the formulation of MRMT in the form of a non-local single equation model. The global memory function, which encodes mass transfer between the mobile and the immobile regions, is at the center of this method. We propose two methods to estimate the global memory function for a fracture network with given fracture and matrix geometry. Both employ a scaling approach based on the known local memory function for a given immobile region. With the first method, the local memory function is calculated numerically, while the second one employs a parametric memory function in form of truncated power-law. The developed concepts are applied and tested for fracture networks of different complexity. We find that both physically based parameter estimation methods for the global memory function provide predictive MRMT approaches for the description of multiphase flow in highly heterogeneous porous media.

AB Understanding gas transport in porous media and its mechanism has broad applications in various research areas, such as carbon sequestration in deep saline aquifers and gas explorations in reservoir rocks. Gas transport is mainly controlled by pore space geometrical and morphological characteristics. In this study, we apply a physically-based model developed using concepts from percolation theory (PT) and the effective-medium approximation (EMA) to better understand diffusion and permeability of gas in packings of angular and rounded sand grains as well as glass beads. Two average sizes of grain i.e., 0.3 and 0.5 mm were used to pack sands in a column of 6 cm height and 4.9 cm diameter so that the total porosity of all packs was near 0.4. Water content, gas-filled porosity (also known as gas content), gas diffusion, and gas permeability were measured at different capillary pressures. The X-ray computed tomography method and the 3DMA-Rock software package were applied to determine the average pore coordination number z. Results showed that both saturation-dependent diffusion and permeability of gas showed almost linear behavior at higher gas-filled porosities, while deviated substantially from linear scaling at lower gas saturations. Comparing the theory with the diffusion and permeability experiments showed that the determined value of z ranged between 2.8 and 5.3, not greatly different from X-ray computed tomography results. The obtained results clearly indicate that the effect of the pore-throat size distribution on gas diffusion and permeability was minimal in these sand and glass bead packs.

AB Ecohydrological processes occurring at or near the Earth's surface are strongly influenced by Eastern hemlock [EH; Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere], a foundation tree species of eastern North American forests. EH populations are currently threatened by the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae Annand). HWA HWA populations have been expanding rapidly throughout the EH's range. Catchment-scale research examining the hydrological consequences of HWA infestation is lacking, and plot-scale studies remain conflicted in their findings. Given the complex relationships between canopy interception, unsaturated and saturated groundwater storage, and root water uptake, it is not immediately clear how EH loss will affect the hydrologic cycle. We investigated the impact of EH mortality on stream discharge characteristics across a regional sample of catchments utilizing both simulation and statistical modelling approaches. We first examined the relationship between various catchment characteristics, including EH health, and three hydrological variables through regression analysis. We then employed a non-parametric statistical test to evaluate differences in hydrologic regime trends between non-infested and infested catchments. Finally, we calibrated a physically based hydrologic model and considered differences in optimal model parameter values and simulated overland runoff between non-infested and infested catchments. HWA presence modified several ecohydrological characteristics and precipitation partitioning between groundwater flows and surface runoff, potentially driving higher stream flashiness and overland flow, lower baseflow contributions and catchment storage, shorter flow-path lengths, and variable source area dilation at infested sites. Our results suggest that EH decline will augment flooding potential associated with the increasing frequency and intensity of Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone events. Further, our physically based simulation provides more determinate results than regression analysis, indicating that a purely statistical methodology, commonly utilized in studying the relationship between landcover characteristics and hydrologic regime, neglects dynamic physical ecohydrologic relationships.

AB Globally, drainage from sulfide-bearing waste-rock piles, containing high concentrations of toxic metal(loid)s, can severely degrade surrounding ecosystems. Waste-rock piles are typically deposited as unsaturated porous media. The complex physical and chemical heterogeneity of waste rock poses significant challenges to the evaluation of internal hydrological, (bio)geochemical, and mineralogical controls on the magnitude and duration of environmental impacts. An operational-scale waste-rock pile located in the discontinuous permafrost region of Northern Canada was well-instrumented and monitored to examine hydrological processes (including precipitation, evaporation, and infiltration), hydrological and thermal responses to freeze-thaw and dry-wet cycles, and concentration-discharge (cQ) relationships in drainage-water quantity and quality. The net infiltration (subtraction of evaporation from precipitation) into the waste-rock pile occurred from May to November, resulting in rainfall-dominated recharge to pore water, surface seepage, and groundwater. Pronounced variations in water content and temperature in response to freeze-thaw and dry-wet cycles and variations in surface topography were observed in regions of the waste-rock pile impacted by preferential flow pathways. In contrast, distinct variations in water content and temperature were not observed in regions of matrix-dominated flow pathways. The cQ relationships show chemodynamically controlled dilution behavior for most dissolved constituents (e.g., SO4, Fe, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ca, Mn) in the drainage. Therefore, hydrological processes and (bio)geochemical and mineralogical reactions both play prominent roles in determining drainage-water chemistry. This work presents an integrated approach to site-specific monitoring and characterization to evaluate remediation and reclamation options for operational-scale waste-rock piles for long-term ecosystem preservation.

   DYNAMICS; PAYMENTS; SERVICES; TESTS; SIZE
AB We present a framework to compare water treatment costs to source water protection costs, an important knowledge gap for drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). This trade-off helps to determine what incentives a DWTP has to invest in natural infrastructure or pollution reduction in the watershed rather than pay for treatment on site. To illustrate, we use daily observations from 2007 to 2011 for the Bob McEwen Water Treatment Plant, Clermont County, Ohio, to understand the relationship between treatment costs and water quality and operational variables (e.g., turbidity, total organic carbon [TOC], pool elevation, and production volume). Part of our contribution to understanding drinking water treatment costs is examining both long-run and short-run relationships using error correction models (ECMs). Treatment costs per 1000 gallons (per 3.79 m(3)) were based on chemical, pumping, and granular activated carbon costs. Results from the ECM suggest that a 1% decrease in turbidity decreases treatment costs by 0.02% immediately and an additional 0.1% over future days. Using mean values for the plant, a 1% decrease in turbidity leads to $1123/year decrease in treatment costs. To compare these costs with source water protection costs, we use a polynomial distributed lag model to link total phosphorus loads, a source water quality parameter affected by land use changes, to turbidity at the plant. We find the costs for source water protection to reduce loads much greater than the reduction in treatment costs during these years. Although we find no incentive to protect source water in our case study, this framework can help DWTPs quantify the trade-offs.

AB Available data from a recent study of entrapped tetrachloroethylene (PCE) dissolution [Bradford et al., 1999] reveal that soil wettability and grain size distribution characteristics can dramatically influence dissolution behavior. This paper explores the modeling of the long-term dissolution of residual nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) entrapped in fractional wettability porous media. Here dissolution is modeled with a linear driving force expression, and the lumped mass transfer coefficient is represented using independent estimates of the film mass transfer coefficient and the NAPL-water interfacial area. In fractional wettability porous media the NAPL saturation is assumed to occur as both NAPL films and ganglia, and NAPL-water interfacial area is thus modeled as the sum of contributions from films and ganglia. The interfacial area model is calibrated by fitting several parameters to the available experimental data. Trends in fitted parameters suggest that (1) residual NAPL ganglia are less accessible to a flowing aqueous phase in finer textured soils; (2) the dissolution rate depends on the interfacial area in a nonlinear manner; and (3) NAPL ganglia entrapment depends on system wettability and grain size distribution. Mass transfer coefficient correlations are established from these fitted parameters. The calibrated model predicts that for a given NAPL saturation, an increasing PCE-wet sand fraction results in longer periods of high effluent concentrations, followed by increased rates of concentration reduction and more persistent subsequent low-concentration tailing. The dependence of dissolution behavior on mean grain size is also captured by this model. Simulations demonstrate a significant improvement in dissolution predictions using the proposed model in comparison with those obtained using a previously developed mass transfer correlation based upon a power law function of saturation.

TI Extended power-law scaling of air permeabilities measured on a block of
   tuff
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

DT Article
ID SELF-SIMILARITY; BEHAVIOR; RAIN
AB We use three methods to identify power-law scaling of multi-scale log air permeability data collected by Tidwell and Wilson on the faces of a laboratory-scale block of Topopah Spring tuff: method of moments (M), Extended Self-Similarity (ESS) and a generalized version thereof (GESS). All three methods focus on q-th-order sample structure functions of absolute increments. Most such functions exhibit power-law scaling at best over a limited midrange of experimental separation scales, or lags, which are sometimes difficult to identify unambiguously by means of M. ESS and G-ESS extend this range in a way that renders power-law scaling easier to characterize. Our analysis confirms the superiority of ESS and G-ESS over M in identifying the scaling exponents, xi(q), of corresponding structure functions of orders q, suggesting further that ESS is more reliable than G-ESS. The exponents vary in a nonlinear fashion with q as is typical of real or apparent multifractals. Our estimates of the Hurst scaling coefficient increase with support scale, implying a reduction in roughness (anti-persistence) of the log permeability field with measurement volume. The finding by Tidwell and Wilson that log permeabilities associated with all tip sizes can be characterized by stationary variogram models, coupled with our findings that log permeability increments associated with the smallest tip size are approximately Gaussian and those associated with all tip sizes scale show nonlinear variations in xi(q) with q, are consistent with a view of these data as a sample from a truncated version (tfBm) of self-affine fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Since in theory the scaling exponents, xi(q), of tfBm vary linearly with q we conclude that nonlinear scaling in our case is not an indication of multifractality but an artifact of sampling from tfBm. This allows us to explain theoretically how power-law scaling of our data, as well as of non-Gaussian heavy-tailed signals subordinated to tfBm, are extended by ESS. It further allows us to identify the functional form and estimate all parameters of the corresponding tfBm based on sample structure functions of first and second orders.

AB Quantifying dynamic hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) within river corridors that experience high-frequency flow variations caused by dam regulations is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes at the river water and groundwater interfaces. Heat has been widely used as a tracer to infer steady-state flow velocities through analytical solutions of heat transport defined by the diurnal temperature signals. Under sub-daily dynamic flow conditions, however, such analytical solutions are not applicable due to the violation of their fundamental assumptions. In this study, we developed a data assimilation-based approach to estimate the sub-daily flux under highly dynamic flow conditions using multi-depth temperature observations at a 5-min resolution. If the hydraulic gradient is measured, Darcy's law was used to calculate the flux with permeability estimated from temperature responses below the riverbed. Otherwise, flux was estimated directly by assimilating multi-depth temperature data at 1- or 2-hr time intervals assuming one-dimensional flow and heat transport governing equation. By comparing estimated fluxes with model-generated synthetic truth, we demonstrated that both schemes have robust performance in estimating fluxes under highly dynamic flow conditions. This data assimilation-based flux estimation method was able to capture the vertical sub-daily fluxes using multi-depth high-resolution temperature data alone, even in the presence of multi-dimensional flow. This approach has been successfully applied to real field temperature data collected at the Hanford site, which experiences highly dynamic HEFs. Our study shows the promise of adopting distributed 1-D temperature monitoring to capture spatial and temporal exchange dynamics in river corridors at a watershed scale or beyond.

ID MODEL; INFERENCE
AB In this paper, we describe a new multiple change point detection technique based on segmenting the time series under study into subsequences. These segments correspond to the episodes that are likely to contain a unique jump. They are found by applying Bayesian decision theory through the minimization of simple cost functions. All calculations can be performed explicitly, without falling back on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and resulting in particularly light implementation. Through prior distributions derived from a stochastic renewal process description of jump occurrences, expert knowledge of jump amplitude and return period is also introduced in our decision process. Comparison to several multiple change point methods on simulated series lead to similar or better performance, achieved at lower computational cost.

AB Accurately quantifying large-scale terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) remains hampered by poor parameterization of the physical processes that relate to ET. Previous studies suggested that the calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) method that requires only routine meteorological data performed better than main-stream atmospheric reanalyses, land surface or remote sensing models in estimating large-scale ET. Here we simultaneously evaluate the latest machine learning-based upscaling of eddy-covariance measurements (FLUXCOM) and the CR estimates against the water-balance derived ET rates of 18 large Hydrologic Unit Code-2 (HUC2) and 327 medium HUC6 basins across the conterminous United States. Overall, CR and FLUXCOM perform comparably in representing the multiyear mean and temporal variations in annual ET at both, HUC2 and HUC6, scales for the 1979-2013 period. Such equally good skills also hold true for the 2003-2015 period, during which FLUXCOM was driven solely by remote sensing data. However, the CR generally captures the longterm linear tendencies in annual ET rates somewhat better than FLUXCOM. Because of its minimal data requirement, the calibration-free version of the CR may continue to serve as a benchmarking tool for large-scale ET simulations.

AB Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) has recently become a powerful geophysical technique to characterize soil moisture at the field scale. We developed a data assimilation scheme to simultaneously estimate the vertical soil moisture profile and hydraulic parameters from time-lapse GPR measurements. The assimilation scheme includes a soil hydrodynamic model to simulate the soil moisture dynamics, a full-wave electromagnetic wave propagation model, and petrophysical relationship to link the state variable with the GPR data and a maximum likelihood ensemble assimilation algorithm. The hydraulic parameters are estimated jointly with the soil moisture using a state augmentation technique. The approach allows for the direct assimilation of GPR data, thus maximizing the use of the information. The proposed approach was validated by numerical experiments assuming wrong initial conditions and hydraulic parameters. The synthetic soil moisture profiles were generated by the Hydrus-1D model, which then were used by the electromagnetic model and petrophysical relationship to create observed GPR data. The results show that the data assimilation significantly improves the accuracy of the hydrodynamic model prediction. Compared with the surface soil moisture assimilation, the GPR data assimilation better estimates the soil moisture profile and hydraulic parameters. The results also show that the estimated soil moisture profile in the loamy sand and silt soils converge to the true state more rapidly than in the clay one. Of the three unknown parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten model, the estimation of n is more accurate than that of and K-s. The approach shows a great promise to use GPR measurements for the soil moisture profile and hydraulic parameter estimation at the field scale.

AB An accurate numerical calculation is presented for the onset of thermal convection in a two layer system which is comprised of a layer of porous material described by Darcy's law, over which lies a layer of water. The porous layer is also saturated with water. The two layer system is maintained with the lower (porous) surface at 0degreesC and the upper (fluid) surface is stress free with the temperature being above 0degreesC. This physical picture is capable of encompassing water at the density maximum of 4degreesC in the layer and is thus capable of describing a model for patterned ground formation under water. To account for the fact that the density may have a maximum in the layer we adopt an equation of state which expresses the density in the buoyancy force as a quadratic function of temperature. The onset of convection may have a bi-modal nature in which convection may be dominated by the porous medium or by the fluid depending on parameters which appear in the problem. Here, the important parameters are the ratio of fluid to porous medium depth, the upper surface temperature, and the Darcy number delta = rootK/d(m), a parameter representing non-dimensional permeability of the porous matrix. The coefficient K is the permeability and d(m) is the depth of the porous layer. A surprising array of streamline patterns is found at the onset of convection as one varies the appropriate parameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming has led to increase in climate extremes, which altered both hydrological cycles and soil erosion processes. However, the responses of river sediment load to climate change, especially climate extremes have not been well understood due to a lack of comprehensive assessment. This study investigated the temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations during the period of 1956-2019 in ten major river basins in China. Both the partial linear square regression model and the double mass curve method were used to quantify the contribution of key climatic indices and anthropogenic driving forces. Overall, the annual total sediment load exhibited a significant negative trend (P < 0.01), decreasing from 1842.18 Mt/yr in 1960 s to 322.72 Mt/yr in 2010 s (82.48 %). The significant decline of sediment load was particularly obvious in the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin. The abrupt changes of sediment load mostly occurred in 1985-2000. Human activities were primarily response for sediment load changes in most basins. The sediment load in mainstream was mainly regulated by reservoirs, while the tributaries were largely affected by soil and water conservation measures. Intensive human activities have led to substantial changes in land surface and resulted in weakened correlation between sediment load and climate extremes. Generally, precipitation, erosive rainfall and precipitation amount in flood period were closely related to sediment load. In the Southwest River basin and Northwest River basin, the sediment load had a relatively good relationship with extreme temperature, which was related to alpine snowmelt and permafrost degradation due to climate warming. This study provides good insights for a better understanding of the interaction between river sediment load and climate extremes variables, which will be valuable for decision-making in river basin management.

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB The network connectivity structure of water distribution systems (WDSs) represents the domain where hydraulic processes occur, driving the emerging behavior of such systems, for example with respect to robustness and vulnerability. In complex network theory (CNT), a common way of classifying the network structure and connectivity is the association of the nodal degree distribution to specific probability distribution models, and during the last decades, researchers classified many real networks using the Poisson or Pareto distributions. In spite of the fact that degree-based network classification could play a crucial role to assess WDS vulnerability, this task is not easy because the network structure of WDSs is strongly constrained by spatial characteristics of the environment where they are constructed. The consequence of these spatial constraints is that the nodal degree spans very small ranges in WDSs hindering a reliable classification by the standard approach based on the nodal degree distribution. This work investigates the classification of the network structure of 22 real WDSs, built in different environments, demonstrating that the Poisson distribution generally models the degree distributions very well. In order to overcome the problem of the reliable classification based on the standard nodal degree, we define the "neighborhood'' degree, equal to the sum of the nodal degrees of the nearest topological neighbors (i.e., the adjacent nodes). This definition of "neighborhood'' degree is consistent with the fact that the degree of a single node is not significant for analysis of WDSs.
   Plain Language Summary Water distribution systems are networked infrastructure, which can be studied using the complex network theory. A classic study is the network classification allowing to characterize the real system feature with respect e.g. to vulnerability. The work classifies a relevant number of water distribution networks concluding that they are random-like.

AB This study investigates reference evapotranspiration (ET0) trends in China from 1960 to 2012 based on the Penman-Monteith equation and gridded meteorological measurements. Under the combined impacts of factors influencing ET0(i.e., net radiation [RN], mean temperature [TAVE], vapour pressure deficit [VPD], and wind speed [WND]), both seasonal and annual ET0 for the whole China and more than half of the grids decreased over the past 53 years. The attribution analyses suggest that for the whole China, the WND is responsible for annual and seasonal ET0 decreases (excluding summer, where RN is responsible). Across China, the annual cause of WND with the largest spatial extent (43.1% of grids) mainly derives from north of the Changjiang River Basin (CJRB), whereas VPD (RN) as a cause is dispersedly distributed (within and to the south of the CJRB). In summer, RN is dominant in more than half of the grids, but the dominance of VPD and WND accounts for approximately 90% of grids during the remaining seasons. Finally, the correlation coefficients between ET0 and the Atlantic Oscillation (AO), North AO, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices with different lead times are calculated. For the whole China, annual and seasonal ET0 always significantly correlate with these indices (excluding the IOD) but with varied lead times. Additionally, near half of the grids show significant and maximum (i.e., the largest one between ET0 and a certain index with a lead time of 0-3 seasons) correlation coefficients of ET0 with PDO in spring and summer, ENSO in autumn, and AO in winter. This study is not only significant for understanding ET0 changes, but it also provides preliminary and fundamental reference information for ET0 prediction.

AB Top-down control of algal blooms was investigated in the Swan-Canning Estuary, to determine whether the resident zooplankton community was able to substantially reduce phytoplankton biomass through grazing, or whether high phytoplankton biomass effectively inhibited grazing. In situ grazing by zooplankton at two depths in the water column was measured over a diel period on six occasions and examined in relation to the biotic and abiotic habitat conditions.
   Measured weight-specific ingestion rates varied with phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition, but were significantly greater at the surface than at 5 m, close to the bottom (ranges of 1.59 to 252.41 and 0.51 to 2899 mug phytoplankton C mug zooplankton C-1 day(-1), respectively). There was no evidence of significant diel changes in ingestion rates of zooplankton. Phytoplankton biomass removed by in situ community grazing ranged between 0.9 and 45.0% of standing stock per hour. The maximum loss occurred when phytoplankton biomass ranged from 249.0 to 320.8 mug phytoplankton C 1(-1). Zooplankton grazing impact was negatively associated with high phytoplankton and low dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. The implications of, and mechanisms associated with, top-down control of algal biomass in this estuary are discussed in relation to plankton succession and the physical environment.

AB To investigate the prevalence and cause of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for carbon, nutrients, major ions, and particulates, we analyzed 40 years of water quality data from 293 monitoring stations in France. Catchments drained diverse landscapes and ranged from 50 to 110,000 km2, together covering nearly half of France. To test for differences during low and high flows, we calculated independent C-Q slopes above and below the median discharge. We found that 84% of all catchment-element combinations were chemodynamic for at least half of the hydrograph and 60% of combinations showed nonlinear C-Q curves. Only two or three of the nine possible C-Q modalities were manifest for each parameter, and these modalities were stable through time, suggesting that intrinsic and extrinsic elemental properties (e. g., solubility, reactivity, and source dynamics) set basic C-Q templates for each parameter, which are secondarily influenced by biological activity during low flows, and the interaction between hydrology and catchment characteristics at high flows. Several patterns challenged current C-Q views, including low-flow chemostasis for TSS in 66% of catchments, low-flow biological mediation of NO23 in 71% of catchments, and positive C-Q for dissolved organic carbon independent of catchment size in 80% of catchments. Efforts to reduce nutrient loading decreased phosphorus concentration and altered C-Q curves, but NO23 continued to increase. While C-Q segmentation requires more data than a single analysis, the prevalence of nonlinear C-Q slopes demonstrates the potential information loss associated with linear or monotonic analysis of C-Q relationships, and conversely, the value of long-term monitoring.

AB In a low permeability formation, connectivity of natural and induced fractures determines overall hydraulic diffusivity in fluid flow through this formation and defines effective rock permeability. Efficient evaluation of fracture connectivity is a nontrivial task. Here, we utilize a topological concept of global efficiency to evaluate this connectivity. We address the impact of key geometrical properties of stochastic fracture networks (fracture lengths, orientations, apertures, and positions of fracture centers) on the macro-scale flow properties of a shale-like formation. Six thousand different realizations have been generated to characterize these properties for each fracture network. We find that a reduced graph of a fracture network, which consists of the shortest paths from the inlet nodes (fractures) to all outlet nodes, contributes most to fluid flow. Three-dimensional (3D) fracture networks usually have higher global efficiency than two-dimensional (2D) ones, because they have better connectivity. All geometrical properties of fractures influence quality of their connectivity. Aperture distribution impacts strongly global efficiency of a fracture network and its influence is more significant when the system is dominated by large fractures. Fracture clustering lowers global efficiency in both 2D and 3D fracture networks. Global efficiency of 2D and 3D fracture networks also decreases with the increasing exponent of the power-law distribution of fracture lengths, which means that the connectivity of the system decreases with an increasing number of small fractures. Realistic fracture networks, composed of several sets of fractures with constrained preferred orientations, share all the characteristics of the stochastic fracture networks we have investigated.

AB This paper investigates whether particle ensembles in a fractured rock domain may be adequately modeled as an operator-stable plume. If this statistical model applies to transport in fractured media, then an ensemble plume in a fractured rock domain may be modeled using the novel Fokker-Planck evolution equation of the operator-stable plume. These plumes (which include the classical multi-Gaussian as a subset) are typically characterized by power law leading-edge concentration profiles and super-Fickian growth rates. To investigate the possible correspondence of ensemble plumes to operator-stable densities, we use numerical simulations of fluid flow and solute transport through large-scale (2.5 km by 2.5 km), randomly generated fracture networks. These two-dimensional networks are generated according to fracture statistics obtained from field studies that describe fracture length, transmissivity, density, and orientation. A fracture continuum approach using MODFLOW is developed for the solution of fluid flow within the fracture network and low-permeability rock matrix, while a particle-tracking code, random walk particle method for simulating transport in heterogeneous permeable media (RWHet), is used to simulate the advective motion of conservative solutes through the model domain. By deterministically mapping individual fractures onto a highly discretized finite difference grid (1 m x 1 m x 1 m here), the MODFLOW "continuum'' simulations can faithfully preserve details of the generated network and can approximate fluid flow in a discrete fracture network model. An advantage of the MODFLOW approach is that matrix permeability can be made nonzero to account for any degree of matrix flow and/or transport.

AB Estimation of the infiltration/natural recharge to groundwater from rainfall is an important issue in hydrology, particularly in arid regions. This paper proposes the application of The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) mass balance model to develop infiltration (F)-rainfall (P) relationship from flash flood events. Moreover, the NRCS method is compared with the rational and the CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF-index methods to investigate the discrepancies between these methods. The methods have been applied to five gauged basins and their 19 sub-basins (representative basins with detailed measurements) in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia with 161 storms recorded in 4 years. The F-P relationships developed in this study based on NRCS method are: F = 39% P with R-2 = 0.932 for the initial abstraction factor, lambda = 0.2. However, F = 77% P with R-2 = 0.986 for lambda = 0.01. The model at lambda = 0.01 is the best to fit the data, therefore, it is recommended to use the formula at lambda = 0.01. The results show that the NRCS model is appropriate for the estimation of the F-P relationships in arid regions when compared with the rational and the CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF index methods. The latter overestimates the infiltration because they do not take lambda into account. There is no significant difference between F-P relationships at different time scales. This helps the prediction of infiltration rates for aquifer recharge at ungauged basins from monthly and annual rainfall data with a single formula.

TI Improved water allocation utilizing probabilistic climate forecasts:

AB Probabilistic, seasonal to interannual streamflow forecasts are becoming increasingly available as the ability to model climate teleconnections is improving. However, water managers and practitioners have been slow to adopt such products, citing concerns with forecast skill. Essentially, a management risk is perceived in "gambling" with operations using a probabilistic forecast, while a system failure upon following existing operating policies is "protected" by the official rules or guidebook. In the presence of a prescribed system of prior allocation of releases under different storage or water availability conditions, the manager has little incentive to change. Innovation in allocation and operation is hence key to improved risk management using such forecasts. A participatory water allocation process that can effectively use probabilistic forecasts as part of an adaptive management strategy is introduced here. Users can express their demand for water through statements that cover the quantity needed at a particular reliability, the temporal distribution of the "allocation," the associated willingness to pay, and compensation in the event of contract nonperformance. The water manager then assesses feasible allocations using the probabilistic forecast that try to meet these criteria across all users. An iterative process between users and water manager could be used to formalize a set of short-term contracts that represent the resulting prioritized water allocation strategy over the operating period for which the forecast was issued. These contracts can be used to allocate water each year/season beyond long-term contracts that may have precedence. Thus, integrated supply and demand management can be achieved. In this paper, a single period multiuser optimization model that can support such an allocation process is presented. The application of this conceptual model is explored using data for the Jaguaribe Metropolitan Hydro System in Ceara, Brazil. The performance relative to the current allocation process is assessed in the context of whether such a model could support the proposed short-term contract based participatory process. A synthetic forecasting example is also used to explore the relative roles of forecast skill and reservoir storage in this framework.

AB [ 1] Previous investigations on initiation of motion and erosion of cohesive sediment mixtures have not included gravel within the mixtures. Experimental results on the incipient motion characteristics of cohesive sediment mixtures containing gravel are presented in this paper. The sediment used consisted of fine gravel mixed with clay in proportions varying from 10% to 50% by weight, and fine gravel with fine sand mixed in equal proportion, with clay proportions again varying from 10% to 50% by weight. The stages of the incipient condition of motion were visually identified. Three modes of initiation of motion of cohesive sediment mixtures were noticed, namely, pothole erosion, line erosion, and mass erosion. The modes of initiation of motion changed mainly with clay percentages in the mixture, its antecedent moisture characteristics, and the applied shear stress. Analysis of the experimental data from the present study and the literature revealed that depending upon the flow and sediment characteristics, the critical shear stress of the incipient motion condition in cohesive sediment mixtures can be up to 50 times larger than the critical shear stress of cohesionless sediments having similar arithmetic mean size as the cohesive sediments. On the basis of dimensional considerations, a relationship is proposed for the determination of critical shear stress of the incipient motion condition in cohesive sediment mixtures also containing gravel. The variables, namely, clay percentage, void ratio, and unconfined compressive strength of the sediment bed, are noticed to be the main parameters controlling the incipient motion condition of the cohesive sediments. In the absence of cohesion, the proposed relationship reduces to the critical shear stress for the incipient motion condition of the cohesionless sediment mixture having the same arithmetic mean size. The condition for the threshold of erosion of cohesive sediment mixtures by the flow is thus parameterized in the present study.

AB Transport of fine-grained sediment from unpaved forest roads into streams is a concern due to the potential negative effects of additional suspended sediment on aquatic ecosystems. Here we compared turbidity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) dynamics in five nonfish bearing coastal Oregon streams above and below road crossings, during three consecutive time periods (before, after road construction/improvement, and after forest harvest and hauling). We hypothesized that the combined effects of road construction/improvement and the hauling following forest harvest would increase turbidity and SSC in these streams. We tested whether the differences between paired samples from above and below road crossing exceeded various biological thresholds, using literature values of biological responses to increases in SSC and turbidity. Overall, we found minimal increases of both turbidity and SSC after road improvement, forest harvest, and hauling. Because flow is often used as a surrogate for turbidity or SSC we examined these relationships using data from locations above road crossings that were unaffected by roads or forest harvest and hauling. In addition, we examined the association between turbidity and SSC for these background locations. We found a positive, but in some cases weak association between flow and turbidity, and between flow and SSC; the relationship between turbidity and SSC was more robust, but also inconsistent among sites over time. In these low order streams, the concentrations and transport of suspended sediment seems to be highly influenced by the variability of local conditions. Our study provides an expanded understanding of current forest road management practice effects on fine-grained sediment in streams and introduces alternative metrics using multiple thresholds to evaluate potential indicators of biological relevance.

TI Relationship between specific surface area and the dry end of the water

AB Accurate description of the soil water retention curve (SWRC) at low water contents is important for simulating water dynamics and biochemical vadose zone processes in arid environments. Soil water retention data corresponding to matric potentials of less than -10 MPa, where adsorptive forces dominate over capillary forces, have also been used to estimate soil specific surface area (SA). In the present study, the dry end of the SWRC was measured with a chilled-mirror dew point psychrometer for 41 Danish soils covering a wide range of clay (CL) and organic carbon (OC) contents. The 41 soils were classified into four groups on the basis of the Dexter number (n = CL/OC), and the Tuller-Or (TO) general scaling model describing water film thickness at a given matric potential (<-10 MPa) was evaluated. The SA estimated from the dry end of the SWRC (SA_SWRC) was in good agreement with the SA measured with ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (SA_EGME) only for organic soils with n >10. A strong correlation between the ratio of the two surface area estimates and the Dexter number was observed and applied as an additional scaling function in the TO model to rescale the soil water retention curve at low water contents. However, the TO model still overestimated water film thickness at potentials approaching ovendry condition (about -800 MPa). The semi-log linear Campbell-Shiozawa-Rossi-Nimmo (CSRN) model showed better fits for all investigated soils from -10 to -800 MPa and yielded high correlations with CL and SA. It is therefore recommended to apply the empirical CSRN model for predicting the dry part of the water retention curve (-10 to -800 MPa) from measured soil texture or surface area. Further research should aim to modify the more physically based TO model to obtain better descriptions of the SWRC in the very dry range (-300 to -800 MPa).

AB Gullying is a significant process in the long-term dynamics and evolution of both natural and rehabilitated (i.e. post-mining) landscapes. From a landscape management perspective it is important that we understand gully initiation and development, as it is well recognized that catchment disturbance can result in the development of gullies that can be very difficult to rehabilitate. This study examines gully position using geomorphic statistics relating to features such as depth, width and length in a catchment undisturbed by European activity in the Northern Territory, Australia. The results demonstrate that gullying occurs throughout the catchment and that a slope-area threshold does not exist and that gully position broadly follows the catchment area-slope relationship. Simple relationships relating catchment area and slope to gully depth, width and length provide poor results, despite these relationships having been found to apply for ephemeral gullies in cropland. The results suggest that gully initiation thresholds are low as a result of an enhanced fire regime. A threshold model for gully position that uses catchment area and slope to switch between gully and hillslope was evaluated and found broadly to capture gully position.

AB Flow channelization is a commonly observed phenomenon in fractured subsurface media where the flow of fluids is restricted primarily to highly transmissive fracture networks surrounded by a low-permeability rock matrix. The multiscale structural heterogeneity of these networks results in multiscale flow channelization where preferential flow paths form at length scales ranging from the entire system down to the subfracture size. We present an analysis of how one of the largest scales in fractured media, the network density, influences the degree of flow channeling that occurs using an ensemble of semigeneric three-dimensional discrete fracture network (DFN) simulations. We construct 10 DFNs, whose fracture lengths follow a power law distribution, at four densities for a total of 40 networks. We characterize their structure in terms of the network topology and geometry. Eulerian and Lagrangian observations of the steady-state flow fields obtained within the networks are used to quantify the degree of flow channelization at the network scale. We introduce a measure for the importance-ranking/hierarchy of different flow paths in the network using graph-based analysis of Lagrangian transport by which the degree of flow channeling between networks is compared. These flow observations are then linked to the structural properties of the networks. In general, network-scale flow channeling decreases as the network density increases. However, at low densities, there is more uniform flow within the entire connected network than in high-density networks. We also demonstrate how standard transport observables can be used to infer the degree of flow channelization occurring within a fracture network.

AB Passive microwave data have been used to infer the areal snow water equivalent (SWE) with some success. However, the accuracy of these retrieved SWE values have not been well determined for heterogeneous vegetated regions. The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Winter Field Campaign (WFC), which took place in February 1994, provided the opportunity to study in detail the effects of boreal forests on snow parameter retrievals. Preliminary results reconfirmed the relationship between microwave brightness temperature and snow water equivalent. The pronounced effect of forest cover on SWE retrieval was studied. A modified vegetation mixing algorithm is proposed to account for the forest cover. The relationship between the microwave signature and observed snowpack parameters matches results from this model.

ID THROUGH LARGE NUMBERS; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; INHOMOGENEITIES
AB A novel analytical solution approach for problems of steady flow in two-dimensional heterogeneous porous media is presented, where the hydraulic conductivity may be represented as an arbitrary polynomial in space. The solution approach uses Wirtinger calculus and the Bers-Vekua theory of elliptical functions. The final form of the solution comprises an arbitrary complex polynomial solution to the Laplace equation and additional nonholomorphic terms which are determined directly from the coefficients of this polynomial. The arbitrary polynomial coefficients may be chosen to satisfy general flow conditions along system boundaries. The approach is also extended to singular flow, such as that induced by pumping wells. The solution is demonstrated to be effectively exact for a number of test cases; the problems are solved to machine precision.

AB Capillary heterogeneity trapping caused by mesoscale heterogeneity at the millimeter scale has been shown to have a great potential in immobilizing a significant amount of CO2 in CO2 geologic storage. The goal of this study is to develop and apply a macroscopic percolation simulator to better understand how post-imbibition CO2 capillary heterogeneity trapping varies with different types and degrees of mesoscale heterogeneity as well as to quantify and compare its contribution to the pore-scale snap-off/bypass residual trapping mechanism. Using invasion percolation during drainage and ordinary percolation with macroscopic trapping during imbibition, the macroscopic percolation simulator can rapidly simulate both post-drainage and post-imbibition CO2 saturation fields under capillary-gravity equilibrium, producing results that are validated by a full-physics reservoir simulator with a speedup of 10 to 100 times. The macroscopic percolation simulation results have shown that for domains that are completely uncorrelated or with nonleaky downstream capillary barriers, CO2 heterogeneity trapping contribution always increases with the degree of heterogeneity of the domain. This is consistent with previous experimental results. However, the relationship between the CO2 residual trapping ability of a domain also depends on the spatial structure of the heterogeneity and trapping ability does not always increase linearly with the degree of heterogeneity as previously shown. Additionally, when the capillary barrier is leaky, then regardless of the degree of heterogeneity, no extra capillary heterogeneity trapping can be achieved after long-term imbibition. Finally, this study demonstrates how residual trapping relationships may not be scale-invariant and calls for more sophisticated upscaling methods such as the macroscopic percolation simulation method presented here.

AB A lattice Boltzmann color-fluid model, which was recently proposed by Liu et al. (2012) based on a concept of continuum surface force, is improved to simulate immiscible two-phase flows in porous media. The new improvements allow the model to account for different kinematic viscosities of both fluids and to model fluid-solid interactions. The capability and accuracy of this model is first validated by two benchmark tests: a layered two-phase flow with a variable viscosity ratio, and a dynamic capillary intrusion. This model is then used to simulate liquid CO2 (LCO2) displacing water in a dual-permeability pore network. The extent and behavior of LCO2 preferential flow (i.e., fingering) is found to depend on the capillary number (Ca), and three different displacement patterns observed in previous micromodel experiments are reproduced. The predicted variation of LCO2 saturation with Ca, as well as variation of specific interfacial length with LCO2 saturation, are both in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. To understand the effect of heterogeneity on pore-scale displacement, we also simulate LCO2 displacing water in a randomly heterogeneous pore network, which has the same size and porosity as the simulated dual-permeability pore network. In comparison to the dual-permeability case, the transition from capillary fingering to viscous fingering occurs at a higher Ca, and LCO2 saturation is higher at low Ca but lower at high Ca. In either pore network, the LCO2-water specific interfacial length is found to obey a power-law dependence on LCO2 saturation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of interannual variability of precipitation and potential evaporation on the long-term mean annual evapotranspiration as well as on the interannual variability of evapotranspiration is studied using a stochastic soil moisture model within the Budyko framework. Results indicate that given the same long-term mean annual precipitation and potential evaporation, including interannual variability of precipitation and potential evaporation reduces the long-term mean annual evapotranspiration. This reduction effect is mostly prominent when the dryness index (i.e., the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation) is within the range from 0.5 to 2. The maximum reductions in the evaporation ratio (i.e., the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation) can reach 8-10% for a range of coefficient of variation (CV) values for precipitation and potential evaporation. The relations between the maximum reductions and the CV values of precipitation and potential evaporation follow power laws. Hence the larger the interannual variability of precipitation and potential evaporation becomes, the larger the reductions in the evaporation ratio will be. The inclusion of interannual variability of precipitation and potential evaporation also increases the interannual variability of evapotranspiration. It is found that the interannual variability of daily rainfall depth and that of the frequency of daily rainfall events have quantitatively different impacts on the interannual variability of evapotranspiration; and they also interact differently with the interannual variability of potential evaporation. The results presented in this study demonstrate the importance of understanding the role of interannual variability of precipitation and potential evaporation in land surface hydrology under a warming climate.

AB Synoptic information on bed shear stress is necessary in predicting the transport of sediments and environmental contaminants in rivers and open channels. Existing methods of estimating bed shear stress typically involve measuring vertical profiles of streamwise velocity or Reynolds stress and taking advantage of the logarithmic or the constant stress region, respectively, to determine friction velocity and subsequently, bed shear stress. While effective, these methods yield local measurements of bed shear stress only. Direct measurements of bed shear stress can also be obtained through measurements with a drag plate. However, this method yields average shear stress information over the area of the plate and is impractical for large-scale implementation in the field. Here we present a method capable of providing continuous synoptic measurements of bed shear stress over a large field-of-view. A series of Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) measurements were made in a variety of flows generated in a wide-open channel facility. Turbulent dissipation is calculated on the free surface from the 2-D LSPIV results and is correlated with near-surface ADV measurements of turbulent dissipation in the water column. The ADV results are consistent with the Nezu (1977) established relationship for the vertical variation of turbulent dissipation in the water column. Knowledge of the correlation between free-surface and near-surface dissipation values coupled with Nezu's (1977) relationship allow a robust and accurate estimate of friction velocity to be made and subsequently, shear stress at the bed can be estimated.

AB Climate state can be an important predictor of future hydrologic conditions. In ensemble streamflow forecasting, where historical weather inputs or streamflow observations are used to generate the ensemble, climate index weighting is one way to represent the influence of climate state. Using a climate index, each forecast variable member of the ensemble is selectively weighted to reflect the climate state at the time of the forecast. A new approach to climate index weighting of ensemble forecasts is presented. The method is based on a sampling-resampling approach for Bayesian updating. The original hydrologic ensemble members define a sample drawn from the prior distribution; the relationship between the climate index and the ensemble member forecast variable is used to estimate a likelihood function. Given an observation of the climate index at the time of the forecast, the estimated likelihood function is then used to assign weights to each ensemble member. The weights define the probability of each ensemble member outcome given the observed climate index. The weighted ensemble forecast is then used to estimate the posterior distribution of the forecast variable conditioned on the climate index. The Bayesian climate index weighting approach is easy to apply to hydrologic ensemble forecasts; its parameters do not require calibration with hindcasts, and it adapts to the strength of the relation between climate and the forecast variable, defaulting to equal weighting of ensemble members when no relationship exists. A hydrologic forecasting application illustrates the approach and contrasts it with traditional climate index weighting approaches.

AB A fundamental understanding of the fluid movement and dynamic partitioning process at fracture intersections is important to accurately predict water infiltration and contaminant transport in networks of fractures. We present an experimental study on the flow-splitting behavior at a T-shaped intersection. Different combinations of apertures of the vertical (b(v)) and horizontal (b(h)) fractures are considered. Experimental results confirm that the gravity-driven flow in the vertical fracture transitions from droplet to rivulet mode as the flow rate increases. We quantify the flow dynamics through the intersection and especially focus on the partitioning efficiency (eta) defined as the percentage of flow partitioned into the horizontal fracture. We identify three regimes of flow partitioning at the intersection for the case of b(v) < b(h): total partitioning (eta -> 1), splitting or partial bypass (0 < eta < 1), and total bypass (eta -> 0). The total bypass regime is associated with the rivulet mode with a flow rate higher than similar to 1.5 ml/min. We find a simple relationship between eta and the flow rate Q for droplet flow, eta = min(1, C(h)Q(-1)), where C-h is a threshold flow rate below which droplets almost completely imbibe into the horizontal fracture, leading to eta -> 1. A force balance analysis links C-h to a critical droplet length for the transition from complete partitioning to path splitting. The obtained relationship is further supported by numerical simulations of droplet flow through intersections. The results and analysis from this study may provide insights and physical constraints on construction of reduced order unsaturated flow models based on simplified discrete fracture networks.

AB The quantification of the interfacial area between fluids in a multiphase system in porous media has been a subject of growing interest in disciplines where mass transfer across fluid interfaces is of importance. In this study, a proof of concept for a novel kinetic interface sensitive (KIS) tracer is provided by employing a simple, low-cost, well-controlled dynamic column experiment in conjunction with a macroscale two-phase flow reactive transport model. The steel column is filled with a well-characterized porous medium consisting of well-sorted normally distributed glass beads (d(50) = 240 mu m). KIS tracers were designed to determine the specific interfacial area, awn, between a nonwetting fluid and a wetting fluid, by evaluating the chemical reaction rates and mass transfer across the fluid-fluid interface. This study shows for the first time a general framework behind the use of KIS tracers and their potential in assessing the awn for a known capillary pressure-saturation relationship under laboratory conditions. A two-phase flow four-component reactive transport and a two-phase flow two-component transport numerical model were developed to simulate the oil flooding of the initially water saturated column and tracer breakthrough curves obtained from experimental data. These breakthrough curves were subsequently used to approximate awn using a polynomial relationship. The interpretation of the KIS tracer column experiments indicates that the range for maximum value of awn is between 500 and 540 m(2)/m(3). The results also show that despite the use of two independently synthesized tracers, if the reaction kinetics are well quantified, similar awn values can be obtained.

AB The transport of fine sediment, carried in suspension by water, is central to the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecological functioning of river floodplains and deltas. An extensive new field data set for the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada quantifies robust positive relationships between in situ suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and remotely sensed visible/near-infrared reflectance. These relationships are exploited using SPOT and ASTER satellite images to map suspended sediment concentrations across the PAD for four days in 2006 and 2007, revealing strong variations in water sources and flow patterns, including flow reversals in major distributaries. Near-daily monitoring with 276 MODIS satellite images tracks hydrologic recharge of floodplain lakes, as revealed by episodic infusions of sediment-rich water from the Athabasca River. The timing and magnitude of lake recharge are linked to springtime water level on the Athabasca River, suggesting a system sensitive to changes in river flow regime. Moreover, recharge timing differentiates lakes that are frequently and extensively recharged from those recharged more rarely. Finally, we present a first estimation of river flow velocity based on remotely sensed SSC, though saturation may occur at velocities > 0.6 m/s. Viewed collectively, the different remote sensing methodologies presented here suggest strong value for visible/near-infrared remote sensing of suspended sediment to assess hydrologic and sediment transport processes in complex flow environments. Field observations including nephelometric turbidity, specific conductivity, water temperature, Secchi disk depth, suspended sediment concentration, and water level are archived at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center for Biogeochemical Dynamics (available at http://daac.ornl.gov//HYDROCLIMATOLOGY/guides/PAD.html).

AB In this paper, we consider dispersive and chromatographic mixing at an interface, under alternating flow conditions. In case of a nonreactive or linearly sorbing solute, mixing is in complete analogy with classical dispersion theory. For nonlinear exchange, however, oscillating convective flow leads to an alternation of sharpening (Traveling Wave TW) and spreading (Rarefaction Wave RW). As the limiting TW form is not necessarily accomplished at the end of the TW half cycle, the oscillating fronts show gradual continuous spreading that converges to a zero-convection nonlinear pure diffusion spreading, which is mathematically of quite different nature. This behavior is maintained in case the total (background) concentration differs at both sides of the initial exchange front.

AB Concentration-discharge (c-Q) relations have been used to infer watershed-scale processes governing solute fluxes. Prior studies have documented inconsistent concentration-discharge patterns at the storm-event scale driven by changes in end-member concentrations. Other studies have evaluated c-Q data from all periods in a composite fashion to quantify chemostasis (relatively invariant changes in concentration over several orders of magnitude variation in streamflow). Here we examine 3 years of high-frequency nitrate and discharge data (49,861 data points) to complement 14 years of weekly data (699 data points) for an urban stream in Baltimore, MD, U.S. to quantify c-Q relationships. We show that these relationships are variable through time and depend on the temporal scale at which they are investigated. On a storm-event scale, the sensor data exhibit a watershed-specific dQ/Q threshold when storms switch from counter-clockwise to clockwise c-Q behavior. On a seasonal scale, we show the influence of hydrologic variability and in-stream metabolism as controls on stream nitrate concentrations and fluxes. On a composite scale, we evaluate the c-Q data for chemostasis using analysis of both c-Q slopes and CVc/CVQ, as a function of time. The slopes of c-Q data for both long-term weekly and high-frequency data sets are in close agreement on an annual basis and vary between dry and wet years; the CVc/CVQ analysis is less sensitive to hydroclimate variability. This work highlights the value of both long-term and high-frequency c-Q data collection for calculating and analyzing solute fluxes.

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Stream temperature, an important measure of ecosystem health, is expected to be altered by future changes in climate and land use, potentially leading to shifts in habitat distribution for aquatic organisms dependent on particular temperature regimes. To assess the sensitivity of stream temperature to change in a region where such a shift has the potential to occur, we examine the variability of and controls on the direct relationship between air and water temperature across the state of Pennsylvania. We characterized the relationship between air and stream temperature via linear and nonlinear regression for 57 sites across Pennsylvania at daily and weekly timescales. Model fit (r2) improved for 92% (daily) and 65% (weekly) of sites for nonlinear versus linear relationships. Fit for weekly versus daily regression analysis improved by 0.08 for linear and 0.06 for nonlinear regression relationships. To investigate the mechanisms controlling stream temperature sensitivity to environmental change, we define thermal sensitivity as the sensitivity of stream temperature of a given site to change in air temperature, quantified as the slope of the regression line between air and stream temperature. Air temperature accounted for 6095% of the daily variation in stream temperature for sites at or above a Strahler stream order (SO) of 3, with thermal sensitivities ranging from low (0.02) to high (0.93). The sensitivity of stream temperature to air temperature is primarily controlled by stream size (SO) and baseflow contribution. Together, SO and baseflow index explained 43% of the variance in thermal sensitivity across the state, and 59% within the Susquehanna River Basin. In small streams, baseflow contribution was the major determinant of thermal sensitivity, with increasing baseflow contributions resulting in decreasing sensitivity values. In large streams, thermal sensitivity increased with stream size, as a function of accumulated heat throughout the stream network. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Travel time distributions (TTDs) provide an effective way to describe the transport and mixing processes of water parcels in a subsurface hydrological system. A major challenge in characterizing catchment TTD is quantifying the travel times in deep groundwater and its contribution to the streamflow TTD. Here, we develop and test a novel modeling framework for an integrated assessment of catchment scale TTDs through explicit representation of 3D-groundwater dynamics. The proposed framework is based on the linkage between a flux tracking scheme with the surface hydrologic model (mHM) for the soil-water compartment and a particle tracking scheme with the 3D-groundwater model OpenGeoSys (OGS) for the groundwater compartment. This linkage provides us with the ability to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of TTDs in these different hydrological compartments from grid scale to regional scale. We apply this framework in the Nagelstedt catchment in central Germany. Simulation results reveal that both shape and scale of grid-scale groundwater TTDs are spatially heterogeneous, which are strongly dependent on the topography and aquifer structure. The component-wise analysis of catchment TTD shows a time-dependent sensitivity of transport processes in soil zone and groundwater to driving meteorological forcing. Catchment TTD exhibits a power-law shape and fractal behavior. The predictive uncertainty in catchment mean travel time is dominated by the uncertainty in the deep groundwater rather than that in the soil zone. Catchment mean travel time is severely biased by a marginal error in groundwater characterization. Accordingly, we recommend to use multiple summary statistics to minimize the predictive uncertainty introduced by the tailing behavior of catchment TTD.

AB [ 1] Drought periods appear as extreme events whose characterization encompasses several issues. Many issues are related to the multiple natures that a drought may have: meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, or socioeconomical. There are also issues related to the complexity of the phenomena, which may be characterized by many magnitudes, such as duration, severity, or intensity. None of them alone may be used as a general drought characterization criterion. Others arise from the kind of methodologies that are available for their significance evaluation, which focus on different aspects for specific objectives. However, most have a common aspect: the extreme persistent realization of a random hydroclimatic variable. For the goal of general drought analysis, in this paper a new index for drought characterization is presented: the drought frequency index (DFI). The index focuses on this common aspect of the drought origins, with a purely probabilistic treatment. Because droughts are persistent phenomena, the index is based on the stochastic characterization of extreme persistent deviation sequences using a novel probabilistic criterion. In this way, the DFI is related to the mean frequency of recurrence of extreme persistent events. Therefore the mean frequency of recurrence is adopted as the scale for drought significance evaluation. The index performance is analyzed and compared with respect to the different issues that result from applying other methodologies: magnitude selection, univariate versus multivariate, threshold selection ( related to the run theory), and timescale issues ( related with the standard precipitation index (SPI) application). Furthermore, to apply runs theory for any magnitude number, an original generalization of drought multivariate recurrence models is presented. Finally, the spatial comparability of the indexes is analyzed. Results reveal the ability of the DFI to reduce the sensitivity to practical issues. The DFI provides a consistent index for spatial comparisons and for application to general drought characterization goals.

AB Utilising datasets from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and previous isotopic studies, we investigated delta O-18 spatial and temporal patterns in Chinese precipitation. Significantly positive relationships existed between precipitation delta O-18 and air temperature above the north of 35 degrees N and in high altitude regions above 32 degrees N. Significantly negative relationships between precipitation delta O-18 and the precipitation amount existed below south of 35 degrees N. These temperature and precipitation effects became stronger with increasing altitude except in high altitude regions between 32 degrees N and 35 degrees N. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1980 to 2004 showed that variations in spatial and seasonal wind fields at 700 hpa and total precipitable water from the ground to the top of the atmosphere were correlated with the monthly spatial distribution of precipitation delta O-18. Basing on this relationship, we established quantitative correlations between the mean monthly precipitation delta O-18 and both latitude and temperature in different seasons. We found that spatial variations in precipitation delta O-18 could be described well using the Bowen-Wilkinson model and second-order equations developed during the present study only in winter (from December to February). During the rest of the year, patterns were too complex to predict using simple models. The results suggest that it is difficult to demonstrate variations of precipitation delta O-18 throughout the year and for all regions of China using a single model. Moreover, the new models for the relationships among precipitation, latitude, and temperature were better able to depict the variations in precipitation delta O-18 than the Bowen-Wilkinson model.

AB We present a sociohydrological model that can help us to better understand the system dynamics of a smallholder farmer. It couples the dynamics of the six main assets of a typical smallholder farmer: water storage capacity, capital, livestock, soil fertility, grazing access, and labor. The hydroclimatic variability, which is a main driver and source of uncertainty of the smallholder system, is accounted for at subannual scale. The model incorporates rule-based adaptation mechanisms of smallholders (for example, adjusting expenditures on food and fertilizers and selling livestocks) when farmers face adverse sociohydrological conditions, such as low annual rainfall, occurrence of dry spells, or variability of input or commodity prices. We have applied the model to analyze the sociohydrology of a cash crop producing smallholder in Maharashtra, India, in a semisynthetic case study setting. Of late, this region has witnessed many suicides of farmers who could not extricate themselves out of the debt trap. These farmers lacked irrigation and were susceptible to fluctuating commodity prices and climatic variability. We studied the sensitivity of a smallholder's capital, an indicator of smallholder well-being, to two types of cash crops (cotton and sugarcane), water storage capacity, availability of irrigation, initial capital that a smallholder starts with, prevalent wage rates, and access to grazing. We found that (i) smallholders with low water storage capacities and no irrigation are most susceptible to distress, (ii) a smallholder's well-being is low at low wage rates, (iii) wage rate is more important than absolution of debt, (iv) well-being is sensitive to water storage capacity up to a certain level, and (v) well-being increases with increasing area available for livestock grazing. Our results indicate that government intervention to absolve the debt of farmers or to invest in local storage to buffer rainfall variability may not be enough. In addition, alternative sources of income may need to be provided, for instance by ensuring minimum wages or by providing more access to grazing areas.

AB We investigate chemical transport in laboratory rock cores using unidirectional pulse tracer experiments. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) measured at various flow rates in one sandstone and two carbonate samples are interpreted using the one-dimensional Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formulation with a truncated power law (TPL) model. Within the same framework, we evaluate additional memory functions to consider the Advection-Dispersion Equation (ADE) and its extension to describe mass exchange between mobile and immobile solute phases (Single-Rate Mass Transfer model, SRMT). To provide physical constraints to the models, parameters are identified that do not depend on the flow rate. While the ADE fails systematically at describing the effluent profiles for the carbonates, the SRMT and TPL formulations provide excellent fits to the measurements. They both yield a linear correlation between the dispersion coefficient and the Peclet number (D-L proportional to Pefor10<O(Pe)<100), and the longitudinal dispersivity is found to be significantly larger than the equivalent grain diameter,D-e. The BTCs of the carbonate rocks show clear signs of nonequilibrium effects. While the SRMT model explicitly accounts for the presence of microporous regions (up to 30% of the total pore space), in the TPL formulation the time scales of both advective and diffusive processes (t(1)(Pe)andt(2)) are associated with two characteristic heterogeneity length scales (d over bar andl, respectively). We observed thatl approximate to 2.5 x D(e)and that anomalous transport arises whenl/d over bar <= O(1). In this context, the SRMT and TPL formulations provide consistent, yet complementary, insight into the nature of anomalous transport in laboratory rock cores.

AB Bayesian theory of model calibration provides a coherent framework for distinguishing and encoding multiple sources of uncertainty in probabilistic predictions of flooding. This paper demonstrates the use of a Bayesian approach to computer model calibration, where the calibration data are in the form of spatial observations of flood extent. The Bayesian procedure involves generating posterior distributions of the flood model calibration parameters and observation error, as well as a Gaussian model inadequacy function, which represents the discrepancy between the best model predictions and reality. The approach is first illustrated with a simple didactic example and is then applied to a flood model of a reach of the river Thames in the UK. A predictive spatial distribution of flooding is generated for a flood of given severity.

AB The contributing areas of streams in the Prairie regions of Canada and the northern U.S. are dominated by complexes of wetlands which store and release water. Prior research has suggested the existence of hysteresis between the total volume of water stored in prairie wetlands within a drainage basin and the basin's contributing area. To simulate the relationship between storage and contributing area in a way that accounts for hysteresis, two wetland hydrology models with vastly different levels of complexity were devised. The fully distributed Wetland Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Ponding Model (WDPM) applies simple fluxes of runoff and evaporation to a DEM of a prairie wetland complex. The parameterized Pothole Cascade Model (PCM) applies simulated fluxes of water to collections of conceptual models of wetlands and is less demanding in computations and data. Prior research showed that both models produced hysteretic relationships between water storage and contributing area, but the PCM produced smaller estimates of contributing area than did the WDPM, likely due to its spatial simplification. Using sequential remote sensing observations of wetland area after snowmelt, this study shows that the frequency distribution of the open water areas of prairie wetlands is similar to that produced by the WDPM when the wetlands are close to being completely filled. The remotely sensed observations show evidence of hysteresis in the open water area frequency distributions, as predicted by the fully distributed WDPM. To enable the parameterized PCM to produce the same type of hysteretic relationships as the WDPM, scaling relationships between the maximum area of a wetland and the area of upland draining into it were included. The parameterized PCM is suitable for application with prairie snow redistribution, snowmelt, infiltration, runoff and evapotranspiration routines as part of semi-distributed hydrological modelling of prairie wetland basins such as that implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Model.

AB We present the results of a 3-year monitoring programme of the stable isotope composition of lake water and precipitation at Taozi Lake, in the East Asian monsoon region of China. Our aims were to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of variation of stable isotopes in a small closed-basin lake and to quantitatively determine the impacts of precipitation and evaporation on the stable isotope composition of lake water under a humid monsoon climate. In the time domain, the stable oxygen isotopic ratio of the lake water (delta O-18(L)) exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variations, but the isotope variations between different precipitation events substantially exceeded seasonal and interannual variations. Compared with the stable isotopes in precipitation, delta O-18(L) was substantially positive and d(L) was negative. In the space domains, the lake water was homogeneously mixed. Indicated by statistic analyses, precipitation plays a dominant role in dynamic of the lake stable isotope during precipitation events of relatively large magnitude, whereas the effect of evaporation is dominant during smaller precipitation events. Results advance our understanding of the stable isotope change rule in the process of lake water evaporation, and it is helpful to identify the climatic significance recorded in stable isotopic compositions of lake bottom sediments.

AB Snow accumulation and ablation rule the temporal dynamics of water availability in mountain areas and cold regions. In these environments, the evaluation of the snow water amount is a key issue. The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) over a mountain basin at the end of the snow accumulation season is estimated using a minimal statistical model (SWE-SEM). This uses systematic observations such as,round measurements collected at snow guages and snow-covered area (SCA) data retrieved by remote sensors, here MODIS. Firstly, SWE-SEM calculates local SWE estimates at Snow gauges, then the spatial distribution of SWE over a certain area using an interpolation method; linear regressions of the first two order moments of SWE with altitude. The interpolation has been made by both confining and unconfining the spatial domain by SCA. SWE-SEM is applied to the Mallero basin (northern Italy) for calculating the snow Water equivalent at the end of the winter season for 6 years (2001-2007). For 2007, SWE-SEM estimates are validated through fieldwork measurements collected during an 'ad hoc' campaign on March 31, 2007. Show-surveyed measurements are used to check SCA, snow density and SWE estimates. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A volume-penalization immersed boundary (VPIB) method was developed to study flow interactions with aquatic vegetation. The model has been validated with data from laboratory experiments and previous high-fidelity models with satisfactory results. Sensitivity analyzes on both penalty parameter and thickness parameter were conducted, and optimal values for these parameters are recommended. The validated model has been applied to study the effects of swaying motion of vegetation stems on the flow dynamics at both vegetate-stem scale and patch scale. The swaying motion of the vegetation stem is prescribed following a cubic law that peaks at the top and decreases to zero at the bottom. At stem-scale, the hydrodynamics depend on the Keulegan Carpenter number (KC), which is defined as the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem to the diameter of the stem. Simulations with three KC values were carried out. For KC >= 1, the flow turbulence is significantly enhanced by the swaying motion of the stem, and turbulence becomes more isotropic in the wake. The swaying motion of vegetation stems caused a 5% increase of the bottom shear stress at the shoulders of the stem, and the effect is negligible in the wake. At patch-scale, the hydrodynamics depend on the effective Keulegan Carpenter number based on the patch size of the vegetation patch, and the solid volume fraction for dense vegetation canopy. Solid volume fraction was varied while maintaining the same effective Keulegan Carpenter in the simulations. When the effective Keulgen Carpenter number is small (KC < 1), effects of the swaying motion of vegetation stems on the large patch-scale dynamics are not significant, including both the turbulence statistics and the bottom stress.

AB This paper compares the performance of analytical and numerical approaches for modeling DNAPL dissolution with biodecay. A solution derived from a 1-D advective transport formulation ("Parker" model) is shown to agree very closely with high resolution numerical solutions. A simple lumped source mass balance solution in which with decay is assumed proportional to DNAPL mass ("Falta1" model) over-or underpredicts aqueous phase biodecay depending on the magnitude of the exponential factor governing the relationship between dissolution rate and DNAPL mass. A modification of the Falta model that assumes decay proportional to the source exit concentration is capable of accurately simulating source behavior with strong aqueous phase biodecay if model parameters are appropriately selected or calibrated ("Falta2" model). However, parameters in the lumped models exhibit complex interdependencies that cannot be quantified without consideration of transport processes within the source zone. Combining the Falta2 solution with relationships derived from the Parker model was found to resolve these limitations and track the numerical model results. A method is presented to generalize the analytical solutions to enable simulation of partial mass removal with changes in source parameters over time due to various remedial actions. The algorithm is verified by comparison with numerical simulation results. An example application is presented that demonstrates the interactions of partial mass removal, enhanced biodecay, enhanced mass transfer and source zone flow reduction applied at various time periods on contaminant flux reduction. Increasing errors that arise in numerical solutions with coarse discretization and high decay rates are shown to be controlled by using an adjusted decay coefficient derived from the Parker analytical solution.

AB Fracture surface topography exhibits long-range spatial correlations resulting in a heterogeneous aperture field. This leads to the formation, within fracture planes, of preferential flow channels controlling flow and transport processes. By means of a 3-D heat transport model coupled with a 2-D fracture flow model based on the lubrification approximation (i.e., local cubic law), we investigate how the statistical parameters determining spatial aperture variations in individual fractures control the heat exchange at the fluid/rock interface and heat transport by flow. Ensemble statistics over fracture realizations provide insights into the main hydraulic and geometrical parameters controlling the hydraulic and thermal behaviour of rough fractures. Similarly to the rough fracture's hydraulic behaviour, we find that its heat transport behaviour deviates from the conventional parallel plate fracture model with increasing fracture closure and/or decreasing correlation length. We demonstrate that the advancement of the thermal front is typically slower in rough fractures compared to smooth fractures having the same mechanical aperture. In contrast with previous studies that neglect temporal and spatial temperature variations in the rock matrix, we find that the thermal behavior of a rough-walled fracture can, under field-relevant conditions, be predicted from a parallel plate model with an aperture equal to the rough fracture's effective hydraulic aperture. This greatly simplifies the prediction of possible reservoir thermal behavior when using field measurable quantities and hydrological modeling.

AB In-stream sediment mining and feeding inevitably change the sediment budget of an alluvial river, and may substantially alter its hydraulics and morphology. These alterations can have variable effects on fluvial habitat. Minimization of the detrimental effects and maximization of the beneficial impacts require a quantitative understanding of the complicated interaction between flow, sediment transport and morphological evolution. However, existing numerical river models have been developed for purely natural fluvial processes, and are rarely, if ever, applicable where interactive sediment mining and feeding take place. This paper presents numerical models for alluvial rivers subject to interactive sediment mining and feeding, within the context of shallow water hydrodynamics. The theoretical framework of two- and one-dimensional models is provided from conservation laws, and closure requirements are briefly addressed. The present models are distinguished from previous ones because of the complete continuity equations for the water and sediment phases and bed material, which are scrutinized under idealized scenarios with known analytical features. The continuity equations contain terms arising from mass exchange, which, though less known to the majority of fluvial hydraulics community, may be significant not only scientifically but also under regimes of practical interests. To demonstrate the applicability of the present models, a numerical study is provided on the dynamics of an otherwise aggrading channel in response to sediment mining, showing the role of sediment mining in mitigating river aggradation.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that effective field-scale bioremediation reactions rates are significantly lower than batch-or lab-scale rates, when the same law of mass action is used to represent the reaction at both scales. The mismatch is usually attributed to poor mixing of reactants brought about by heterogeneity. A recent method, based on a purely Lagrangian particle tracking (PT) theoretical development, successfully reproduces the effects of mixing-limited bimolecular reaction (A + B -> C) from two benchmark experiments. In this numerical method, the reactants are represented by particles, and the small-scale physics are directly translated into a combination of two probabilities that govern whether: (1) reactant particles are collocated during a short time interval, and (2) two collocated particles favorably transform into a reaction. The latter is due to thermodynamics and is independent of scale of mixing. The former directly accounts for the degree of mixing in any system. We extend the application of the PT method to biodegradation, which is commonly characterized by more complex Michaelis-Menten (Monod) chemical kinetics. The advantage of the PT method is that it explains the variation of reaction rate based on mixing-controlled particle collisions instead of using empirical parameters. The PT method not only matches the Michaelis-Menten (Monod) equation under ideal conditions, but also captures the characteristics of non-ideal conditions such as imperfect mixing, disequilibrium, and limited availability of the active sites. We show these using hypothetical systems and also successfully apply the method to a column study of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A downscaling approach based on multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) is presented. The key concept underlying MPS is to sample spatial patterns from within training images, which can then be used in characterizing the relationship between different variables across multiple scales. The approach is used here to downscale climate variables including skin surface temperature (TSK), soil moisture (SMOIS), and latent heat flux (LH). The performance of the approach is assessed by applying it to data derived from a regional climate model of the Murray-Darling basin in southeast Australia, using model outputs at two spatial resolutions of 50 and 10 km. The data used in this study cover the period from 1985 to 2006, with 1985 to 2005 used for generating the training images that define the relationships of the variables across the different spatial scales. Subsequently, the spatial distributions for the variables in the year 2006 are determined at 10 km resolution using the 50 km resolution data as input. The MPS geostatistical downscaling approach reproduces the spatial distribution of TSK, SMOIS, and LH at 10 km resolution with the correct spatial patterns over different seasons, while providing uncertainty estimates through the use of multiple realizations. The technique has the potential to not only bridge issues of spatial resolution in regional and global climate model simulations but also in feature sharpening in remote sensing applications through image fusion, filling gaps in spatial data, evaluating downscaled variables with available remote sensing images, and aggregating/disaggregating hydrological and groundwater variables for catchment studies.

AB Snow volume and melt timing are major factors influencing the water cycle at northern high altitudes and latitudes, yet both are hard to quantify or monitor in remote mountainous regions. Twice-daily special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) passive microwave observations of seasonal snow melt onset in the Wheaton River basin, Yukon Territory, Canada (similar to 60 degrees 08'05"N, similar to 134 degrees 53'45"W), are used to test the idea that melt onset date and duration of snowpack melt-refreeze fluctuations control the timing of the early hydrograph peaks with predictable lags. This work uses the SSM/I satellite data from 1988 to 2002 to evaluate the chronology of melt and runoff patterns in the upper Yukon River basin. The Wheaton River is a small (875 km(2)) tributary to the Yukon, and is a subarctic, partly glacierized heterogeneous basin with near-continuous hydrographic records dating back to 1966. SSM/I pixels are sensitive to melt onset due to the strong increase in snow emissivity, and have a robust signal, in spite of coarse (>25 x 25 km(2)) pixel resolution and varied terrain. Results show that Wheaton River peak flows closely follow the end of large daily variations in brightness temperature of pixels covering the Wheaton River, but the magnitude of flow is highly variable, as might be expected from interannual snow mass variability. Spring rise in the hydrograph follows the end of high diurnal brightness temperature (T-b) amplitude variations (DAV) by 0 to 5 days approximately 90% of the time for this basin. Subsequent work will compare these findings for a larger (7250 km(2)), unglacierized tributary, the Ross River, which is farther northeast (similar to 61 degrees 59"40"N, similar to 132 degrees 22"40"W) in the Yukon Territory. These techniques will also be used to try to determine the improvement in melt detection and runoff prediction from the higher resolution (similar to 15 x 15 km(2)) advanced microwave scanning radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) sensor.

AB Model-driven forecasting, used for flood risks or big hydropower systems management, can produce results of unsatisfying accuracy even with best-calibrated hydrodynamic models. One of the biggest uncertainty sources is the inflow data, either produced by different hydrological models or obtained using unreliable rating curves. To keep the model in the up-to-date state, data assimilation techniques are used. The aim of the assimilation is to reduce the difference between simulated and observed state of selected variables by updating hydrodynamic model state variables according to observed water levels. The widely used data assimilation method applicable for nonlinear hydrodynamic models is Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). However, this method can often increase the computational time due to complexity of mathematical apparatus, making it less applicable in everyday operations. This paper presents the novel, fast, tailor-made data assimilation method, suitable for 1D open channel hydraulic models, based on control theory. Using Proportional-Integrative-Derivative (PID) controllers, the difference between measured levels and simulated levels obtained by hydrodynamic model is reduced by adding or subtracting the flows in the junctions/sections where water levels are measured. The novel PID control-based data assimilation (PID-DA) is compared to EnKF. Benchmarking shows that PID-DA can be used for data assimilation, even coupled with simplified 1D hydraulic model, without significant sacrifice of stability and accuracy, and with reduction of computational time up to 63 times.

AB A nondestructive and spatially integrated multielectrode method for measuring soil electrical resistivity was tested in the Beauce region of France during a period of corn crop irrigation to monitor soil water flow over time and in two-dimensional (2-D) with simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and thermal profiles. The results suggested the potential of surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for improving soil science and agronomy studies. The method was able to produce a 2-D delimitation of soil horizons as well as to monitor soil water movement. Soil drainage through water uptake by the roots, the progression of the infiltration front with preferential flow zones, and the drainage of the plowed horizon were well identified. At the studied stage of corn development (3 months) the soil zones where infiltration and drainage occurred were mainly located under the corn rows. The structural soil characteristics resulting from agricultural practices or the passage of agricultural equipment were also shown. Two-dimensional sections of soil moisture content were calculated using ERT. The estimates were made by using independently established "in situ'' calibration relationships between the moisture and electrical resistivity of typical soil horizons. The thermal soil profile was also considered in the modeling. The results showed a reliable linear relationship between the calculated and measured water contents in the crop horizon. The precision of the calculation of the specific soil water content, quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), was 3.63% with a bias corresponding to an overestimation of 1.45%. The analysis and monitoring of the spatial variability of the soil moisture content with ERT represent two components of a significant tool for better management of soil water reserves and rational irrigation practices.

AB Although averaging procedures to derive larger-scale conservation equations from their microscopic counterparts have been examined and employed in a consistent manner for a range of hydrologic problems, procedures for obtaining correspondingly averaged thermodynamic relations at the larger scale have received less attention. We examine issues related to the change of scale for intensive thermodynamic quantities, such as fluid pressures and temperatures, compare formulations based upon the underlying thermodynamic theory relied upon, and produce precise, consistent definitions for fluid pressures and capillary pressures in multiphase porous medium systems. The averaged thermodynamics approach demonstrated and advocated is applicable to a wide range of hydrologic systems beyond the two-fluid porous medium case examined in detail in this work.

AB Within the field of chaos theory several methods for the analysis of complex dynamical systems have recently been proposed. In light of these ideas we study the dynamics which control the behavior over time of river flow, investigating the existence of a low-dimension deterministic component. The present article follows the research undertaken in the work of Porporato and Ridolfi [1996a] in which some clues as to the existence of chaos were collected. Particular emphasis is given here to the problem of noise and to nonlinear prediction. With regard to the latter, the benefits obtainable by means of the interpolation of the available time series are reported and the remarkable predictive results attained with this nonlinear method are shown.

AB The exchange of gas components across the subsurface/atmosphere interface influences multiphase flow and reactive transport in the subsurface and is crucial for many biogeochemical processes, for the emission of greenhouse gases, and for the fate of volatile contaminants. In this study, we present a modeling approach to simulate non-isothermal multiphase flow and multicomponent reactive transport in coupled subsurface/atmosphere compartments. The model is based on a coupled porous medium/free flow domain in which the NavierStokes equation is used to describe single-phase (gaseous) flow in the free-flow subdomain and Darcy's law is applied for two-phase flow in the porous medium subdomain (i.e., two-domain approach). The implementation is performed by coupling COMSOL Multiphysics and PhreeqcRM, which enables the investigation of the interplay between multi-physical processes (i.e., flow, mass and heat transport) in the coupled compartments and geochemical reactions in the porous medium. We first present a set of benchmark examples in which key features of the proposed model are tested against other numerical simulators and an analytical solution. Successively, we take advantage of the unique capabilities of the proposed approach to explore conservative and reactive transport of gas components in a coupled porous medium/free flow domain. The results show that the exchange processes between the compartments control the location of reactive zones and the extent of geochemical reactions (i.e., mineral dissolution) by changing the spatiotemporal distribution of fluid phases and enhancing the interphase mass transfer of key gas components such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.

AB Novel groundwater sampling (age, flux, and nitrate) carried out beneath a streambed and in wells was used to estimate (1) the current rate of change of nitrate storage, dS(NO3)/dt, in a contaminated unconfined aquifer, and (2) future [NO3-](FWM) (the flow-weighted mean nitrate concentration in groundwater discharge) and f(NO3) (the nitrate flux from aquifer to stream). Estimates of dS(NO3)/dt suggested that at the time of sampling (2013) the nitrate storage in the aquifer was decreasing at an annual rate (mean=-9 mmol/m(2)yr) equal to about one-tenth the rate of nitrate input by recharge. This is consistent with data showing a slow decrease in the [NO3-] of groundwater recharge in recent years. Regarding future [NO3-](FWM) and fNO3, predictions based on well data show an immediate decrease that becomes more rapid after similar to 5 years before leveling out in the early 2040s. Predictions based on streambed data generally show an increase in future [NO3-](FWM) and f(NO3) until the late 2020s, followed by a decrease before leveling out in the 2040s. Differences show the potential value of using information directly from the groundwater-surface water interface to quantify the future impact of groundwater nitrate on surface water quality. The choice of denitrification kinetics was similarly important; compared to zero-order kinetics, a first-order rate law levels out estimates of future [NO3-] FWM and f(NO3) (lower peak, higher minimum) as legacy nitrate is flushed from the aquifer. Major fundamental questions about nonpoint-source aquifer contamination can be answered without a complex numerical model or long-term monitoring program.

ID PEAK FLOW; SERIES
AB The estimation of sub-daily flows from daily flood flows is important for many hydrological and hydraulic applications. Flows during flood events often vary significantly within sub-daily time-scales, and failure to capture the sub-daily flood characteristic can result in an underestimation of the instantaneous flood peaks, with possible risk of design failure. It is more common to find a longer record of daily flow series (observed or modelled using daily rainfall series) than sub-daily flow data. This paper describes a novel approach, known as the steepness index unit volume flood hydrograph approach, for disaggregating daily flood flows into sub-daily flows that takes advantage of the strong relationship between the standardized instantaneous flood peak and the standardized daily flood hydrograph rising-limb steepness index. The strength of this relationship, which is considerably stronger than the relationship between the standardized flood peak and the event flood volume, is shown using data from six rivers flowing into the Gippsland Lakes in southeast Australia. The results indicate that the steepness index unit volume flood hydrograph approach can be used to disaggregate modelled daily flood flows satisfactorily, but its reliability is dependent on a model's ability to simulate the standardized daily flood hydrograph rising-limb steepness index and the event flood volume.

ID SOIL HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; PIPETTE
AB The particle-size distribution (PSD) of a soil expresses the mass fractions of various sizes of mineral particles which constitute the soil material. It is a fundamental soil property, closely related to most physical and chemical soil properties and it affects almost any soil function. The experimental determination of soil texture, i.e., the relative amounts of sand, silt, and clay-sized particles, is done in the laboratory by a combination of sieving (sand) and gravitational sedimentation (silt and clay). In the latter, Stokes' law is applied to derive the particle size from the settling velocity in an aqueous suspension. Traditionally, there are two methodologies for particle-size analysis from sedimentation experiments: the pipette method and the hydrometer method. Both techniques rely on measuring the temporal change of the particle concentration or density of the suspension at a certain depth within the suspension. In this paper, we propose a new method which is based on the pressure in the suspension at a selected depth, which is an integral measure of all particles in suspension above the measuring depth. We derive a mathematical model which predicts the pressure decrease due to settling of particles as function of the PSD. The PSD of the analyzed sample is identified by fitting the simulated time series of pressure to the observed one by inverse modeling using global optimization. The new method yields the PSD in very high resolution and its experimental realization completely avoids any disturbance by the measuring process. A sensitivity analysis of different soil textures demonstrates that the method yields unbiased estimates of the PSD with very small estimation variance and an absolute error in the clay and silt fraction of less than 0.5%.

AB Modeling multispecies reactive transport in natural systems with strong heterogeneities and complex biochemical reactions is a major challenge for assessing groundwater polluted sites with organic and inorganic contaminants. A large variety of these contaminants react according to serial-parallel reaction networks commonly simplified by a combination of first-order kinetic reactions. In this context, a random-walk particle tracking method is presented. This method is capable of efficiently simulating the motion of particles affected by first-order network reactions in three-dimensional systems, which are represented by spatially variable physical and biochemical coefficients described at high resolution. The approach is based on the development of transition probabilities that describe the likelihood that particles belonging to a given species and location at a given time will be transformed into and moved to another species and location afterward. These probabilities are derived from the solution matrix of the spatial moments governing equations. The method is fully coupled with reactions, free of numerical dispersion and overcomes the inherent numerical problems stemming from the incorporation of heterogeneities to reactive transport codes. In doing this, we demonstrate that the motion of particles follows a standard random walk with time-dependent effective retardation and dispersion parameters that depend on the initial and final chemical state of the particle. The behavior of effective parameters develops as a result of differential retardation effects among species. Moreover, explicit analytic solutions of the transition probability matrix and related particle motions are provided for serial reactions. An example of the effect of heterogeneity on the dechlorination of organic solvents in a three-dimensional random porous media shows that the power-law behavior typically observed in conservative tracers breakthrough curves can be largely compromised by the effect of biochemical reactions.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID VULNERABILITY; RISK; RELIABILITY; METRICS
AB Reliability, resilience, and vulnerability are the traditional risk measures used to assess the performance of a reservoir system. Among these measures, resilience is used to assess the ability of a reservoir system to recover from a failure event. However, the time-independent static resilience does not consider the system characteristics, interaction of various individual components and does not provide much insight into reservoir performance from the beginning of the failure event until the full performance recovery. Knowledge of dynamic reservoir behavior under the disturbance offers opportunities for proactive and/or reactive adaptive response that can be selected to maximize reservoir resilience. A novel measure is required to provide insight into the dynamics of reservoir performance based on the reservoir system characteristics and its adaptive capacity. The reservoir system characteristics include, among others, reservoir storage curve, reservoir inflow, reservoir outflow capacity, and reservoir operating rules. The reservoir adaptive capacity can be expressed using various impacts of reservoir performance under the disturbance (like reservoir release for meeting a particular demand, socioeconomic consequences of reservoir performance, or resulting environmental state of the river upstream and downstream from the reservoir). Another way of expressing reservoir adaptive capacity to a disturbing event may include aggregated measures like reservoir robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. A novel measure that combines reservoir performance and its adaptive capacity is proposed in this paper and named dynamic resilience.'' The paper also proposes a generic simulation methodology for quantifying reservoir resilience as a function of time. The proposed resilience measure is applied to a single multipurpose reservoir operation and tested for a set of failure scenarios. The dynamic behavior of reservoir resilience is captured using the system dynamics simulation approach, a feedback-based object-oriented method, very effective for modeling complex systems. The results of dynamic resilience are compared with the traditional performance measures in order to identify advantages of the proposed measure. The results confirm that the dynamic resilience is a powerful tool for selecting proactive and reactive adaptive response of a multipurpose reservoir to a disturbing event that cannot be achieved using traditional measures. The generic quantification approach proposed in the paper allows for easy use of dynamic resilience for planning and operations of various civil infrastructure systems.

AB The discharge flow process for flood control of a gate-controlled reservoir is performed by opening and closing the reservoir floodgates. Determining the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system consisting of fully opened floodgates according to time, taking into account the discharge characteristics of the gate-controlled reservoirs during the flood period, was an important demand raised by many reservoir managers. This paper introduces a novel optimization method based on the PSO algorithm combined with the rearrangement method of the particle solution groups to directly determine the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system which consists of the number of fully opened floodgates according to time. When applying the PSO algorithm, unlike previous research that uses the discharge flow process as decision variables, in this paper, the PSO-algorithm which uses the operating plan of floodgates as the decision variables is employed to determine the initial solution for the minimal flood peak discharge in the downstream. This initial solution is modified as a more reliable and realistic optimal operation rule of the reservoir that simultaneously satisfies the maximum flood peak elimination condition and the minimum operation of reservoir floodgates by the newly developed rearrangement method of partial solution groups. To validate the proposed method in this paper, two reservoirs placed in the upstream of Chongchen River and its tributary in the DPR of Korea are selected as a case study. In addition, the PSO algorithm and progressive optimality algorithm (POA) which use the discharge flow process as the decision variables were conducted to compare the performance with the newly proposed method. The validation results show that the method proposed in the paper is superior to the two methods and sufficiently reflects the demand of reservoir managers, which can be effectively applied to the determination of the optimal operating rule of the gate-controlled reservoirs during the flooding period.

AB Snow melt and refreeze events are important determinants of spring runoff timing, and snowpack stratigraphy and metamorphism. Previous studies have established the utility of differences between twice-daily passive microwave brightness temperature (T-b) observations, called the diurnal amplitude variation (DAV), for identifying snow melt and refreeze. Liquid water in snow leads to a large increase in microwave emissivity compared to a completely frozen snowpack, so phase changes from nighttime freezing and daytime melting result in high DAV values. However, the physical temperature of the land surface also contributes to brightness temperature, independent of the phase of water. Thus, it is important to account for physical temperature change when using T-b differences to detect snow melt and refreeze. Here, we use near-surface air temperature (T-a) to approximate the physical temperature of the land surface and compare diurnal T-b changes (Delta T-b ) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System satellite instrument to coincident T-a changes. We find that an approximately linear relationship exists between Delta T-b and Delta T-a for frozen snow and fit this relationship using modal linear regression. Melt and refreeze events are identified as large positive and negative excursions from the regression line, respectively. We demonstrate the method in the Northern Great Plains, USA, and evaluate it using ground-based data from Senator Beck Basin Study Area, Colorado, USA. Melt and refreeze events identified from satellite observations mostly occur after the annual peak snow accumulation and are consistent with snow temperature and snowpack energy balance observations at Senator Beck Basin.

TI Soil seal formation and its effect on infiltration: Uniform versus
   nonuniform seal approximation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODELING INFILTRATION; WATER REGIME; SURFACE; DYNAMICS
AB Two different approaches to the solution of the problem of flow through the dynamic stage of seal formation as well as through soil with a fully developed seal are studied. The first approach considers the disturbed seal layer and the undisturbed soil underneath as a continuous nonuniform soil profile. The second replaces the nonuniform seal by a uniform equivalent layer, thereby generating a homogeneous two-layer flow system. The depth-dependent properties of the nonuniform seal are expressed in terms of the exponential model of Mualem and Assouline [1989]. The dynamics of seal formation are modeled according to Assouline and Mualem [1997]. During the first rainfall on an undisturbed soil profile, when the seal layer is formed, the application of the first or the second approach has only a minor effect on the calculated infiltration curves. However, there is a significant difference between the two solutions regarding the dynamic changes of the water content in the soil surface and, consequently, within the seal layer. During subsequent rainfalls on a sealed soil profile, when the seal layer is completely developed, the differences between the two ways of accounting For the seal layer become evident, and their effects on the infiltration curve are much more significant. Representing the seal as an equivalent uniform layer increases the pending time and the infiltration rates at the early stage of the process. The amplitude of these effects is increased when the rainfall rate is higher and the seal layer is thicker. An important result is that the relationship between infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration is unique in the case of a completely developed seal and when the seal is considered as a nonuniform layer. However, this relationship is not unique during seal formation, independent of the approach applied to represent the seal layer.

AB The paper reports an experimental study of the flow structure over an immobile gravel bed in open channel at intermediate submergence, with particular focus on the near-bed region. The experiments consisted of velocity measurements using three-component (stereoscopic) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in near-bed horizontal plane and two-component PIV in three vertical planes that covered three distinctly different hydraulic scenarios where the ratio of flow depth to roughness height (i.e., relative submergence) changes from 7.5 to 10.8. Detailed velocity measurements were supplemented with fine-scale bed elevation data obtained with a laser scanner. The data revealed longitudinal low-momentum and high-momentum "strips'' in the time-averaged velocity field, likely induced by secondary currents. This depth-scale pattern was superimposed with particle-scale patches of flow heterogeneity induced by gravel particle protrusions. A similar picture emerged when considering second-order velocity moments. The interaction between the flow field and gravel-bed protrusions is assessed using cross correlations of velocity components and bed elevations in a horizontal plane just above gravel particle crests. The cross correlations suggest that upward and downward fluid motions are mainly associated with upstream-facing and lee sides of particles, respectively. Results also show that the relative submergence affects the turbulence intensity profiles for vertical velocity over the whole flow depth, while only a weak effect, limited to the near-bed region, is noticed for streamwise velocity component. The approximation of mean velocity profiles with a logarithmic formula reveals that log-profile parameters depend on relative submergence, highlighting inapplicability of a conventional "universal'' logarithmic law for gravel-bed flows with intermediate submergence.

ID FREQUENCY; FRAMEWORK; RIVER
AB River discharge and nutrient measurements are subject to aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In this study, we present a novel method for estimating these uncertainties in colocated discharge and phosphorus (P) measurements. The "voting point"-based method constrains the derived stage-discharge rating curve both on the fit to available gaugings and to the catchment water balance. This helps reduce the uncertainty beyond the range of available gaugings and during out of bank situations. In the example presented here, for the top 5% of flows, uncertainties are shown to be 139% using a traditional power law fit, compared with 40% when using our updated "voting point" method. Furthermore, the method is extended to in situ and lab analysed nutrient concentration data pairings, with lower uncertainties (81%) shown for high concentrations (top 5%) than when a traditional regression is applied (102%). Overall, for both discharge and nutrient data, the method presented goes some way to accounting for epistemic uncertainties associated with nonstationary physical characteristics of the monitoring site.

AB Runoff events play an important role in nitrate export from catchments, but the variability of export patterns between events and catchments is high and the dominant drivers remain difficult to disentangle. Here, we rigorously asses if detailed knowledge on runoff event characteristics can help to explain this variability. To this end, we conducted a long-term (1955-2018) event classification using hydro-meteorological data, including rainfall characteristics, soil moisture and snowmelt, in six neighboring mesoscale catchments with contrasting land use. We related these event characteristics to nitrate export patterns from high-frequency nitrate concentration monitoring (2013-2017) using concentration-discharge (CQ) relationships. Our results show that low-magnitude rainfall-induced events with dry antecedent conditions exported lowest nitrate concentrations and loads but exhibited highly variable CQ relationships. We explain this by a low fraction of active flow paths, revealing the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate sources within the catchments and by an increased impact of biogeochemical retention processes. In contrast, high-magnitude rainfall or snowmelt-induced events exported highest nitrate concentrations and loads and converged to similar chemostatic export patterns across all catchments, without exhibiting source limitation. We explain these homogeneous export patterns by high catchment wetness that activated a high number of flow paths and by higher nitrate availability during high-flow seasons. Long-term hydro-meteorological data indicated an increased number of events with dry antecedent conditions in summer and a decreased number of snow-influenced events. These trends will likely continue and cause increased nitrate concentration variability during low-flow seasons and changes in the timing of nitrate export peaks during high-flow seasons.

TI Self-organizing nonlinear output (SONO): A neural network suitable for
   cloud patch-based rainfall estimation at small scales
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

AB Accurate measurement of rainfall distribution at various spatial and temporal scales is crucial for hydrological modeling and water resources management. In the literature of satellite rainfall estimation, many efforts have been made to calibrate a statistical relationship (including threshold, linear, or nonlinear) between cloud infrared (IR) brightness temperatures and surface rain rates (RR). In this study, an automated neural network for cloud patch-based rainfall estimation, entitled self-organizing nonlinear output (SONO) model, is developed to account for the high variability of cloud-rainfall processes at geostationary scales (i. e., 4 km and every 30 min). Instead of calibrating only one IR-RR function for all clouds the SONO classifies varied cloud patches into different clusters and then searches a nonlinear IR-RR mapping function for each cluster. This designed feature enables SONO to generate various rain rates at a given brightness temperature and variable rain/no-rain IR thresholds for different cloud types, which overcomes the one-to-one mapping limitation of a single statistical IR-RR function for the full spectrum of cloud-rainfall conditions. In addition, the computational and modeling strengths of neural network enable SONO to cope with the nonlinearity of cloud-rainfall relationships by fusing multisource data sets. Evaluated at various temporal and spatial scales, SONO shows improvements of estimation accuracy, both in rain intensity and in detection of rain/no-rain pixels. Further examination of the SONO adaptability demonstrates its potentiality as an operational satellite rainfall estimation system that uses the passive microwave rainfall observations from low-orbiting satellites to adjust the IR-based rainfall estimates at the resolution of geostationary satellites.

AB Historically, paired watershed studies have been used to quantify the hydrological effects of land use and management practices by concurrently monitoring 2 similar watersheds during calibration (pretreatment) and post-treatment periods. This study characterizes seasonal water table and flow response to rainfall during the calibration period and tests a change detection technique of moving sums of recursive residuals (MOSUM) to select calibration periods for each control-treatment watershed pair when the regression coefficients for daily water table elevation were most stable to minimize regression model uncertainty. The control and treatment watersheds were 1 watershed of 3-4-year-old intensely managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) with natural understory, 1 watershed of 3-4-year-old loblolly pine intercropped with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), 1 watershed of 14-15-year-old thinned loblolly pine with natural understory (control), and 1 watershed of switchgrass only. The study period spanned from 2009 to 2012. Silvicultural operational practices during this period acted as external factors, potentially shifting hydrologic calibration relationships between control and treatment watersheds. MOSUM results indicated significant changes in regression parameters due to silvicultural operations and were used to identify stable relationships for water table elevation. None of the calibration relationships developed using this method were significantly different from the classical calibration relationship based on published historical data. We attribute that to the similarity of historical and 2010-2012 leaf area index on control and treatment watersheds as moderated by the emergent vegetation. Although the MOSUM approach does not eliminate the need for true calibration data or replace the classic paired watershed approach, our results show that it may be an effective alternative approach when true data are unavailable, as it minimizes the impacts of external disturbances other than the treatment of interest.

AB A continuous time random walk particle tracking (CTRW-PT) method was employed to model flow cell experiments that measured transport of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in a reactive porous medium. The experiments involved a water-saturated medium containing negatively charged, polyacrylamide beads, resembling many natural soils and aquifer materials, and having the same refraction index as water. Negatively and positively charged ENPs were injected into a uniform flow field in a 3-D horizontal flow cell, and the spatial and temporal concentrations of the evolving ENP plumes were obtained via image analysis. As a benchmark, and to calibrate the model, Congo red tracer was employed in 1-D column and 3-D flow cell experiments, containing the same beads. Negatively charged Au and Ag ENPs demonstrated migration patterns resembling those of the tracer but were slightly more dispersive; the transport was well represented by the CTRW-PT model. In contrast, positively charged AgNPs displayed an unusual behavior: establishment of an initial plume of essentially immobilized ENPs, followed by development of a secondary, freely migrating plume. The mobile plume was found to contain ENPs that, with aging, exhibited aggregation and charge inversion, becoming negatively charged and mobile. In this case, the CTRW-PT model was modified to include a probabilistic law for particle immobilization, to account for the decreasing tendency (over distance and time) of the positively charged AgNPs to attach to the porous medium. The agreement between experimental results and modeling suggests that the CTRW-PT framework can account for the non-Fickian and surface-charge-dependent transport and aging exhibited by ENPs in porous media.

AB The no-slip boundary condition has usually been assumed to hold for the Reynolds equations (local cubic law) for fluid flow through rough-walled fractures. However, its validity for non-wetting fluid flow, such as prevails in fractured oil reservoirs, has been questioned. A series of experiments with a rough-walled fracture with mean aperture of 760 mu m finds a higher flow rate for non-wetting fluid than wetting fluid. A modified Reynolds equation with a slip boundary condition is derived for non-wetting fluid flow through rough-walled fractures. Comparison of the modified Reynolds equation predictions with experimental results confirms that slip was a plausible explanation for a higher flow rate. The amount by which the flow rate for non-wetting fluids exceeds that for wetting fluids is found to depend highly on, and increase with, the degree to which the flowing fluid was non-wetted to thin immobile films on the surfaces. Numerical studies using the modified Reynolds equation indicate that the flow rate of non-wetting fluid became higher than that of wetting fluid as the roughness of the fracture increases. As the aperture becomes smaller, the flow rate ratio of non-wetting fluid to wetting fluid becomes large, leading to the endpoint relative permeability for the non-wetting fluid to exceed 1. The experimental and numerical studies clearly show that as the aperture of the fracture became less than a few hundred microns, the modified Reynolds equation with slip boundary conditions provides a better model for flow of a non-wetting fluid through rough-walled fractures.

AB The kinetic energy (KE) of rainfall is an important parameter in estimating the rainfall erosivity factor, an essential parameter in the soil erosion equation. The global precipitation measurement dual-frequency precipitation radar (GPM DPR) can provide radar reflectivity at Ku-and Ka-band frequencies (Zku and Zka), rainfall rate (I, mm h(-1)), and drop size distribution parameters (mass-weighed mean diameter: D-m in mm and normalized intercept parameter: log(10)N(w), N-w in m(-3) mm(-1)). The empirical relations between rainfall KE and GPM DPR parameters (KEtime-I, KEmm-D-m, KEtime-Z(ku), and KEtime-Z(ka) relations) can allow us to estimate the KE at the locations where there are no ground-based measurements. In the present work, long-term measurements of impact type disdrometers located at three different locations (Zhongli, Feitsui, and Hsiayun) in north Taiwan are used to collect the raindrop size distribution (RSD) information of six seasons (spring, mei-yu, summer, autumn, winter, and typhoon). Measured RSDs in six seasons are used to estimate the rainfall intensity, mass-weighted mean diameter, rainfall KE flux (KEtime, J m(-2) h(-1)), KE content (KEmm, J m(-2) mm(-1)), radar reflectivity at Ku-and Ka-band frequencies. For the first time, present study establish and validate the rainfall KE functional relationships with GPM DPR data products (KEtime-I, KEmm-D-m, KEtime-Z(ku), and KEtime-Zka relations). The empirical relations between rainfall KE and GPM DPR parameters (I, Dm, Zku, and Zka) are established for six seasons of each disdrometer location. Derived KE relations did not show any spatial disparity for a given season, especially the KEmm-D-m, KEtime-Z(ku), and KEtime-Z(ka) relations. On the other hand, a clear seasonal differences in the rainfall KE relations are noticed at each observational site. The established relations showed reasonable agreement in estimating the KE from the GPM DPR. However, in determining the KE, the KEmm-D-m relation showed outperformance over the remaining three relations (KE(tim)e-I, KEtime-Z(ku), and KEtime-Z(ka) relations).

AB Models of microbial dynamics coupled to solute transport in aquifers typically require the introduction of a bacterial capacity term to prevent excessive microbial growth close to substrate-injection boundaries. The factors controlling this carrying capacity, however, are not fully understood. In this study, we propose that grazers or bacteriophages may control the density of bacterial biomass in continuously fed porous media. We conceptualize the flow-through porous medium as a series of retentostats, in which the dissolved substrate is advected with water flow whereas the biomasses of bacteria and grazers are considered essentially immobile. We first model a single retentostat with Monod kinetics of bacterial growth and a second-order grazing law, which shows that the system oscillates but approaches a stable steady state with nonzero concentrations of substrate, bacteria, and grazers. The steady state concentration of the bacteria biomass is independent of the substrate concentration in the inflow. When coupling several retentostats in a series to mimic a groundwater column, the steady state bacteria concentrations thus remain at a constant level over a significant travel distance. The one-dimensional reactive transport model also accounts for substrate dispersion and a random walk of grazers influenced by the bacteria concentration. These dispersive-diffusive terms affect the oscillations until steady state is reached, but hardly the steady state value itself. We conclude that grazing, or infection by bacteriophages, is a possible explanation of the maximum biomass concentration frequently needed in bioreactive transport models. Its value depends on parameters related to the grazers or bacteriophages and is independent of bacterial growth parameters or substrate concentration, provided that there is enough substrate to sustain bacteria and grazers.

ID POROUS-MEDIA
AB On the basis of the conservation of momentum for pore water flow, a new relation between drag and driving forces is developed for flow within a saturated aquifer. Such a relation inherently includes inertial terms of both the solid phase and the fluid phase that play an important role under dynamic conditions (e.g., earthquakes) and under some transient conditions (e.g., aquifer pumping). For laminar flow of a fluid relative to the skeletal frame a new relation is reached by simplification from the more general case. The Darcy-Gersevanov law and Darcy's law are found to be special cases that result from further simplifications.

AB Water markets increasingly facilitate adaptation to water scarcity, but transaction costs can be barriers to expanded water marketing, particularly under water rights law in the western United States. However, transaction costs are rarely measured, and existing research commonly overlooks how transaction costs differ across individual water transfers and uncertainty in those costs. We collected hundreds of estimates of procedural transaction costs-costs incurred by transfer proponents for legal and hydrologic experts-by surveying 100 water professionals in the state of Colorado. There, water markets are among the most active in the United States, convey perhaps the most clearly defined private property rights of any state, and, unique to Colorado, require approval from specialized water courts. We elicited costs for water transfers with differing physical and legal characteristics, and we elicited separate assessments of (i) probabilities of legal outcomes for water transfers and (ii) transaction costs conditional on those outcomes. Then, we estimated expected transaction costs with a statistical model that combines (i) with (ii). The model reveals systematic differences in transaction costs, with scale economies and higher transaction costs for water-scarce regions, senior water rights, and higher-conflict legal outcomes. It also shows substantial transaction cost uncertainty, which itself can discourage trading. Our novel survey and estimation procedure develops a replicable approach for measuring transaction cost heterogeneity and uncertainty. Additionally, qualitative survey data we collected indicate transaction costs have increased over time due to growing competition for scarce water and that, despite high transaction costs, specialized water courts offer unique benefits.
   Key Points
   Water market transaction costs are uncertain, and this uncertainty depends upon legal procedures for water rights transfers Transaction costs are higher in water-scarce regions, for higher-conflict transfers, and for senior water rights, and show scale economies Transaction costs have grown over time due to increased competition for scarce water and more complex water rights operations

AB Floodplain channels are important components of river-floodplain systems and are known to play a key role in hydrodynamic exchange and sediment transport. The Amazon floodplain exhibits complex networks of these channels, and despite their potential importance to this globally important wetland system, these floodplain channels are relatively unstudied. The research presented here is the first systematic and detailed study of the network and morphologic characteristics of a large number of these channels in the middle reach of the central Amazon River using analysis of data derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM vertical bar ) mosaic and field survey. Our findings show that the channels are ubiquitous, their width varies widely, and some of their characteristics can be fitted using power laws, potentially much like the self-similar or fractal-like behavior hypothesized for other types of fluvial networks. In all, 96% of the floodplain channels are not wide enough to be represented well, or at all, in the similar to 90 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. Channel depths are tied closely to the local amplitude of the passing main river flood wave (p value of 0.75), except where there are local runoff inputs, which results in substantially deeper channels which provide preferential flow paths across the floodplain. Channel networks imply that areas of the floodplain function for large parts of the flood cycle as separate hydrogeomorphic land units, here termed floodplain hydrological units (FHUs). These hypothesized FHUs also have distinct spatial and pattern characteristics, and it is suggested here that their differences could provide the beginnings of a framework for understanding the detailed hydrodynamics of the floodplain. In particular, different types of FHUs have differences in flood water source, which will have important implications for biogeochemical studies of the wetlands.

TI Genetic programming approach for flood routing in natural channels

DT Article
DE Muskingum method; flood routing; genetic programming; genetic algorithm
ID PARAMETER-ESTIMATION
AB In recognition of the rion-linear relationship between storage and discharge existing in most river systems, non-linear forms of the Muskingum model have been proposed, together with methods to calibrate the model parameters. However, most studies have focused only on routing a typical hypothetical flood hydrograph characterized by a single peak. In this study, we demonstrate that the storage-discharge relationship adopted for the non-linear Muskingum model is not adequate for routing flood hydrographs in natural channels, which are often characterized by multiple peaks. As an alternative, an evolutionary algorithm-based modelling approach, i.e. genetic programming (GP), is proposed, which is found to route complex flood hydrographs accurately. The proposed method is applied for constructing a routing model for a channel reach along the Walla Walla River, USA. The GP model performs extremely well with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.73 m(3) s(-1) as against an RMSE of 3.26 m(3) s(-1) for routing the multi-peaked hydrograph. The advantage of GP lies in the fact that, unlike other models, it establishes the routing relationship in an easy and simple mathematical form. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI The Maude Weir sediments. 2. Effect of weir storage on magnetic
   properties and associated chemistry
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETISM; SOILS
AB The magnetic properties of river sediments have been used to determine the sources of sediments. However, changes in magnetic properties during transport and sedimentation may occur. This paper examines the effect of reduction on the magnetic properties of sediments from the Maude Weir, NSW. For all sediment samples from the Maude Weir? for both cores and grab samples, there was an inverse relationship between particle size and concentration of magnetic minerals,as measured by magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic grain size, as measured by the ratio SIRM/chi, declined through the particle size range. This was attributed to dissolution of the finer grains of the magnetic minerals owing to the chemically reduced state of the sediments. As reducing conditions can alter both the concentration and magnetic grain size of sediments, it is important that the state of chemical reduction be considered when using mineral magnetism as a source tracer for dam sediments. There was a good relationship between total Fe and magnetic susceptibility and total phosphorus. The relationships mentioned above applied to all sediment samples and locations, even though there was substantial variation in the particle size distribution of the samples.

AB Equations based on surface renewal (SR) analysis to estimate the sensible heat flux (H) require as input the mean ramp amplitude and period observed in the ramp-like pattern of the air temperature measured at high frequency. A SR-based method to estimate sensible heat flux (HSR-LST) requiring only low-frequency measurements of the air temperature, horizontal mean wind speed, and land-surface temperature as input was derived and tested under unstable conditions over a heterogeneous canopy (olive grove). HSR-LST assumes that the mean ramp amplitude can be inferred from the difference between land-surface temperature and mean air temperature through a linear relationship and that the ramp frequency is related to a wind shear scale characteristic of the canopy flow. The land-surface temperature was retrieved by integrating in situ sensing measures of thermal infrared energy emitted by the surface. The performance of HSR-LST was analyzed against flux tower measurements collected at two heights (close to and well above the canopy top). Crucial parameters involved in HSR-LST, which define the above mentioned linear relationship, were explained using the canopy height and the land surface temperature observed at sunrise and sunset. Although the olive grove can behave as either an isothermal or anisothermal surface, HSR-LST performed close to H measured using the eddy covariance and the Bowen ratio energy balance methods. Root mean square differences between HSR-LST and measured H were of about 55 W m(-2). Thus, by using multitemporal thermal acquisitions, HSR-LST appears to bypass inconsistency between land surface temperature and the mean aerodynamic temperature. The one-source bulk transfer formulation for estimating H performed reliable after calibration against the eddy covariance method. After calibration, the latter performed similar to the proposed SR-LST method.

AB The total travel distance and the hydraulic conductivity in steady-state groundwater flow systems are modeled with asymmetric gamma distribution functions. The ratio of the total travel distance over the hydraulic conductivity, scaled by a factor involving the hydraulic gradient and the aquifer porosity, equals the residence time of groundwater. The residence time measures the period elapsed between recharge and discharge of groundwater from an aquifer flow system. The residence time is a random variable whose probability density function (p.d.f.) is determined by those of the total travel distance and the hydraulic conductivity. The p.d.f. of the residence time was derived and from that, applying basic mass-balance considerations, followed that of the groundwater age. The age is the time elapsed since the recharge of groundwater in transit through an aquifer flow system. It is shown that the p.d.f.s of the residence time and the groundwater age are related by a first-order, linear, differential equation. The cumulative distribution functions of the residence time and the groundwater age and their first and second moments are also derived, and so is the output concentration of a solute that enters a steady-state groundwater flow system dissolved in recharge. A computational example illustrates the advantage of treating the residence time and the groundwater age statistically and constraining them with Darcy's law and mass-balance principles. Solute output shows a complex structure with stable and radioactive solutes in deceptively simple steady-state groundwater flow regimes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study solute transport in a periodic channel with a sinusoidal wavy boundary when inertial flow effects are sufficiently large to be important, but do not give rise to turbulence. This configuration and setup are known to result in large recirculation zones that can act as traps for solutes; these traps can significantly affect dispersion of the solute as it moves through the domain. Previous studies have considered the effect of inertia on asymptotic dispersion in such geometries. Here we develop an effective spatial Markov model that aims to describe transport all the way from preasymptotic to asymptotic times. In particular we demonstrate that correlation effects must be included in such an effective model when Peclet numbers are larger than O(100) in order to reliably predict observed breakthrough curves and the temporal evolution of second centered moments. For smaller Peclet numbers correlation effects, while present, are weak and do not appear to play a significant role. For many systems of practical interest, if Reynolds numbers are large, it may be typical that Peclet numbers are large also given that Schmidt numbers for typical fluids and solutes can vary between 1 and 500. This suggests that when Reynolds numbers are large, any effective theories of transport should incorporate correlation as part of the upscaling procedure, which many conventional approaches currently do not do. We define a novel parameter to quantify the importance of this correlation. Next, using the theory of CTRWs we explain a to date unexplained phenomenon of why dispersion coefficients for a fixed Peclet number increase with increasing Reynolds number, but saturate above a certain value. Finally we also demonstrate that effective preasymptotic models that do not adequately account for velocity correlations will also not predict asymptotic dispersion coefficients correctly.

ID PARTIALLY PENETRATING WELL; UNCONFINED AQUIFERS; TIME
AB An analytical solution is presented for capture and catchment zones of a well located on a groundwater divide in a recharged aquifer. The analytical solution is derived for a homogeneous, isotropic, and uniformly thick leaky aquifer. It is shown that streamlines and well-catchment area have elongated shapes tending to infinity along the groundwater divide, and do not depend on any aquifer property, but only on the ratio of the well-pumping rate and aquifer recharge flux. Isochrones delineating capture zones also depend on the mean residence time of the groundwater, which is independent of the well-pumping rate. The capture and catchment zones differ significantly in both size and shape from the classical theory that ignores recharge. In particular, the catchment zone is wider and has a finite extent.

The key stochastic input Variables are intrinsic permeability, k, and the soil grain size distribution index, alpha. Three different stochastic combinations of these two input parameters were considered in the analysis. The spectral/perturbation approach was used to develop closed-form expressions to describe stochastic variability of key output processes, such as capillary and individual phase pressures. The second paper of this two-part series [Abdin and Kaluarachchi, this issue] will discuss the applicability and the validity of the spectral/perturbation technique to study the stochastic behavior of three-phase flow using numerical simulations.

AB Conceptual rainfall-runoff models have traditionally been applied without paying much attention to numerical errors induced by temporal integration of water balance dynamics. Reliance on first-order, explicit, fixed-step integration methods leads to computationally cheap simulation models that are easy to implement. Computational speed is especially desirable for estimating parameter and predictive uncertainty using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Confirming earlier work of Kavetski et al. (2003), we show here that the computational speed of first-order, explicit, fixed-step integration methods comes at a cost: for a case study with a spatially lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model, it introduces artificial bimodality in the marginal posterior parameter distributions, which is not present in numerically accurate implementations of the same model. The resulting effects on MCMC simulation include (1) inconsistent estimates of posterior parameter and predictive distributions, (2) poor performance and slow convergence of the MCMC algorithm, and (3) unreliable convergence diagnosis using the Gelman-Rubin statistic. We studied several alternative numerical implementations to remedy these problems, including various adaptive-step finite difference schemes and an operator splitting method. Our results show that adaptive-step, second-order methods, based on either explicit finite differencing or operator splitting with analytical integration, provide the best alternative for accurate and efficient MCMC simulation. Fixed-step or adaptive-step implicit methods may also be used for increased accuracy, but they cannot match the efficiency of adaptive-step explicit finite differencing or operator splitting. Of the latter two, explicit finite differencing is more generally applicable and is preferred if the individual hydrologic flux laws cannot be integrated analytically, as the splitting method then loses its advantage.

ID CATCHMENTS
AB Models based on gridded maps provide a simple and flexible way of modelling hydrological processes at the catchment scale. Such a model is described for humid temperate regions where no regional aquifer is present. The catchment is represented by a grid of 50 x 50 m interconnected cells. These are characterized by the depth and porosity of the soil layer, the slope and direction of drainage, the possible presence of a stretch of river and the presence or absence of forest canopy. Three types of hydrological processes are modelled: throughflow (described by a modified version of Darcy's law); channel how (described by Manning's equation); and the interception-evaporation process as dependent on the presence or absence of forest canopy. The model predicts the hydrograph at the catchment outlet and the location of rivers in the catchment. These are compared with the observed river network, thus providing an additional means of assessing the model. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the reconstructed velocity field particles were deployed and tracked numerically in a Lagrangian way.

DE advection; snow melt; sensible heat; snow patches
AB In the calculation of the melting of a patchy snow cover, the energy advected from the adjacent bare soil to the snow surface is an important consideration. The quantity or rate of energy advected depends on the fetches and sizes of snow and bare ground patches. Any successful method to estimate advection will necessarily require the incorporation of relationships describing the same. Complex boundary-layer methods require detailed spatial knowledge of the patch sizes, wind direction and fetch distances, and are computationally intensive. A physically based approach that can be spatially applied using distributions of snow patch geometry is required.
   This paper presents a new approach, in which boundary-layer integration is used to provide a means of calculating the amount of energy removed by the snow patch surface as warmer air moves over it. The method is reduced to a simple parametric form, and the relationships describing the coefficients required for its application are developed.
   The applicability of this new approach is discussed in light of the fractal nature of snow patches, the relationship between the individual patch length and area, and the distribution of patch sizes as they develop and disappear on the landscape.

AB The quantification of timescales associated with the movement of the seawater-freshwater interface is useful for developing effective management strategies for controlling seawater intrusion (SWI). In this study, for the first time, we derive an explicit analytical solution for the timescales of SWI and seawater retreat (SWR) in a confined, homogeneous coastal aquifer system under the quasi-steady assumption, based on a classical sharp-interface solution for approximating freshwater outflow rates into the sea. The flow continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface are identified as two primary mechanisms governing timescales of the interface movement driven by an abrupt change in discharge rates or hydraulic heads at the inland boundary. Through theoretical analysis, we quantified the dependence of interface-movement timescales on porosity, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, aquifer length, density ratio, and boundary conditions. Predictions from the analytical solution closely agreed with those from numerical simulations. In addition, we define a temporal asymmetry index ( the ratio of the SWI timescale to the SWR timescale) to represent the resilience of the coastal aquifer in response to SWI. The developed analytical solutions provide a simple tool for the quick assessment of SWI and SWR timescales and reveal that the temporal asymmetry between SWI and SWR mainly relies on the initial and final values of the freshwater flux at the inland boundary, and is weakly affected by aquifer parameters. Furthermore, we theoretically examined the log-linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary, and found that the relationship may be approximated by two linear functions with a slope of -2 and -1 for large changes at the boundary flux for SWI and SWR, respectively.

AB Multivariate extreme value models are a fundamental tool in order to assess potentially dangerous events. The target of this paper is two-fold. On the one hand we outline how, exploiting recent theoretical developments in the theory of copulas, new multivariate extreme value distributions can be easily constructed; in particular, we show how a suitable number of parameters can be introduced, a feature not shared by traditional extreme value models. On the other hand, we introduce a proper new definition of multivariate return period and show the differences with (and the advantages over) the definition presently used in literature. An illustration involving flood data is presented and discussed, and a generalization of the well-known multivariate logistic Gumbel model is also given.

AB A novel two-dimensional, physically based model of soil erosion and sediment transport coupled to models of hydrological and overland flow processes has been developed. The Hairsine-Rose formulation of erosion and deposition processes is used to account for size-selective sediment transport and differentiate bed material into original and deposited soil layers. The formulation is integrated within the framework of the hydrologic and hydrodynamic model tRIBS-OFM, Triangulated irregular network-based, Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator-Overland Flow Model. The integrated model explicitly couples the hydrodynamic formulation with the advection-dominated transport equations for sediment of multiple particle sizes. To solve the system of equations including both the Saint-Venant and the Hairsine-Rose equations, the finite volume method is employed based on Roe's approximate Riemann solver on an unstructured grid. The formulation yields space-time dynamics of flow, erosion, and sediment transport at fine scale. The integrated model has been successfully verified with analytical solutions and empirical data for two benchmark cases. Sensitivity tests to grid resolution and the number of used particle sizes have been carried out. The model has been validated at the catchment scale for the Lucky Hills watershed located in southeastern Arizona, USA, using 10 events for which catchment-scale streamflow and sediment yield data were available. Since the model is based on physical laws and explicitly uses multiple types of watershed information, satisfactory results were obtained. The spatial output has been analyzed and the driving role of topography in erosion processes has been discussed. It is expected that the integrated formulation of the model has the promise to reduce uncertainties associated with typical parameterizations of flow and erosion processes. A potential for more credible modeling of earth-surface processes is thus anticipated.

AB Climate change's effects on water resources have been some of the first realities of ecological change in the Anthropocene, forcing climate change adaptation efforts even as the international community seeks to mitigate climate change. Water law has thus become one vehicle of climate change adaptation. Legal research into the intersections between climate change and water law in the United States must contend with the facts that: (a) climate change affects different parts of this large country differently; and (b) U.S. water law is itself a complicated subject, with each state having its own laws for surface water and groundwater and the federal government playing a significant role in interstate and international waters, in building and managing large water infrastructure, and in creating water rights for Native American tribes and other federal reservations. Within this complexity, legal research to date has tended to focus on the law governing surface water in the American West, enumerating various problems with the prior appropriation doctrine as the West grows hotter and drier and offering multiple suggestions to increase legal flexibility so that western water can be re-allocated to reflect changing social-ecological realities. These suggestions extend to new, more comprehensive, and more adaptive water governance approaches. Far less legal scholarship has focused on eastern riparian rights, the various groundwater doctrines at play in the United States, or the increasing role of tribes in managing water resources, but these areas warrant future attention.

AB The reservoir properties of carbonate rocks are controlled by both deposition and diagenesis. The latter includes the early precipitation of calcite cements, which can exert a strong control on the evolution of subsequent diagenetic pathways. We quantify the impact of early marine cement growth in grainstones on evolving pore space by examining trends in the relationship between cementation and permeability using a 3D process-based model (Calcite3D). The model assumes varying proportions of polycrystalline and monocrystalline grain types, upon which we grow isopachous and syntaxial calcite cement types, respectively. We model two syntaxial cement shapes, compact and elongated, that approximate the geometries of typical rhombohedral calcite forms.
   Results demonstrate the effect of cement competition: an increasing proportion of monocrystalline grains creates stronger competition and a reduction in the impact of individual grains on final calcite cement volume and porosity. Isopachous cement is effective in closing pore throats and limiting permeability. We also show that the impact of syntaxial cement on porosity occlusion and therefore flow is highly dependent on monocrystalline grain location and the orientation of crystal axes. This demonstrates the importance of diagenetic overprint in controlling the evolution of rock properties, but also that this process can be essentially random. We also show that diagenesis alone can create notable heterogeneity in the permeability of carbonates.
   While Calcite3D is successful in modelling realistic changes in cement volumes and pore space morphology, modelled permeabilities (0.01-30D) are above the range reported in reservoir grainstones due to the very high permeability of the initial synthetic sediment deposit (58.9D). Poroperm data generated by Calcite3D, however, exhibits a linear relationship between the logarithms of porosity and permeability with a high coefficient of determination, as observed in natural media.

AB We study the spatial structure of soil moisture fields within savanna ecosystems, whose persistence is vital because it is the driver of the entire ecological structure and function. These include changes in the physical and biogeochemical conditions of the landscape, affecting vegetation state, soil composition, water fluxes, and solar radiation. We focus on computations of the probabilistic structure of islands of soil moisture, known empirically to be related to that of tree clusters, defined as crossing properties of simulated soil moisture fields. Rainfall is modelled via Cox-Isham space-time fields endowed with characteristic scales. Results show that clusters of soil moisture islands are characterized by robust scale-free structures in the region of a phase transition whose order parameter depends on mean soil moisture. Signatures of this fractal structure are well-defined power laws of size distributions of soil moisture clusters; their perimeters-vs-area relations; variance-vsarea of the fields. These characteristics allow for the estimation of the fractal dimension of the field, and its Hurst coefficient. From the general covariance equation of a fractal field, spatial simulations are possible because its mean and variance are known from the probabilistic structure of soil moisture at a point. Our results identify the statistics of hotspots of microbial activity deduced from proper moisture islands, unattainable otherwise, and thus may guide the design of field and remote observations. The critical order parameter characterizing the phase transition establishes where the fractal structure of soil moisture fields exists as a function of the climatic drivers, and the thresholds reflecting where vegetation survives in the field. An example of application of the phase transition diagram presented here is carried out with reference to the Nylsvley savanna in South Africa.

AB Theories of osmosis in groundwater flow are increasingly used to explain anomalies of salinity in clayey environments. However, predictive modelling through mathematical analysis can hardly be found in literature. In this paper, a model of chemical osmosis based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is used to predict the evolution of pressure and salinity in a clay membrane. Analysis of this model reveals simplifications that hold for specific situations. Two experiments from literature serve to show that the analytical modelling solution agrees with numerical and experimental results. Moreover, it is shown that the commonly applied Boussinesq approximation necessarily does not hold when osmosis is involved. Indeed, the clay system must be able to store the excess flow of water induced by osmosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme rainfall is a critical "agent" driving flash floods in urban areas. In rainfall frequency analysis (RFA), however, storms are usually assumed to be uniform in space and fixed in time. Spatially and temporally uniform design storms and area reduction factors are oftentimes used in conjunction with RFA results in engineering practice for infrastructure design and planning. The consequences of such assumptions are poorly understood. This study examines how spatiotemporal rainfall heterogeneity impacts RFA, using a newly-introduced bivariate framework consisting of copula theory and stochastic storm transposition (SST). A large number of regionally -extreme storms with specific features-rainfall depth, duration, intensity, and level of intra-storm spatial organization-were collected. Rainfall intensity-durationfrequency (IDF) estimates exhibiting these bivariate features were then generated by synthesizing long records of rainfall via SST. The results show that dependencies exist among spatiotemporal storm characteristics. Bivariate frequency results exhibit smaller uncertainties but more complex physical meanings that the results from conventional methods. In particular, the highly spatially -organized storms play a leading role in frequency estimates.

AB Incorporation of channel network information in streamflow modelling is a well-accepted scientific practice now. In particular, channel network morphology based instantaneous unit hydrographs (IUHs) are widely used for modelling of flood response. However, very few attempts have been made so far to use channel networks for modelling total flow, not just flood flow. In this study, total flow is partitioned into pure surface flow (PSF) and mixed surface-subsurface flow (MSSF), which are then modelled separately by constructing channel network morphology based IUHs. For modelling total flow, the combined IUH is then obtained by introducing a splitting parameter that represents the relative proportions of PSF and MSSF. We compare the performance of the proposed geomorphology based routing structure and a variant with a commonly used routing structure- two linear reservoirs in parallel. The three routing structures are then integrated with a well-known water balance model to perform continuous streamflow modeling. We perform inter-model comparison quantitatively by considering eight performance metrics within a multi-objective framework as well as qualitatively by observing the simulated storage-discharge relationships. By performing the inter-model comparison for 71 catchments across the US, we find that the geomorphology based models perform better than the linear model for low flow related metrics. They are also better at capturing non-linear and dynamic relationship between catchment water storage and discharge. The geomorphology based models perform particularly well in northeastern and midwestern US, while no such region of dominance emerges for the linear routing based model. Results also indicate the possibility of using the proposed models to capture the dominant flow generation processes in a basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge concerning the redox potential (Eh) conditions in the vadose zone of a soil aquifer treatment (SAT) system constitutes valuable information for assessing water quality and operational efficiency. The complex nature of Eh conditions in SAT limits the ability to predict and quantify them using detailed models. Alter-natively, data-driven models can be used for predictions and relationship analysis. Hourly measurements of Eh, volumetric water content (theta), soil temperature (T), and gaseous oxygen (O2) were obtained at multiple depths of a SAT vadose zone. A correlation analysis showed that O2 correlated with Eh for most temporal components. Only the monthly component of T and the daily component of theta were correlated with Eh. A detailed multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis illustrated that the gaseous O2, at shallow depths, can explain the majority (above 80%) of the Eh variability. The MLR curve demonstrated breakpoints in the Eh response to O2 at shallow depths, which were identified using a piecewise regression. These breakpoints explain, in part, the different stages of microbial activity throughout the SAT wetting and drying cycles. Combining an oxygen transport analytical model with the piecewise regression enabled the Eh prediction through easy-to-acquire T and theta measurements. At deeper depths, the Eh-O2 relationship demonstrates a step-function characteristic, which indicates that the changes in Eh occur due to the arrival of a low-Eh solution. Thus, the Eh dynamic in the SAT vadose zone is mostly controlled by aerobic conditions.

AB Most of the existing drought indices are based on a single variable (e.g. precipitation) or a combination of two variables (e.g., precipitation and streamflow). This may not be sufficient for reliable quantification of the existing drought condition. It is possible that a region might be experiencing only a single type of drought at times, but multiple drought types affecting a region is quite common too. To have a comprehensive representation, it is better to consider all the variables that lead to different physical forms of drought, such as meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts. Therefore, we propose to develop a multivariate drought index (MDI) that will utilize information from hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration and soil moisture as indicator variables, thus accounting for all the physical forms of drought. The entropy theory was utilized to develop this proposed index, that led to the smallest set of features maximally preserving the information of the input data set. MDI was then compared with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) for all climate regions within Texas for the time period 1950-2012, with particular attention to the two major drought occurrences in Texas, viz. the droughts which occurred in 1950-1957, and 2010-2011. The proposed MDI was found to represent drought conditions well, due to its multivariate, multi scalar, and nonlinear properties. To help the user choose the right time scale for further analysis, entropy maps of MDI at different time scales were used as a guideline. The MDI time scale that has the highest entropy value may be chosen, since a higher entropy indicates a higher information content. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The crop-water production function quantitatively evaluates the relationship between seasonal water use and crop yield and is used to evaluate optimal irrigation depth and assess the potential of deficit and supplemental irrigation. A simple and easily applicable methodology to develop crop-and region-specific crop-water production functions using crop coefficients and sensitivity-indices is presented. Previous efforts to describe the crop-water production function have not accounted for the effects of the temporal distribution of water use and trivialize the associated variability in yields by assuming an optimized or arbitrary temporal distribution. The temporal distribution of water use throughout the growing season can significantly influence crop yield, and the ability of farmers to manage both the timing and amount of irrigation water may result in higher yields. We propose crop kites, a tool that explicitly acknowledges crop yield as a function of the temporal distribution of water use to both evaluate the complete space of water use and crop yield relationships, and extract from this space specific crop-water production functions. An example for winter wheat is presented using previously validated crop-specific sensitivity indices. Crop-water production functions are extracted from the crop kite related to specific irrigation schedules and temporal distributions of water use. Crop-water production functions associated with maximizing agricultural production agree with previous efforts characterizing the shape as a diminishing curvilinear function. Crop kites provide the tools for water managers and policy makers to evaluate crop-and region-specific agricultural production as it relates to water management and the associated economics, and to determine appropriate policies for developing and supporting the infrastructure to increase water productivity.

AB The issue of lack of donor basins for prediction of flow duration curves (FDCs) in ungauged basins (PUB) is an important area of research that is not resolved in the literature. We present a distance based approach to predict FDCs at ungauged basins by quantifying the dissimilarity between FDCs and characteristics data of basins. This enables us to bracket hydrologically similar basins and thus allowing us to estimate FDCs at ungauged basins. Generally, a single regression model is selected to make hydrological estimates at an ungauged basin. Based on established laws and theories of hydrology, we work to devise a method to improve the output of selected model for an ungauged basin by swapping it with another model in case the latter gives better coverage and statistical estimates of the nearest neighbors of an ungauged basin. We report two examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of model swapping. Out of 124 basins used in analysis, 34 basins in example 1 and 41 basins in example 2 fulfill the set criteria of model swapping and subsequently their estimates are improved significantly.

AB We present a scientific replication of a benthic algae nuisance threshold study originally conducted in Montana, but we do so using a different sampling methodology in a different state. Respondents are asked to rate eight photographs that depict varying algae conditions. Our initial results show that Utah resident preferences for benthic algae levels are quite similar to those of Montana residents, thus replicating the Montana study. For the full Utah sample, though, Cronbach's a indicated poor internal consistency in rating the photographs, so a "monotonicity rule'' was used to identify respondents providing monotonic preferences with respect to chlorophyll a densities. Simple graphical analyses are combined with ordered probit analysis to determine the maximum desirable density of chlorophyll a (Chl a). Our analysis indicates that Chl a levels in excess of 150 mg Chl a/m(2) are undesirable, but the regression model suggests that those with strictly monotonic preferences were far more likely favor a more stringent standard.
   Plain Language Summary Excess nutrients in water can cause eutrophication, a potentially undesirable condition that fosters the growth of nuisance algae. Unlike many other water quality problems, excess algae are easily discerned by those who recreate at streams, rivers, and lakes. EPA has recently tasked state water quality agencies with establishing a numeric criterion for excess nutrients. Some agencies have used public opinion surveys to gauge aesthetic preferences for algae when developing a chlorophyll a-based criterion. This approach implicitly assumes that (1) chlorophyll a densities closely correspond to the quantity and type of benthic algae and (2) preferences for algae are strictly monotonic, i.e., less algae are preferred to more algae. We scientifically replicate a Montana study and find that preferences of Utah residents demonstrate a remarkable similarity to those of Montana residents. However, responses for a significant proportion of the sample were not monotonic. Hence, the water quality criterion implied by survey data may be sensitive to the assumption of monotonicity. Multiple preferred criteria may emerge, each differing according to how researchers treat the monotonicity assumption. We find that respondents whose preferences for chlorophyll a are strongly monotonic are more likely to favor a more stringent criterion.

AB We investigate the storagedischarge relationships of two nested (3 center dot 6 and 30 center dot 4 km(2)) upland catchments using rainfallrunoff models: (1) a nonlinear discharge sensitivity function and (2) a tracer-constrained process-based conceptual model. Both approaches explicitly acknowledge that water storage is neither time nor space invariant and this provided insight into the respective scaling relationships. Both modelling approaches consistently demonstrated small seasonal storage fluctuations consistent with the wet, cool Scottish climate: the smaller catchment exhibited a greater average dynamic storage (ca 55 mm) compared to the larger scale (ca 40 mm). However, there are differences in simulated storage quantities and ranges inferred from both models, which can largely be explained by model uncertainties and model assumptions. In contrast to the dynamic (active) storage indicated by the rainfall-runoff models, input-output relationships of delta O-18 in both catchments were used to estimate the passive storage available for mixing and tracer damping in streams. This showed that catchment storage is an order of magnitude greater (ranging from 500 to 900 mm) than the dynamic storage estimated by both models, though again, storage estimates were greater for the smaller catchment. The passive storage inferred for mixing indicates that discussion of dynamic storage revealed by water balance considerations masks a much larger catchment storage which may in turn determine sensitivity to environmental change.

AB This study presents a novel hysteresis model based on van Genuchten's soil-moisture relationships. The proposed model yields a series of closed-form relationships in which two shape factors alpha and eta are determined from the main drying and wetting curves. Experimental and literature-cited data were used to assess model accuracy. The proposed model was also compared with the Scott and KP models. Analytical results indicate that the present model is simple, accurate and effective in constructing the series of wetting and drying scanning curves. Notably, the proposed model outperforms the Scott and KP models in terms of model accuracy. Moreover, the novel model eliminates the pumping effect and has perfect closure at scanning curve reversal points. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB While numerous models exist for soil evaporation estimation, they are more or less empirically based either in the model structure or in the determination of introduced parameters. The main difficulty lies in representing the water stress factor, which is usually thought to be limited by capillarity-supported water supply or by vapor diffusion flux. Recent progress in understanding soil hydraulic properties, however, have found that the film flow, which is often neglected, is the dominant process under low moisture conditions. By including the impact of film flow, a reexamination on the typical evaporation process found that this usually neglected film flow might be the dominant process for supporting the Stage II evaporation (i.e., the fast falling rate stage), besides the generally accepted capillary flow-supported Stage I evaporation and the vapor diffusion-controlled Stage III evaporation. A physically based model for estimating the evaporation rate was then developed by parameterizing the Buckingham-Darcy's law. Interestingly, the empirical Bucket model was found to be a specific form of the proposed model. The proposed model requires the in-equilibrium relative humidity as the sole input for representing water stress and introduces no adjustable parameter in relation to soil texture. The impact of vapor diffusion was also discussed. Model testing with laboratory data yielded an excellent agreement with observations for both thin soil and thick soil column evaporation experiments. Model evaluation at 15 field sites generally showed a close agreement with observations, with a great improvement in the lower range of evaporation rates in comparison with the widely applied Priestley and Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model.

AB In this study, we focus on the electrical tortuosity-based permeability model k = r(eff)(2)/8F (r(eff) is an effective pore size, and F is the formation factor) and analyze its applicability to rocks experiencing mineral precipitation and dissolution. Two limiting cases of advection-dominated water-rock reactions are simulated, that is, the reaction-limited and transport-limited cases. At the pore scale, the two precipitation/dissolution patterns are simulated with a geometrical model and a phenomenological model. The fluid and electric flows in the rocks are simulated by directly solving the linear Stokes equation and Laplace equation on the representative elementary volume of the samples. The numerical results show that evolutions of k and F differ significantly in the two limiting cases. In general, the reaction-limited precipitation/dissolution would result in a smooth variation of k and F, which can be roughly modeled with a power function of porosity phi with a constant exponent. In contrast, the transport-limited precipitation/dissolution mostly occurs near the pore throats where the fluid velocity is high. This induces a sharp change in k and F despite a minor variation in phi. The commonly used power laws with constant exponents are not able to describe such variations. The results also reveal that the electrical tortuosity-based permeability prediction generally works well for rocks experiencing precipitation/dissolution if r(eff) can be appropriately estimated, for example, with the electrical field normalized pore size Lambda. The associated prediction errors are mainly due to the use of electrical tortuosity, which might be considerably larger than the true hydraulic tortuosity.

AB Urban catchments are characterized by a wide variety of complex juxtapositions and surface compositions that are linked to multiple overland flow paths. Their extremely high spatial heterogeneity leads to great sensitivity of hydrologic simulation to the scale variation of calculation units. Although extensive efforts have been made for investigating the scale effects and indicate its significance, less is understood of how routing features vary with spatial scales and further how the variation of routing features influences the hydrological response. In this paper, a grid-based distributed urban hydrological model is applied to study spatial scale effects ranging from 10 to 250 m. Two parameters are proposed to quantitatively depict the routing features of overland flow specified for impervious and pervious areas. The results show that routing features are quite sensitive to spatial resolution. Large differences among simulations exist in the infiltration amounts attributed to the combined effects of the two routing parameters, which leads to opposite effects for both total flow volume and peak flow for various rainfall events. The relationship of the key model parameters at different spatial resolutions can be explicitly expressed by corresponding routing features. With this relationship, parameters transfer among different spatial scales can be realized to obtain consistent simulation results. This study further revealed the quantitative relationship between spatial scales, routing features, and the hydrologic processes and enabled accurate and efficient simulations required by real-time flooding forecasting and land-atmosphere coupling, while fully taking the advantages of detailed surface information.
   Plain Language Summary Given the inherent complex underlying surface compositions and overland flow paths in urban areas, underlying high spatial resolution surface data eventually become necessary. Unfortunately, high-resolution modeling in urban catchment is still challenging in terms of computational restricts, proper setting up of parameters, and so forth due to the high spatial heterogeneity. Practical simulation requirements often limit the use of high-resolution models, as in the case of real-time prediction of urban flooding, the coupling of land-atmosphere processes. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the scale effects and its mechanism and then to explore an accommodation approach to enable precise flooding prediction with a coarse model. For grid-based and distributed hydrologic models, the mosaic method can basically eliminate the scale effects on the runoff generation process. However, the scale effects on overland flow routing remain insufficiently understood, and to help understand the scale effects, simulations were performed under five different resolutions, ranging from 10 to 250 m, for various rainfall events. Two physical parameters are introduced to quantify the scale effects on routing features. Three variables are concurrently calculated to assess the effects on modeling outputs. The results indicate that routing features are sensitive to changes in spatial resolution, which results in opposite effects on simulation results under different rainfall conditions. In conclusion, an accommodation approach is proposed based on the affecting mechanism.

AB The capability of peatland ecosystems to regulate evapotranspiration (ET) following wildfire is a key control on the resilience of their globally important carbon stocks under future climatic conditions. Evaporation dominates post-fire ET, with canopy and sub-canopy removal restricting transpiration and increasing evaporation potential. Therefore, in order to project the hydrology and associated stability of peatlands to a diverse range of post-fire weather conditions and future climates the regulation of evaporation must be accurately parameterised in peatland ecohydrological models. To achieve this, we measure the surface resistance (r(s)) to evaporation over the growing season one year post-fire within four zones of a boreal peatland that burned to differing depths, relating r(s) to near surface soil tensions. We show that the magnitude and temporal variability in r(s) varies with burn severity. At the peatland scale, r(s) and near-surface tension correlates non-linearly. However, at the point scale no relationship was evident between temporal variations in r(s) and near-surface tension across all burn severities; in part due to the limited fluctuation in near-surface tensions and the precision of r(s) measurements. Where automated measurements enabled averaging of errors, the relationship between near-surface tension and r(s) switched between periods of strong and weak correlation within a burned peat hummock. This relationship, when strong, deviated from that obtained under steady state laboratory conditions; increases in r(s) were more sensitive to fluctuations in near-surface tension under dynamic field conditions. Calculating soil vapour densities directly from near-surface tensions is shown to require calibration between peat types and provides little if any benefit beyond the derivation of empirical relationships between r(s) and measured soil tension. Thus, we demonstrate important spatiotemporal fluctuations in post-fire r(s) that will be key to regulating post-fire peatland hydrology, but highlight the complex challenges in effectively parameterising this important underlying control of near-surface tensions within hydrological simulations.

AB We postulate that the spatial variability in flow velocity in a basin, arising from the systematic downstream variation of celerity, may explain the observed nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationships. This is based on the argument that different rainfall excess rates will produce different velocity fields in a basin due to the nonlinear relation between velocity and flow. In particular, we show that if the mean velocity V varies with flow Q as Vproportional toQ(m), then the time to peak t(p) and the peak f(t(p)) of the network instantaneous response function (IRF) vary as t(p) proportional to i(e)(-m) and f(t(p)) proportional to i(e)(+m), where i(e) is the rainfall excess rate.

AB We study the migration of sorbing tracers through crystalline rock by combining relatively simple transport measures with particle tracking in a discrete fracture network. The rock volume is on a 100 m scale and is a replica of a thoroughly characterized site at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden. Flow is driven by generic boundary conditions consistent with the natural gradient in the region. The emphasis is on the global effect of fracture-to-fracture hydraulic variability where individual fractures are assumed to be of uniform aperture. The transport measures are conditioned on two random variables: the water residence time (tau) and a parameter which quantifies the hydrodynamic control of retention (beta). Results are illustrated for two radionuclides: technetium (strongly sorbing) and strontium (weakly sorbing). It is found that the assumption of streamline routing or full mixing at fracture intersections has comparatively little impact on transport. The choice of the cubic or quadratic hydraulic law (i.e., relation between transmissivity and aperture) strongly affects water residence times but has little impact on average transport since it does not affect the statistics of beta. If the statistics of beta are known, then the distribution of water residence time (tau) is of little importance for transport. We assess the applicability of a linearized model beta = tau/b(ret) using two different approaches to estimate the effective "retention'' aperture 2b(ret): from transmissivity data and from fracture density and flow porosity data. Under some conditions, these conventional estimates may provide acceptable representation of transport. The results stress the need for further studies on upscaling of tau, beta distributions as well as on estimating effective parameters for hydraulic control of retention.

AB [1] We consider the transport behavior of a passive solute in a heterogeneous medium, modeled by continuous time random walks (CTRW) and linear multirate mass transfer (MRMT). Within the CTRW framework, we formulate a transport model which is formally equivalent to MRMT. In both approaches the total concentration is divided into mobile and immobile parts. The immobile concentration is given by the convolution in time of the mobile concentration and a memory function. The memory function is a functional of the distribution of transition and trapping times for the CTRW and the MRMT approach, respectively, and determines the transport behavior of the solute. Based on different expressions for the memory function in the two frameworks, we derive conditions for which both approaches describe the same transport behavior. We focus on anomalous transport behavior that can arise if the transition and trapping time distributions behave algebraically in a given time regime. Using an expansion of the Laplace transform of the memory function, we develop explicit expressions for the time behavior of the flux concentration as well as for the center of mass velocity and the (macro) dispersion coefficients of the solute distribution. We observe (anomalous) power law as well as (normal) Fickian transport behavior, depending on the exponents that dominate the trapping and transition time distributions, respectively. The results show that the character of the anomalous transport does not depend on the details of the transport model but only on the exponents dominating the transition or trapping time distributions. The unified transport framework presented here comprising CTRW and MRMT shows new aspects and opens new perspectives for the modeling of transport in heterogeneous media.

AB The forces and overturning moments exerted by second order waves on large vertical circular cylinders are analysed. The mathematical equations governing the physical system are the three-dimensional Laplace's equation satisfied by the velocity potential phi(x,y,z,t) and the boundary conditions, namely the dynamic boundary condition which is obtained from the Bernoulli's equation, kinematic boundary condition, radiation condition, bottom boundary condition and the zero radial velocity condition on the surface of the cylinder. The non-linearity of the mathematical problem is evidenced in the free surface boundary conditions viz. dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions. Analytical solutions are obtained using the perturbation technique. These solutions are compared with various experimental data. The comparison shows favourable agreement between the theory and the experimental results.

AB Advection dominated transport processes in sub-surface formations are characterized by discontinuities in the fields of transported quantities, and realistic predictions are challenging for Eulerian transport schemes because they suffer from numerical diffusion. Henceforth, we have focused on developing a Lagrangian particle-tracking scheme for modeling advective solute transport in fractured media. To this end, we adopt an Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) for fractured media with a permeable matrix. The flexibility to use non-conformal fracture-matrix discretizations makes EDFMs a compelling choice in field-scale flow problems. Unaffected by the numerical diffusion, Lagrangian transport schemes complement the potential of EDFMs by allowing the use of sufficiently large grid cell sizes for flow field computations. In an EDFM framework, the inter-continuum fluid mass exchange cannot be quantified by the particle trajectories/pathlines due to the unresolved fracture-matrix interfaces and different dimensionalities of the matrix and fracture discretizations. These constraints motivate the use of a stochastic particle-tracking scheme, and thus, we formulated a pathline-specific probability of inter-continuum particle transfer based on mass conservation of an elementary solute/fluid mass. The particle's transfer probability is calculated for the maximum residence time period in its associated fracture/matrix control volume, thus making the scheme time-adaptive. In addition, a conditional residence time distribution was derived, which dictates the timestamp of the particle transfer. First, we showcase that the tracking scheme preserves the initially homogeneous solute concentration field, suggesting that the probabilistic rules are consistent with the inter-continuum fluxes. Additionally, we illustrate the estimation of an evolving solute plume and compare the results with those of an Eulerian counterpart. The presented stochastic approach enables straightforward formulations of Lagrangian models for dynamic and sub-grid processes, e.g., solute interactions with the solid phase, the mapping of their effects onto large scale transport and additionally, be included in random walk models for dispersion.

AB Hydropower generation in the Hetch Hetchy Power System is strongly tied to snowmelt dynamics in the central Sierra Nevada and consequently is particularly financially vulnerable to changes in snowpack availability and timing. This study explores the Hetchy Hetchy Power System as a representative example from the broader class of financial risk management problems that hold promise in helping utilities such as SFPUC to understand the tradeoffs across portfolios of risk mitigation instruments given uncertainties in snowmelt dynamics. An evolution-ary multi-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) framework is implemented to identify time adaptive stochastic rules that map utility state information and exogenous inputs to optimal annual financial decisions. The resulting financial risk mitigation portfolio planning problem is mathematically difficult due to its high dimensionality and mixture of nonlinear, nonconvex, and discrete objectives. These features add to the difficulty of the problem by yielding a Pareto front of solutions that has a highly disjoint and complex geometry. In this study, we contribute a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms' (MOEAs') abilities to support a DPS framework for managing financial risk. We perform comprehensive diagnostics on five algorithms: the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (RVEA), and the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). The MOEAs are evaluated to characterize their controllability (ease-of-use), reliability (probability of success), efficiency (minimizing model evaluations), and effectiveness (high quality tradeoff representations). Our results show that newer decomposition, reference point, and reference vector algorithms are highly sensitive to their parameterizations (difficult to use), suffer from search deterioration (losing solutions), and have a strong likelihood of misrepresenting key tradeoffs. The results emphasize the importance of using MOEAs with archiving and adaptive search capabilities in order to solve complex financial risk portfolio problems in snow-dependent water-energy systems.

ID QUADRATIC GAUSSIAN CONTROL; RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT; OPERATION
AB A new formulation is presented for the analysis of multireservoir systems, based on the development of first and second moment expressions for the stochastic storage state variables. These expressions give explicit consideration to the maximum and minimum storage bounds in the reservoir system, a feature not incorporated in some existing formulations based on traditional control theory. Using this analysis, expected values of the storage states, variances of storage, release policies, reliability levels, and failure probabilities (useful information in the context of reservoir operations and design) can be obtained from a nonlinear programming solution. The approach does not involve any discretization of the system variables. The results for the means and standard deviations of the storage states for a multireservoir system compare favorably with those obtained from simulation.

AB Real-time water quality control (WQC) in water distribution networks (WDN), the problem of regulating disinfectant levels, is challenging due to lack of (i) a proper control-oriented modeling considering complicated components (junctions, reservoirs, tanks, pipes, pumps, and valves) for water quality modeling in WDN and (ii) a corresponding scalable control algorithm that performs real-time water quality regulation. In this paper, we solve the WQC problem by (a) proposing a novel state-space representation of the WQC problem that provides an explicit relationship between inputs (chlorine dosage at booster stations) and states/outputs (chlorine concentrations in the entire network) and (b) designing a highly scalable model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that showcases fast response time and resilience against some sources of uncertainty.

AB Water retention curves (WRCs) and hydraulic conductivity functions (HCFs) are critical soil-specific characteristics necessary for modeling the movement of water in soils using the Richardson-Richards equation (RRE). Well-established laboratory measurement methods of WRCs and HCFs are not usually suitable for simulating field-scale soil moisture dynamics because of the scale mismatch. Hence, the inverse solution of the RRE must be used to estimate WRCs and HCFs from field measured data. Here, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for the inverse solution of the RRE and the estimation of WRCs and HCFs from only volumetric water content (VWC) measurements. The proposed framework does not need initial and boundary conditions, which are rarely available in real applications. The PINNs consist of three linked feedforward neural networks, two of which were constrained to be monotonic functions to reflect the monotonicity of WRCs and HCFs. Alternatively, we also tested PINNs without monotonicity constraints. We trained the PINNs using synthetic VWC data with artificial noise, derived by a numerical solution of the RRE for three soil textures. The monotonicity constraints regularized the inverse problem. The PINNs were able to reconstruct the true VWC dynamics. We demonstrated that the PINNs could recover the underlying WRCs and HCFs in nonparametric form. However, the reconstructed WRCs and HCFs at wet and dry ends were unsatisfactory because of the strong nonlinearity. We additionally showed that the trained PINNs could estimate soil water flux density with a broader range of estimation than the currently available methods.

AB Over the last 150 years or so engineers, farmers, scientists, and many others around the globe have gained access to the waters that lie underground with drilling technology, pumps and cheap energy. Since the mid-twentieth century, a massive worldwide proliferation of deep wells has redistributed groundwaters away from springs, seeps, wells, and oases, robbing them of the water that supports local sustainable socionatural relations. The idea and social fact of groundwater has emerged in this history, and has three distinguishing features: heterogeneity, ubiquity, and visibility. The failure to halt depletion has prompted a turn to culture in the hope of governing the liquid sustainably. However, rather than grapple with the complexities and contradictions of heterogeneity, ubiquity, and visibility, these efforts take a rather thin view of culture-as rules, norms, and institutions to be studied, codified and deployed to address the crisis. This instrumental understanding of culture as a set of traits to be selectively used for arresting depletion has not proven effective, however, compelling us to rethink our cultural, political, and economic engagements with groundwater.

AB It is vital to identify drought events and to evaluate multivariate drought characteristics based on a composite drought index for better drought risk assessment and sustainable development of water resources. However, most composite drought indices are constructed by the linear combination, principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices. In this study, the multidimensional copulas function was applied to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index (NMDI) to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship due to its dependence structure and flexibility. The NMDI was constructed by combining meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural variables (precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture) to better reflect the multivariate variables simultaneously. Based on the constructed NMDI and runs theory, drought events for a particular area regarding three drought characteristics: duration, peak, and severity were identified. Finally, multivariate drought risk was analyzed as a tool for providing reliable support in drought decision-making. The results indicate that: (1) multidimensional copulas can effectively solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multivariate variables; (2) compared with single and other composite drought indices, the NMDI is slightly more sensitive in capturing recorded drought events; and (3) drought risk shows a spatial variation; out of the five partitions studied, the Jing River Basin as well as the upstream and midstream of the Wei River Basin are characterized by a higher multivariate drought risk. In general, multidimensional copulas provides a reliable way to solve the nonlinear relationship when constructing a comprehensive drought index and evaluating multivariate drought characteristics.

AB In this study, we extend the KLME approach, a moment-equation approach based on the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (KL), developed by Zhang and Lu [An efficient, higher-order perturbation approach for flow in randomly heterogeneous porous media via Karhunen-Loeve decomposition. J Comput Phys 2004;194(2):773-94] to efficiently incorporate existing direct measurements of the log hydraulic conductivity. We first decompose the conditional log hydraulic conductivity Y = lnK, as an infinite series on the basis of a set of orthogonal Gaussian standard random variables {xi(i)}. The coefficients of this series are related to eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the conditional covariance function of the log hydraulic conductivity. We then write head as an infinite series whose terms It" represent the head contribution at the nth order in terms of ay, the standard deviation of Y, and derive a set of recursive equations for h((n)) We assume that h((n)) can be expressed as infinite series in terms of the products of n Gaussian random variables. The coefficients in these series are determined by substituting decompositions of Y and h((m)), m < n, into those recursive equations. We solve the conditional mean head up to fourth-order in ay and the conditional head covariances up to third-order in sigma(y)(2). The Y higher-order corrections for the conditional mean flux and flux covariance can be determined directly from the higher-order moments of the head, using Darcy's law. We compare the results from the KLME approach against those from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the conventional first-order moment method. It is evident that the KLME approach with higher-order corrections is superior to the conventional first-order approximations and is computationally more efficient than both the Monte Carlo simulations and the conventional first-order moment method.

AB [1] Multivariate linear regression is one of the most popular modeling tools in hydrology and climate sciences for explaining the link between key variables. Piecewise linear regression is not always appropriate since the relationship may experiment sudden changes due to climatic, environmental, or anthropogenic perturbations. To address this issue, a practical and general approach to the Bayesian analysis of the multivariate regression model is presented. The approach allows simultaneous single change point detection in a multivariate sample and can account for missing data in the response variables and/or in the explicative variables. It also improves on recently published change point detection methodologies by allowing a more flexible and thus more realistic prior specification for the existence of a change and the date of change as well as for the regression parameters. The estimation of all unknown parameters is achieved by Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations. It is shown that the developed approach is able to reproduce the results of Rasmussen (2001) as well as those of Perreault et al. (2000a, 2000b). Furthermore, two of the examples provided in the paper show that the proposed methodology can readily be applied to some problems that cannot be addressed by any of the above-mentioned approaches because of limiting model structure and/or restrictive prior assumptions. The first of these examples deals with single change point detection in the multivariate linear relationship between mean basin-scale precipitation at different periods of the year and the summer-autumn flood peaks of the Broadback River located in northern Quebec, Canada. The second one addresses the problem of missing data estimation with uncertainty assessment in multisite streamflow records with a possible simultaneous shift in mean streamflow values that occurred at an unknown date.

TI Macroroughness and variations in reach-averaged flow resistance in steep
   mountain streams
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; VELOCITY; CHANNEL; POOLS; MORPHOLOGY
AB Steep mountain streams typically feature macroroughness elements like large immobile boulders or channel-spanning bedforms such as step-pool sequences. The effects of macroroughness on resistance and flow velocity are not well understood and appropriate field parameters for representing macroroughness in flow velocity equations have not been identified. The prediction of flow velocity in rough and steep streams therefore remains challenging. We measured flow velocity and several macroroughness parameters, i.e., boulder concentration, boulder diameter and protrusion, and roughness of longitudinal channel profiles in six reaches of steep mountain streams with plane bed/riffle, step-pool, and cascade channel morphologies. The between-site variations in flow resistance can be explained to a large degree by nondimensionalization of discharge and flow velocity using channel slope and a characteristic roughness length. Using any of our roughness parameters as the characteristic roughness length, this nondimensionalization leads to a similarity collapse of the entire data set. The remaining differences in flow resistance among the streams are related to dimensionless measures of macroroughness that describe the concentration of boulders or step density in a reach. Boulder concentration represents the measure best describing the data and is used in a simple regression equation for flow velocity. The predictions were better than predictions by the variable power law equation proposed by Ferguson. Although the regression might not be statistically significant, the observed trends suggest that boulder concentration partly explains the residual variance of between-site variation of flow resistance.

AB In this study, a laboratory investigation was conducted to determine the co-effect of heterogeneity and solute concentration on dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) migration regularity and corresponding representative elementary volume (REV). Four experiments of perchloroethylene (PCE) migration were performed in bench scale two-dimensional (2D) sandboxes to investigate the REVs of PCE saturation (S-o), PCE-water interfacial area (A(OW)). Experimental results of migration regularity indicated heterogeneity hindered PCE infiltration, while higher solute concentration enhance PCE migration along horizontal and vertical directions. Moreover, heterogeneity and high solute concentration led to larger values of the second moments and Ganglia-to-pool ratio (GTP) of PCE plume in experiments. In comparison with solute concentration, REV estimation suggested the heterogeneity has a larger impact on the REVs of DNAPL plume. The heterogeneity of porous media has decreased the mean values of S-o-REV sizes more than 0.79 mm and 1.80 mm under conditions of low and high solute concentrations, respectively. A(OW)-REV sizes due to the heterogeneity of the porous medium were decreased by 46.0% and 51.9% of the average rates under conditions of low and high solute concentrations, respectively. On the other hand, high solute concentration led to a higher mean value of A(OW)-REV size, while solute concentration had different influences on S-o-REV under respective heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions. These phenomena indicated A(OW)-REV size has the largest value under conditions of homogeneity and high solute concentration. Confidence intervals of A(OW)-REV sizes for Experiment-III (homogeneity, low solute concentration) and Experiment-IV (homogeneity, high solute concentration) and confidence intervals for Experiment-I (heterogeneity, low solute concentration) and Experiment-II (heterogeneity, high solute concentration) had no overlapping part. These experimental results indicate the significant effect of heterogeneity and solute concentration on REVs of DNAPL plume in groundwater system, which is essential to understand the characteristics of scale effect and corresponding migration behaviors of DNAPL in a complex subsurface environment.

AB In recent years, the impact of global warming has raised public concern over the precipitation-induced geological hazards, water security and energy security in the Yalong River Basin (YRB). Therefore, it is advisable to identify the variations of future precipitation, hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and the operation of local hydropower reservoirs. To this end, the ensemble mean of the bias corrected NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) climate projections downscaled from 10 global climate models (GCMs) was applied to seven precipitation indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the ensemble of two distributed hydrologic models (VIC and CREST) under the global warming of 1.5 degrees C and 2 C. Reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and the hydropower optimization model were explicitly included in the routing module to represent the impact of the local hydropower reservoirs, respectively. The future natural runoff is likely to increase under RCP8.5, decrease under RCP4.5, and see a larger daily variability under both. The local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative climate impact on the basin hydrology, and the basin is expected to see increased dry-season runoff, decreased wet-season runoff, and lower daily variability of runoff under all scenarios as compared to the baseline period. The future hydropower generation of the YRB is consistent with the variation of future runoff, and reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce about 5% electricity more than the current actual operation rules, highlighting the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions. Our framework and findings are expected to provide instructive information for water resources management not only in the YRB but also in different regions worldwide.

AB Backflow phenomenon, as a consequence of hydraulic fracturing, is of considerable technical and environmental interest. Here, backflow of a non-Newtonian fluid from a disk-shaped elastic fracture is studied theoretically and experimentally. The fracture is of constant aperture h and the outlet section at constant pressure p(e). We consider a shear-thinning power-law fluid with flow behavior index n. Fracture walls are taken to react with a force proportional to h(lambda), with lambda a positive elasticity exponent; for lambda=1 linear elasticity holds. Constant overload f(0), acting on the fracture, is also embedded in the model. A transient closed-form solution is derived for the (i) fracture aperture, (ii) pressure field, and (iii) outflow rate. The particular case of a Newtonian fluid (n=1) is explicitly provided. For p(e)=0 and f(0)=0, the residual aperture and outflow rate scale asymptotically with time t as t(-n/(n+lambda+1)) and t(-(2n+lambda+1)/(n+lambda+1)), respectively, thus generalizing literature results for n=1 and/or lambda=1. For nonzero exit pressure and/or overload, the fracture aperture tends asymptotically to a constant value depending on lambda, n, p(e), f(0), and other geometrical and physical parameters. The results are provided in dimensionless and dimensional form, including the time to achieve a given percentage of fluid recovery. In addition, an example application (with values of parameters derived from field scale applications) is included to further characterize the influence of fluid rheology. Experimental tests are conducted with Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids and different combinations of parameters to validate the model. Experimental results match well the theoretical predictions, mostly with a slight overestimation.

AB The parabolic partial differential equation describing fluid flow in partially saturated porous media, Richards' equation, is highly nonlinear due to pressure head dependencies in the specific soil moisture capacity and relative hydraulic conductivity terms. In order to solve Richards' equation several numerical techniques have been developed, which, starting from the discretization of the partial differential equation, produced even more accurate models, leading to complex and computationally expensive simulations for large-scale systems. A three-dimensional unsaturated flow modeling developed through a simulation environment based on cellular automata ( CA) is described in this paper. The proposed model represents an extension of the original computational paradigm of cellular automata, because it uses a macroscopic CA approach where local laws with a clear physical meaning govern interactions among automata. This CA structure, aimed at simulating a large-scale system, is based on functionalities capable of increasing its computational capacity, both in terms of working environment and in terms of the optimal number of processors available for parallel computing. The model has been validated with reference multidimensional solutions taken from benchmarks in literature, showing a good agreement even in the cases where nonlinearity is very marked. Furthermore, some analyses have been carried out considering quantization techniques aimed at transforming the CA model into an asynchronous structure. The use of these techniques in a three-dimensional benchmark allowed a considerable reduction in the number of local interactions among adjacent automata without changing the efficiency of the model, especially when simulations are characterized by scarce mass exchanges. Finally, from a computational point of view the higher efficiency values were achieved running the model on a parallel architecture, obtaining a high speedup very close to the optimal with the maximum number of processors available.

AB Deep learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, the lack of physical mechanism becomes a major limitation in using machine learning methods that rely on the available labeled observations. To address this issue, the study proposes that synthetic samples are added to train the deep learning network by using three previously undiscussed physical mechanisms as follows: (1) extreme heavy rainfalls when the soil water is saturated, (2) long-duration rainless events when soil water is exhausted, and (3) the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff. A physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, shortly named PHY-LSTM, is then formulated. PHY-LSTM network is trained on 531 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, indicating that the performance is significantly improved compared to conventional LSTM. Specifically, the mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improves from 0.52 to 0.61 from the daily simulations during the testing period in local models. It is demonstrated that synthetic samples can effectively improve the simulation of flood peaks and reduce the number of negative streamflow, and strong monotonicity is still maintained even if a slight disturbance is involved in the training dataset. The proposed PHY-LSTM shows that physical mechanisms are very useful to improve efficiencies of the data-driven rainfall-runoff model.

AB The characterization and modeling of heat transfer in fractured media is particularly challenging as the existence of fractures at multiple scales induces highly localized flow patterns. From a theoretical and numerical analysis of heat transfer in simple conceptual models of fractured media, we show that flow channeling has a significant effect on the scaling of heat recovery in both space and time. The late time tailing of heat recovery under channeled flow is shown to diverge from the T(t) proportional to t(-1.5) behavior expected for the classical parallel plate model and follow the scaling T(t) proportional to 1/t(log t)(2) for a simple channel modeled as a tube. This scaling, which differs significantly from known scalings in mobile-immobile systems, is of purely geometrical origin: late time heat transfer from the matrix to a channel corresponds dimensionally to a radial diffusion process, while heat transfer from the matrix to a plate may be considered as a one-dimensional process. This phenomenon is also manifested on the spatial scaling of heat recovery as flow channeling affects the decay of the thermal breakthrough peak amplitude and the increase of the peak time with scale. These findings are supported by the results of a field experimental campaign performed on the fractured rock site of Ploemeur. The scaling of heat recovery in time and space, measured from thermal breakthrough curves measured through a series of push-pull tests at different scales, shows a clear signature of flow channeling. The whole data set can thus be successfully represented by a multichannel model parametrized by the mean channel density and aperture. These findings, which bring new insights on the effect of flow channeling on heat transfer in fractured rocks, show how heat recovery in geothermal tests may be controlled by fracture geometry. In addition, this highlights the interest of thermal push-pull tests as a complement to solute tracers tests to infer fracture aperture and geometry.

AB River runoff and suspended sediment play a critical role in the chemical, physical, biological processes of Earth's ecosystems. We assessed the temporal changes in runoff and sediment load at both the annual and event scales in the Gushanchuan watershed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. A total of 330 events, from 1955 to 2018, were selected to evaluate the relationships between rainfall, runoff, and suspended sediment load at the Gaoshiya gauging station. Significant reductions were examined in the maximum runoff peaks, suspended sediment concentration, total runoff, suspended sediment yield, and ratio of event runoff to annual total, whereas the ratio of event sediment yield to annual total remained relatively stable. Hysteresis analysis suggested that the complex loops, anti-clockwise, and figure-eight loops accounted for 93.7% of the total events in the watershed. High positive correlations were observed between the flood-event sediment yield, runoff volume, maximum runoff peaks, and total rainfall amount. The flow-sediment relationship can be well fitted by the proportional model, and was weaker in 1997-2018 than those in the periods of 1955-1979 and 1980-1996. Runoff during the rising limb of the event significantly contributed to the total runoff and sediment yield. Land use changes and various soil conservation practices were responsible for the decrease in the flood frequency and magnitude. The results of this study provide useful insights into the relationships between rainfall, runoff, and suspended sediment dynamics, and their responses to soil conservation practices.

AB Transient immiscible and miscible displacement experiments performed on artificial glass-etched pore networks are used to determine the capillary and relative permeability curves as well as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients. The transient responses of the total and axial distribution of the wetting phase (WP) saturation and the pressure drop across the pore network are introduced into an inverse modeling scheme to estimate the imbibition capillary pressure and relative permeability curves of pore networks by varying the capillary number, the contact angle, and the shear-thinning rheology of the nonwetting phase (NWP). The temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of the solute concentration profiles over selected areas of the pore network is fitted to analytical one-dimensional solute dispersion models to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the Peclet number, in single- and dual-pore networks. Under an unfavorable viscosity ratio the growth pattern is a two-dimensional fractal object, its description with the one-dimensional macroscopic two-phase flow equations is questionable, a high uncertainty is introduced into the capillary pressure curve, whereas ''average'' relative permeability functions are estimated. The relative permeability of the NWP may be a decreasing or increasing function of the capillary number over the viscous or capillary fingering pattern, respectively. The relative permeability of the WP is an increasing function of the capillary number and increases weakly with the NWP shear-thinning rheology strengthening. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient varies nonlinearly with Peclet number following power laws with exponents ranging from 1 to 2 and depending on the relative contribution fraction of the macrodispersion (associated with the spatial variation of pore sizes) and Taylor dispersion (associated with the flow channeling) to the entire process.

AB Prediction of microbial surface water contamination is a formidable task because of the inherent randomness of environmental processes driving microbial fate and transport. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of a fully stochastic model of microbial transport in watersheds, and apply the theory to a simple flow network to demonstrate its use. The framework bridges the gap between microscopic behavior of individual microorganisms and macroscopic ensemble dynamics. This scaling is accomplished within a single mathematical framework, where each microorganism behaves according to a continuous-time discrete-space Markov process, and the Markov behavior of individual microbes gives rise to a nonhomogeneous Poisson random field that describes microbial population dynamics. Mean value functions are derived, and the spatial and temporal distribution of water contamination risk is computed in a straightforward manner.

AB In deformed porous carbonates, the architecture of the pore network may be modified by deformation or diagenetic processes altering the permeability with respect to the pristine rock. The effects of the pore texture and morphology on permeability in porous rocks have been widely investigated due to the importance during the evaluation of geofluid reservoirs. In this study, these effects are assessed by combining synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography (SR micro-CT) and computational fluid dynamics. The studied samples pertain to deformed porous carbonate grainstones highly affected by deformation bands (DBs) exposed in Northwestern Sicily and Abruzzo regions, Italy.
   The high-resolution SR micro-CT images of the samples, acquired at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra - Sincrotrone Trieste laboratory (Italy), were used for simulating a pressure-driven flow by using the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). For the experiments, a multiple relaxation time (MRT) model with the D3Q19 scheme was used to avoid viscosity-dependent results of permeability. The permeability was calculated using Darcy's law once steady conditions were reached. After the simulations, the pore-network properties (effective porosity, specific surface area, and geometrical tortuosity) were calculated using 3D images of the velocity fields. These images were segmented considering a velocity threshold value higher than zero.
   The study showed that DBs may generate significant heterogeneity and anisotropy of the permeability of the evaluated rock samples. Cataclasis and cementation process taking place within the DBs reduce the effective porosity and therefore the permeability. Contrary to this, pressure dissolution and faulting may generate connected channels which contribute to the permeability only parallel to the DB. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flow regulation is widely known to modify the thermal regime of rivers. Here, we examine the sensitivity of an empirical approach, the Equilibrium Temperature Concept (ETC), to detect both the effects of hydraulic infrastructures on the annual thermal cycle and the recovery of the thermal equilibrium with the atmosphere. Analysis was undertaken in a Pyrenean river (the Noguera Pallaresa, Ebro basin) affected by a series of reservoirs and hydropower plants. Equilibrium temperature (T-e) is defined as the water temperature (T-w) at which the sum of all heat fluxes is zero. Based on the assumption of a linear relationship between T-e and T-w, we identified changes in the T-e-T-w regression slope, used as an indicator of a thermal alteration in river flow. We also assessed the magnitude of the alteration by examining the regression slope and its statistical significance. Variations in the regression parameters were used as indicators of the influence of factors other than atmospheric conditions on water temperature. Observed T-w showed a linear relationship with T-e at all river stations. However, the slopes of the T-e-T-w relationship appeared to be lower in the reaches downstream from hydraulic infrastructures, particularly below large dams. A seasonal analysis indicated that T-e-T-w relationships had higher slopes and lower p-values during autumn, while no significant differences were found at other seasons. Although thermal characteristics did not strongly depend on atmospheric conditions downstream of hydraulic infrastructures, the river recovered to pre-alteration conditions with distance downstream, indicating the natural tendency of water to attain thermal equilibrium with the atmosphere. Accepting associated uncertainties, mostly because of the quality of the data and the lack of consideration of other factors influencing the thermal regime (e.g. discharge), ETC appears to be a simple and effective method to identify thermal alterations in regulated rivers.

AB Despite the widely held assumption that trees negatively affect the local water budget in densely planted tree plantations, we still lack a clear understanding of the underlying processes by which canopy cover influences local soil water dynamics in more open, humid tropical ecosystems. In this study, we propose a new conceptual model that uses a combination of stable isotope and soil moisture measurements throughout the soil profile to assess potential mechanisms by which evaporation (of surface soil water and of canopy-intercepted rainfall) affects the relationship between surface soil water isotopic enrichment (lc-excess) and soil water content. Our conceptual model was derived from soil water data collected under deciduous and evergreen plants in a shade grown coffee agroforestry system in Costa Rica. Reduced soil moisture under shade trees during the drier season, coinciding when these trees were defoliated, was largely the result of increase soil water evaporation as indicated by the positive relationship between soil water content and lc-excess of surface soil water. In contrast, the evergreen coffee shrubs had a higher leaf area index during the drier season, leading to enhanced rainfall interception and a negative relationship between lc-excess and soil water content. During the wet season, there was no clear relationship between soil water content and between lc-excess of surface soil water. Greater surface soil water under coffee during the dry season may, in part, explain greater preferential flow under coffee compared with under trees in conditions of low rainfall intensities. However, with increasing rainfall intensities during the wet season, there was no obvious difference in preferential flow between the two canopy covers. Results from this study indicate that our new conceptual model can be used to help disentangling the relative influence of canopy cover on local soil water isotopic composition and dynamics, yet also stresses the need for additional measurements to better resolve the underlying processes by which canopy structure influences local water dynamics.

AB Storing water at home has become a common practice in many areas with water delivery systems in developing countries. However, little is known about which factors motivate households to expend on water storage devices. Instrumental variable Tobit models are estimated to investigate the relationship between perceptions of water supply reliability and household expenditures on water storage devices in Leon, Nicaragua. Findings indicate that almost 80% of households use at least one storage device on which they expend an average of 0.87% of their income. Results show that reliability perceptions are the main factor driving household expenditures on storage devices, followed by home ownership and household income. Findings also indicate that reliability perceptions are associated with service performance and assessment of service hours relative to peers.

AB This article assesses the potential for incomplete definitions of resource use to influence estimates of nonuser willingness to pay (WTP), with an emphasis on resources for which an exhaustive set of uses may be difficult to characterize. The data are drawn from a stated preference analysis involving coastal wetland restoration. Results suggest that mechanisms used to distinguish users and nonusers of wetland services may influence estimates of nonuser WTP and that for some attributes, traditional distinctions between user and nonuser WTP may have arguable empirical justification. More broadly, results suggest that relationships among use behaviors and restoration values may be more complex than are typically assumed and point to limitations in methods frequently used to distinguish user and nonuser WTP.

TI An analytical solution for transient radial flow through unsaturated
   fractured porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB [1] This paper presents analytical solutions for one-dimensional radial transient flow through a horizontal, unsaturated fractured rock formation. In these solutions, unsaturated flow through fractured media is described by a linearized Richards' equation, while fracture-matrix interaction is handled using the dual-continuum concept. Although linearizing Richards' equation requires a specially correlated relationship between relative permeability and capillary pressure functions for both fractures and matrix, these specially formed relative permeability and capillary pressure functions are still physically meaningful. These analytical solutions can thus be used to describe the transient behavior of unsaturated flow in fractured media under the described model conditions. They can also be useful in verifying numerical simulation results, which as demonstrated in this paper, are otherwise difficult to validate.

AB The present study attempts to identify universal relationships between the geographical characteristics of a basin and the streamflow within a basin by using the parameter regionalization method of a water balance model, with the aim of gaining hydrological knowledge that might enable predictions of streamflow in ungauged basins. To this end, we first revisited existing regional relationships between the parameters of a Tank model and the geographical characteristics in Japanese mountainous basins, and translated the regional relationships between the geographical characteristics of a basin and streamflow. Second, we used a physically distributed rainfallrunoff model to perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of the geographical characteristics of a hypothetical basin on its streamflow, with the aim of obtaining physically explainable relationships between these factors. Finally, we selected regional relationships that were also explained in the sensitivity analysis as potentially representing universal hydrological knowledge that might help to predict streamflow in ungauged basins. As a result, we obtained the following potentially universal hydrological knowledge: (1) the fraction of surface flow is less in large basins than in small basins; (2) the infiltration at the ground surface is higher if a basin is covered by soil with a high vertical permeability; (3) the fraction of prompt interflow is higher if a basin is covered by soil with a high horizontal permeability; (4) the fraction of delayed interflow is lower in large basins than in small basins and (5) the storage capacity at the ground surface is high if the ground surface is very rough.

AB The introduction of tertiary treatment to many of the sewage treatment works (STW) across the Thames basin in southern England has resulted in major reductions in river phosphorus (P) concentrations. Despite this, excessive phytoplankton growth is still a problem in the River Thames and many of its tributaries. There is an urgent need to determine if future resources should focus on P removal from the remaining STW, or on reducing agricultural inputs, to improve ecological status. Nutrient concentration-flow relationships for monitoring sites along the River Thames and 15 of its major tributaries were used to estimate the relative inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen from continuous (sewage point sources) and rain-related (diffuse and within-channel) sources, using the Load Apportionment Model (LAM). The model showed that diffuse sources and remobilisation of within-channel phosphorus contributed the majority of the annual P load at all monitoring sites. However, the majority of rivers in the Thames basin are still dominated by STW P inputs during the ecologically-sensitive spring-autumn growing season. Therefore, further STW improvements would be the most effective way of improving water quality and ecological status along the length of the River Thames, and 12 of the 15 tributaries. The LAM outputs were in agreement with other indicators of sewage input, such as sewered population density, phosphorus speciation and boron concentration. The majority of N inputs were from diffuse sources, and LAM suggests that introducing mitigation measures to reduce inputs from agriculture and groundwater would be most appropriate for all but one monitoring site in this study. The utilisation of nutrient concentration-flow data and LAM provide a simple, rapid and effective screening tool for determining nutrient sources and most effective mitigation options.

AB The potential for flooding and sediment transport is greatly affected by river channel form and changes in land use. Therefore the modelling of channel morphology prior to canalization and of land-use change is important with respect to the prediction of floods and sediment yield and their consequences. A combination of land-use transformation maps and soil properties shows certain decision rules for the conversion of forest into arable or vice versa. The model proposed, from this study, was used to simulate possible past and/or future channel and land-use patterns. Subsequently, the outcome of this simulation was used to assess the risk of flooding, sediment transport and soil-erosion under different conditions. In this study, channel morphology prior to canalization and land-use change in the Ishikari basin, Hokkaido, Japan, were analysed by comparing three scenarios using a physical based channel and slope model. The results indicate that pre-canalization channel morphology has a significant impact on flood peak, but no significant effect on sediment yield. In contrast, land-use change has a significant effect on soil eroded from hillslopes, but no significant effect on flooding for Ishikari basin. This study also illustrates the challenges that a simple model, such as a physical based channel and slope model, can simulate large-scale river basin processes using fewer hydrological data resources.

AB Model input data selection is a complicated process, especially for non-linear dynamic systems. The questions on which inputs should be used and how lone the training data should be for model development have been hard to solve in practice. Despite the importance of this subject, there have been insufficient reports in the published literature about inter-comparison between different model input data selection techniques. In this study, several methods (i.e. the Gamma test, entropy theory, AIC (Akaike's information criterion)/BIC (Bayesian information criterion) have been explored with the aid of non-linear models of LLR (local linear regression) and ANN (artificial neural networks). The methodology is tested in estimation of solar radiation in the Brue Catchment of England. It has been found that the conventional model selection tools such as AIC/BIC failed to demonstrate their functionality. Although the entropy theory is quite powerful and efficient to compute, it failed to pick up the best input combinations. On the other hand. it is very encouraging to find that the new Gamma test was able to choose the best input selection. However, it is Surprising, to note that the Gamma test significantly underestimated the required training data while the entropy theory did a better job in this aspect. This is the first study to compare the performance of those techniques for model input selections and still there are many unsolved puzzles. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The well-known Horton's laws are empirical observations on how the means of measurements for river networks and basins vary with Horton-Strahler order. It is now known that these laws are a consequence of an average-sense self-similarity in the bifurcation structure of river networks. In this paper we present a reformulation of Horton's laws which generalizes the familiar scaling of first moments, or means, to scaling of entire distributions. We also present extensive data analysis which supports this reformulation and show that this feature is also exhibited by Shreve's well-known random topology model.

AB The one-dimensional (1-d), constant-parameter heat transport equation (HTE) built upon Fourier's law proposed in 1822 has been widely used to model heat transport in soil, where the core question is how to fit the observed temperature time series without detailed geomedium heterogeneity being mapped in the model. To address this question, this study extended the classical HTE by adding one parameter (the time index) using the time subordination approach to capture the impact of random operational times spent by individual heat parcels on heat dynamics. This led to a parsimonious, 1-d, Subordinated HTE (Sub-HTE), which assumes the temporally non-Fourier heat transport and contains the classical HTE as an end member, with analytical solutions aimed at upscaling local heat transport in heterogeneous porous media. To test this approach, temperature time-series were collected in unsaturated soils built in the laboratory that were subjected to periodic surface temperature fluctuations. Model applications showed that, although the HTE captures the general shape of the observed temperature time series, the Sub-HTE is a mild improvement of the HTE in characterizing the nuances of temperature amplitude attenuation (likely due to the small operational time at the intermediate/late time stages). Both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks were developed to interpret other dynamics in heat flow, including the early time temperature jump and phase advance. Parameter analyses also revealed that the thermal front velocity in the Sub-HTE is a function of Darcy flux, the time index, and the system's thermal properties, while the thermal diffusivity (the only parameter related to thermal properties in the Sub-HTE) can be scale independent. Therefore, the 1-d Sub-HTE can be a reliable generalization of the classical 1-d HTE in upscaling heat transport in soil.

AB We provide a quantitative interpretation of the column experiment reported by Gramling et al. (2002). The experiment involves advection-dominated transport in porous media of three dissolved species, i.e., two reactants undergoing a fast irreversible reaction and the resulting product. The authors found that their observations could not be properly fitted with a model based on an advection-dispersion-reaction equation (ADRE) assuming the reaction was instantaneous, the actual measured total reaction product being lower than predictions for all times. The data have been recently well reproduced by Edery et al. (2009, 2010) by means of a particle tracking approach in a continuous time random walk framework. These and other authors have questioned the use of partial differential equation (PDE)-based approaches to quantify reactive transport because of the difficulty in capturing local-scale mixing and reaction. We take precisely this approach and interpret the experiments mentioned by means of a continuum-scale model based on the ADRE. Our approach differs from previous modeling attempts in that we imbue effects of incomplete mixing at the pore scale in a time-dependent kinetic reaction term and show that this model allows quantitative interpretation of the experiments in terms of both reaction product profiles and time-dependent global production rate. The time dependence of the kinetic term presented accounts for the progressive effects of incomplete mixing due to pore-scale rate-limited mass transfer, and follows a power law, which is consistent with the compilation of existing experiments reported by Haggerty et al. (2004). Our interpretation can form the basis for further research to assess the potential use of PDE approaches for the interpretation of reactive transport problems in moderately heterogeneous media.

AB Prediction of CO2 injection performance in deep subsurface porous media relies on the ability of the well to maintain high flow rates of carbon dioxide during several decades typically without fracturing the host formation or damaging the well. Dynamics of solid particulate suspensions in permeable media are recognized as one major factor leading to injection well plugging in sandstones. The invading supercritical liquid-like fluid can contain exogenous fine suspensions or endogenous particles generated in situ by physical and chemical interactions or hydrodynamic release mechanisms. Suspended solids can plug the pores possibly leading to formation damage and permeability reduction in the vicinity of the injector. In this study we developed a finite volume simulator to predict the injectivity decline near CO2 injection wells and also for production wells in the context of enhanced oil recovery. The numerical model solves a system of two coupled sets of finite volume equations corresponding to the pressure-saturation two-phase flow, and a second subsystem of solute and particle convection-diffusion equations. Particle transport equations are subject to mechanistic rate laws of colloidal, hydrodynamic release from pore surfaces, blocking in pore bodies and pore throats, and interphase particle transfer. The model was validated against available laboratory experiments at the core scale. Example results reveal that lower CO2 residual saturation and formation porosity enhance CO2-wet particle mobility and clogging around sinks and production wells. We conclude from more realistic simulations with heterogeneous permeability spanning several orders of magnitude that the control mode of mobilization, capture of particles, and permeability reduction processes strongly depends on the type of permeability distribution and connectivity between injection and production wells.

AB While the value of correcting raw radar rainfall estimates using simultaneous ground rainfall observations is well known, approaches that use the complete record of both gauge and radar measurements to provide improved rainfall estimates are much less common. We present here two new approaches for estimating radar rainfall that are designed to address known limitations in radar rainfall products by using a relatively long history of radar reflectivity and ground rainfall observations. The first of these two approaches is a radar rainfall estimation algorithm that is nonparametric by construction. Compared to the traditional gauge adjusted parametric relationship between reflectivity (Z) and ground rainfall (R), the suggested new approach is based on a nonparametric radar rainfall estimation method (NPR) derived using the conditional probability distribution of reflectivity and gauge rainfall. The NPR method is applied to the densely gauged Sydney Terrey Hills radar network, where it reduces the RMSE in rainfall estimates by 10%, with improvements observed at 90% of the gauges. The second of the two approaches is a method to merge radar and spatially interpolated gauge measurements. The two sources of information are combined using a dynamic combinatorial algorithm with weights that vary in both space and time. The weight for any specific period is calculated based on the error covariance matrix that is formulated from the radar and spatially interpolated rainfall errors of similar reflectivity periods in a cross-validation setting. The combination method reduces the RMSE by about 20% compared to the traditional Z-R relationship method, and improves estimates compared to spatially interpolated point measurements in sparsely gauged areas.

AB Diffusion both disperses and retards mass movement of contaminants through porous media. The retardation generally involves mass transfer of contaminants from faster to slower flow paths, making prediction more difficult and remediation slower. In ordinary (Fickian) diffusion, root-mean-square displacement of a population of diffusing molecules increases with the square root of the elapsed time, and diffusivity (D, (LT-1)-T-2) of the porous medium is constant in time. The diffusivity can be measured using time-dependent methods such as pulsed field gradient (PFG) magnetic resonance (MR), or steady state diffusion experiments. However, it is known that diffusion behaves anomalously in sparsely connected pore spaces at the percolation threshold. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations using random walks, designed to mimic measurement of D using both time-dependent and steady state methods. In the time-dependent simulations, diffusivity scaled as Dsimilar toT(-0.48) at the percolation threshold. Above the percolation threshold, D decreased at early times, then became constant, with the time required for constant D being greater when the medium was less interconnected. In the steady state simulations we examined the effect of sample size on apparent diffusivity. Above the percolation threshold, diffusivity decreased, then became constant as sample size increased, but at the percolation threshold, diffusivity scaled as Dsimilar toL(-1.83). The drop in diffusivity with sample size was caused by both a decrease in effective porosity and an increase in tortuosity, each of which also followed scaling laws. A single measurement will not suffice to determine whether a sample's pore space is at the percolation threshold, necessitating measurement of diffusivity at more than one scale in time or space. Using a scale-dependent measurement to make predictions at a different scale can result in serious overestimation or underestimation of diffusive mass transfer and consequent retardation.

AB The subsurface hydrological response plays an important role in the hydrology of humid regions. In particular, the physical relationship between base flow dynamics and the fluctuations in spatially averaged water table depth, as described by the groundwater rating curve, determine to a significant extent the nature of statistical persistence of hydrological anomalies in the unconfined aquifers level and river flow. In this paper, we propose that the scale and shape of the groundwater rating curve reflect some of the geomorphological characteristics of the region such as relief, drainage density, and the hypsometric distribution of the elevation field. These connections between geomorphology and hydrology of river basins are investigated using a simple model of unconfined groundwater flow applied to synthetic basins as well as observed basins from Illinois.

AB Surface microtopography affects overland flow, infiltration, soil erosion, pollutant transport, and other fundamental hydrologic and environmental processes across scales. Under the influence of surface depressions, overland flow essentially features a series of progressive puddle-to-puddle (P2P) filling, spilling, merging, and splitting processes. The objectives of this study are to characterize puddles and their hierarchical relationships and model the microtopography-controlled P2P processes. We proposed a new modeling framework for simulating the P2P overland flow dynamics through cell-to-cell (C2C) and P2P routing for a set of puddle-based units (PBUs) in a well-delineated, cascaded P2P drainage system. Testing of the P2P model demonstrated its potential to improve overland flow modeling and hydrologic connectivity analysis by explicitly incorporating the hydrologic roles of depressions and quantifying the real microtopography-controlled P2P dynamics.

AB A widely used procedure for interpreting results of hydraulic pulse tests involves an analysis that is based on the piezo-conduction equation. In this paper, the range of applicability of the classical piezo-conduction equation is examined in the light of results derived from Biot's classical theory of poroelasticity, which takes into account complete coupling involving fluid flow and skeletal deformations along with influences of grain compressibility. Comparisons are made between the two approaches by considering typical low permeability rocks including Westerly Granite and Indiana Limestone, where the permeabilities can vary by orders of magnitude. These studies are complemented by experiments performed on samples of Stanstead Granite, the results of which were analyzed employing the different approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The role of lithology in influencing basin form and function is explored empirically by investigating correlations between a range of catchment variables, where the spatial unit of analysis is not surface catchments but lithologically coherent groundwater units. Using the Thames basin, UK, as a case study, nine groundwater units have been identified. Values for 11 hydrological and geomorphological variables, including rainfall, drainage density, Baseflow Index, aquifer porosity, storage coefficient and log-hydraulic conductivity, aquifer and drainage elevation, river incision, and hypsometric integral have been estimated for each of the groundwater units in the basin, and Pearson correlation coefficients calculated for all pairs of variables. Seven of the correlation coefficients are found to be significant at a confidence level of >99%. Negative correlations between drainage density and log aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and between drainage density and river incision, and positive correlations between log-hydraulic conductivity and river incision, log-hydraulic conductivity and Baseflow Index, and between Baseflow Index and river incision are inferred to have consistent causal explanations. For example, incision of rivers into aquifers leads to relative increases in hydraulic gradients in the vicinity of rivers which, in turn, promotes the development of secondary porosity increasing both aquifer hydraulic conductivity and, hence, Baseflow Index. The implication of this interpretation is that the geomorphological evolution of basins is intimately linked to the evolution of hydraulic conductivity of the underlying aquifers. This is consistent with, and supports the notion of a coupled complexly evolving surface water-groundwater system. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents strategies for vectorizing finite element codes in simulating large groundwater flow and transport problems. The approaches take advantage of vector-processing capabilities of the Cray Y-MP by regulating the node-element and node-node relationships. Regularization is achieved by adding auxiliary nodes and elements around the simulation domain. Vectorization of the global matrix assembly is due solely to the regularity of incidence matrix definition, while the vectorization of the iterative solver takes advantage of the regularity of the node-node relationship and the concepts of wavefronts. The vectorization schemes are illustrated using the code VapourT. Rectangular elements are also added to the VapourT in addition to its original triangular elements. Test runs of the vectorized code with the vector processor turned on (VT4) versus the original code with the vector processor turned off (VT1) for triangular elements indicate overall speedups of 6-10.93 times in terms of CPU seconds. Part of the speedup results from the ability to eliminate some addressing subroutines. However, most of the speedup is due to the vectorization scheme. The speedups purely due to vectorization for the vectorized code (from VT3 to VT4) are 3.51-5.81 times in terms of CPU seconds for triangular elements and 4.28-7.25 (from VT5 to VT6) for rectangular elements.

AB We assess the ability of 11 models to reproduce three-phase oil relative permeability (k(ro)) laboratory data obtained in a water-wet sandstone sample. We do so by considering model performance when (i) solely two-phase data are employed to render predictions of k(ro) and (ii) two and three-phase data are jointly used for model calibration. In the latter case, a Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach is used to estimate model parameters. The tested models are selected among (i) classical models routinely employed in practical applications and implemented in commercial reservoir software and (ii) relatively recent models which are considered to allow overcoming some drawbacks of the classical formulations. Among others, the latter set of models includes the formulation recently proposed by Ranaee et al. (2015), which has been shown to embed the critical effects of hysteresis, including the reproduction of oil remobilization induced by gas injection in water-wet media. We employ formal model discrimination criteria to rank models according to their skill to reproduce the observed data and use ML Bayesian model averaging to provide model-averaged estimates (and associated uncertainty bounds) of k(ro) by taking advantage of the diverse interpretive abilities of all models analyzed. The occurrence of elliptic regions is also analyzed for selected models in the framework of the classical fractional flow theory of displacement. Our study confirms that model outcomes based on channel flow theory and classical saturation-weighted interpolation models do not generally yield accurate reproduction of k(ro) data, especially in the regime associated with low oil saturations, where water alternating gas injection (WAG) techniques are usually employed for enhanced oil recovery. This negative feature is not observed in the model of Ranaee et al. (2015) due to its ability to embed key effects of pore-scale phase distributions, such as hysteresis effects and cycle dependency, for modeling k(ro) observed during WAG.

AB Water fluxes in catchments are controlled by physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous, and poorly characterized by direct measurement. As a result, parsimonious theories of catchment hydrology remain elusive. Here I describe how one class of catchments (those in which discharge is determined by the volume of water in storage) can be characterized as simple first-order nonlinear dynamical systems, and I show that the form of their governing equations can be inferred directly from measurements of streamflow fluctuations. I illustrate this approach using data from the headwaters of the Severn and Wye rivers at Plynlimon in mid-Wales. This approach leads to quantitative estimates of catchment dynamic storage, recession time scales, and sensitivity to antecedent moisture, suggesting that it is useful for catchment characterization. It also yields a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be used to directly simulate the streamflow hydrograph from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series. This single-equation rainfall-runoff model predicts streamflow at Plynlimon as accurately as other models that are much more highly parameterized. It can also be analytically inverted; thus, it can be used to '' do hydrology backward,'' that is, to infer time series of whole-catchment precipitation directly from fluctuations in streamflow. At Plynlimon, precipitation rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations agree with rain gauge measurements as closely as two rain gauges in each catchment agree with each other. These inferred precipitation rates are not calibrated to precipitation measurements in any way, making them a strong test of the underlying theory. The same approach can be used to estimate whole-catchment evapotranspiration rates during rainless periods. At Plynlimon, evapotranspiration rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations exhibit seasonal and diurnal cycles that agree semiquantitatively with Penman-Monteith estimates. Thus, streamflow hydrographs may be useful for reconstructing precipitation and evapotranspiration records where direct measurements are unavailable, unreliable, or unrepresentative at the scale of the landscape.

AB This study examines the role of rainfall variability on the spatial scaling structure of peak flows using the Whitewater River basin in Kansas as an illustration. Specifically, we investigate the effect of rainfall on the scatter, the scale break and the power law (peak flows vs. upstream areas) regression exponent. We illustrate why considering individual hydrographs at the outlet of a basin can lead to misleading interpretations of the effects of rainfall variability. We begin with the simple scenario of a basin receiving spatially uniform rainfall of varying intensities and durations and subsequently investigate the role of storm advection velocity, storm variability characterized by variance, spatial correlation and intermittency. Finally, we use a realistic space-time rainfall field obtained from a popular rainfall model that combines the aforementioned features. For each of these scenarios, we employ a recent formulation of flow velocity for a network of channels, assume idealized conditions of runoff generation and flow dynamics and calculate peak flow scaling exponents, which are then compared to the scaling exponent of the width function maxima. Our results show that the peak flow scaling exponent is always larger than the width function scaling exponent. The simulation scenarios are used to identify the smaller scale basins, whose response is dominated by the rainfall variability and the larger scale basins, which are driven by rainfall volume, river network aggregation and flow dynamics. The rainfall variability has a greater impact on peak flows at smaller scales. The effect of rainfall variability is reduced for larger scale basins as the river network aggregates and smoothes out the storm variability. The results obtained from simple scenarios are used to make rigorous interpretations of the peak flow scaling structure that is obtained from rainfall generated with the space-time rainfall model and realistic rainfall fields derived from NEXRAD radar data.

ID SIMULATION
AB In this work, we address the problem of characterizing the heterogeneity and uncertainty of hydraulic properties for complex geological settings. Hereby, we distinguish between two scales of heterogeneity, namely the hydrofacies structure and the intrafacies variability of the hydraulic properties. We employ multiple-point geostatistics to characterize the hydrofacies architecture. The multiple-point statistics are borrowed from a training image that is designed to reflect the prior geological conceptualization. The intrafacies variability of the hydraulic properties is represented using conventional two-point correlation methods, more precisely, spatial covariance models under a multi-Gaussian spatial law. We address the different levels and sources of uncertainty in characterizing the subsurface heterogeneity, and explore their effect on groundwater flow and transport predictions. Typically, uncertainty is assessed by way of many images, termed realizations, of a fixed statistical model. However, in many cases, sampling from a fixed stochastic model does not adequately represent the space of uncertainty. It neglects the uncertainty related to the selection of the stochastic model and the estimation of its input parameters. We acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in the definition of the prior conceptual model of aquifer architecture and in the estimation of global statistics, anisotropy, and correlation scales. Spatial bootstrap is used to assess the uncertainty of the unknown statistical parameters. As an illustrative example, we employ a synthetic field that represents a fluvial setting consisting of an interconnected network of channel sands embedded within finer-grained floodplain material. For this highly non-stationary setting we quantify the groundwater flow and transport model prediction uncertainty for various levels of hydrogeological uncertainty. Results indicate the importance of accurately describing the facies geometry, especially for transport predictions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To better understand how tides affect the soil conditions of salt marshes, pore-water flow in a modeled 3-D creek-marsh system was simulated under the influence of both monochromatic and spring-neap tides. In analyzing the simulation results, six indices, viz., marsh surface elevation (SE), hydroperiod (HP), shortest distance to creeks (SDC), mean soil water saturation (MSS), soil saturation index (SSI), and net water flux (NWF), were examined across the marsh surface. The results demonstrated that MSS, SSI, and NWF exhibited corresponding patterns of spatial variations, which were related to marsh SE, HP, SDC, and tidal regime. Although the relationships could be described by a simple function under monochromatic tides, under spring-neap tides, the relationships were more complex with different behaviors in the lower and upper marsh areas. The SDC was a critically important factor affecting soil conditions. Well-aerated and -drained zones coexisted near the creek under both monochromatic and spring-neap tides. Spring-neap tides led to improved soil aeration in the upper marsh, including the interior section (away from the creek) where the HP and inundation frequency were reduced during neap tides. However, the local flushing condition did not improve correspondingly. The study suggests that single morphological index cannot describe the soil conditions adequately. A proper representation of the soil conditions for plant growth and distribution should take into account not only the aeration condition but also the flushing condition. For that purpose, a composite index is needed to combine the soil water saturation index and the net flux index. Citation: Xin, P., L. Li, and D. A.

AB In this study, a first-order, nonstationary stochastic model of transient flow is developed which is applicable to the entire domain of a bounded vadose zone in the presence of sink/source. We derive general equations governing the statistical moments of the flow quantities by perturbation expansions. Owing to the mathematical complexity of the equations, in general we need to solve them numerically. The numerical moment equation approach, however, has the flexibility in handling different boundary conditions, flow configurations, input covariance structures, and soil constitutive relationships. The moment equations presented in this study are simpler and easier to solve than those in the literature for transient unsaturated how. We solve these moment equations by the method of finite differences and demonstrate the developed model through some one- and two-dimensional examples under various transient conditions.

AB A field investigation of the effects of rainfall and slope angle on splash detachment was conducted for 5 months, using 27 splash cups in a Japanese cypress plantation in southern Japan. The unit, kinetic energy of throughfall (J m(-2) mm(-1)), was found to be constant and independent of rainfall intensity, indicating that splash detachment can be related to both throughfall intensity and soil slope. The linear correlation coefficient was highly significant for both the maximum throughfall intensity over 1 h (RI1h) and the average splash detachment of all splash cups, although individual cups varied widely. No consistent relationship was found between the splash detachment rate and slope angle for individual periods. This variation in the relationship between splash detachment and slope angle was attributed to the effect of soil crusting and ponding on splash detachment. Splash detachment on a gentler slope (14) exhibited a strong relationship with the maximum throughfall intensity lasting for short periods of 10-30 min. In contrast, the splash detachment from slopes >35 degrees highly correlated with the maximum throughfall intensity over 3 h. This suggests that a longer period is required to prevent the splash detachment due to ponded water on steeper slopes. On gentler slopes, prolonged rainfall may result in a higher ponding depth, thereby reducing raindrop impact and causing less splash detachment. Thus, under forest canopies, the effect of slope angle on the rainfall parameter should be incorporated into future splash erosion models. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Most simulators for subsurface flow of water, gas, and oil phases use empirical correlations, such as Henry's law, for the CO2 composition in the aqueous phase, and equations of state (EOS) that do not represent the polar interactions between CO2 and water. Widely used simulators are also based on lowest-order finite difference methods and suffer from numerical dispersion and grid sensitivity. They may not capture the viscous and gravitational fingering that can negatively affect hydrocarbon (HC) recovery, or aid carbon sequestration in aquifers. We present a three-phase compositional model based on higher-order finite element methods and incorporate rigorous and efficient three-phase-split computations for either three HC phases or water-oil-gas systems. For HC phases, we use the Peng-Robinson EOS. We allow solubility of CO2 in water and adopt a new cubic-plus-association (CPA) EOS, which accounts for cross association between H2O and CO2 molecules, and association between H2O molecules. The CPA-EOS is highly accurate over a broad range of pressures and temperatures. The main novelty of this work is the formulation of a reservoir simulator with new EOS-based unique three-phase-split computations, which satisfy both the equalities of fugacities in all three phases and the global minimum of Gibbs free energy. We provide five examples that demonstrate twice the convergence rate of our method compared with a finite difference approach, and compare with experimental data and other simulators. The examples consider gravitational fingering during CO2 sequestration in aquifers, viscous fingering in water-alternating-gas injection, and full compositional modeling of three HC phases.

AB Aquatic macrophytes are often the dominant factor influencing flow conditions within the channels they occupy. Existing knowledge of how stream plants affect the flow is outlined, and the different scales at which vegetation resistance operates are proposed. Resistance is shown to be a function of the size of the plants, their structural properties, location in the channel, and the local flow conditions. Current models to calculate this composite resistance effect are assessed in the light of theoretical considerations of the nature of vegetation resistance. New theory is also presented, which demonstrates the non-linear relationship between channel resistance and the proportion of the channel occupied by vegetation.

AB Soil water dynamics are very important for understanding and managing water movement in agricultural irrigation; Therefore, it is of great significance to establish an efficient and accurate infiltration model to simulate soil water dynamics. In this work, based on the finite volume method discrete format and principal variable transformation technology, the Taylor first-order expansion is used to solve the Richards equation, the adaptive time step is controlled by the change of soil maximum saturation, the CMS and BiCGSTAB are used to solve the large sparse matrix generated by the implicit format, and the generalized Ross infiltration model is generated. The validity of the model was verified by mass conservation and field experiment, and the soil water dynamic change law of hole irrigation with two irrigation methods (HSI and HAI) was explored by the model. The result shows that the generalized Ross infiltration model based on CMS and BiCGSTAB can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the model; the main variable transformation technique of the generalized Ross infiltration model improves the mass conservation of the model. Balancing the model accuracy and calculation efficiency, a scientific and reasonable time step can be determined by controlling the change in maximum effective saturation (delta S-emax), the generalized Ross infiltration model is found to accurately simulate soil-water dynamics under hole irrigation (R-2 > 0.9). It is found that HSI and HAI in four-hole irrigation provides more possibilities for further realizing the movement of soil nutrients with water without considering the evaporation of irrigation holes or small evaporation. If the time and infiltration volume fitting curve determined with the indoor single-hole infiltration test is used to control the water volume, HSI requires longer infiltration time to reach the same irrigation volume.

AB Power law correlation properties of sign and magnitude series have been studied based on the series of observation records of flow of the River Yangtze. The results obtained give improved insight into and understanding of the linear and non-linear processes of the water cycle. With the newly developed Delayed Vector Variance method and the surrogate test, the documented linkage between the sign series and the linear process, and that between the magnitude series and non-linear process can be verified. The spectra estimated by detrended fluctuation analysis method show different properties of intra-annual and inter-annual correlations in both sign and magnitude series. The linear process behaves as an 1/f noise at a time scale less than about 60 days, but shows features of anti-persistence in terms of long-term fluctuation. The magnitudes are clustered in three ways mainly caused by non-linear processes, i.e. periodic clustering, strong short-term clustering of 1/f noise at time scales less than 20 days, and long-term clustering with weak persistence.

AB Evaporation from bare soil is an important component of a catchment water balance. However, it is arguably one of the most challenging hydrological processes to estimate and measure accurately. Several approaches to estimate soil evaporation exist, but their performance for specific water table conditions remains unclear. This study investigated the performance of four commonly used approaches and several ways on how to implement them: the energy-balanced based FAO-56 method with the skin evaporation enhancement (FAO-56 skin), hydraulic methods based on groundwater level fluctuation (GLF), Darcy's law, and the maximum entropy production (MEP) method based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory. Three lysimeters with different water table depths were used at a research site in the Guanzhong Basin of China. The lysimeters were equipped with soil moisture probes. Water table fluctuations were also measured. The data allow us to accurately estimate evaporation rates using a water balance approach and are used to assess the performance of the analysed methods. The results show that: (1) The MEP method performed best for all water table conditions, but tends to overestimate evaporation if the water table is below the extinction depth. The extinction depth is the depth of the water table were there the contribution of groundwater to bare-soil evaporation is zero. In our case, the extinction depth was 78 cm. (2) The FAO-56 skin method underestimated evaporation where the water table was above the extinction depth, and vice versa. (3) The groundwater level fluctuation method significantly overestimated the evaporation if the specific yield was estimated using hydraulic methods. The groundwater level fluctuation method should be combined with a soil water balance, independent of water table conditions. The method can only be applied if the water table is above the extinction depth. (4) Conceptually, Darcy's law was suitable for estimating evaporation. However, the estimation of the required parameters is challenging. A good fit could only be obtained through calibration to measured evaporation rates.

AB Risk assessment requires a description of the probabilistic properties of hydrological variables. In a number of cases, this description is made on a single variable, whereas most hydrological events are intrinsically multivariate. In this context, copulas have recently received attention in order to derive a multivariate frequency analysis. After a reminder of the general results in the field of multivariate extreme value theory.. the paper gives a description of a very simple copula, the Gaussian copula. Four case studies demonstrate its usefulness in the contexts of field significance determination, regional risk analysis, discharge-duration-frequency (QdF) models with design hydrograph derivation and regional frequency analysis. The limitations and potential errors related to this statistical toot are also highlighted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, new analytical solutions of the linearized parabolic approximation (LPA) of the De Saint Venant equations (DSVEs) are derived for the case of finite channel length. The new solutions, which take into account upstream and lateral inflows, are found considering two types of boundary conditions at the downstream end, namely a stage-discharge relationship and a time dependent flow depth. The solutions, for both discharge and water depth, are first determined in the Laplace Transform domain, and the Laplace Transform Inversion Theorem is used in order to find the corresponding time domain expressions. Finally, the effects induced on the flow propagation by the downstream boundary condition are analyzed using the new analytical solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] This analysis addresses three important conceptual problems in the measurement of direct and indirect costs and benefits: (1) the distribution of impacts between a regional economy and the encompassing state economy; (2) the distinction between indirect impacts and indirect costs (IC), focusing on the dynamic time path unemployed resources follow to find alternative employment; and (3) the distinction among the affected firms' microeconomic categories of fixed and variable costs as they are used to compute regional direct and indirect costs. It uses empirical procedures that reconcile the usual measures of economic impact provided by input/output models with the estimates of economic costs and benefits required for analysis of welfare changes. The paper illustrates the relationships and magnitudes involved in the context of water policy issues facing the Pecos River Basin of New Mexico.

AB Confidence intervals based on classical regression theories augmented to include prior information and credible intervals based on Bayesian theories are conceptually different ways to quantify parametric and predictive uncertainties. Because both confidence and credible intervals are used in environmental modeling, we seek to understand their differences and similarities. This is of interest in part because calculating confidence intervals typically requires tens to thousands of model runs, while Bayesian credible intervals typically require tens of thousands to millions of model runs. Given multi-Gaussian distributed observation errors, our theoretical analysis shows that, for linear or linearized-nonlinear models, confidence and credible intervals are always numerically identical when consistent prior information is used. For nonlinear models, nonlinear confidence and credible intervals can be numerically identical if parameter confidence regions defined using the approximate likelihood method and parameter credible regions estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo realizations are numerically identical and predictions are a smooth, monotonic function of the parameters. Both occur if intrinsic model nonlinearity is small. While the conditions of Gaussian errors and small intrinsic model nonlinearity are violated by many environmental models, heuristic tests using analytical and numerical models suggest that linear and nonlinear confidence intervals can be useful approximations of uncertainty even under significantly nonideal conditions. In the context of epistemic model error for a complex synthetic nonlinear groundwater problem, the linear and nonlinear confidence and credible intervals for individual models performed similarly enough to indicate that the computationally frugal confidence intervals can be useful in many circumstances. Experiences with these groundwater models are expected to be broadly applicable to many environmental models. We suggest that for environmental problems with lengthy execution times that make credible intervals inconvenient or prohibitive, confidence intervals can provide important insight. During model development when frequent calculation of uncertainty intervals is important to understanding the consequences of various model construction alternatives and data collection strategies, strategic use of both confidence and credible intervals can be critical.

AB Field experiments at Tiramoana station 30 km north of Christchurch. New Zealand using an erosion plot 16.5 m long 0.6 m wide. and with a slope of 14- 14.5 degrees on rendzina soil aimed to measure the variability of flow velocity and of soil aggregates transport rate in shallow overland flow. Discharge/cross-section area ratio was used to estimate mean velocity, and high-speed digital video camera and image analysis provided information about flow and sediment transport variability. Six flow runs with 0.5-3.0 L s(-1) discharges were supercritical with Froude numbers dose to or more than 1. Mean flow velocity followed Poiseuille law. float numbers were more than 1-5 and hydraulic resistance was an inverse proportional function of the Reynolds number, which is typical for laminar flows. Hence actual velocity varied through time significantly and the power spectrum was of 'red-noise'. which is typical for turbulent flow. Sediment transport rates had even higher variability, and soil aggregates transport was a compound Poisson process. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Stream tube integration method for analysing subsurface fluid flow

DE stream tube integration; moving mesh; integral finite difference method
ID POROUS-MEDIA
AB A stream tube integration method is introduced to solve transient subsurface fluid flow problems. The method combines a geometry-embedded form of Darcy's Law and the notion of location of average. Two types of problems, transient radial flow to a well of finite radius in an areally infinite aquifer and in a double porosity system, are solved by the stream tube integration method and the integral finite difference method. Results of the solutions show that the stream tube integration method, with fixed coarse mesh, are more accurate and better behaved than the integral finite difference method, with fine mesh. The fixed mesh stream tube integration method is readily extended to the moving mesh method. With much coarse mesh, the moving mesh technique can obtain the same accurate results as the fixed mesh stream tube integration method. It is suggested that the stream tube integration method is a viable way to state, solve, interpret and verify numerical solutions. The method provides efficient computation and improved accuracy for analysing subsurface fluid flow. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The sustainability of water resources is a critical factor in the development and the ongoing viability of healthy communities. Determining, with great certainty, that systems can be developed to ensure that sustainability is a great challenge to water resource systems engineers. The greatest design, planning, and management challenges lie in the engineer's limited ability to quantify potential future conditions. This study explores the utility of fuzzy set theory in the field of water resource systems reliability analysis and proposes three new fuzzy reliability measures: (1) a combined reliability-vulnerability index, (2) a robustness index, and (3) a resiliency index. These measures were evaluated using two simple hypothetical case studies of water supply systems. The indices suggested are able to handle different fuzzy representations and different system conditions.

AB The development of a Bayesian modeling approach for estimation of the age distribution of groundwater using radioactive isotopes and anthropogenic chemicals is described. The model considers the uncertainties associated with the measured tracer concentrations as well as the parameters affecting the concentration of tracers in the groundwater, and it provides the posterior probability densities of the parameters defining the groundwater age distribution using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The model also incorporates the effect of dissolution of aquifer minerals on diluting the C-14 signature and the uncertainties associated with this process on the inferred age distribution parameters. Two demonstration modeling cases have been performed. First, the method was applied to simulated tracer concentrations at a discharge point of a hypothetical 2-D vertical aquifer with two recharge zones, leading to a mixed groundwater age distribution under different presumed uncertainties. When the error variance of the observed tracer concentrations is considered unknown, the method can estimate the parameters of the fitted exponential-lognormal distribution with a relatively narrow credible interval when five hypothetical samples are assumed to be collected at the discharge point. However, when a single sample is assumed, the credible intervals become wider, and credible estimations of the parameters are not obtained. Second, the method was applied to the data collected at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. In this demonstration application, nine different forms of presumed groundwater age distributions have been considered, including four single forms and five mixed forms, assuming the groundwater consists of distinct young and old fractions. For the medium geometrical standard deviation delta(c, i) = 1.41, the model estimates a young groundwater age of between 0 and 350 years, with the largest odds being given to a mean age of approximately 100 years, and a fraction of young groundwater of between 15% to roughly 60%, with the largest odds for 30%. However, the method cannot definitively rule out larger fractions of young groundwater. The model provides a much more uncertain estimation of the age of old groundwater, with a credible interval of between 20,000 to 200,000 years.

AB This is a computational study of gravity-driven fingering instabilities in unsaturated porous media. The governing equations and corresponding numerical scheme are based on the work of Nieber et al. (2003) in which nonmonotonic saturation profiles are obtained by supplementing the Richards equation with a nonequilibrium capillary pressure-saturation relationship, as well as including hysteretic effects. The first part of the study takes an extensive look at the sensitivity of the finger solutions to certain key parameters in the model such as capillary shape parameter, initial saturation, and capillary relaxation coefficient. The second part is a comparison to published experimental results that demonstrates the ability of the model to capture realistic fingering behavior.

AB Socio-hydrology focuses on studying the dynamics and co-evolution of coupled human and water systems. Recently, several new socio-hydrologic models have been published that explore these dynamics, and these models offer unique opportunities to better understand these coupled systems and to understand how water problems evolve similarly in different regions. These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems. They will allow us to explore multiple working hypotheses to greatly expand insights and understanding of coupled socio-hydrologic systems.

AB This study explores linkages between the microbial composition and hydrochemical variables of pristine groundwater to identify active redox conditions and processes. Two confined aquifers underlying the city of Qianjiang in the Jianghan Plain in China were selected for this study, having different recharge sources and strong hydrochemical gradients. Typical methods for establishing redox processes according to threshold concentration criteria for geochemical parameters suggest iron or sulphate reduction processes. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to obtain diversity and taxonomic information on microbial communities. Instead of revealing iron- and sulphate-reducing bacteria, salt- and alkali-tolerant bacteria, such as the phylum Firmicutes and the class Gammaproteobacteria, and in particular, the family Bacillaceae, were dominant in the downstream groundwater of the first aquifer that had high ion concentrations caused by the dissolution of calcite and dolomite; meanwhile, the heterotrophic microaerophilic families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae prevailed in the upstream groundwater of the first aquifer. Sulphate-reducing bacteria were extremely abundant in the upstream groundwater of the second aquifer, as the SO42- concentration was especially high. Methanogens and methanotrophs were predominant in the downstream groundwater of the second aquifer even though the concentration of SO42- was much higher than 0.5 mg L-1. The microbial communities, together with the geochemical parameters, indicated that the upstream region of the first aquifer was suboxic, that Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reductions were not the main redox processes in the downstream groundwater of the first aquifer with high Fe and Mn concentrations, and that the redox processes in the upstream and downstream regions of the second confined aquifer were SO42- reduction and methanogenesis, respectively. This study expands understanding of the linkages between microbial communities and hydrogeochemistry in pristine groundwaters and provides more evidence for identifying active redox conditions and processes.

AB Mixing fronts, where fluids of different chemical compositions mix with each other, are known to represent hotspots of chemical reaction in hydrological systems. These fronts are typically subjected to velocity gradients, ranging from the pore scale due to no slip boundary conditions at fluid solid interfaces, to the catchment scale due to permeability variations and complex geometry of the Darcy velocity streamlines. A common trait of these processes is that the mixing interface is strained by shear. Depending on the Peclet number Pe, which represents the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic shear time, and the Damkohler number Da, which represents the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time, the local reaction rates can be strongly impacted by the dynamics of the mixing interface. So far, this impact has been characterized mostly either in kinetics-limited or in mixing-limited conditions, that is, for either low or high Da. Here the coupling of shear flow and chemical reactivity is investigated for arbitrary Damkohler numbers, for a bimolecular reaction and an initial interface with separated reactants. Approximate analytical expressions for the global production rate and reactive mixing scale are derived based on a reactive lamella approach that allows for a general coupling between stretching enhanced mixing and chemical reactions. While for Pe < Da, reaction kinetics and stretching effects are decoupled, a scenario which we name "weak stretching", for Pe > Da, we uncover a "strong stretching" scenario where new scaling laws emerge from the interplay between reaction kinetics, diffusion, and stretching. The analytical results are validated against numerical simulations. These findings shed light on the effect of flow heterogeneity on the enhancement of chemical reaction and the creation of spatially localized hotspots of reactivity for a broad range of systems ranging from kinetic limited to mixing limited situations.

TI Non-asymptotic Weibull tails explain the statistics of extreme daily
   precipitation
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

ID FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; MAXIMUM
AB The exceedance probability of extreme daily precipitation is usually quantified assuming asymptotic behaviours. Non-asymptotic statistics, however, would allow us to describe extremes with reduced uncertainty and to establish relations between physical processes and emerging extremes. These approaches are still mistrusted by part of the community as they rely on assumptions on the tail behaviour of the daily precipitation distribution. This paper addresses this gap. We use global quality -controlled long rain gauge records to show that daily precipitation annual maxima are samples likely emerging from Weibull tails in most of the stations worldwide. These non-asymptotic tails can explain the statistics of observed extremes better than asymptotic approximations from extreme value theory. We call for a renewed consideration of non-asymptotic statistics for the description of extremes.

AB The aim of this paper is to explore how rainfall mechanisms and catchment characteristics shape the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities. We propose a new approach of comparing intensity-duration-frequency statistics of maximum annual rainfall with those of maximum annual streamflow in order to infer the catchment behavior for runoff extremes. We calibrate parsimonious intensity-duration-frequency scaling models to data from 314 rain gauges and 428 stream gauges in Austria, and analyze the spatial patterns of the resulting distributions and model parameters. Results indicate that rainfall extremes tend to be more variable in the dry lowland catchments dominated by convective rainfall than in the mountainous catchments where annual rainfall is higher and rainfall mechanisms are mainly orographic. Flood frequency curves are always steeper than the corresponding rainfall frequency curves with the exception of glaciated catchments. Based on the proposed approach of combined intensity-duration-frequency statistics we analyze elasticities as the percent change of flood discharge for a 1% change in extreme rainfall through comparing rainfall and flood quantiles. In wet catchments, the elasticities tend to unity, i.e. rainfall and flood frequency curves have similar steepness, due to persistently high soil moisture levels. In dry catchments, elasticities are much higher, implying steeper frequency curves of floods than those of rainfall, which is interpreted in terms of more skewed distributions of event runoff coefficients. While regional differences in the elasticities can be attributed to both dominating regional rainfall mechanisms and regional catchment characteristics, our results suggest that catchment characteristics are the dominating controls. With increasing return period, elasticities tend towards unity, which is consistent with various runoff generation concepts. Our findings may be useful for process-based flood frequency extrapolation and climate impact studies, and further studies are encouraged to explore the tail behavior of elasticities.

AB [1] The Hydrological Synthesis special section presents synthesis topics that have the potential to revolutionize hydrological sciences in a manner needed to meet critical water challenges that we now face. The special section also highlights topics that are important and exciting enough to compel researchers to engage in collaborative synthesis activities. This introductory paper provides a brief overview of nine papers that are included in this special section, which discuss the synthesis of tools, data, concepts, theories, or approaches across disciplines and scales. The wide range of topics that are explored include groundwater quality, river restoration, water management, nitrogen cycling, and Earth surface dynamics. Collectively, the special section papers illustrate that the challenge to deal effectively with complex water problems is not purely a scientific, technological, or socioeconomic one; it is instead a complex, 21st century problem that requires coordinated synthesis.

AB We consider a steady, uniform, dense, fully-saturated, gravity-driven, inclined flow of water and identical spherical grains over an erodible bed between parallel, vertical sidewalls. The grains are inelastic and the energy lost in their interaction is also influenced by the fluid viscosity. We use an extension of kinetic theory for dense flows and employ approximate integrations of the momentum and energy balances for the grains in order to obtain analytical expressions for the depth of flow and for the volume flow rate of the mixture as functions of inclination and average concentration. We also predict the range of slopes for which dense, fully-saturated flows are possible. The predictions are in reasonable agreement with already published experimental results.

AB We present an overview of the most common numerical solution strategies for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, including fully implicit formulations, artificial compressibility methods, penalty formulations, and operator splitting methods (pressure/velocity correction, projection methods). A unified framework that explains popular operator splitting methods as special cases of a fully implicit approach is also presented and can be used for constructing new and improved solution strategies. The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids. Emphasis is put on showing the close relationship between (seemingly) different and competing solution approaches for incompressible viscous flow. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Electrical resistivity/induced polarization (0.1-1000 Hz) and vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-nu) measurements of peat samples extracted from different depths (0-11 m) in a peatland in Maine were obtained as a function of pore fluid conductivity (sigma(w)) between 0.001 and 2 S/m. Hydraulic conductivity increased with sigma(w) (K-nu proportional to sigma(w)(0.3) between 0.001 and 2 S/m), indicating that pore dilation occurs due to the reaction of NaCl with organic functional groups as postulated by previous workers. Electrical measurements were modeled by assuming that "bulk'' electrolytic conduction through the interconnected pore space and surface conduction in the electrical double layer (EDL) at the organic sediment-fluid interface act in parallel. This analysis suggests that pore space dilation causes a nonlinear relationship between the "bulk'' electrolytic conductivity (sigma(el)) and sigma(w) (sigma(el) proportional to sigma(w)(1.3)). The Archie equation predicts a linear dependence of sigma(el) on sigma(w) and thus appears inappropriate for organic sediments. Induced polarization (IP) measurements of the imaginary part (sigma"(surf)) of the surface conductivity (sigma*(surf)) show that sigma"(surf) is greater and more strongly sigma(w)-dependent (sigma"(surf) proportional to sigma(w)(0.5) between 0.001 and 2 S/m) than observed for inorganic sediments. By assuming a linear relationship between the real (sigma'(surf)) and the imaginary part (sigma"(surf)) of the surface conductivity, we develop an empirical model relating the resistivity and induced polarization measurements to sigma(w) in peat. We demonstrate the use of this model to predict (a) sigma(w) and (b) the change in K-nu due to an incremental change in sigma(w) from resistivity and induced polarization measurements on organic sediments. Our study has implications for noninvasive geophysical characterization of sigma(w) and K-nu with potential to benefit studies of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes as well as nutrient supply dynamics in peatlands.

AB This article employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for prediction of Evaporation Losses (E) in reservoirs. SVM that is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning theory, uses regression technique by introducing e-insensitive loss function has been adopted. RVM is based on a Bayesian formulation of a linear model with an appropriate prior that results in a sparse representation. The input of SVM and RVM models are mean air temperature (T) ( degrees C), average wind speed (WS) (m/sec), sunshine hours (SH)(hrs/day), and mean relative humidity (RH) (%). Equations have been also developed for prediction of E. The developed RVM model gives variance of the predicted E. A comparative study has also been presented between SVM, RVM and ANN models. The results indicate that the developed SVM and RVM can be used as a practical tool for prediction of E. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Although many optimization models for water quality problems have been developed, methodology for judging the necessity of applying them is scarcely worked out. The universal optimization scheme presented here is to determine a management strategy for controlling water quality in a generic body of water. Dynamics of a water quality index is represented by an ordinary differential equation, and a linear system model is deduced. The H-infinity control theory, which summarizes system stabilization and error minimization, is applied to a generalized water quality control problem including the linear system model. A class of H-infinity controllers is identified, and a temporal discretization scheme for a controller is proposed. Three application examples demonstrate the conception of universal optimization and the validity of its implementation using an H-infinity controller. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The anomalous dispersion observed in solute transport through porous media is often attributed to media heterogeneity at various scales, while chemical movement in homogenous media is traditionally thought to be Fickian. There has been increasing evidence over the past few years that even in carefully packed homogenous media, solute movement may not be Fickian as previously thought. On the basis of a pore- scale modeling, we demonstrate that in a simple uniform porous medium where all pores are well hydraulically connected, the movement of passive tracers appears to be anomalous. It is found that the macroscopic dispersion coefficient increases with time approximately in a power law prior to reaching an asymptotic value, but the spatial distribution of the plume remains non- Gaussian and cannot be described adequately by the advection-dispersion equation. In particular, the spatial distribution of the plume has a persistent tail that does not decay with the distance from the peak in c alpha exp(-bx(2)) as predicted by the advection-dispersion equation but in c alpha exp(-a vertical bar x vertical bar) with a depending on the Peclet number. The concentration in the plume front, on the other hand, decays faster than predicted by the advection- dispersion equation. Comparing the results to the continuous time random walk (CTRW) reveals that the solute movement is well described by CTRW with a modified exponentially distributed transition time. The plume shows a transition from anomalous to normal distributions but at a slow rate. Given the time it takes for such a transition to complete in such a uniform medium, it is anticipated that in natural media where multiple- scale heterogeneity exists, a transition from anomalous to normal transports may never complete.

AB Mangrove forests can significantly attenuate tsunami waves and thus play an important role in coastal protection. As a first approximation, the problem is modeled utilizing solitary waves impinging on emergent/submerged rigid cylinders. A three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model using cyclic boundary conditions was developed based on the IHFOAM solver to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on the solitary wave attenuation. The numerical model was established based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the standard k - omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) surface capturing schemes. The results indicate that different patterns are found in terms of flow field characteristics (velocity and turbulent kinetic energy) and forces exerted on the cylinders for various wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration, which helps to better understand wave dissipation mechanism induced by vegetation. Different from the bulk drag coefficient derived by the conventional wave dissipation models, the direct force method was applied to quantify the time-varying and period-averaged drag coefficients (C-D) of individual cylinders. The time-varying C-D associated with maximum force and local velocity is defined as the representative C-D, for comparison with the period-averaged C-D in detail. Besides, by considering the submergence ratio, new generic C-D formulas are proposed as functions of the modified Reynolds number (Re) and Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC) for illustrating the C-D dynamics under solitary wave conditions. Finally, a preliminary comparison between the proposed C-D formulas and existing formulas are given to reveal the intrinsic C-D law, which may lead to improved understanding and modeling concerning wave-vegetation interaction.

AB This study investigated the form of the governing equation for the particle distribution by focusing on the particle motion processes rather than flow regime and particle characteristics. A linear erosion term for a fetch-eddy effect was introduced to the advection dispersion equation. The equation formulated in this paper described most of the particle deposit patterns behind an object including porous and solid snow fences, and a tree. This theory may enable us to estimate particle motion parameters, such as diffusion, drift, and erosion coefficients, from field observed particle distributions. Snow stratigraphy observed by ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used verify to result of the modeled theoretical snow redistribution. These analyses confirmed the effectiveness of the linear erosion term at explaining the particle deposition patterns due to eddies around a porous snow fence.

AB [1] Concentration-discharge (c-Q) plots have been used to infer how flow components such as event water, soil water, and groundwater mix to produce the observed episodic hydrochemical response of small catchments. Because c-Q plots are based only on observed streamflow and solute concentration, their interpretation requires assumptions about the relative volume, hydrograph timing, and solute concentration of the streamflow end-members. Evans and Davies [1998] present a taxonomy of c-Q loops resulting from three-component conservative mixing. Their analysis, based on a fixed template of end-member hydrograph volume, timing, and concentration, suggests a unique relationship between c-Q loop form and the rank order of end-member concentrations. Many catchments exhibit variability in component contributions to storm flow in response to antecedent conditions or rainfall characteristics, but the effects of such variation on c-Q relationships have not been studied systematically. Starting with a "baseline'' condition similar to that assumed by Evans and Davies [1998], we use a simple computer model to characterize the variability in c-Q plot patterns resulting from variation in end-member volume, timing, and solute concentration. Variability in these three factors can result in more than one c-Q loop shape for a given rank order of end-member solute concentrations. The number of resulting hysteresis patterns and their relative frequency depends on the rank order of solute concentrations and on their separation in absolute value. In ambiguous cases the c-Q loop shape is determined by the relative "prominence'' of the event water versus soil water components. This "prominence'' is broadly defined as a capacity to influence the total streamflow concentration and may result from a combination of end-member volume, timing, or concentration. The modeling results indicate that plausible hydrological variability in field situations can confound the interpretation of c-Q plots, even when fundamental end-member mixing assumptions are satisfied.

AB Bedload transport is one of the main mechanisms for sediment transport in rivers. Bedload transport may exhibit anomalous dispersion behavior during the formation of clusters on the surface of a heterogeneous river bed, which cannot be quantified by the classical Fick's law of diffusion. This study simplifies the complex bedload transport process to a "mass-spring-damper" system, which can describe the cluster formation process based on the observed cluster geometry. The simulation results are consistent with the morphology of clusters extracted from the experimental gravel bed in our flume. The level of spatial heterogeneity of individual clusters is characterized to distinguish the planform morphology of each cluster, based on estimation of the HausdorffBesicovitch dimension of the cluster area. Trapping of sediment particles during bedload transport on a heterogeneous gravel bed is quantified using a random walk approach and the birth-death emigration-immigration Markov process. Sub-diffusive dynamics of bedload transport is also modeled simultaneously using the Langevin equation that defines statistical properties of bedload sediments. Further analysis indicates that the microscopic stochastic Langevin equation relates to a macroscopic deterministic equation according to the continuous time random walk (CTRW) theory.

AB In this study, a method to estimate the normal range of groundwater level time-series data was developed to identify outliers in terms of the global, contextual, and collective sense. To evaluate the normal range of groundwater level time-series data, the statistical characteristics of the data and the patterns of the precipitation time-series data were incorporated into the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based ensemble regressor (i.e., the LER model). Based on the LER model, multiple possible trends of the groundwater level were generated, and the general rules of outlier identification methods (i.e., sigma and Tukey's fences (TF) rules) were applied to the LER ensemble estimation result to finally define the range of the normal data. For outlier identification performance validation, the actual groundwater level acquired from three groundwater monitoring stations in South Korea (i. e., the Pohang-Gibuk (PG), Namwon-Dotong (ND), and Jeju-Sangyae (JS) monitoring wells) and the corresponding precipitation data acquired from the nearest weather stations were applied to the study. As the reference method for comparative performance validation, simple applications of the sigma and TF rules were used. For the monitoring data, the developed LER-based outlier identification method evaluates the range of the data that might be explained by the modelled influences of the interest (i.e., normal data range). The developed method showed an outlier identification performance of >70% in general while the performance of the sigma and TF rules was mostly <50%. In particular, as the method effectively estimated the seasonal trend and the variability of the groundwater level with consideration of the precipitation patterns and statistics on the groundwater level variation, it is superior for identifying the contextual or collective outliers compared to the simple sigma and TF rules. Through in-depth analysis, it can be concluded that the developed LER-based outlier identification method is effective for discriminating the abnormal data by considering the intrinsic statistical characteristics of the original data trend and the exogenous factors. In the aspect of the practical applicability, as the result can be automatically acquired based on real-time monitoring data, the developed method is expected to apply for more efficient maintenance of the monitoring devices by embedding the model as the management software into the monitoring network system.

However, current models fail to comprehensively consider the effects of multiple habitat factors on the development of fish species. In this study, a dynamic framework for river ecosystems was set up to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors in terms of hydrology and water quality on the fish community in rivers. To achieve this the biomechanical forms of the relationships between hydrology, water quality, and aquatic organisms were determined. The developing processes of the food web without external disturbance were simulated by 208 models, constructed using Ecopath With Ecosim (EWE). These models were then used to analyze changes in biomass (Delta B) of two representative fish species, Opsariichthys bidens and Carassius auratus, which are widely distributed in Asia, and thus have attracted the attention of scholars and stakeholders, due to the consequence of habitat alteration. Results showed that the relationship between the changes in fish biomass and key habitat factors can be expressed in a unified form. T-tests for the unified form revealed that the means of the two data sets of simulated and observed Delta B for these two fish species (O. bidens and C. auratus) were equal at the significance level of 5%. Compared with other ecological dynamic models, our framework includes theories that are easy to understand and has modest requirements for assembly and scientific expertise. Moreover, this framework can objectively assess the influence of hydrological and water quality variance on aquatic biota with simpler theory and little expertise. Therefore, it is easy to be put into practice and can provide a scientific support for decisions in ecological restoration made by river administrators and stakeholders across the world.

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

DT Article
AB Two questionable features of many existing studies of capacity expansion planning problems in water resources are (1) the modelling of the expansion as a deterministic process, and ( 2) the lack of control over the incidence of system failure. System failure, in this presentation, is related to the occurrence of shortfalls in water supply. A sequential decision model is used as a general framework for the formulation of stochastic demand capacity expansion problems subject to reliability constraints designed to regulate the incidence of system failure. Various different types of constraint are investigated and each is incorporated into a dynamic programming solution procedure by means of Lagrangian theory. Computational examples illustrate the potential importance of using such reliability constraints in the analysis of capacity expansion problems.

AB This paper examines the determinants of consumers' willingness to pay for improvement programs for three drinking water issues: water quality, pinhole leaks in home plumbing infrastructure, and aging public infrastructure. The research is based on a mail survey of consumers in Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D. C. The analysis focuses on the relationship between information, risk perceptions, and willingness to pay. An alternative specific conditional logit model is used to model consumers' willingness to pay for improvements. Results indicate that the willingness to pay for any of the programs is negatively affected by the cost of the proposed improvement. Consumers' risk perceptions, the external information provided in the survey, and whether they read the annual report from their water utility affect consumers' willingness to pay for improvement programs.

AB In situ turbidity meters are being increasingly used to generate continuous records of suspended sediment concentration in rivers. However, the usefulness of the information obtained depends heavily on the existence of a close relationship between fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration and turbidity and the calibration procedure that relates suspended sediment concentration to the turbidity meter's signal. This study assesses the relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity for a small (1.19 km(2)) rural catchment in southern Brazil and evaluates two calibration methods by comparing the estimates of suspended sediment concentration obtained from the calibrated turbidity readings with direct measurements obtained using a USDH 48 suspended sediment sampler. With the first calibration method, the calibration relationship is derived by relating the turbidity readings to simultaneous measurements of concentration obtained from suspended sediment samples collected from the vicinity of the turbidity probe during flood events. With the second method, the calibration is based on the readings obtained from the turbidity meter when the probe immersed in samples of known concentration prepared using soils collected from the catchment. Overall, there was a close link between fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration and turbidity in the stream at the outlet of the catchment, and the estimates of sediment concentration obtained using the first calibration method corresponded closely with the conventionally measured sediment concentrations. However, use of the second calibration method introduced appreciable errors. When the estimated sediment concentrations were compared with the measured values, the mean errors were +/- 122 mg l(-1) and +601 mg l(-1) for the first and second calibration procedures respectively.

AB random shapes of pore throats in geomaterials hinder accurate estimation of capillary pressure, and conventional pore network models that simply use the Young-Laplace equation assuming circular pore throats overestimate the capillary pressure. As a solution to this problem that does not complicate the pore network model or slow its implementation, we propose a new morphological analysis method to correlate the capillary pressure at an irregular pore channel with its cross-sectional geometry using lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation and Mayer and Stowe-Princen theory. Geometry-based shape factors for pore throats are shown here to correlate strongly with the capillary pressure obtained by LB simulation. Water retention curves obtained by incorporating the morphological calibration into conventional pore network simulation and their correlative scheme agree well with experimental data. The suggested method is relevant to pore-scale processes such as geological CO2 sequestration, methane bubbling from wetlands, and enhanced carbon recovery.

AB Plants grown in porous media are part of a bioregenerative life support system designed for long-duration space missions. Reduced gravity conditions of orbiting spacecraft (microgravity) alter several aspects of liquid flow and distribution within partially saturated porous media. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the suitability of conventional capillary flow theory in simulating water distribution in porous media measured in a microgravity environment. Data from experiments aboard the Russian space station Mir and a U.S, space shuttle were simulated by elimination of the gravitational term from the Richards equation. Qualitative comparisons with media hydraulic parameters measured on Earth suggest narrower pore size distributions and inactive or nonparticipating large pores in microgravity. Evidence of accentuated hysteresis, altered soil-water characteristic, and reduced unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from microgravity simulations may be attributable to a number of proposed secondary mechanisms. These are likely spawned by enhanced and modified paths of interfacial flows and an altered force ratio of capillary to body forces in microgravity.

   structure uncertainty and its quantification using ensemble-based
   genetic programming framework
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COMBINATION; PARAMETERS; CALIBRATION; DYNAMICS
AB Uncertainty analysis is starting to be widely acknowledged as an integral part of hydrological modeling. The conventional treatment of uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modeling is to assume a deterministic model structure, and treat its associated parameters as imperfectly known, thereby neglecting the uncertainty associated with the model structure. In this paper, a modeling framework that can explicitly account for the effect of model structure uncertainty has been proposed. The modeling framework is based on initially generating different realizations of the original data set using a non-parametric bootstrap method, and then exploiting the ability of the self-organizing algorithms, namely genetic programming, to evolve their own model structure for each of the resampled data sets. The resulting ensemble of models is then used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the model structure. The performance of the proposed modeling framework is analyzed with regards to its ability in characterizing the evapotranspiration process at the Southwest Sand Storage facility, located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta. Eddy-covariance-measured actual evapotranspiration is modeled as a function of net radiation, air temperature, ground temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Investigating the relation between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and uncertainty, two sets of experiments were carried out by varying the level of mathematical operators that can be used to define the predictand-predictor relationship. While the first set uses just the additive operators, the second set uses both the additive and the multiplicative operators to define the predictand-predictor relationship. The results suggest that increasing the model complexity may lead to better prediction accuracy but at an expense of increasing uncertainty. Compared to the model parameter uncertainty, the relative contribution of model structure uncertainty to the predictive uncertainty of a model is shown to be more important. Furthermore, the study advocates that the search to find the optimal model could be replaced by the quest to unearth possible models for characterizing hydrological processes.

AB This study is the first to contrast two similarity theory methods, the flux variance and the half-order time derivative, over a wide range of atmospheric stability and surface roughness conditions. These two methods were selected because they require only single-level temperature measurement to estimate sensible heat flux. The data used were collected over bare soil, a grass-covered forest clearing, and an even-aged pine forest. For all three sites the flux variance method estimated the sensible heat flux relatively well for unstable atmospheric conditions. The half-order time derivative method was found to be sensitive to the parameterization of the eddy diffusivity, especially for the grass and bare soil field sites. Overall, the flux variance method was able to reproduce the measured sensible heat flux with greater accuracy than the half-order time derivative methods for the three experiment sites.

The calibration of runoff models for tilled fields is not identical to that of unfilled fields, as it has to take into consideration the temporal variability of parameters due to the transient nature of surface crusts. In this paper, we seek the application of a rainfall-runoff model and the development of a calibration methodology to take into account the impact of tillage on overland flow simulation at the scale of a tilled plot (3240 m(2)) located in southern France. The selected model couples the (Morel-Seytoux, H.J., 1978. Derivation of equations for variable rainfall infiltration. Water Resources Research. 14(4), 561-568). Infiltration equation to a transfer function based on the diffusive wave equation. The parameters to be calibrated are the hydraulic conductivity at natural saturation K-s, the surface detention S-d and the lag time omega. A two-step calibration procedure is presented. First, eleven rainfall-runoff events are calibrated individually and the variability of the calibrated parameters are analysed. The individually calibrated K-s values decrease monotonously according to the total amount of rainfall since tillage. No clear relationship is observed between the two parameters S-d and omega, and the date of tillage. However, the lag time omega increases inversely with the peakflow of the events. Fairly good agreement is observed between the simulated and measured hydrographs of the calibration set. Simple mathematical laws describing the evolution of K-s and omega are selected, while S-d is considered constant. The second step involves the collective calibration of the law of evolution of each parameter on the whole calibration set. This procedure is calibrated on 11 events and validated on ten runoff inducing and four non-runoff inducing rainfall events. The suggested calibration methodology seems robust and can be transposed to other gauged sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analyzing the behavior of heavy precipitation, high temperatures, and extremes of other environmental variables has become an important research topic both for hydrologists and climatologists. Extreme value theory provides a well-developed mathematical foundation to statistically model excesses above a high threshold. Practitioners often assume that those excesses approximately follow a generalized Pareto distribution. To infer the two parameters of this distribution, a variety of estimations has been proposed and studied. Among them, maximum likelihood estimation offers an elegant way to include covariates, but imposing an explicit form on the parameters dependence. When analyzing large data sets, this procedure can be too slow and sometimes produce aberrant values due to optimization problems. To overcome these drawbacks, a method based on probability weighted moments and Kernel regression is proposed, tested, and applied to a Swiss daily precipitation data set. The method is implemented as a freely available R package.

AB [1] Temporary storage of solutes in streams is often controlled by flow-induced uptake in hyporheic zones. This phenomenon accounts for the tails that are generally observed following the passage of a solute pulse, and such exchange is particularly important for the transport of reactive substances that can be subject to various biogeochemical processes in the subsurface. Advective pumping, induced by streamflow over an irregular permeable bed, leads to a distribution of pore water flow paths in the streambed and a corresponding distribution of subsurface solute residence times. This paper describes a modeling framework that couples longitudinal solute transport in streams with solute advection along a continuous distribution of hyporheic flow paths. Moment methods are used to calculate the shape of solute breakthrough curves in the stream based on various representations of hypotheic exchange, including both advective pumping and several idealized formulations. Basic hydrodynamic principles are used to derive the distribution of solute residence times due to pumping. The model provides an accurate representation of the breakthrough curves of tritium along a 30 km reach of Sava Brook in Uppland County in Sweden. Both hydrodynamic theory for pumping exchange and pore water samples obtained from the bed during the tracer experiment suggest that the residence time for solutes in the hyporheic zone is characterized by a log normal probability density function. Closed-form solutions of the central temporal moments of solute breakthrough curves in the stream reveal a significant similarity between this new model and existing models of hyporheic exchange, including the Transient Storage Model. The new model is advantageous because its fundamentally derived exchange parameters can be expressed as functions of basic hydrodynamic quantities, which allows the model results to be generalized to conditions beyond those directly observed during tracer experiments. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using the pumping theory to relate the spatial variation of hyporheic exchange rate along Sava Brook with the local Froude number, hydraulic conductivity and water depth.

AB Flood control and hydropower generation are two main functions of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. In this study, a multi-objective operation model for TGR considering these two functions was developed. Since the optimal results of reservoir operation are mostly in the form of gross outflow which is hardly used to directly guide reservoir operation, the optimization of spillways operation was taken into account. For observed historical flood hydrographs and design flood hydrographs, the progressive optimality algorithm (POA) was employed to determine the optimal operation of spillways. For the real-time reservoir operation, a smooth support vector machine (SSVM) model was applied to abstract the optimal operation rules which consider the order and the number of spillways put into use. Results demonstrate that the use of different spillways has a significant impact on reservoir operation. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the order and number of spillways that should be used. Instead of optimizing outflow, direct optimization of the order and number of spillways can yield most reasonable results. The SSVM model simulates the relationship among inflow, water level and outflow satisfactorily and can be used for real-time or short term reservoir operation. Application of the SSVM model can also reduce flood risk and increase hydropower generation during the flood season. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the first major attempt to compare seven different inverse approaches for identifying aquifer transmissivity. The ultimate objective was to determine which of several geostatistical inverse techniques is better suited for making probabilistic forecasts of the potential transport of solutes in an aquifer where spatial variability and uncertainty in hydrogeologic properties are significant. Seven geostatistical methods (fast Fourier transform (FF), fractal simulation (FS), linearized cokriging (LC), linearized semianalytical (LS), maximum likelihood (ML), pilot point (PP), and sequential self-calibration (SS)) were compared on four synthetic data sets. Each data set had specific features meeting (or not) classical assumptions about stationarity, amenability to a geostatistical description, etc. The comparison of the outcome of the methods is based on the prediction of travel times and travel paths taken by conservative solutes migrating in the aquifer for a distance of 5 km. Four of the methods, LS, ML, PP, and SS, were identified as being approximately equivalent for the specific problems considered. The magnitude of the variance of the transmissivity fields, which went as high as 10 times the generally accepted range for linearized approaches, was not a problem for the linearized methods when applied to stationary fields; that is, their inverse solutions and travel time predictions were as accurate as those of the nonlinear methods. Nonstationarity of the "true" transmissivity field, or the presence of "anomalies" such as high-permeability fracture zones was, however, more of a problem for the linearized methods. The importance of the proper selection of the semivariogram of the log(10) (T) field (or the ability of the method to optimize this variogram iteratively) was found to have a significant impact on the accuracy and precision of the travel time predictions. Use of additional transient information from pumping tests did not result in major changes in the outcome. While the methods differ in their underlying theory, and the codes developed to implement the theories were limited to varying degrees, the most important factor for achieving a successful solution was the time and experience devoted by the user of the method.

AB The present work aims to study the main chemical and physical water parameters in the upper and middle Volturno river catchment (southern Italy), between the Capo Volturno springs and the confluence with the Calore river. This study makes use of morphology, geolithology, tectonic, land use, and physico-chemical (pH, electrical conductivity, redox potential, temperature, major ions, and Rn-222) data for the identification of the main sources of surface and groundwaters in the Volturno catchment and of their evolution and mixing both in base flow and peak flow conditions. The study was also performed to assess whether the alteration due to potential anthropogenic contamination may hamper the identification of natural primitive sources of surface waters, especially in the populated and farmed plains far from the river headwaters. Our data suggest that water chemistry of this stretch of the Volturno river is dominated mainly by lithology and, only marginally, by the intense exogenous activities and that this trend is appreciable in both base flow and peak flow conditions. The proposed simple geochemical approach based on easy-to-sample matrices and on cost-effective standard methods is a valuable tool to address catchment functionality especially in upland areas, where complex geologic and structural settings, heterogeneous groundwater flow, and logistical issues are the rule rather than the exception. Because the upper and middle Volturno catchment is comparable with numerous valleys of the Mediterranean area, this study could be a reference for analogous applications.

AB [1] Critical conditions for rill erosion are determined through laboratory experiments and one-dimensional numerical simulations. Relationships between rill flow characteristics and slope angle theta or plot size are studied both experimentally and numerically for realistic rainfall intensities. The experimental results show that maximum rill flow velocities occur within a specific range of slope angles, theta = 30 degrees - 40 degrees, which is independent of plot size and degree of overland flow concentration. For a given plot size and rainfall intensity the threshold slope angle for rill erosion depends on a number of factors, including soil erodibility, the degree of overland flow concentration, and the effect of gravity on soil erosion. The effect of plot size on the stable rill width generated by rill erosion is also discussed along with its implications for soil loss predictions.

AB The nature of the von Karman constant (k), i.e. universal, Re-independent but wall-dependent or, in general, flow dependent, has been subjected to considerable investigation. Contradicting the classic view that k should be universal in open-channel flows of clear water with a fully developed boundary layer, irrespectively of the type of boundary, it has recently been proposed that the value of k is influenced by the mobility of the bottom boundary.
   Rather than advocating a particular view on the nature of k, the objectives of this work are: (i) to provide a similarity framework for the nature of k, highlighting, in the process, the underlying key phenomena at play, and (ii) to explore a theoretical model for k as a function of turbulence parameters.
   Dimensional analysis is performed, including a new key step, following the works of Selim Yalin, in which the shear-rate is interpreted as a two-phase variable, depending on flow as well as sediment parameters. Vaschy-Buckingham's theorem is applied and similarity arguments leading to the log-law are employed. These introduce appropriate hypothesis concerning complete and incomplete similarity, thus providing a theoretical framework for the discussion of the nature of k. A theoretical model is then explored, materialised in a functional relation between k and turbulence parameters. The discussion of the nature of k becomes a discussion of the nature of those parameters, all susceptible to be measured. Such discussion is based on laboratory results concerning flows over porous immobile and mobile beds. The data reveals changes in the structure of turbulence for flows over weakly mobile gravel-sand beds but is not supportive of a reduction of the value of k. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   INFORMATION
AB While optimality is a foundational mathematical concept in water resources planning and management, optimal solutions may be vulnerable to failure if deeply uncertain future conditions deviate from those assumed during optimization. These vulnerabilities may produce severely asymmetric impacts across a region, making it vital to evaluate the robustness of management strategies as well as their impacts for regional stakeholders. In this study, we contribute a multistakeholder many-objective robust decision making (MORDM) framework that blends many-objective search and uncertainty analysis tools to discover key tradeoffs between water supply alternatives and their robustness to deep uncertainties (e.g., population pressures, climate change, and financial risks). The proposed framework is demonstrated for four interconnected water utilities representing major stakeholders in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, U.S. The utilities supply well over one million customers and have the ability to collectively manage drought via transfer agreements and shared infrastructure. We show that water portfolios for this region that compose optimal tradeoffs (i.e., Pareto-approximate solutions) under expected future conditions may suffer significantly degraded performance with only modest changes in deeply uncertain hydrologic and economic factors. We then use the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to identify which uncertain factors drive the individual and collective vulnerabilities for the four cooperating utilities. Our framework identifies key stakeholder dependencies and robustness tradeoffs associated with cooperative regional planning, which are critical to understanding the tensions between individual versus regional water supply goals. Cooperative demand management was found to be the key factor controlling the robustness of regional water supply planning, dominating other hydroclimatic and economic uncertainties through the 2025 planning horizon. Results suggest that a modest reduction in the projected rate of demand growth (from approximately 3% per year to 2.4%) will substantially improve the utilities' robustness to future uncertainty and reduce the potential for regional tensions. The proposed multistakeholder MORDM framework offers critical insights into the risks and challenges posed by rising water demands and hydrological uncertainties, providing a planning template for regions now forced to confront rapidly evolving water scarcity risks.
   Key Points
   We advance many-objective robust decision making for multiple stakeholders Stakeholders' robustness exhibits dependencies, vulnerabilities, and tradeoffs A modest reduction in demand growth rate insulates against future uncertainty

AB Estimation of irrigation water use (IWU) is critical to assessing water use efficiency and optimizing water resource allocation. However, diversity in irrigation scheduling, irrigation system, and crop type has imposed restrictions on deriving the accurate spatial distribution of IWU. Existing approaches of deriving IWU may have large uncertainty, due mostly to methodological limitations, inadequate inputs, and the mismatch in spatiotemporal scale between IWU estimates and in situ counterparts. Remote sensing has the potential to provide valuable information on moisture transport, which could unravel water consumption by crops. First, we developed a robust relationship between root zone soil moisture (RZSM) and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to reference ET from the land components of European ReAnalysis-5 (ERA5L) without an irrigation module across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Second, RZSM under irrigation was derived from the developed relationship and remotely sensed ETa from the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model during 2000-2020. Third, IWU over the two decades was derived based on increases in RZSM and ETa due to irrigation using remotely sensed and model-based variables, along with our derived formulas considering groundwater recharge originating from irrigation. The IWU estimates were fairly reliable compared with reported IWU from the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey at the state-level in four years, with the coefficient of determination ranging from 0.74 to 0.84, root mean square error ranging from 1.90 to 2.33 km(3)/yr, and bias ranging from -0.11 to 0.15 km(3)/yr. Integration of remotely sensed ETa with ERA5L output resulted in IWU estimates of much higher accuracy than published studies. The IWU estimates across the CONUS reflected an increasing trend (similar to 2.71 km(3)/yr(2)) during 2000-2007 but a decreasing trend (similar to 0.90 km(3)/yr(2)) during 2008-2020, due to efficient irrigation practices and increased precipitation.

AB The role of models in science is to facilitate predictions from hypotheses. Although the idea that models provide information is widely reported and has been used as the basis for model evaluation, benchmarking, and updating strategies, this intuition has not been formally developed and current benchmarking strategies remain ad hoc at a fundamental level. Here we interpret what it means to say that a model provides information in the context of the formal inductive philosophy of science. We show how information theory can be used to measure the amount of information supplied by a model, and derive standard model benchmarking and evaluation activities in this context. We further demonstrate that, via a process of induction, dynamical models store information from hypotheses and observations about the systems that they represent, and that this stored information can be directly measured.

AB Irrigated agriculture will have to increase production to meet the demand for food of the population of the world. A simple physically based method is presented that allows to determine appropriate irrigation rate and duration to avoid runoff, thus contributing to the design of efficient irrigation. The method relies on the infiltration capacity curve of the soil under interest. This curve allows determination of two important relationships: (a) maximal irrigation rate vs. irrigation dose and (b) irrigation duration versus rate. Two case studies illustrate the application of the method to adapt irrigation to the reduction of soil infiltration capacity resulting from the quality of the irrigation water (treated wastewater) or soil surface sealing. The range of irrigation rates for which duration can be estimated as the ratio between the required dose and the application rate is defined.

AB This study proposes to test the hypothesis that theory-guided machine learning model can be effectively applied to model the behavior of a real aquifer. For this purpose, a theory-guided multilayer perceptron model (TgMLP) for real aquifers was developed to simulate groundwater flow dynamics. A comparison of the performance of the TgMLP with that of a numerical model (NumMod) and a traditional multilayer perceptron model (MLP) was performed. The ability of these three models to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of groundwater was evaluated, the degree of PDE violation of the TgMLP model was also assessed, and the applicability of these three models in a real-world setting was discussed. The Saint-Honore ' unconfined aquifer (Quebec, Canada), which has been extensively monitored over the last few years, was used as an experimental laboratory for this study. Historical groundwater levels, recharge, precipitation, mean temperature and streamflow data were used to calibrate/train/validate and test the models. The results show that the performance of the TgMLP far exceeds that of the numerical and traditional MLP models, that the MLP model is a good interpolator but is unable to extrapolate, and that only the numerical and TgMLP models are able to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of groundwater flow and represent the dominant flow direction in the aquifer. It was found that the TgMLP model better approximates the solution of the PDE at 70% of the locations. These results support the hypothesis that TgMLP is effective in modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of groundwater in a real aquifer even if improve-ments are needed. Although the TgMLP model is capable of representing groundwater flow dynamics to some degree, its implementation requires much higher computational costs than a numerical model; however, these can be reduced with the use of a GPU to speed up the calculations.

ID FLOOD PEAKS; FREQUENCY
AB A regional envelope curve ( REC) summarizes the current bound on our experience of extreme floods in a region. Although RECs are available for many regions of the world, their traditional deterministic interpretation limits the use of the curves for design purposes, as magnitude, but not frequency of extreme flood events, can be quantified. A probabilistic interpretation of a REC is introduced via an estimate of its exceedance probability. The effect of intersite correlation on the exceedance probability is discussed. Monte Carlo experiments are performed to assess the performance of the estimate of the REC's exceedance probability. Generalized curves are presented for assessing the impact of regional intersite cross correlation on the likelihood of exceeding an observed REC. We also discuss how future developments in the theory of records may improve our ability to quantify the information content of a REC.

AB This study investigates the impacts of surface roughness on the nonlinear fluid flow through three-dimensional (3D) self-affine rock fractures, whose original surface roughness is decomposed into primary roughness (i.e. the large-scale waviness of the fracture morphology) and secondary roughness (i.e. the small-scale unevenness) with a wavelet analysis technique. A 3D Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is adopted to predict the flow physics in rock fractures numerically created with and without consideration of the secondary roughness, respectively. The simulation results show that the primary roughness mostly controls the pressure distribution and fracture flow paths at a large scale, whereas the secondary roughness determines the nonlinear properties of the fluid flow at a local scale. As the pressure gradient increases, the secondary roughness enhances the local complexity of velocity distribution by generating and expanding the eddy flow and back flow regions in the vicinity of asperities. It was found that the Forchheimer's law characterizes well the nonlinear flow behavior in fractures of varying roughness. The inertial effects induced by the primary roughness differ only marginally in fractures with the roughness exponent varying from 0.5 to 0.8, and it is the secondary roughness that significantly enhances the nonlinear flow and leads to earlier onset of nonlinearity. Further examined were the effects of surface roughness on the transmissivity, hydraulic aperture and the tortuosity of flow paths, demonstrating again the dominant role of the secondary roughness, especially for the apparent transmissivity and the equivalent hydraulic aperture at high pressure gradient or high Reynolds number. The results may enhance our understanding of the role of surface roughness in the nonlinear flow behaviors in natural rock fractures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies a 3-D state space representation of Budyko's framework designed to capture the mutual interdependence among long-term mean actual evapotranspiration (E), potential evapotranspiration (E-p) and precipitation (P). For this purpose we use three dimensionless and dependent quantities: Psi = E/P, Phi = E-p/P and Omega = E/E-p. This 3-D space and its 2-D projections provide an interesting setting to test the physical soundness of Budyko's hypothesis. We demonstrate analytically that Budyko-type equations are unable to capture the physical limit of the relation between Omega and Phi in humid environments, owing to the unfea-sibility of E-p/P = 0 when E/E-p -> 1. Using data from 146 sub-catchments in the Amazon River basin we overcome this inconsistency by proposing a physically consistent power law: Psi = k Phi(e), with k = 0.66, and e = 0.83 (R-2 = 0.93). This power law is compared with two other Budyko-type equations. Taking into account the goodness of fits and the ability to comply with the physical limits of the 3-D space, our results show that the power law is better suited to model the coupled water and energy balances within the Amazon River basin. Moreover, k is found to be related to the partitioning of energy via evapotranspiration in terms of Omega. This suggests that our power law implicitly incorporates the complementary relationship of evapotranspiration into the Budyko curve, which is a consequence of the dependent nature of the studied variables within our 3-D space. This scaling approach is also consistent with the asymmetrical nature of the com-plementary relationship of evapotranspiration. Looking for a physical explanation for the parameters k and e, the inter-annual variability of individual catchments is studied. Evidence of space-time symmetry in Amazonia emerges, since both between-catchment and between-year variability follow the same Budyko curves. Finally, signs of co-evolution of catchments are explored by linking spatial patterns of the power law parameters with fundamental characteristics of the Amazon River basin. In general, k and e are found to be related to vegetation, topography and water in soils.

AB We used data from 109 surveyed cross sections at 34 reaches of New Zealand rivers ranging in bankfull width from 8 to 234 m, each with 4-13 measured flows, to compare regression-derived at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) coefficients and exponents to the coefficients and exponents predicted by Dingman's (2007) analytical AHG relations. The analytical geometrical relations depend on measured values of 1) bankfull width, 2) bankfull maximum depth, and 3) a geometric exponent fit to the measured cross section. Because of data limitations and the lack of a generally applicable analytical hydraulic relation, the hydraulic relation is here represented by an empirical power-law relation between depth and velocity developed at each section. The fits between the quasi-analytical and empirical values of the AHG coefficients and exponents are highly statistically significant, with intercepts near 0 and slopes near 1, validating Dingman's original analytical relations. This confirmation of the physical basis underlying empirically-observed AHG relations, along with some statistically-significant relations among the quantities that determine AHG coefficients and exponents that are not predicted by theory, may be useful for estimating AHG relations from remotely-sensed or partial information.

AB Transport processes taking place in natural formations are often characterized by the spatial nonstationarity of flow field and the nonergodic condition of solute spreading. The former may originate from statistical inhomogeneity of porous media properties or from the influence of boundary conditions as well as from conditioning procedures on measured data, while the latter is generally due to the finite size of the solute source. In real-world applications these aspects sometimes dominate the transport phenomena, and known literature results based on statistical homogeneity and ergodicity assumptions cannot be properly applied. In this paper a method is proposed to handle different and concurrent causes of the flow field nonstationarity and to describe nonergodic transport of inert solutes by spatial moments in a domain of finite size. The goal is reached by expanding the steady state flow equation in Taylor series limited to the first-order and by the recursive application of finite element (FE) method. The unknowns are the piezometric head mean values and its derivatives in respect to the fluctuating porous media hydraulic conductivity. From the latter the velocity statistics are derived on the basis of Darcy's law according to the first-order approximation. By neglecting the pore-scale dispersion the spatial moments of a solute plume are a posteriori obtained by a consistent Lagrangian analysis starting from the knowledge of the velocity field covariance matrices without any restriction regarding the statistical homogeneity of flow and/or ergodicity conditions. The proposed method is here applied to investigate the influence of boundary conditions on the solute transport developing in a limited domain. The results obtained from different test cases give a velocity field behavior in agreement with literature findings and allow us to define the nonergodic transport in bounded domains. The comparison of the results with some ad hoc developed Monte Carlo simulations ensures the applicability of the proposed approach at least to the small heterogeneity cases here considered.

AB In this study, the spatial and temporal variabilities of terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and snow water equivalent anomaly (SWEA) information obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites data were analysed in conjunction with multisource snow products over several basins in the Canadian landmass. Snow water equivalent (SWE) data were extracted from three different sources: Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research version 2 (GlobSnow2), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), and Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC). The objective of the study was to understand whether SWE variations have a significant contribution to terrestrial water storage anomalies in the Canadian landmass. The period was considered from December 2002 to March 2011. Significant relationships were observed between TWSA and SWEA for most of the 15 basins considered (53% to 80% of the basins, depending on the SWE products considered). The best results were obtained with the CMC SWE products compared with satellite-based SWE data. Stronger relationships were found in snow-dominated basins (R-s > = 0.7), such as the Liard [root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.4 mm] and Peace Basins (RMSE = 26.76 mm). However, despite high snow accumulation in the north of Quebec, GRACE showed weak or insignificant correlations with SWEA, regardless of the data sources. The same behaviour was observed in the Western Hudson Bay basin. In both regions, it was found that the contribution of non-SWE compartments including wetland, surface water, as well as soil water storages has a significant impact on the variations of total storage. These components were estimated using the Water-Global Assessment and Prognosis Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) simulations and then subtracted from GRACE observations. The GRACE-derived SWEA correlation results showed improved relationships with three SWEA products. The improvement is particularly important in the sub-basins of the Hudson Bay, where very weak and insignificant results were previously found with GRACE TWSA data. GRACE-derived SWEA showed a significant relationship with CMC data in 93% of the basins (13% more than GRACE TWSA). Overall, the results indicated the important role of SWE on terrestrial water storage variations.

AB The stream tracer technique and transient storage models (TSMs) have become common tools in stream solute and hyporheic exchange studies. The expense and logistics associated with water sample collection and analysis often results in limited temporal resolution of stream tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs). Samples are often collected without a priori or real-time knowledge of BTC information, which can result in poor sample coverage of the critical shoulder (initial rise) and tail (post-steady state fall) of the BTC. We illustrate the use of specific conductance (SC) measurements as a surrogate for conservative dissolved tracer (Br-) samples. The advantages of collecting SC data for use in the TSM are (1) cost, (2) ease of data collection, and (3) well-defined breakthrough curves, which strengthen TSM parameter optimization. This method is based on developing an ion concentration (IC)-SC relationship from limited discrete tracer solute samples. SC data can be collected on a more frequent basis at no additional analysis cost. TSM simulations can then be run for the conservative tracer data derived from SC breakthrough curves and the IC-SC relationship. This technique was tested in a 120 m reach of stream (2-60 m subreaches) in the Maimai M15 catchment, New Zealand during baseflow recession. Dissolved LiBr was injected for 12-92 h, with Br- as the conservative ion of interest. Four TSM simulations using the OTIS model are optimized using UCODE to fit (1) Br- data derived from the Br--SC relationship (n = 1307 observations at each of two stream sampling sites), (2) all stream Br- data collected (n = 58 in upper reach, n = 60 in lower reach), (3) half of the stream Br- data collected, and (4) 20 stream Br- samples from each site. No two simulations resulted in the same optimal parameter values. Results suggest that the greater the frequency of observations, the greater the confidence in estimated parameter values. Br- -SC simulations resulted in the best overall model fits to the data, with the lowest calculated error variance of 6-37, narrowest 95% parameter estimate confidence intervals, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0-99 942, among the four simulations. This is largely due to the improved representation of the shoulder and tail of the BTC with this method. The IC-SC correlation method is robust in situations in which (1) changes in background SC data can be accounted for, and (2) the data used to define the IC-SC relationship are representative of the range of data collected. This method provides more efficient sample analysis, improved data resolution, and improved model results compared to the alternative stream tracer data gathering methods presented. Additionally, we describe a new parameterization of the cross-sectional area of the stream during flow recession, as a function of discharge, based on a stream hydraulic geometry relationship. This variant of the OTIS model provides a more realistic representation of stream dynamics during unsteady discharge. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Accurate descriptions of heterogeneity in porous media are important for understanding and modeling single phase (e.g. contaminant transport, saltwater intrusion) and multiphase (e.g. geologic carbon storage, enhanced oil recovery) transport problems. Application of medical imaging to experimentally quantify these processes has led to significant progress in material characterization and understanding fluid transport behavior at laboratory scales. While widely utilized in cancer diagnosis and management, cardiology, and neurology, positron emission tomography (PET) has had relatively limited applications in earth science. This study utilizes a small-bore micro-PET scanner to image and quantify the transport behavior of pulses of a conservative aqueous radiotracer injected during single and multiphase flow experiments in two heterogeneous Berea sandstone cores. The cores are discretized into axial-parallel streamtubes, and using the reconstructed micro-PET data, expressions are derived from spatial moment analysis for calculating sub-core tracer flux and pore water velocity. Using the flux and velocity measurements, it is possible to calculate porosity and saturation from volumetric flux balance, and calculate permeability and water relative permeability from Darcy's law. Second spatial moment analysis enables measurement of sub-core solute dispersion during both single phase and multiphase experiments. A numerical simulation model is developed to verify the assumptions of the streamtube dimension reduction technique. A variation of the reactor ratio is presented as a diagnostic metric to efficiently determine the validity of the streamtube approximation in core and column-scale experiments. This study introduces a new method to quantify sub-core permeability, relative permeability, and dispersion. These experimental and analytical methods provide a foundation for future work on experimental measurements of differences in transport behavior across scales. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The classical continuum modeling of evaporation in capillary porous media is revisited from pore network simulations of the evaporation process. The computed moisture diffusivity is characterized by a minimum corresponding to the transition between liquid and vapor transport mechanisms confirming previous interpretations. Also the study suggests an explanation for the scattering generally observed in the moisture diffusivity obtained from experimental data. The pore network simulations indicate a noticeable nonlocal equilibrium effect leading to a new interpretation of the vapor pressure-saturation relationship classically introduced to obtain the one-equation continuum model of evaporation. The latter should not be understood as a desorption isotherm as classically considered but rather as a signature of a nonlocal equilibrium effect. The main outcome of this study is therefore that nonlocal equilibrium two-equation model must be considered for improving the continuum modeling of evaporation.

AB This study examined hydropedological patterns and storagedischarge relationships towards catchment process understanding at a small forested site, the Hermine (Laurentians, Quebec, Canada). The catchment is characterized by a steep surface topography and a shallow, irregular, low-permeability soil layer (LPSL), thus offering two possible main hydrologic drivers for runoff generation and routing. Using spatially detailed topographic data of the soil surface and the LPSL, water table levels measured at 94 locations on 50 occasions were expressed as 5 perched groundwater (PGW) storage variables: (i) a binary index illustrating the presence/absence of surface water, (ii) a soil saturation deficit, (iii) a water table elevation above the LPSL, (iv) a classification of sites as being in a dry, filling or spilling subsurface depression, and (v) a water table elevation above an underlying filled subsurface depression. The most common proxies for PGW storage, namely the saturation deficit and the location of surface saturated areas, were least appropriate to portray the Hermine catchment dynamics. Patterns of PGW storage were initially important during a rainstorm to trigger a response at the outlet but then remained unchanged even though streamflows continued to increase up to a higher order of magnitude. Hydraulically limited water tables were shown to exist in some areas, thus hinting towards the coexistence of rapid lateral preferential flow and slower subsurface flow. Most importantly, discontinuous storagedischarge relationships at the point-scale combined into continuous relationships at the catchment-scale, a result which can be seen as an emergent property of the Hermine catchment.

TI HOW MUCH COMPLEXITY IS WARRANTED IN A RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SMALL UPLAND CATCHMENTS; CALIBRATION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Development of mathematical models relating the precipitation incident upon a catchment to the streamflow emanating from the catchment has been a major focus of surface water hydrology for decades. Generally, values for parameters in such models must be selected so that runoff calculated from the model ''matches'' recorded runoff from some historical period. Despite the fact that the physics governing the path of a drop of water through a catchment to the stream involves complex relationships, evidence indicates that the information content in a rainfall-runoff record is sufficient to support models of only very limited complexity. This begs the question of what limits the observed data place on the allowable complexity of rainfall-runoff models. Time series techniques are applied for estimating transfer functions to determine how many parameters are appropriate to describe the relationship between precipitation and streamflow in the case where data on only precipitation, air temperature, and streamflow are available. Statistics from an ''information matrix'' provide the clues necessary for determining allowable model complexity. Time series models are developed for seven catchments with widely varying physical characteristics in different temperate climatic regimes to demonstrate the method. It is found that after modulating the measured rainfall using a nonlinear loss function, the rainfall-runoff response of all catchments is well represented using a linear model. Also, for all catchments a two-component linear model with four parameters is the model of choice. The two components can be interpreted as defining a ''quick flow'' and ''slow flow'' response of the given catchment. The method therefore provides a statistically rigorous way to separate hydrographs and parameterize their response behavior. The ability to construct reliable transfer function models for describing the rainfall-runoff process offers a new approach to investigate empirically the controls of physical catchment descriptors, land use change, climate change, etc., on the dynamic response of catchments through the extensive analysis of historical data sets.

AB Reliable estimates of wetland loss require improved wetland inventories and effective monitoring programmes. The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is experiencing rapid urban, agricultural and economic development, which places wetlands at risk, especially small geographically isolated wetlands. This loss is concomitant with a loss of ecosystem services. To improve upon current wetland inventories, a method for mapping wetlands using an automated object-based approach was developed for a regional watershed in Alberta. The method improves upon existing wetland mapping methods by effectively mapping small wetlands and better capturing the convolution of wetland edges. This approach uses digital terrain objects derived from light detection and ranging data, from which 130 157 wetlands were identified. Wetland loss estimates (% number and % area) were obtained by applying a wetland area versus frequency power-law function to the wetland inventory. We estimated a 16.2% historic loss of wetland number and a 2.6% loss of wetland area, with the size of these lost wetlands < 0.04 ha. The improved techniques for mapping wetland loss and estimating wetland loss provide a more accurate representation of the magnitude of wetland loss in the Prairie Pothole Region.

TI A theoretical assessment of heat transfer by ventilation in homogeneous

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID AIR-FLOW; SNOW; INTERFACE; BOUNDARY
AB The effects of heat transfer by ventilation in snow are investigated theoretically. We draw together standard analytical results for fluid flow in porous media and apply them to the case of steady flows induced by periodic roughness elements. These solutions are used to estimate the relative magnitude of ventilation heat transfer in snow. We conclude that topography-driven ventilation is unlikely to have a significant impact on the larger scale energy balance of snow-covered regions since the airflow is confined to a shallow penetration depth or just the roughness elements themselves, rather than the bulk snowpack. In particular, for the limiting case of very warm and moisture saturated air flowing over a melting snow cover, we show that latent and sensible heat due to ventilation have about equal contributions and that this contribution is small compared to the overall surface flux as predicted by the Monin-Obukhov theory.

AB We computed daily discharge (Q) versus gross drainage area (GDA) regression analyses for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons for six small to medium headwater catchments at a northern peatland complex in the James/Hudson Bay lowlands. Temporal dynamics of the daily goodness of fits (R2) between Q and GDA were then examined to identify the most relevant conceptual model of runoff generation in this landscape. We observed high R2 values during low flow conditions (mean R2?=?0.93 for 2009 and 2010). During wetter periods and in particular during large runoff events, the relationship degraded rapidly and consistently, suggesting differences in quickflow response among the gauged catchments. At low flows, the six catchments generated equivalent amounts of runoff (mm), leading to a strong QGDA relationship. During high flows, total growing season runoff increased systematically with GDA between 8 and 50?km2 and then decreased with further increases in GDA. These differences were responsible for the observed breakdown in the daily QGDA relationships and also resulted in significant differences in total runoff among the six catchments during the wetter year. Quantitative landscape analysis using a 5-m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model revealed that near-stream zone characteristics vary systematically with scale in a manner that is consistent with the observed patterns of quickflow runoff response. In this northern peatland complex, fast-responding flowpaths in the spatially discrete near-stream zones may be the key determinant of catchment runoff efficiency at the small to medium (similar to 10 to similar to 200?km2) headwater catchment scales analysed here. Moreover, the relatively organized drainage patterns observed in this study are consistent with our understanding of ecohydrological feedbacks driving geomorphic evolution of northern peatlands.

AB Interannual variations of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) are modulated by external forcings such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Atlantic Nino. Vegetation over land responds to variations in ISMR, but the feedback from vegetation to ISMR variability has not been fully explored yet. To address this gap, we perform two simulations with the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to the Community Land Surface Model (WRF-CLM) for the period of 2004-2018. We use the same boundary forcing from ERA-interim reanalysis for the two experiments, but with two different vegetation prescriptions, (1) observed, interannually varying Leaf Area Index (LAI), obtained from satellite images/data (VAR-LAI); and (2) climatological Leaf Area Index from the same product, to suppress interannual LAI variations (CLIM-LAI). We find that the correlation coefficient of simulated total seasonal rainfall with the observed data is higher for VAR-LAI simulation as compared to CLIM-LAI. To elicit causality among eco-hydro-climatological variables, we develop a network based on information theory, i.e., a process network. We find that LAI plays a major role in influencing precipitation in the network through evapotranspiration. The number of links originating from LAI and evapotranspiration increases during drought years, making the eco-hydro-climatological network denser. Our findings indicate that the ISMR predictions and projections need to represent the time-varying LAI to fully capture the varying feedbacks from evolving vegetation to the atmosphere especially during drought years.
   Plain Language Summary Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) has strong interannual variations impacting land processes, including vegetation. Here, we address an unanswered science question: Can these interannual variations of vegetation impact the variability of ISMR in turn through feedbacks? To test this hypothesis, we perform numerical experiments using a coupled regional landatmosphere model and find that representing varying vegetation improves the simulations of ISMR. We further use the information theory-based process network and find a higher number of information links originating from land to atmospheric variables, during the drought years. The interannual variations of ISMR are conventionally predicted based on large-scale dynamics neglecting region-specific local land processes. Here, we show the importance of regional land-atmosphere feedbacks to the interannual variations of ISMR.

AB Experiments were carried out using a mobile gravel bed placed in a tilting flume with a modified particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. Individual grain movements were surveyed using data from time series of images. Near-bed velocity flow field measurements were made simultaneously above the same area of the sediment surface by applying cross-correlation techniques to the collected plan view images. Statistics of grain motions were collected through a semiautomatic procedure. Significant changes in the flow field were observed in the proximity of the entrained or deposited particles. A strong correlation is shown between the changes in the local streamwise and lateral velocity and the movement of the grains. The theory of Grass is revisited and developed based on the experimental results. The probability distribution of individual grain resistance has been derived from the statistics of the near-bed velocity field and of the entrainment risk.

TI A self-identification Neuro-Fuzzy inference framework for modeling
   rainfall-runoff in a Chilean watershed

ID VARIABLE SELECTION; SHORT-TERM; PREDICTION; ANFIS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Modeling the relationship between rainfall and runoff is an important issue in hydrology, but it is a complicated task because both the high levels of complexity in which both processes are embedded and the associated uncertainty, affect the forecasting. Neuro-fuzzy models have emerged as a useful approach, given the ability of neural networks to optimize parameters in a fuzzy system. In this work a Self-Identification Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Model (SINFIM) for modeling the relationship between rainfall and runoff on a Chilean watershed is proposed to reduce the uncertainty of selecting both the rainfall and runoff lags and the number of membership functions required in a fuzzy system. The data comes from the Diguillin river located in Nuble region and average daily runoff and average daily rainfall recorded from years 2000 to 2018, according to the Chilean directorate of water resources (DGA). In addition, we worked with the Colorado River basin, located in the Maule region, to validate the method developed. The experimental results showed a good adjustment using the last 3 years as validation set, further improvement was achieved using only the last year was used as validation test, obtaining 84% of R-2 and 0, 91 Kling Gupta Efficiency, higher than other forecasting models such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial neural networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach. In addition, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent BIAS indicate the method is a promising model. On the other hand, even better results were obtained in the validation basin, whose adjustment was 94% and an efficiency of 97%. Therefore, the proposed model is a solid alternative to forecast the runoff in a given watershed, obtaining good performance measurements, managing to predict both the low and peak runoff values from rainfall events, avoiding the requirement to determine a priori the lags of time series and the number of fuzzy rules.

AB A general form of formula is presented for the rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) relationship. This formula is derived from the nearly normal probability distribution function of transformed intensities. In order to transform the raw intensities, a correcting non-constant spread technique, the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, and the Box-Cox transformation are adopted. These transformations enable to express a simpler model for the IDF formula that agrees well with traditional IDF relationships. Since the proposed method allows the estimation of any percentile value of intensities with a single equation, the intensity percentile at arbitrary duration can be generated easily. The validity of the formula derived by means of the proposed method is assessed using data from major weather stations in Korea. The results show that the percentile intensities produced using the proposed method are in good agreement with those of traditional frequency analysis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rainfall charges soil moisture and river basins among its many roles with respect to the hydrologic cycle. Research aimed at improved understanding and modeling of surface water processes includes attention to rainfall at a variety of space-time scales. Given the atmospheric environment in which rain events are observed, some similarities between certain rainfall data structures and fluid turbulence can be expected. So the space-time intermittency and large fluctuations observed in both rain rates and energy dissipation rates have provided an interest among hydrologists in developing physical theories, experiments, and mathematical models. In response to a request for insights into multiplicative cascade models, the main goal of this article is to single out a special mathematical transformation, namely, "size biasing'' (or "tilting''), which has proven to be very powerful in the mathematical analysis of multiplicative cascades and which has also been successfully exploited within the context of turbulence from a physical perspective.

AB In this study, geostatistical and stochastic methods are used to study groundwater flow and solute transport in a multiscale heterogeneous formation. The formation is composed of various materials, and distributions of conductivity and chemical sorption coefficient within each material are heterogeneous. The random distributions of materials in the formation are characterized by an indicator function. The conductivity and chemical sorption coefficient fields in each material are assumed to be statistically stationary. On the basis of these assumptions a general expression is derived for the covariance function of the composite field in terms of the covariance of the indicator variable and the properties of the composite materials. Darcy's law and perturbation method are applied to develop the covariance of the retarded velocity. The numerical method of moments [Zhang et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2003a, 2003b] is used to study the effects of various uncertain parameters on flow and transport predictions. Case studies have been conducted to investigate the influences of a medium's physical and chemical heterogeneity and nonstationarity on solute flux prediction. The study results indicate that the large-scale heterogeneity dominates the effects on flow and solute transport processes, and the effect of small-scale heterogeneity is secondary. It is also shown from the case studies that the numerical method of moments is applicable to studying flow and solute transport in complex subsurface environments, especially for the uncertainty analysis. Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained through method of moment. The calculation results of the mean total solute flux by the two methods match very well, but the variance of total solute flux obtained by the method of moments is smaller than that by the Monte Carlo method, especially for the cases with large total variances of the conductivity and sorption coefficient. In comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation, the method of moments is much more efficient in calculation.

TI Analytical solutions for transport in porous media with Gaussian source

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
AB Analytical solutions for the advective-dispersion equation for solute transport in porous media commonly assume a uniform distribution of mass within the source term. This paper derives an analytical solution for transport in porous media for a source term whose mass; is distributed as a bivariate Gaussian spatial function. The solution is an extension of existing analytical solutions using a Green's function approach to separate out one-dimensional terms in a manner similar to previous authors. This approach illustrates the relationship of the bivariate Gaussian source term solation to of her Green's function solutions and thus leads to a set of solutions for advective-dispersive transport with various source term and domain geometries. Comparison of point, bivariate Gaussian, and uniform source term solutions finds the greatest differences' near the source, with discrepancies decreasing with travel distance.

AB We present a bivariate model of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition by overland flow, designed for complex terrain, soil, and cover conditions. We use a Green's function Monte Carlo method to solve the underlying continuity equations, leading to improved robustness and implementation efficiency. By deriving the relationship between the terrain shape and erosion/deposition pattern, we clarify the physical interpretation of terrain curvatures and overall importance of the bivariate formulation. We explain the impact of various soil and cover properties by simulating the detachment and transport capacity limited erosion for uniform land use and by predicting the erosion/deposition distribution for a conventional, spatially variable land use at an experimental farm. We compare the results with the observed colluvial deposits and linear erosion features and illustrate the application of the model for improving the effectiveness of erosion prevention measures.

AB Processes of infiltration, transport, and outflow in unsaturated soil necessarily involve the dissipation of energy through various processes. Accounting for these energetic processes can contribute to modeling hydrological and ecological systems. The well-documented hysteretic relationship between matric potential and moisture content in soil suggests that one such mechanism of energy dissipation is associated with the cycling between wetting and drying processes, but it is challenging to estimate the magnitude of the effect in situ. The Preisach model, a generalization of the Independent Domain model, allows hysteresis effects to be incorporated into dynamical systems of differential equations. Building on earlier work using such systems with field data from the south-west of Ireland, this work estimates the average rate of hysteretic energy dissipation. Through some straightforward assumptions, the magnitude of this rate is found to be of O(10(-5)) W m(-3).

AB The current study focuses on understanding key factors controlling geochemical export in eight diverse coastal watersheds at seasonal and annual time scales. Geochemical, atmospheric and hydrologic data across a range of hydro-climatic regimes and varying land uses were investigated and relationships analysed. A hyperbolic dilution model was fitted for each watershed system to evaluate dischargeconcentration relationships. Nitrate concentration effects were observed in watersheds exposed to high atmospheric deposition rates as well as agricultural watersheds, whereas urban watersheds showed nitrate dilution effects. Dilution patterns were observed for calcium, magnesium and sulfate for almost all watersheds. Seasonal loads for almost all constituents were noted to be mainly driven by hydrologic seasonality, but are also dependent on inputs (atmospheric deposition and land use sources). Understanding the primary controls on hydro-chemical interactions is critical for developing and refining predictive water quality models, especially in coastal watersheds where sensitive downstream ecosystems act as receiving waters for upstream pollutant loads.

DE soil water characteristics; cavitation; unsaturated porous media;

ID NEGATIVE PRESSURES; WATER; STRENGTH
AB [1] A potential mechanism for liquid drainage in wet porous media based on cavitation of water (the spontaneous formation of water vapor bubbles) under tension is proposed. Cavitation theory applied to an idealized pore predicts considerable differences in drainage branches of characteristic curves determined under tension and with imposed positive pressure. A potentially important aspect of cavitation is the possibility of liquid displacement (drainage) even in the absence of a continuous gaseous phase. Surface heterogeneity and impurities in soil and rock water are conducive for lowering cavitation tension threshold; on the other hand, small pore sizes and viscous resistance to flow restrain cavitation in natural porous media. The significance of cavitation in flow and transport processes is yet unknown; however, there are two important aspects to this phenomenon: (1) it may require revision of several conceptual models for liquid retention and displacement in porous media, and (2) extrapolating from evidence in plant xylem systems, cavitation may play an important role in determining the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function.

AB This study is among the first to report on a theoretical relationship linking the hydraulic conductivity of soil and aquifer with environmental solution conditions. A mathematical model is developed for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite from the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution. The model relies on the diffuse double layer and DLVO theories, the aggregation kinetics, and the Hazen equation, with a few plausible assumptions, for establishing three individual relationships, with each corresponding to one of three steps in the cation-to-particle-to-grain-to-hydraulic conductivity pathway. It is based on a mechanistic understanding that the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations controls the size of montmorillonite primary particles by influencing the electrical double layer, subsequently regulates the grain-size distribution of montmorillonite via inter-particle collision, and finally determines the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite. The model is validated by direct measurements of the surface charge density, the grain-size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite in NaCl and CaCl2 solutions of various concentrations. The theoretical model of predicting hydraulic conductivity developed here is novel for implementing more accurate modeling of contaminant transport in the environment with advantage of cost-savings.

AB How floods respond to changing climate is of great concern in research community and society, but there is no consistent conclusion about whether floods are as sensitive to changes in temperature as precipitation extremes. In this study, the responses and connections of local floods to temperature and precipitation extremes over three hydroclimatically different regions across the United States were explored. The regions include Northeast Coast (humid coast), Central Plains (dry inland), Southeast Plains (humid subtropic), varying in atmospheric moisture availability. Investigation was made at both hourly and daily timescales, and the influences of watershed imperviousness on flood responses were highlighted by using small watersheds (< 600 km(2)) and categorizing watersheds based on watershed imperviousness. Correlation and co-occurrence probability analysis shows that the connections between floods and precipitation extremes over the studied watersheds are relatively high, with the majority showing a value of 0.6 and 0.5 for the two criteria, respectively. Scaling analysis finds that hourly precipitation extremes generally scale with daily temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship, but daily precipitation extremes reflect smaller scaling rates and even decrease with rising temperature at higher temperatures. Despite floods in the studied watersheds are highly related with precipitation extremes, the scaling of flood-temperature is always lower than that of extreme precipitation-temperature. Increasing connections between floods and precipitation extremes, resulted from higher watershed imperviousness or in summer months, tend to increase the scaling of flood-temperature, even to a close CC relationship. However, the scaling of flood-temperature still cannot surpass that of extreme precipitation-temperature. It is generally concluded that flood would change with rising temperature at a rate smaller than what is expected from the scaling of precipitation extremes to temperature, and precipitation scaling analysis should better use finer-timescale (e.g., hourly) precipitation records.

AB In the subsurface, fractures commonly provide dominant pathways for fluid flow and solute transport. However, mechanisms responsible for dispersion in large-scale fracture networks are not completely understood. Scalable models of flow and transport in discrete fracture networks that accurately represent the small-scale physics controlling transport can provide a means for improving understanding of the large-scale dispersion mechanisms. Within fracture networks, mixing within fracture intersections can play an important role in mass transport. This mixing process results from a combination of advection and diffusion within fracture intersections. A number of high-resolution computational studies involving direct solution of the Stokes equations in fracture intersections show that mixing exhibits a strong dependence on Peclet number, Pe = V(b)/D-m, where V is the mean fluid velocity, (b) is the mean fracture aperture and D-m is the molecular diffusion coefficient. However, such high-resolution techniques are not feasible in large-scale network simulations, so it is common to model mixing using either stream-tube routing (Pe -> infinity) or complete mixing (Pe -> 0). We present a novel probabilistic method that allows accurate and efficient calculation of the Pe-dependent solute transport through fracture intersections. Fundamental to our approach is a simplified approximation to the Stokes velocity field within fracture intersections based upon local application of the cubic law in each fracture entering and exiting the fracture intersection. In addition, we use a time domain approach to route particles across the fracture intersection in a single step; using this approach the influence of both advection and diffusion are represented explicitly. Results show that our new model accurately represents the trajectory and travel times of particles passing through a fracture intersection. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is two to three orders-of-magnitude faster than comparable simulations relying upon detailed simulation of the Stokes velocity field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The age distribution of water in hydrologic systems has received renewed interest recently, especially in relation to watershed response to rainfall inputs. The purpose of this contribution is first to draw attention to existing theories of age distributions in population dynamics, fluid mechanics and stochastic groundwater, and in particular to the McKendrick-von Foerster equation and its generalizations and solutions. A second and more important goal is to clarify that, when hydrologic fluxes are modeled by means of time-varying stochastic processes, the age distributions must themselves be treated as random functions. Once their probabilistic structure is obtained, it can be used to characterize the variability of age distributions in real systems and thus help quantify the inherent uncertainty in the field determination of water age. We illustrate these concepts with reference to a stochastic storage model, which has been used as a minimalist model of soil moisture and streamflow dynamics.

AB The saturation solution to the capillary retention phenomenon is critical to understand how much and what type of phase is retained by a heterogeneous medium. Hence, this paper studies the solution qualitatively using methods from the qualitative theory of differential equations. In particular, when the capillary function, defined as the square root of the ratio of permeability to porosity, is differentiable and monotonic is examined. The analysis shows that the saturation solution is bell shaped with a local minimum or maximum point depending on the Leverett curve and the derivative of the capillary function. The case with a discontinuous capillary function is identified here as the limiting case when the regularisation parameter approaches zero. Analytical solution of the linearised differential equation enables the derivation of a parameter that characterises the local flow regime of the solution. The parameter is a function of the capillary number, the viscous limit fractional flow and the diffusivity functions. The results of the analysis are validated and demonstrated numerically.

AB We present a systematic comparison study of simulating two-phase flow (drainage) in single heterogeneous fractures by using two fundamentally different approaches, namely, a continuum-based two-phase flow model and an invasion-percolation (IP) model. We analyze both gravity neutral and gravity destabilized cases. In the continuum model, the two-phase mass conservation equations for the 2-D fracture plane are solved, based on modifications to TOUGH2, a numerical simulator for multiphase and multicomponent flow and transport in geological media. A specific capillary pressure-liquid saturation function is used to account for the sudden drainage of a local aperture location in the fracture once its local aperture-dependent nonwetting phase fluid entry pressure is exceeded. Results from the continuum model are compared to those from an IP model that includes trapping. We consider cases where the contribution of aperture-induced curvature in the capillary pressure term dominates over that of the in-plane curvature. The comparison shows that the presented continuum model can well reproduce the IP model results at low-capillary-number conditions and furthermore can also produce meaningful results in the high-capillary-number regimes where IP models are not valid. Taking into account the viscous forces in the fluid displacement process, the continuum model is used to examine the effect of capillary number (reflecting the injection rate) on the phase invasion. When the injection rate varies from low to high, simulations using the continuum model show that the invasion pattern changes from single dominant fingers to more homogeneous spreading and/or clusters with numerous tortuous fingers. This trend is comparable to results from previous experimental observations in the literature. The continuum model is also used to numerically construct the upscaled (fracture-scale) capillary pressure-saturation relationship. The upscaled relationship can be well fitted to the van Genuchten and the Brooks-Corey porous-medium-type models. Fracture capillary behavior depends on the aperture field heterogeneity. Simulation results indicate that increasing the aperture standard deviation leads to smaller entry pressure and larger residual water saturation. Citation: Yang, Z., A. Niemi, F. Fagerlund, and T.

AB This paper investigates the variation of hydraulic roughness parameters with flow depth for submerged flexible vegetation. In an experimental study flexible grass canopies are used to examine the impact of stem height, grass type and degree of submergence on the flow resistance properties. Results reveal that Manning's n roughness coefficient increases with decreasing flow depth reaching an asymptotic constant at lower levels of vegetation submergence. Data suggest that the value of the constant is dependent on the vegetation height and the vegetation properties. Currently the n-UR method underpredicts the Manning's n and the data from this study extends the USDA method for lower bed slopes and for smaller UR values. The vegetal drag-Reynolds number model is extended for submerged flexible grass linings of differing heights and types. Similar values of the vegetative characteristic number k are evaluated as from previous studies yet for contrasting vegetation types. The vegetal drag coefficient value was found to be strongly correlated to the vegetation height, and follows a power law relationship. The exponent value was found to be independent of the vegetation characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Channel meanders in rivers induce complex three-dimensional (3D) flow characteristics such as secondary flows and flow recirculation. Helical secondary flows promote transverse dispersion, and flow recirculation zones trap tracers. As a result, these meander-driven flows may cause anomalous transport manifested by unusually elevated levels of tracer concentration at early and late times of breakthrough curves (BTCs). In this study, we perform 3D numerical simulations in meandering channels across a wide range of channel sinuosity to investigate the impact of meander geometry on flow and transport. We solve 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stoke equations blended with a SST k - omega turbulence model to obtain velocity and turbulence fields. We then incorporate the obtained flow fields into a Lagrangian particle tracking model to simulate solute transport. Sinuosity higher than 1.5 leads to the onset of horizontal recirculating flows along the apex outer banks, and these recirculation zones expand as sinuosity increases. The analysis of the transport simulations elucidates that the interplay between the secondary flows and recirculation zones induces anomalous transport. The helical secondary flows bring particles into the recirculation zones by promoting transverse dispersion, and the recirculating flows delay particle transport by the trapping effect. We show that the tail power-law slope and truncated time of BTCs as well as Lagrangian tortuosity distributions change dramatically with the emergence of recirculation zones. These analyses demonstrate that the recirculation zones are acting as the primary driver of anomalous transport. Finally, we successfully predict the observed anomalous transport with a Spatial Markov Model (SMM), which is an upscaled transport model that incorporates Lagrangian velocity distribution and spatial velocity correlation. The successful predictions show that the Lagrangian velocity statistics effectively capture the underlying mechanisms of anomalous transport in meandering open-channel flows.

AB We study the time behavior of solute transport in a heterogeneous medium. We consider a spatially biased continuous time random walk (CTRW) governed by psi(s, t), the joint probability density for an event-displacement s with an event-time t. In this effective transport framework the concentration distribution of a solute is given by a generalized master equation (GME). We present results detailing the time dependence for the resident and flux concentrations, the center of mass velocity and the macroscopic dispersion coefficients of the solute plume. The Laplace transform of the GME is converted to a spatial differential equation resembling the advection dispersion equation (ADE), with Laplace space dependent coefficients though, and can then be solved explicitly in Laplace space. The transport behavior of the solute is then determined by accurate numerical inverse Laplace transforms. The confirmation of the accuracy of our methods is demonstrated by the excellent agreement with efficient random walk simulations based on the same psi(s, t). The psi(s, t) is given by the product of a Gaussian distribution for s and a truncated power-law distribution for t. This particular choice allows for a systematic study of the time regimes of anomalous and normal transport behavior and the transition from normal to anomalous behavior. The presented results show new aspects for the modeling of solute transport in heterogeneous media, in particular the effect of the system "memory" on plume patterns at asymptotically long times. In a specific application we solve for the contaminant flux entering a stream from a point injection of tracer in a catchment. The results are discussed as an independent test of a model of fractal stream chemistry in catchments. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Motional modes of dilatational waves in elastic porous media containing

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PROPAGATION
AB Numerical simulations of dilatational waves in an elastic porous medium containing two immiscible viscous compressible fluids indicate that three types of wave occur, but the modes of dilatory motion corresponding to the three waves remain uncharacterized as functions of relative saturation. In the present paper, we address this problem by deriving normal coordinates for the three dilatational waves based on the general poroelasticity equations of Lo et al. 2005 [13]. The normal coordinates provide a theoretical foundation with which to characterize the motional modes in terms of six connecting coefficients that depend in a well defined way on inertial drag, viscous drag, and elasticity properties. Using numerical calculations of the connecting coefficients in the seismic frequency range for an unconsolidated sand containing water and air as a representative example relevant to hydrologic applications, we confirm that the dilatational wave whose speed is greatest corresponds to the motional mode in which the solid framework and the two pore fluids always move in phase, regardless of water saturation, in agreement with the classic Biot theory of the fast compressional wave in a water-saturated porous medium. For the wave which propagates second fastest, we show, apparently for the first time, that the solid framework moves in phase with water, but out of phase with air [Mode (III)], if the water saturation is below about 0.8, whereas the solid framework moves out of phase with both pore fluids [Mode (IV)] above this water saturation. The transition from Mode (III) to Mode (IV) corresponds to that between the capillarity-dominated region of the water retention curve and the region reflecting air-entry conditions near full water saturation. The second of the two modes corresponds exactly to the slow compressional wave in classic Biot theory, whereas the first mode is possible only in a two-fluid system undergoing capillary pressure fluctuations. For the wave which has the smallest speed, the dilatational mode is dominated by the motions of the two pore fluids, which are always out of phase, a result that is consistent with the proposition that this wave is caused by capillary pressure fluctuations.

AB Wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis are used to identify and describe spatial and temporal variability in Canadian seasonal precipitation, and to gain further insights into the dynamical relationship between the seasonal precipitation and the dominant modes of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. Results from applying continuous wavelet transform to seasonal precipitation series from 201 stations selected from Environment Canada Meteorological Network reveal striking climate-related features before and after the 1940s. The span of available observations, 1900-2000, allows for depicting variance and covariance for periods up to 12 years. Scale-averaged wavelet power spectra are used to simultaneously assess the temporal and spatial variability in each set of 201 seasonal precipitation time series. The most striking feature, in the 2-3-year period and in the 3-6-year period-the 6-12-year period is dominated by white noise and is not considered further-is a net distinction between the timing and intensity of the temporal variability in autumn, winter and spring-summer precipitation. It is found that the autumn season exhibits the most intense activity (or variance) in both the 2-3 year and the 3-6 year periods. The winter season corresponds to the least intense activity for the 2-3 year period, but it exhibits more activity than the spring-summer for the 3-6 year period.
   Cross-wavelet analysis is provided between the seasonal precipitation and four selected climatic indices: the Pacific North America (PNA), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) originally called the Arctic Oscillation, and the sea surface temperature series over the Nino-3 region (ENSO). The wavelet cross-spectra revealed coherent space-time variability of the climate-precipitation relationship throughout Canada. It is shown that strong climate/precipitation activity (or covariance) in the 2-6 year period starts after 1940 whatever the climatic index and the season. Prior to year 1940, only local and weaker 2-6 year activity is revealed in western Canada essentially in winter and autumn, but overall a non-significant precipitation/climate relationship is observed prior to 1940. Correlation analysis in the 2-6 year band between the seasonal precipitation and the selected climatic indices revealed strong positive correlations with the ENSO, the NAO, and the NAM in eastern and western Canada for the post-1940 period. For the period prior to 1940, the correlation tend be negative for all the indices whatever the region. A particular feature in the correlation analysis results is the consistently stronger and positive NAM-precipitation correlations in all the regions since 1940. The cross-wavelet spectra and the correlation analysis in the 2-6 year band suggest the presence of a change point around 1940 in Canadian seasonal precipitation-that is found to be more likely related to NAM dynamics.

AB Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been commonly applied in the last two decades as a substitute for the traditional mathematical programming algorithms in searching for optimal operating rules of reservoir systems. However, only a few GA studies related to reservoir operations addressed the inflow uncertainty. In this study, the reservoir operation rules were developed and evaluated by reflecting the uncertainty of reservoir inflows using the non-dominated sorting GA II algorithm (NSGA-II) through the following procedure: (1) the historical inflow data were classified into four clusters using the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering technique; (2) NSGA-II searched for an optimal release rule in each cluster with all the inflow data of the corresponding cluster; (3) a release response function was then derived for each cluster by regressing the calculated optimal release data against the storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow during the month; and (4) finally, the derived release rules for each cluster were tested with three performance indices, namely, reliability, resilience, and vulnerability. The proposed procedure was applied to the monthly operations of the Lake Tana multi-reservoir system in Ethiopia, which has six upstream irrigation reservoirs and one natural lake that has three release outlets for agriculture, hydropower, and instream requirement. Using the NSGA-II, SOM, and a seasonal ARIMA forecasting model in this study, it is concluded that 1) the overall performance of the proposed optimization procedure with ARIMA forecasts and cluster approach reaches 84% of the perfect information case across multiple performance measures; 2) the use of the one-month-ahead ARIMA forecasts improves the overall system performance by 8% over simply optimizing to the mean flow; and 3) the use of the four clusters and the consequent RRFs further improves the overall system performance by 14%. Furthermore, this study recommends that, in future, significant efforts should be focused on improving the operation performance of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the Lake Tana system.

AB In this work we study mixed finite element approximations of Richards' equation for simulating variably saturated subsurface flow and simultaneous reactive solute transport. Whereas higher order schemes have proved their ability to approximate reliably reactive solute transport (cf., e.g. [Bause M, Knabner P. Numerical simulation of contaminant biodegradation by higher order methods and adaptive time stepping. Comput Visual Sci 7;2004:61-78]), the Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element method (RT0) with a first order accurate flux approximation is popular for computing the underlying water flow field (cf. [Bause M, Knabner P. Computation of variably saturated subsurface flow by adaptive mixed hybrid finite element methods. Adv Water Resour 27;2004:565-581, Farthing MW, Kees CE, Miller CT. Mixed finite element methods and higher order temporal approximations for variably saturated groundwater flow. Adv Water Resour 26;2003:373-394, Starke G. Least-squares mixed finite element solution of variably saturated subsurface flow problems. SIAM J Sci Comput 21;2000:1869-1885, Younes A, Mose R, Ackerer P, Chavent G.

Analysis of expanded mixed finite element methods for a nonlinear parabolic equation modeling flow into variably saturated porous media. SIAM J Numer Anal 37;2000:701-724]). This combination might be non-optimal. Higher order techniques could increase the accuracy of the flow field calculation and thereby improve the prediction of the solute transport. Here, we analyse the application of the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element (BDM1) with a second order accurate flux approximation to elliptic, parabolic and degenerate problems whose solutions lack the regularity that is assumed in optimal order error analyses. For the flow field calculation a superiority of the BDM1 approach to the RT0 one is observed, which however is less significant for the accompanying solute transport. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new data set of bimodal subaqueous channel bed sediments was analyzed for longitudinal patterns in grain size. It yielded two interesting observations: (1) separate fining trends in d(50) exist for gravel and fines that overlap for similar to 175 river kilometers, and (2) this overlap in fining trends results in a protracted (nonabrupt) gravel to sand transition. These suggest bed patchiness that is interpreted in the context of inherent grain size bimodality, localized hydraulic sorting due to spatially heterogeneous (and low) sediment supply, and local deviations in channel gradient. The data also show that tributaries have a minor impact on main stem downstream fining due to basin shape and tectonic history. In addition, subaqueous channel sediments were observed to be finer than nearby sediments collected from exposed bars, which may indicate a narrow active zone of transport where bars are disconnected from sediment movement. This research has implications for bed material collection and theories of downstream fining.

AB We examined the impact of both seasonal and year-to-year variations in precipitation on simulated soil moisture dynamics at a tropical rain forest (TRF) site and a tropical seasonal forest (TSF) site in Southeast Asia, between which there is a clear difference in the precipitation regime, through a probabilistic ecohydrological model. All model parameters have apparent physical meaning and were obtained by field observations. Rainfall statistics as the primary model forcing terms were constructed from long-term rainfall records, and their analysis revealed a close relationship between drought and El Nino events at the TRF site and a long-term drying trend at the TSF site. The model results further demonstrated that the studied ecosystem's robustness ( mainly concerning the plant water availability) are attributed to functional factors such as soil texture for the TRF site and rooting depth and the dry season use of water from the preceding wet season for the TSF site.

AB The flux along a horizontal well in uniform flow is examined using an analytic three-dimensional, steady model. Wells with uniform head and low pumping rates have gaining sections along which water enters the well and losing sections along which water exits. Such a well may provide a conduit for contaminated groundwater to be drawn into the well, conveyed a large distance, and injected into an uncontaminated region of an aquifer. Dimensionless ratios of the well's length L and radius R, aquifer thickness H, and uniform flow rate U are developed to quantify the minimum pumping rate Q(min) at which no losing section occurs. The ratio Q(min)/(ULH) is presented as a nomograph using R/H and L/H for placement parallel to flow and is 6 piR/H for placement perpendicular to flow, and,a parabolic relationship between these limiting cases is developed for placement oblique to flow. Capture zone geometry is quantified using Q(min)/(ULH).

AB Pathogen transport in heterogeneous aquifers is investigated for microbial risk assessment. A point source with time-dependent input of pathogens is assumed, exemplified as a simple on-site sanitation installation, intermingled with water supply wells. Any pathogen transmission pathway (realization) to the receptor from a postulated infection hazard is viewed as a random event, with the hydraulic conductivity varying spatially. For aquifers where VAR[lnK] < 1 and the integral scale is finite, we provide relatively simple semianalytical expressions for pathogen transport that incorporate the colloid filtration theory. We test a wide range of Damkohler numbers in order to assess the significance of rate limitations on the aquifer barrier function. Even slow immobile inactivation may notably affect the retention of pathogens. Analytical estimators for microbial peak discharge are evaluated and are shown to be applicable using parameters representative of rotavirus and Hepatitis A with input of 10-20 days duration.

AB Tamil Nadu State in south-eastern India receives most of its rainfall from October through December, a phenomenon known as north-east monsoon rainfall (NEMR). Tamil Nadu's south-west monsoon rainfall (SWMR), received between June and September, correlates positively with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), whereas NEMR correlates negatively. We undertook Study to investigate the relationship between global teleconnection indicators, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and precipitation over Tamil Nadu during NEMR. The results showed that NEMR had significant positive correlation with Nino-3 sea-surface temperatures (SST) in July. The statistical relationships between the IOD and NEMR were much weaker than those between ENSO and NEMR.
   To understand the relationship and/or local dynamic structure, composites of the Circulation field for the extreme El Nino/La Nina years were compared with the mean state for July, September and November. Composite Circulation analysis clearly showed that in extreme El Nino years, the Bay of Bengal exhibited a positive sea-level pressure (SLP) anomaly, and the Arabian Sea exhibited a negative SLP anomaly, which resulted in strong north-easterly winds, bringing Moisture and precipitation to the Southern part of India in November. The reverse was also true: A strong negative anomaly was observed in the Bay of Bengal during La Nina years, which resulted in a weak NE monsoon. However, local circulation anomalies (Bay of Bengal through Arabian Sea) did not continue from July to November. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID AIR-TEMPERATURE
AB The data-driven technique, evolutionary polynomial regression, has been tested and used for the study of water temperature behaviour in the River Barle (south-west England). The study aimed to produce multiple models for forecasting water temperature, using air temperature as input. In addition, river discharge data were used to describe the hydrological regime of the study stream, even if they are not involved in the modelling phase. The availability of data sampled at hourly intervals allowed behaviour to be studied at several time scales, including short-term lags between air temperature and water temperature. The approach to model building differs front previous studies in that the relationship between air temperature and water temperature is not evaluated on the basis of a multi-parameter regression, nor does it identify particular Structures; rather the evolutionary technique identifies the model by itself. In fact, the non-linear relationship between air temperature and water temperature is investigated by an evolutionary search in the space of particular pseudo-polynomials structures.

AB [1] Hydrological processes within the terrestrial water cycle operate over a wide range of time and space scales, and with governing equations that may be a mixture of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper we propose a unified strategy for the formulation and solution of fully coupled process equations at the watershed and river basin scale. The strategy shows how a system of mixed equations can be locally reduced to ordinary differential equations using the semidiscrete finite volume method (FVM). Domain decomposition partitions the watershed surface onto an unstructured grid, and vertical projection of each element forms a finite volume on which all physical process equations are formed. The projected volume or prism is partitioned into surface and subsurface layers, leading to a fully coupled, local ODE system, referred to as the model "kernel." The global ODE system is assembled by combining the local ODE system over the domain, and is then solved by a state-of-the-art ODE solver. The unstructured grid, based on Delaunay triangulation, is generated with constraints related to the river network, watershed boundary, elevation contours, vegetation, geology, etc. The underlying geometry and parameter fields are then projected onto the irregular network. The kernel-based formulation simplifies the process of adding or eliminating states, constitutive laws, or closure relations. The strategy is demonstrated for the Shale Hills experimental watershed in central Pennsylvania, and several phenomena are observed: (1) The enslaving principle is shown to be a useful approximation for soil moisture-water table dynamics for shallow soils in upland watersheds; (2) the coupling shows how antecedent moisture (i.e., initial conditions) can amplify peak flows; (3) the coupled equations predict the onset or threshold for upland ephemeral channel flow; and ( 4) the model shows how microtopographic information controls surface saturation and connectivity of overland flow paths for the Shale Hills site. The open-source code developed in this research is referred to as the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM).

AB River discharge values, estimated using a rating curve, are subject to both random and epistemic errors. We present a new likelihood function, the Voting Point' likelihood that accounts for both error types and enables generation of multiple possible multisegment power-law rating curve samples that aim to represent the total uncertainty. The rating curve samples can be used for subsequent discharge analysis that needs total uncertainty estimation, e.g. regionalisation studies or calculation of hydrological signatures. We demonstrate the method using four catchments with diverse rating curve error characteristics, where epistemic uncertainty sources include weed growth, scour and redeposition of the bed gravels in a braided river, and unconfined high flows. The results show that typically, the posterior rating curve distributions include all of the gauging points and succeed in representing the spread of discharge values caused by epistemic rating errors. We aim to provide a useful method for hydrology practitioners to assess rating curve, and hence discharge, uncertainty that is easily applicable to a wide range of catchments and does not require prior specification of the particular types and causes of epistemic error at the gauged location.

AB This work presents and discusses a series of experiments focusing on the transport of floating particles, mimicking seeds and propagules, within an array of randomly arranged cylinders mimicking emergent vegetation stems. The focus is on the temporary capture process by which particles colliding with a cylinder are trapped by surface tension for finite but relatively long retention times, thus promoting a large mechanical dispersion. Video analysis of the particle paths within the array shows that the probability of particles being captured, either temporarily or permanently, as well as the mean retention time, vary with flow velocity while being weakly affected by stem density. On the contrary, stem density plays a significant role in determining the frequency of the temporary captures; in particular, the probability of having temporary, rather than permanent, captures increases with vegetation density. We also propose some relationships to predict the probability of having temporary capture events and their mean duration based on experimental results.

AB As the efficiency of the long-running inter basin water transfer (IBWT) projects declines, the increasing water crisis in the intake area and the deteriorating ecosystem problems in the transferred area have gradually worsened. In this paper, a new form of IBWT, the dual-IBWT (DIBWT), is defined, in which the original transferred area (OTA) and additional transferred area (ATA) are integrated to transfer water resource from two basins to a corporate intake area (CIA). Unlike a typical IBWT, the OTA is one of the transferred areas for the CIA as well as the recipient area of the ATA and plays a dual role in this DIBWT system. A multi-objective DIBWT model involving interconnected OTA and ATA submodels is developed for fulfilling joint transfer targets, flattening water transfer fluctuations, and replenishing ecological flow demands. Then, a three-step framework is presented to derive the multi-resource joint operation rules coordinating the water-supply, water-transfer and water-receipt rules together. In particular, the simulation-optimization approach (SO) is applied to obtain the optimal solution based on a time series of 56 years. The Jialing across Han River to Wei River Water Transfer (JHW-DIBWT) project in western China is used as a case study to assess the performance of the DIBWT compared to a typical IBWT. The results indicate that the JHW-DIBWT has significant advantages in alleviating the conflicts of transfer-supply-demand and restoring the river ecosystem with the aid of additional water resources. Meanwhile, its superiority is revealed by the corresponding joint operation rules of the water-supply, the water-transfer and the water-receipt rule curves, which also can serve as a practical guide for multi-objective and multi-resource water system management. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is not limited to compare the performance between these two IBWTs, but more importantly, it provides a promising framework for extending the study of different form of IBWTs.

AB [1] Spatial patterns of land surface and subsurface characteristics often exert significant control over hydrological processes at many scales. Recognition of the dominant controls at the watershed scale, which is a prerequisite to successful prediction of system responses, will require significant progress in many different research areas. The development and improvement of techniques for mapping structures and spatiotemporal patterns using geophysical and remote sensing techniques would greatly benefit watershed science but still requires a significant synthesis effort. Effective descriptions of hydrological systems will also significantly benefit from new scaling and averaging techniques, from new mathematical description for spatial pattern/structures and their dynamics, and also from an understanding and quantification of structure and pattern-building processes in different compartments ( soils, rocks, and land surface) and at different scales. The advances that are needed to tackle these complex challenges could be greatly facilitated through the development of an interdisciplinary research framework that explores instrumentation, theory, and simulation components and that is implemented in a coordinated manner.

AB Evaporative fluxes from terrestrial porous surfaces are determined by interplay between internal capillary and diffusive transport, energy input, and mass exchange across the land-air interface. Turbulent airflows near the Earth's surface introduce complex boundary conditions that affect vapor, heat, and momentum exchange rates with the atmosphere. The impact of turbulent airflow on evaporation from porous surfaces was quantified using surface renewal theory coupled with a physically based pore scale model for vapor transfer from partially wet surfaces to individual eddies. The model considers diffusive vapor exchange with individual eddies interacting intermittently with a drying surface to quantify mean surface evaporative fluxes. The model captures nonlinearities between surface water content and evaporation flux during drying of porous surfaces, yielding close agreement with experimental results.

AB [1] The spectrum of soil moisture content at scales ranging from 1 hour to 8 years is analyzed for a site whose hydrologic balance is primarily governed by precipitation (p), and evapotranspiration (ET). The site is a uniformly planted loblolly pine stand situated in the southeastern United States and is characterized by a shallow rooting depth (R-L) and a near-impervious clay pan just below R-L. In this setup, when ET linearly increases with increasing root zone soil moisture content (theta), an analytical model can be derived for the soil moisture content energy spectrum (E-s( f), where f is frequency) that predicts the soil moisture "memory'' ( taken as the integral timescale) as beta(-1)(1) approximate to eta R-L/ETmax, where ETmax is the maximum measured hourly ET and h is the soil porosity. The spectral model suggests that E-s(f) decays at f(-2-alpha) at high f but almost white (i.e., f(0)) at low f, where alpha is the power law exponent of the rainfall spectrum at high f (alpha approximate to 0.75 for this site). The rapid E-s( f) decay at high f makes the soil moisture variance highly imbalanced in the Fourier domain, thereby permitting much of the soil moisture variability to be described by a limited number of Fourier modes. For the 8-year data collected here, 99.6% of the soil moisture variance could be described by less than 0.4% of its Fourier modes. A practical outcome of this energy imbalance in the frequency domain is that the diurnal cycle in ET can be ignored if beta(-1)(1) ( estimated at 7.6 days from the model) is much larger than 12 hours. The model, however, underestimates the measured E-s(f) at very low frequencies (f << beta(1)) and its memory, estimated from the data at 42 days. This underestimation is due to seasonality in ETmax and to a partial decoupling between ET and soil moisture at low frequencies.

AB The spontaneous imbibition of water and other liquids into gas-filled fractures in variably-saturated porous media is important in a variety of engineering and geological contexts. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated this phenomenon. We present a theoretical framework for predicting the 1-dimensional movement of water into air-filled fractures within a porous medium based on early-time capillary dynamics and spreading over the rough surfaces of fracture faces. The theory permits estimation of sorptivity values for the matrix and fracture zone, as well as a dispersion parameter which quantifies the extent of spreading of the wetting front. Quantitative data on spontaneous imbibition of water in unsaturated Berea sandstone cores were acquired to evaluate the proposed model. The cores with different permeability classes ranging from 50 to 500 mD and were fractured using the Brazilian method. Spontaneous imbibition in the fractured cores was measured by dynamic neutron radiography at the Neutron Imaging Prototype Facility (beam line CG-1D, HFIR), Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Water uptake into both the matrix and the fracture zone exhibited square-root-of-time behavior. The matrix sorptivities ranged from 2.9 to 4.6 mm s(-0.5), and increased linearly as the permeability class increased. The sorptivities of the fracture zones ranged from 17.9 to 27.1 mm s(-0.5), and increased linearly with increasing fracture aperture width. The dispersion coefficients ranged from 23.7 to 66.7 mm(2) s(-0.5) and increased linearly with increasing fracture aperture width and damage zone width. Both theory and observations indicate that fractures can significantly increase spontaneous imbibition in unsaturated sedimentary rock by capillary action and surface spreading on rough fracture faces. Fractures also increase the dispersion of the wetting front. Further research is needed to investigate this phenomenon in other natural and engineered porous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper deals with two-equation models describing solute transport in highly heterogeneous porous systems and more particularly dual permeability structures composed of high- and low-permeability regions. A macroscopic two-equation model has been previously proposed in the literature based on the volume averaging technique [Ahmadi A, Quintard M, Whitaker S. Transport in chemically and mechanically heterogeneous porous media V: two-equation model for solute transport with adsorption, Adv Water Resour 1998;22:59-86; Cherblanc F, Ahmadi A, Quintard M. Two-medium description of dispersion in heterogeneous porous media: calculation of macroscopic properties. Water Resour Res 2003;39(6):1154-73]. Through this theoretical upscaling method, both convection and dispersion mechanisms are taken into account in both regions, allowing one to deal with a large range of heterogeneous systems. In this paper, the numerical tools associated with this model are developed in order to test the theory by comparing macroscopic concentration fields to those obtained by Darcy-scale numerical experiments. The heterogeneous structures considered are made up of low-permeability nodules embedded in a continuous h i gh- permeability region. Several permeability ratios are used, leading to very different macroscopic behaviours. Taking advantage of the Darcy-scale simulations, the role of convection and dispersion in the mass exchange between the two regions is investigated. Large-scale averaged concentration fields and elution curves are extracted from the Darcy-scale numerical experiments and compared to the theoretical predictions given by the two-equation model. Very good agreement is found between experimental and theoretical results. A permeability ratio around 100 presents a behaviour characteristic of "mobile-mobile" systems emphasizing the relevance of this two-equation description. Eventually, the theory is used to set-up a criterion for the existence of local equilibrium conditions. The potential importance of local-scale dispersion in reducing large-scale dispersion is highlighted. The results also confirm that a non-equilibrium description may be necessary in such systems, even if local-equilibrium behaviour could be observed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The nonlinear equation of Boussinesq (1877) is a foundational approach for studying groundwater flow through an unconfined aquifer, but solving the full nonlinear version of the Boussinesq equation remains a challenge. Here, we present an exact solution to the full nonlinear Boussinesq equation that not only applies to sloping aquifers but also accounts for source and sink terms such as bedrock seepage, an often significant flux in headwater catchments. This new solution captures the hysteretic relationship (a loop rating curve) between the groundwater flow rate and the water table height, which may be used to provide a more realistic representation of streamflow and groundwater dynamics in hillslopes. In addition, the solution provides an expression where the flow recession varies based on hillslope parameters such as bedrock slope, bedrock seepage, aquifer recharge, plant transpiration, and other factors that vary across landscape types.

AB The Arctic is warming rapidly. Changing seasonal freezing and thawing cycles of the soil are expected to affect river run-off substantially, but how soil frost influences river run-off at catchment scales is still largely unknown. We hypothesize that soil frost alters flow paths and therefore affects storage-discharge relations in subarctic catchments. To test this hypothesis, we used an approach that combines meteorological records and recession analysis. We studied streamflow data (1986-2015) of Abiskojokka, a river that drains a mountainous catchment (560 km(2)) in the north of Sweden (68 degrees latitude). Recessions were separated into frost periods (spring) and nofrost periods (summer) and then compared. We observed a significant difference between recessions of the two periods: During spring, discharge was linearly related to storage, whereas storage-discharge relationships in summer were less linear. An analysis of explanatory factors showed that after winters with cold soil temperatures and low snowpack, storage-discharge relations approached linearity. On the other hand, relatively warm winter soil conditions resulted in storage-discharge relationships that were less linear. Even in summer, relatively cold antecedent winter soils and low snowpack levels had a propagating effect on streamflow. This could be an indication that soil frost controls recharge of deep groundwater flow paths, which affects storage-discharge relationships in summer. We interpret these findings as evidence for soil frost to have an important control over river run-off dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing significant catchment-integrated effects of soil frost on this spatiotemporal scale.

AB Vegetative filter strips (VFSs) can effectively trap sediment in overland flow, but little information is available on its performance in controlling high-concentration sediment and the runoff hydraulics in VFS. Flume experiments were conducted to investigate the sediment deposition, hydraulics of overland flow and their relationships in simulating VFS under a great range of sediment concentrations with four levels of vegetation cover (bare slope and 4%, 11% and 17%) and two flow rates (15 and 30 L min(-1)). Sediment concentrations varied from 30 to 400 kg m(-3) and slope gradient was 9 degrees. Both the deposited sediment load and deposition efficiency in VFS increased as the vegetation cover increased. Sediment concentration had a positive effect on the deposited load but no effect on deposition efficiency. A lower flow rate corresponded to greater deposition efficiency but had little effect on deposited load. Flow velocities decreased as vegetation cover increased. Sediment concentration had a negative effect on the mean velocity but no effect on surface velocity. Hydraulic resistance increased as the vegetation cover and sediment concentration increased. Sediment deposition efficiency had a much more pronounced relationship with overland flow hydraulics compared with deposited load, especially with the mean flow velocity, and there was a power relationship between them. Flow regime also affected the sediment deposition efficiency, and the efficiency was much higher under subcritical than supercritical flow. The results will be useful for the design of VFS and the control of sediment flowing into rivers in areas with serious soil erosion. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Stream chemistry is often used to infer catchment-scale biogeochemical processes. However, biogeochemical cycling in the near-stream zone or hydrologically connected areas may exert a stronger influence on stream chemistry compared with cycling processes occurring in more distal parts of the catchment, particularly in dry seasons and in dry years. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that near-stream wetland proportion is a better predictor of seasonal (winter, spring, summer, and fall) stream chemistry compared with whole-catchment averages and that these relationships are stronger in dryer periods with lower hydrologic connectivity. We evaluated relationships between catchment wetland proportion and 16-year average seasonal flow-weighted concentrations of both biogeochemically active nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), as well as weathering products, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), at ten headwater (<200 ha) forested catchments in south-central Ontario, Canada. Wetland proportion across the entire catchment was the best predictor of DOC and TP in all seasons and years, whereas predictions of NO3-N concentrations improved when only the proportion of wetland within the near-stream zone was considered. This was particularly the case during dry years and dry seasons such as summer. In contrast, Ca and Mg showed no relationship with catchment wetland proportion at any scale or in any season. In forested headwater catchments, variable hydrologic connectivity of source areas to streams alters the role of the near-stream zone environment, particularly during dry periods. The results also suggest that extent of riparian zone control may vary under changing patterns of hydrological connectivity. Predictions of biogeochemically active nutrients, particularly NO3-N, can be improved by including near-stream zone catchment morphology in landscape models.

AB The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) is a key variable in many regional-scale land surface models. Currently, the assimilation of point-scale snow sensor data into these models is commonly performed without consideration of the spatial representativeness of the point data with respect to the model grid-scale SWE. To improve the understanding of the relationship between point-scale snow measurements and surrounding areas, we characterized the spatial distribution of snow depth and SWE within 1-, 4- and 16-km(2) grids surrounding 15 snow stations (snowpack telemetry and California snow sensors) in California, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon during the 2008 and 2009 snow seasons. More than 30000 field observations of snowpack properties were used with binary regression tree models to relate SWE at the sensor site to the surrounding area SWE to evaluate the sensor representativeness of larger-scale conditions. Unlike previous research, we did not find consistent high biases in snow sensor depth values as biases over all sites ranged from 74% overestimates to 77% underestimates. Of the 53 assessments, 27 surveys indicated snow station biases of less than 10% of the surrounding mean observed snow depth. Depth biases were largely dictated by the physiographic relationship between the snow sensor locations and the mean characteristics of the surrounding grid, in particular, elevation, solar radiation index and vegetation density. These scaling relationships may improve snow sensor data assimilation; an example application is illustrated for the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center National Snow Analysis SWE product. The snow sensor bias information indicated that the assimilation of point data into the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center model was often unnecessary and reduced model accuracy.

AB Methods based on multiple-point statistics (MPS) have been routinely used to characterize complex geological formations in the last decade. These methods use the available static data (for example, measured conductivities) for conditioning. Integrating dynamic data (for example, measured transient piezometric head data) into the same framework is challenging because of the complex non-linear relationship between the dynamic response and geology. The Ensemble PATtern (EnPAT) search method was recently developed as a promising technique to handle this problem. In this approach, a pattern is postulated to be composed of both parameter and state variables, and then, parameter values are sequentially (point-wise) simulated by directly sampling the matched pattern from an ensemble of training images of both geologic parameters and state variables. As a consequence, the updated ensemble of realizations of the geological parameters preserve curvilinear structures (i.e., non-multiGaussanity) as well as the complex relationship between static and dynamic data. Moreover, the uncertainty of flow and transport predictions can be assessed using the updated ensemble of geological models. In this work, we further modify the EnPAT method by introducing the pilot-point concept into the algorithm. More specifically, the parameter values at a set of randomly selected pilot point locations are simulated by the pattern searching procedure, and then a faster MPS method is used to complete the simulation by conditioning to the previously simulated pilot point values. This pilot point guided MPS implementation results in lower computational cost and more accurate inference of the parameter field. In addition, in some situations where there is sparsity of measured geologic static data, the EnPAT algorithm is extended to work only with the dynamic data. We employed a synthetic example to demonstrate the effectiveness of pilot points in the implementation of EnPAT, and also the capability of dynamic data to identify complex geologic structures when measured conductivity data are not available.

ID VALUING IRRIGATION WATER; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; POLICIES
AB [1] European water policy requires all EU Member States to implement volumetric water pricing at rates that roughly cover the total costs of providing water services. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that will enable us to analyze the differential impact that a water pricing policy for irrigation would have on heterogeneous farmers of an irrigated area. For this purpose, multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) mathematical programming models were used. The methodology is implemented on a representative area in the Duero Valley in Spain. Our results show the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of a water pricing policy. From them we observe significant differences in the evolution of agricultural incomes and estimate the cost recovery by the state, the demand for farm labor, and the consumption of agrochemicals resulting from the rise in water price between the various groups of farmers established within the analyzed irrigated area.

DT Article
ID FLOW-FIELD; NETWORKS; BASIN; ASYMMETRY; HILLSLOPE
AB This paper develops a geomorphological theory of tidal basin response ( tidal instantaneous geomorphologic elementary response, or TIGER) to describe specific characteristics of tidal channel hydrodynamics. On the basis of the instantaneous unit hydrograph approach, this framework relates the hydrodynamics of tidal watersheds to the geomorphic structure of salt marshes and, specifically, to the distance traveled by water particles within the channel network and on the marsh surface. The possibility of determining the water fluxes from observations of geomorphic features is an appealing approach to the study of tidally driven flow rates. Our formulation paves the way to the application of recent results on the geomorphic structure of salt marshes and tidal networks to the determination of marsh creek hydrology. A case study shows how the asymmetry in the stage-velocity relation and the existence of velocity surges typical of the tidal hydrographs can be explained as an effect of the delay in the propagation of the tidal signal within the marsh area.

AB Declines of acidic deposition levels by as much as 50% since 1990 have led to partial recovery of surface waters in the northeastern USA but continued depletion of soil calcium through this same period suggests a disconnection between soil and surface water chemistry. To investigate the role of soil-surface water interactions in recovery from acidification, the first regional survey to directly relate soil chemistry to stream chemistry during high flow was implemented in a 4144-km(2) area of the Catskill region of New York, where acidic deposition levels are among the highest in the East. More than 40% of 95 streams sampled in the southern Catskill Mountains were determined to be acidified and had inorganic monomeric aluminum concentrations that exceeded a threshold that is toxic to aquatic biota. More than 80% likely exceeded this threshold during the highest flows, but less than 10% of more than 100 streams sampled were acidified in the northwestern portion of the region. Median Oa horizon soil base saturation ranged from 50% to 80% at 200 sites across the region, but median base saturation in the upper 10cm of the B horizon was less than 20% across the region and was only 2% in the southern area. Aluminum is likely to be interfering with root uptake of calcium in the mineral horizon in approximately half the sampled watersheds. Stream chemistry was highly variable over the Catskill region and, therefore, did not always reflect the calcium depletion of the B horizon that our sampling suggested was nearly ubiquitous throughout the region. Published 2013. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

AB Canopy interception is one of the most important processes in an ecosystem, but it is still neglected when assessing evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning in apple orchards on the Loess Plateau in China. To explore the importance of canopy interception, we monitored two neighbouring apple orchards on the Loess Plateau in China, one 8-year-old and the other 18-years old at the start of the study, from May to September for four consecutive years (2013-2016). We measured parameters of canopy interception (I) including precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, leaf area index, transpiration (T), and soil evaporation (S) to quantify ET. The importance of canopy interception was then assessed by comparing the relationship between water supply (precipitation) and water demand (ET), calculated with and without considering canopy interception (T + S and T + S + I, respectively). Tree age clearly influenced canopy interception, as estimates of annual canopy interception during the study years in the younger and older orchards amounted to 22.2-29.4 mm and 26.8-39.9 mm, respectively. Daily incident rainfall and rainfall intensity in both orchards were significantly positively correlated with daily canopy interception in each year. The relationship between annual precipitation and annual ET (calculated with and without consideration of canopy interception) in the younger orchard differed during 2015 and 2016. Ignoring canopy interception would result in underestimation of annual ET in both apple orchards and hence incorrect evaluation of the relationship between water supply and water demand, particularly for the younger orchard during 2015 and 2016. Thus, for a complete understanding of water consumption in apple orchards in this and similar regions, canopy interception should not be ignored when assessing ET partitioning.

AB Mid- to long-term runoff forecasting is important to China. Forecasting based on physical causes has become the trend of this field, and recognition of key factors is central to recent development. Here, global sensitivity analysis based on back-propagation arithmetic was used to calculate the sensitivity of up to 24 factors that affect runoff in the Nenjiang River Basin. The following five indices were found to be key factors for mid- to long-term runoff forecasting during flood season: Tibetan Plateau B, index of the strength of the East Asian trough, index of the area of the northern hemisphere polar vortex, zonal circulation index over the Eurasian continent and index of the strength of the subtropical high over the western Pacific. The hydrological climate of the study area and the rainfallrunoff laws were then analysed in conjunction with its geographical position and topographic condition. The rationality of the results can be demonstrated from the positive analysis point of view. The results of this study provide a general method for selection of mid- to long-term runoff forecasting factors based on physical causes. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This technical note presents a useful methodology for studying how the variance of hydraulic and/or reactive attributes of an aquifer are linked to the multiscaled and hierarchical sedimentary architecture of the aquifer. A new recursive equation is derived which quantitatively describes how the variance is related to sedimentary facies defined at all scales across an entire stratal hierarchy. As compared to prior published equations that emphasize differences in means among facies populations within a hierarchical level, it emphasizes differences across levels. Because of the hierarchical relationships among the terms of the equation, we find it to be useful for conducting a holistic analysis of the relative contributions to the variance arising from all facies types defined across all scales. The methodology is demonstrated using appropriate field data, and is shown to be useful in defining parsimonious classification systems.

ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW SIMULATION; TRANSIENT
AB A fuzzy rule-based model is developed for simulation of solute transport processes in the vadose zone. Underlying physical processes of solute transport described by appropriate differential equations are captured in fuzzy rules. These rules are derived from a training set obtained from different test runs of the SWMS_2D model which simulates water flow and solute transport in two-dimensional variably saturated media. Fuzzy rules operate between two adjacent cells at each time step. Solute concentration of the upper cell, and solute concentration difference between two adjacent cells are used as premises. For a given time step, the solute flux between the two cells is taken as the response, which is combined with the conservation of mass to update the new solute concentration for the new time step. The methodology is applied to solve the breakthrough curve of bromide movement in a soil column. It is also generalized to the same problem under different soil and boundary conditions. In both cases, the fuzzy solution appears to be similar to the measured bromide concentration as well as the SWMS_2D model results. The methodology provides a more efficient alternative to existing modeling methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] This study aims to develop a methodology for data collection that accounts for the application of simulation models in decision making for groundwater management. Simulation model reliability is estimated by comparing the effects that a perturbation in the model parameter space has over the model output as well as over the solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. The problem of experimental design for parameter estimation is formulated and solved using a combination of genetic algorithm and gradient-based optimization. Gaussian quadrature and Bayesian decision theory are combined for selecting the best design under parameter uncertainty. The proposed methodology is useful for selecting a robust design that will outperform all other candidate designs under most potential "true'' states of the system. Results also show that the uncertainty analysis is able to identify complex interactions among the model parameters that may affect the performance of the experimental designs as well as the attainability of management objectives.

AB This article is offered to honor Professor George F. Pinder. Its technical contents were motivated by an Eulerian-Lagrangian method that was recently proposed by him and his collaborators. Two one-node-collocation algorithms, which may be used to advance that method are presented. Although they are here discussed for 1-D problems only, one of them has already been generalized to problems in several space variables. Thus, this paper essentially generalizes the above mentioned Eulerian-Lagrangian method of Pinder et al. to problems in several dimensions. Also, the results presented in this paper have a wider interest in water resources studies because they apply to advection diffusive transport processes in general. The methodology used to develop the new algorithms is a unified theory of domain decomposition methods (DDM), recently introduced by the authors and which owes much to George F. Pinder. The results reported in the present paper illustrate, by the way, its application and power. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID RELIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; MODELS; IMPACT; WATER; RULE; FLOW
AB In a recent article, Pretto et al. [1997] found that certain statistics of storage capacity estimates, for example, mean and higher quantiles, obtained using a behavior analysis do misbehave for medium record lengths in that they exhibit a hump in their functional relationships with the data record length. Further, this upward bias was observed to disappear at longer record lengths. Pretto et al. proffered several reasons for this apparently anomalous behavior. In this paper, we investigate another reason that we suspect might also be causing behavior analysis storage estimates to misbehave. In particular, we use a modified sequent peak methodology, which, unlike a behavior analysis, enables the analyst to restrict the amount of water shortfall during any failure period to fixed amounts. The results show that when the shortfall is made the same for all failure periods, the hump in the storage capacity statistics versus length of record functions largely disappears.

AB The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) has been designed and widely used (and misused) worldwide to estimate evapotranspiration across varying spatial and temporal scales using satellite remote sensing over the past 15 yr. It is, however, beset by visual identification of a hot and cold pixel to determine the temperature difference (dT) between the surface and the lower atmosphere, which is assumed to be linearly correlated with surface radiative temperature (T-rad) throughout a scene. To reduce ambiguity in flux estimation by SEBAL due to the subjectivity in extreme pixel selection, this study first demonstrates that SEBAL is of a rectangular framework of the contextual relationship between vegetation fraction (f(c)) and Trad, which can distort the spatial distribution of heat flux retrievals to varying degrees. End members of SEBAL were replaced by a trapezoidal framework of the f(c)-T-rad space in the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL). The warm edge of the trapezoidal framework is determined by analytically deriving temperatures of the bare surface with the largest water stress and the fully vegetated surface with the largest water stress implicit in both energy balance and radiation budget equations. Areally averaged air temperature (T-a) across a study site is taken to be the cold edge of the trapezoidal framework. Coefficients of the linear relationship between dT and Trad can vary with fc but are assumed essentially invariant for the same fc or within the same f(c) class in M-SEBAL. SEBAL and M-SEBAL are applied to the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling experiment (SMACEX) site in central Iowa, U. S. Results show that M-SEBAL is capable of reproducing latent heat flux in terms of an overall root-mean-square difference of 41.1 W m(-2) and mean absolute percentage difference of 8.9% with reference to eddy covariance tower-based measurements for three landsat thematic mapper/enhanced thematic mapper plus imagery acquisition dates in 2002. The retrieval accuracy of SEBAL is generally lower than M-SEBAL, depending largely on the selected extremes. Spatial distributions of heat flux retrievals from SEBAL are distorted to a certain degree due to its intrinsic rectangular framework.

AB To control and reduce the effects of drought, it is essential for farmers to do drought risk management so as to cope with climate change. The purpose of this study was to "assessing farmers' drought risk management behavior (FDRMB) in downstream of Karkheh Dam basin, Iran". For this purpose, the "protection motivation theory (PMT)" was used to measure FDRMB. This theory consists of six variables i.e. "perceived vulnerability (PV)", "perceived severity (PS)", "self-efficacy (SE)", "response cost (RC)", "response efficacy (RC)", and "intention (IN)". This research included a descriptive-correlational and causal relationship that was conducted by a survey. The study population included farmers who were members in the water user association in downstream of Karkheh Dam (N = 3668), out of which, 350 users were sampled by Krejcie and Morgan's table and by the stratified random sampling method, respectively. In accordance with the PMT, for the variables affecting FDRMB a causal framework was designed. Findings from the path analysis indicated that the six variables in PMT might explain 0.473 of the FDRMB variance. Besides, SE had the highest effect in FDRMB (beta = 0.503). As a general conclusion, policies need to make farmers take their own risk management decisions and have access to a variety of tools and strategies.

ID SUSPENDED-LOAD TRANSPORT; SEA WAVES; RIPPLES
AB Many subaerial and subaqueous morphological patterns are repetitive both in space and time, and a characteristic wavelength L and a characteristic period T can be associated with the bottom forms, along with a migration speed c(r)=L/T. In this contribution we focus our attention on river dunes, which form under steady flows, and on tidal sand waves, which form under oscillatory flows. Now, it is widely accepted that these bedforms arise because of the instability of the plane interface between the riverbed/seabed, made up of cohesionless sand, and the water flowing over it. However, the physical mechanisms commonly suggested to explain the growth of these two bottom forms differ. In the present contribution, the theories of formation of river dunes and sand waves, based on modal stability analysis, are revisited, and it is shown that the different physical mechanisms proposed to explain the formation of river dunes and sand waves exhibit more similarity than was believed until today.

AB The effect of spatial concentration fluctuations on the reaction of two solutes, A + B -> C, is considered. In the absence of fluctuations, the concentration of solutes decays as A(det) = B-det similar to t(-1). Contrary to this, experimental and numerical studies suggest that concentrations decay significantly slower. Existing theory suggests a t(-d/4) scaling in the asymptotic regime (d is the dimensionality of the problem). Here we study the effect of fluctuations using the classical diffusion-reaction equation with random initial conditions. Initial concentrations of the reactants are treated as correlated random fields. We use the method of moment equations to solve the resulting stochastic diffusion-reaction equation and obtain a solution for the average concentrations that deviates from similar to t(-1) to similar to t(-d/4) behavior at characteristic transition time t*. We also derive analytical expressions for t* as a function of Damkohler number and the coefficient of variation of the initial concentration.

AB We construct a statistical mechanics for immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow in porous media under local steady-state conditions based on the Jaynes maximum entropy principle. A cluster entropy is assigned to our lack of knowledge of, and control over, the fluid and flow configurations in the pore space. As a consequence, two new variables describing the flow emerge: The agiture, which describes the level of agitation of the two fluids, and the flow derivative, which is conjugate to the saturation. Agiture and flow derivative are the analogs of temperature and chemical potential in standard (thermal) statistical mechanics. The associated thermodynamics-like formalism reveals a number of hitherto unknown relations between the variables that describe the flow, including fluctuations. The formalism opens for new approaches to characterize porous media with respect to multi-phase flow for practical applications, replacing the simplistic relative permeability theory while still keeping the number of variables tractable.

AB Uncertainty plagues every effort to model subsurface processes and every decision made on the basis of such models. Given this pervasive uncertainty, virtually all practical problems in hydrogeology can be formulated in terms of (ecologic, monetary, health, regulatory, etc.) risk. This review deals with hydrogeologic applications of recent advances in uncertainty quantification, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), and decision-making under uncertainty. The subjects discussed include probabilistic analyses of exposure pathways, PRAs based on fault tree analyses and other systems-based approaches, PDF (probability density functions) methods for propagating parametric uncertainty through a modeling process, computational tools (e. g., random domain decompositions and transition probability based approaches) for quantification of geologic uncertainty, Bayesian algorithms for quantification of model (structural) uncertainty, and computational methods for decision-making under uncertainty (stochastic optimization and decision theory). The review is concluded with a brief discussion of ways to communicate results of uncertainty quantification and risk assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Characterizing the dynamic relationship between rainfall and runoff is a highly interesting modeling problem in hydrology. This study develops a deterministic linearized recurrent neural network (denoted as DLRNN) that deals with the system's nonlinearity by recalibration at each time interval, and relates the weights of DLRNN to unit hydrographs in order to describe the transition of the rainfall-runoff processes. Case studies of 38 events, from 1966 to 1997, are implemented in the Wu-Tu watershed of Taiwan, where the runoff path-lines are short and steep. A comparison between the DLRNN and a feed-forward neural network demonstrates the advantage of DLRNN as a dynamic system model. It is concluded that DLRNN shows superiority in the performance of rainfall-runoff simulations and the ability to recognize transitions in hydrological processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A research version of CFP (Conduit Flow Process) code, CFPv2, is applied with UMT3D to simulate long term (1966-2018) nitrate-N contamination transport processes in the Woodville Karst Plain (WIT), northern Florida, where karst conduit networks are well developed. Groundwater flow in the WKP limestone porous matrix is simulated using Darcy's law, and non-laminar flow within conduits is described by Darcy-Weisbach equation. Nitrate-N conduit transport and advective exchanges of groundwater and nitrate-N between conduits and limestone matrix are calculated by CFPv2 and UMT3D, instead of MODFLOW and MT3DMS since Reynolds numbers for flows in conduits are over the criteria of laminar flow. The developed numerical model is calibrated by field observations and then applied to simulate nitrate-N transport in the WKP. The numerical simulations verify the theories that two sprayfields near the City of Tallahassee and septic tanks in the rural area are major nitrate-N point sources within the WKP. High nitrate-N concentrations occur near Lost Creek Sink, and conduits of Wakulla Spring and Spring Creek Springs where aquifer discharge groundwater. Conduit networks control nitrate-N transport and regional contaminant distributions in the WKP, as nitrate-N is transported through conduits rapidly and spread over large areas.

ID SURFACE RADIATIVE TEMPERATURE; EDDY DIFFUSIVITY; BOUNDARY-LAYER;
   RESISTANCE; SATELLITE; FIFE; TRANSPORT
AB A new method has been proposed for estimating sensible heat flux from single-level measurement of air temperature. When turbulent transfer of heat in the lower atmosphere over a homogeneous surface is modeled by a one-dimensional diffusion equation with a constant diffusivity, heat flux can be expressed as a weighted average (half-order derivative) of the time history of air temperature. This formula provides an approximate solution of the diffusion equation where the (eddy) diffusivity characterizing the turbulent flow is not constant. Eddy diffusivity has been formulated based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory with Businger-Dyer stability functions or determined by an empirical equation. The knowledge of surface parameters including friction velocity sometimes is needed to apply this method. The method was tested against observations collected during two field experiments, FIFE and ABRACOS. The close agreement between the estimated sensible heat flux and observations suggests that this novel approach is a potentially powerful tool in evaluating the energy balance at the land surface.

AB A quantitative, process relevant analysis of ten mesoscale (ca 10-90 km(2)) catchments in the Cairngorm mountains, Scotland was carried out using 10-m digital terrain models (DTMs). This analysis produced a range of topographic indices that described differences in the landscape organisation of the catchments in a way that helped explain contrasts in their hydrology. Mean transit time (MTT)-derived from isotopic tracer data-was used as a metric that characterised differences in the hydrological function of the ten catchments. Some topographic indices exhibited significant correlations with MTT. Most notably, the ratio of the median flow path length to the median flow path gradient was negatively correlated with MTT, whilst the median upslope area was positively correlated. However, the relationships exhibited significant scatter which precluded their use as a predictive tool that could be applied to ungauged basins in this region. In contrast, maps of soil hydrological properties could be used to differentiate hydrologically responsive soils (which are dominated by overland flow and shallow sub-surface storm flow) from free draining soils (that facilitate deeper sub-surface flows). MTT was negatively correlated with the coverage of responsive soils in catchments. This relationship provided a much better basis for predicting MTT in ungauged catchments in this geomorphic province. In the Cairngorms, the extensive cover of various glacial drift deposits appears to be a first order control on soil distributions and strongly influences the porosity and permeability of the sub-surface. These catchment characteristics result in soil cover being a much more discerning indicator of hydrological function than topography alone. The study highlights the potential of quantitative landscape analysis in catchment comparison and the need for caution in extrapolating relationships between landscape controls and metrics of hydrological function beyond specific geomorphic provinces.

AB Hydrology, particularly the water table position below the Surface (relative water level, RWL), is an important control oil biogeochemical and ecological processes in peatlands. The surface elevation (SE) in a peatland oscillates ill response to changes in effective stress oil the peat rnatrix Mainly caused by water level fluctuations. This phenomenon is called peatland Surface oscillation (PSO). To investigate the spatiotemporal variability of PSO, Surface elevation and the water level above sea level (AWL) were measured monthly (23 sites) over one year in a warm-temperate restiad peatland, New Zealand. At one site peat surface elevation was measured indirectly by monitoring AWL and RWL continuously with pressure transducers. Annual PSO (the difference between maximum and minimum surface elevation) ranged from 3.2 to 28 cm (mean = 14.9 cm). Surface elevation changes were caused by AWL fluctuations. Spatially homogenous AWL fluctuations (mean 40 cm among sites) translated into RWL fluctuations reduced 27-56% by PSO except for three sites with shallow and dense peat at the peatland margin (7-17%). The SE-AWL relationship was linear for 15 sites. However, eight sites showed significantly higher rates of surface elevation changes during the wet season and thus a non-linear behaviour. We suggest flotation of upper peat layers during the wet season causing, this non-linear behaviour. Surprisingly, PSO was subjected to hysteresis: the positive SE-AWL relationship reversed after rainfall when the Surface slowly rose despite rapidly receding AWL. Hysteresis was more prominent during the dry season than during the wet season. Total peat thickness and bulk density together could only explain 50% of the spatial variability of PSO based oil manual measurements. However. we found three broad types of SE-AWL relationships differing in shape and slope of SE-AWL Curves. These oscillation types reflected patterns in vegetation and flooding.

AB In this paper we present a variable bucket capacity (VBC) representation of TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979), generalizing the Manabe 'simple bucket' scheme widely used in climate models. In doing this, we have been motivated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model presented by Wood et al. (1992). For catchments, or for parts of the land surface, whose hydrology fits the TOPMODEL assumptions, this lumped version offers an alternative representation that can be used as the building block for land surface hydrology models at large spatial scales. The model is first applied, with satisfactory results, to a small catchment near Canberra in Australia. Next, using the same model, the effects of random spatial variability of rainfall are studied, but in the context of land surface hydrological parameterizations for global climate models. Sub-grid rainfall variability, especially the partial coverage that characterizes rainfall events at such large scales, is found to cause significant biases in the estimation of land surface fluxes. Other manifestations of the effects of the spatial variability of rainfall are also investigated, also by means of model simulations, but with a view to gaining insights for developing simple parameterizations of land surface fluxes at large scales. This includes the investigation of the dynamics, i.e. spatial and temporal variability, of the soil moisture state variable during and after a rainfall event. In addition, empirical relationships linking the variable contributing area, subsurface runoff and evaporation, to a soil moisture state variable (e.g. soil moisture storage), are derived based on model simulations, and the effects of the sub-grid rainfall variability on these relationships are examined. Because of the strong non-linearity inherent in the process descriptions within the model, the above 'constitutive' relationships are strongly affected by rainfall heterogeneity.

AB A wide variety of techniques have been developed to homogenize transport equations in multiscale and multiphase systems. This has yielded a rich and diverse field, but has also resulted in the emergence of isolated scientific communities and disconnected bodies of literature. Here, our goal is to bridge the gap between formal multiscale asymptotics and the volume averaging theory. We illustrate the methodologies via a simple example application describing a parabolic transport problem and, in so doing, compare their respective advantages/disadvantages from a practical point of view. This paper is also intended as a pedagogical guide and may be viewed as a tutorial for graduate students as we provide historical context, detail subtle points with great care, and reference many fundamental works.

AB An analytical expression is derived for the starting pressure gradient for Bingham fluids in porous media embedded with randomly distributed fractal-like tree networks based on fractal theory and technique. The proposed model relates the flow rate and the starting pressure gradient to the structural parameters of porous media and microstructural parameters of fractal-like tree networks, the yield stress and fractal dimensions of porous media and maximum mother diameter of randomly distributed fractal-like tree networks. The results show that the starting pressure gradient decreases with the increase of porosity of matrix material, fractal dimension for mother diameters, diameter ratio and permeability, and the starting pressure gradient increases with the increase of the length ratio and the yield stress. The model predictions from the present model for the starting pressure gradient are in good agreement with the available expression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; SLUG-TEST
AB [1] An integrated and theoretical approach is proposed to determine poroelastic properties of isotropic or transversely isotropic argillaceous rocks from conventional mechanical and hydraulic field tests. It uses values of specific storage coefficient, "undrained'' elastic parameters, and porosity. No special hydromechanical test is required. In the isotropic case, a simple binomial equation is derived, whereby the poroelastic properties can be rapidly obtained. An application to deep argillaceous formations has shown that calculated poroelastic property values are in satisfactory agreement with direct experimental measurements. In the transversely isotropic case, which is more representative of sedimentary rocks, the approach is generalized from a theoretical relationship between the specific storage coefficient and the anisotropic poroelastic properties. Nevertheless, in both cases, sensitivity analyses have shown that the method is very sensitive to input data, especially the specific storage coefficient and the "undrained'' mechanical parameters, which have to be measured with accuracy.

AB A few studies suggest that infiltration rates within streambeds increase during the flood season due to an increase in the stream stage and the remove of the clogged streambed. However, some studies suggest that a new clogging layer will quickly form after an older one has been eroded, and that an increase in water depth will compress the clogging layer, making it less permeable during a flood event. The purpose of this work was to understand the impact of floods on infiltration rates within a disconnected stream. We utilized pressure data and daily streambed infiltration rates determined from diurnal temperature time series within a streambed over a period of 167 days for five flood events. Our data did not support the theory that floods linearly increase the infiltration rate. Since the streambed was clogged very quickly with a large load of suspended particles and compaction of the clogged layer, infiltration rates were also low during the flooding season. However, due to an increase in the wet perimeter within the stream during flooding periods, the total recharge amount to the aquifer was increased.

AB In this paper we present flow and travel time ensemble statistics based on a new simulation methodology, the adaptive Fup Monte Carlo method (AFMCM). As a benchmark case, we considered two-dimensional steady flow in a rectangular domain characterized by multi-Gaussian heterogeneity structure with an isotropic exponential correlation and lnK variance sigma(2)(Y) up to 8. Advective transport is investigated using the travel time framework where Lagrangian variables (e. g., velocity, transverse displacement, or travel time) depend on space rather than on time. We find that Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity distributions diverge for increasing lnK variance due to enhanced channeling. Transverse displacement is a nonnormal for all sigma(2)(Y) and control planes close to the injection area, but after xI(Y) = 20 was found to be nearly normal even for high sigma(2)(Y). Travel time distribution deviates from the Fickian model for large lnK variance and exhibits increasing skewness and a power law tail for large lnK variance, the slope of which decreases for increasing distance from the source; no anomalous features are found. Second moment of advective transport is analyzed with respect to the covariance of two Lagrangian velocity variables: slowness and slope which are directly related to the travel time and transverse displacement variance, which are subsequently related to the longitudinal and transverse dispersion. We provide simple estimators for the Eulerian velocity variance, travel time variance, slowness, and longitudinal dispersivity as a practical contribution of this analysis. Both two-parameter models considered (the advection-dispersion equation and the lognormal model) provide relatively poor representations of the initial part of the travel time probability density function in highly heterogeneous porous media. We identify the need for further theoretical and experimental scrutiny of early arrival times, and the need for computing higher-order moments for a more accurate characterization of the travel time probability density function. A brief discussion is presented on the challenges and extensions for which AFMCM is suggested as a suitable approach.

AB Water draining from a large agricultural catchment of 1 110 km(2) in southwest France was sampled over an 18-month period to determine the temporal variability in suspended sediment (SS) and dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) transport during flood events, with quantification of fluxes and controlling factors, and to analyze the relationships between discharge and SS, DOC and POC. A total of 15 flood events were analyzed, providing extensive data on SS, POC and DOC during floods. There was high variability in SS, POC and DOC transport during different seasonal floods, with SS varying by event from 513 to 41 750 t; POC from 12 to 748 t and DOC from 9 to 218 t. Overall, 76 and 62% of total fluxes of POC and DOC occurred within 22% of the study period. POC and DOC export from the Save catchment amounted to 3090 t and 1240 t, equivalent to 1.8 t km(-2) y(-1) and 0.7 t km(-2) y(-1), respectively. Statistical analyses showed that total precipitation, flood discharge and total water yield were the major factors controlling SS, POC and DOC transport from the catchment. The relationships between SS, POC and DOC and discharge over temporal flood events resulted in different hysteresis patterns, which were used to deduce dissolved and particulate origins. In both clockwise and anticlockwise hysteresis, POC mainly followed the same patterns as discharge and SS. The DOC-discharge relationship was mainly characterized by alternating clockwise and anticlockwise hysteresis due to dilution effects of water originating from different sources in the whole catchment.

AB The development and migration of headcuts in rills and gullies can adversely impact soil resources in agricultural areas and accelerate landscape degradation worldwide. Analytical treatments of this erosion process have been based on a turbulent impinging jet analogue, though partially validated by field and laboratory data. Experiments were conducted using fixed headcut models to define the mean flow structure within these erosional features and to assess the applicability of similarity arguments for jets to characterize this flow domain. These data show that (1) flow within headcut scour holes is analogous to plane turbulent reattached wall jets and (2) similarity arguments used to define the limits, length scales, and velocity distributions in classical free jets and wall jets are applicable within discrete regions of the headcut scour hole domain but are affected by the ventilation characteristics of the overfall. This study contributes new knowledge on the hydrodynamics within headcut scour holes, and it confirms the applicability of jet theory for analyzing such soil erosion processes.

AB Many studies have defined the interrelationships between climate, forest disturbance, and runoff at small scales (<100 km(2)), but few have translated these relationships to large watersheds (>500 km(2)). In this study, we explore the relationship between climate, extreme forest fire seasons, mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks, and runoff in eight large watersheds within the Fraser and Peace drainage basins in British Columbia (BC), Canada from 1981-2019. Using a climate index based on precipitation and air temperature anomalies, we find extreme forest fire seasons (those that burned >5% of a watershed's area) are most likely to occur when a warm/dry summer is preceded by multiple seasons of cool/wet conditions. Using the climate suitability class (CSC) model to explore the relationship between climate and MPB outbreaks, we validate previous findings that lower-than-average precipitation, warm growing season temperatures, and lack of extremely cold temperatures during winter are connected to MPB outbreaks within central BC. However, the CSC model needs improvements to accurately assess MPB suitability in northern watersheds that are located outside the model's calibration region, either through weighted variables or lower degree day thresholds. Minimal runoff response occurs from these forest disturbances, with the most prominent runoff change being related to the 2014 fire season in the Osilinka and Mesilinka watersheds. The limited effects of forest disturbance on annual runoff are likely related to large watershed sizes, low percentages of disturbed area in some study watersheds and post-MPB forest dynamics. These results provide valuable insight into the interrelationships of climate, forest disturbance and runoff in large Canadian boreal forested watersheds.

AB We analyze conservative solute transport under convergent flow to a well in perfectly stratified porous media, in which the hydraulic conductivity is treated as a random spatial function along the vertical direction (K(z)). The stratified model provides a rare exception of an exact analytical solution of travel time distributions in the proximity of pumping wells, and it is used here to obtain insights about ergodic and nonergodic transport conditions under nonuniform flow conditions. In addition, it provides a benchmark for numerical models aiming to correctly reproduce convergent flow transport in heterogeneous media, such as indicating the minimum number of layers required to obtain ergodic travel time distributions using only one model realization. The model provides important insights about the shape of the depth-integrated concentrations over time measured at the well (breakthrough curves, BTCs), which are usually applied to obtain transport parameters of the subsurface. It can be applied to any degree of system's heterogeneity and using either resident or flux-weighted injection modes. It can be built using different probabilistic distributions of K. In our analysis, we consider a log-normal K distribution, and the results indicate that, especially for highly heterogeneous systems, described by the log-K variance (sigma(2)(Y)), the minimum number of layers required for from one model simulation to reproduce ergodic travel time distributions can be prohibitively high, e.g., above 10(6) for sigma(2)(Y) - 8 considering flux-weighted injections. This issue poses serious concerns for numerical applications aiming to simulate transport in the proximity of pumping wells. In addition, this simple solution confirms that stratification can lead BTCs to display strong preferential flow and persistent, power-law-like late-time tailing. Since the latter are common phenomenological macroscale evidences of other microscale hydrodynamic processes than pure advection (e.g., mass-transfer), caution must be taken when inferring aquifer properties controlling the anomalous transport dynamics in heterogeneous media from BTCs fitting.

AB Short-term power generation operation is an important content in the hydropower station management. Because of the limitation of forecast accuracy, there is error between the forecasted runoff process and actual runoff process. When the hydropower station operation is near the water level boundaries, such as normal water level or dead water level, this error is likely to bring the risk of water abandoning or output shortage. In order to precisely evaluate the near-boundary operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error, a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model was proposed in this paper by taking the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable. The coupling of hydrological forecasting error and the short-term operation risk of hydropower station based on credibility theory was realized, and the solving process of the model based on fuzzy simulation technology was provided in detail. Different near-boundary operation risks of hydropower station can be analyzed and evaluated by the simulation with different water level combinations in this model. The high-risk area and suggested operation area of Jinxi hydropower station in different near-boundary operation situations were clearly identified in the case study. The intuitive results of this model can provide a strong technical support for the decision-making of the dispatchers when making the power generation plans in the actual production, so that to avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station, and effectively improve the efficiency of water resources utilization.

AB This paper describes the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater flow accretion to the River Lambourn, a 234 km(2) chalk catchment of the West Berkshire Downs, UK, which has been largely unaffected by groundwater abstraction. Variations in the discharge measured at four fixed gauges in the catchment, coupled with information on the length of flowing channel over the period 1983-2001, are used to describe regional patterns in flow accretion. Mean catchment accretion generally exceeds 0.15 m(3) s(-1) km(-1), but there are significant differences between perennial reaches indicating how the combination of local structural controls and seasonal changes in the drainage net affect flow accretion. Data from current meter surveys were used to determine the spatial variability in flow accretion: 505 paired observations along 12 reaches between 1 and 2.95 kin in length indicated a consistent spatial trend in accretion. Accretion was high in upstream and downstream channel reaches, and in middle reaches where dry valleys intersected the main valley. A flow accretion index was developed to describe the relationship of flow accretion in each of the 12 study reaches to catchment discharge. The relationship varied from a strong positive correlation with catchment discharge (two reaches), a weak positive correlation (three reaches), a strong negative correlation (two reaches), to no relationship to catchment discharge (four reaches). The results highlight the need to reconsider the usual assumption of uniform, or uniformly increasing, flow accretion in chalk catchments. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of catchment topography, and illustrate how flow accretion in individual reaches may vary between high and low groundwater levels.

ID TIME; RAINFALL; NETWORK; IDENTIFICATION
AB Current state-of-the-art online neuro fuzzy models (NFMs) such as DENFIS (Dynamic Evolving Neural Fuzzy Inference System) have been used for runoff forecasting. Online NFMs adopt a local learning approach and are able to adapt to changes continuously. The DENFIS model however requires upper/ lower bound for normalization and also the number of rules increases monotonically. This requirement makes the model unsuitable for use in basins with limited data, since a priori data is required. In order to address this and other drawbacks of current online models, the Generic Self-Evolving Takagi-SugenoKang (GSETSK) is adopted in this study for forecast applications in basins with limited data. GSETSK is a fully-online NFM which updates its structure and parameters based on the most recent data. The model does not require the need for historical data and adopts clustering and rule pruning techniques to generate a compact and up-to-date rule-base. GSETSK was used in two forecast applications, rainfall runoff (a catchment in Sweden) and river routing (Lower Mekong River) forecasts. Each of these two applications was studied under two scenarios: (i) there is no prior data, and (ii) only limited data is available (1 year for the Swedish catchment and 1 season for the Mekong River). For the Swedish Basin, GSETSK model results were compared to available results from a calibrated HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model. For the Mekong River, GSETSK results were compared against the URBS (Unified River Basin Simulator) model. Both comparisons showed that results from GSETSK are comparable with the physically based models, which were calibrated with historical data. Thus, even though GSETSK was trained with a very limited dataset in comparison with HBV or URBS, similar results were achieved. Similarly, further comparisons between GSETSK with DENFIS and the RBF (Radial Basis Function) models highlighted further advantages of GSETSK as having a rule-base (compared to opaque RBF) which is more compact, up-to-date and more easily interpretable.

AB [1] A theoretical basis is provided for the empirical equations of downstream hydraulic geometry, written as scaling relations, using the equations for momentum, flow resistance, and continuity of gradually varied open channel flow. Width, depth, velocity, and bed slope are expressed as power functions of water discharge and bed sediment size. These theoretical relations apply in alluvial, ice, and bedrock channels and hold for any value of water discharge as opposed to just mean or bank-full values used in empirical equations. A scaling relation for bed load transport rate in alluvial channels is also derived using dimensional analysis. Threshold and regime theories of stable channel design are shown to be consistent with the requirements of hydraulic similitude as defined by the scaling relations. If field measurements confirm that the scaling relations apply in braided alluvial channels, then predictions of a threshold bed slope between states of meandering and braiding will not be valid.

AB Uniform mean flow takes place in a 3-D heterogeneous formation of normal hydraulic logconductivity Y=ln K. The aim of the study is to derive the dependence of the horizontal K-efh and vertical K-efv effective conductivities on the structural parameters of hydraulic conductivity and investigate the impact of departure from multi-Gaussianity on K-ef, by numerical simulations of flow in formations that share the same pdf and covariance of Y but differ in the connectivity of classes of Y. The main result is that for the extreme models of connected and disconnected high Y zones the ratio between the effective conductivities in isotropic media is much smaller than in 2-D. The dependence of Kefh and K-efv upon the logconductivity variance and the anisotropy ratio is compared with existing approximations (first-order, Landau-Matheron conjecture, self-consistent approximation). Besides the theoretical interest, the results offer a basis for empirical relationships to be used in applications.

To address this problem, we introduce a new piece-wise function fitting model that is integrated with mixed integer programming to optimally place and size surge tanks for transient control. The key features of the algorithm are a model-driven discretization of the search space, a linear approximation nonsmooth system response surface to transients, and a mixed integer linear programming optimization. Results indicate that high quality solutions can be obtained within a reasonable number of function evaluations and demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the approach through two case studies. The work investigates one type of surge control devices (closed surge tank) for a specified set of transient events. The performance of the algorithm relies on the assumption that there exists a smooth relationship between the objective function and tank size. Results indicate the potential of the approach for the optimal surge control design in water systems.

AB Equations commonly used to estimate soil freeze-thaw depths in nonpermafrost and permafrost terrain (Stefan/St. Paul equations) are combined with a daily snowpack/soil water balance model to investigate the effects of soil freezing and thawing on water balance components and the effects of climate, soil, vegetation, and topography on freeze-thaw regimes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that soil moisture has a dominant influence on soil freezing and thawing, with distinctive effects of fall soil moisture contents versus spring and summer inputs after partial soil thawing. The combined models displayed reasonable but sometimes surprising responses to specific sensitivity experiments involving temperature change, vegetation change, and topographic change. Attempts to reproduce measured freeze-thaw regimes as reported in the literature were generally successful but limited by the short data record on most sites. An improved understanding and modeling of surface/air temperature relationships for unmodified and modified landscapes is identified as a critical need.

AB A series of chemical transport simulations in saturated porous media are conducted to examine the coupled impacts on chemical mobility induced by nonuniform sorption reactions and heterogeneous flow fields. The simulations involve the calculation of fluid flow and chemical migration within highly resolved, three-dimensional cubic regions with synthetically derived material properties. Nonuniformities in subsurface materials are represented as randomly correlated hydraulic conductivity and sorption partition coefficient fields. Transport computations are based upon a random walk particle model, appropriately modified to treat equilibrium sorption reactions. Current experiments focus on four hypothetical constituents, one being inert, and the other three independently obeying linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir partitioning relationships. Results show distinct effects of the nonuniform flow and sorption processes on the overall displacement, dispersion, and partitioning/retardation and the breakthrough behavior of the constituent plumes, as well as on the sharpening fronts and skewed concentration profiles associated with nonlinear partitioning models.

AB Upscaling groundwater flow is a fundamental challenge in hydrogeology. This study proposed time-fractional flow equations (t-FFEs) for upscaling long-term, transient groundwater flow and propagation of pressure heads in heterogeneous media. Monte Carlo simulations showed that, with increasing variance and correlation of the hydraulic conductivity (K), flow dynamics gradually deviated from Darcian flow and exhibit sub-diffusive, time-dependent evolution which can be separated into three major stages. At the early stage, the interconnected high-K zones dominated flow, while at intermediate times, the transverse flow due to mixed high- and low-K zones caused delayed rise of the piezometric head. At late times when flow in the relatively high-K domains reached stability, cells with very low-K continued to block the entry of water and generate "islands" with low piezometric head, significantly extending the temporal evolution of the piezometric head. The elongated water breakthrough curve cannot be quantified by the flow equation with an effective K, the space-fractional flow equation, or the multi-rate mass transfer (MRMT) flow model with a few rates, motivating the development of t-FFEs assuming temporally non-Darcian flow. Model applications showed that both the early and intermediate stages of flow dynamics can be captured by a single-index t-FFE (whose index is the exponent of the power-law probability density function of the random operational time for water parcels), but the overall evolution of flow dynamics, especially the enhanced retention of flow at later times, required a distributed-order t-FFE with variable indexes for different flow phases that can dominate flow dynamics at different stages. Therefore, transient groundwater flow in aquifers with spatially stationary heterogeneity can be temporally non-Darcian and non-stationary, due to the time-sensitive, combined effects of interconnected high-K channels and isolated low-K deposits on flow dynamics (which is the hydrogeological mechanism for the temporally non-Darcian flow and sub-diffusive pressure propagation), whose long-term behavior can be quantified by multi-index stochastic models.

ID BOUNDARY-LAYER MODEL; REGIONAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
AB The existence of a symmetrical complementary relationship (CR) in evaporation has been hypothesized in the hydrologic literature but the conditions required have not been investigated in much detail. In this study it is shown that under near-neutral atmospheric conditions and a constant energy term at the evaporating surface, the analytical solution of the coupled turbulent diffusion equations of heat and vapor transport across a moisture discontinuity of the surface yields a symmetrical CR between the evaporation rate of the uniform drying land upwind of the discontinuity and the mean evaporation rate of the wet area provided, the latter has a proper fetch (i.e., along-the-wind extent). This fetch is a function of the air stability parameter and the assumed uniform surface roughness value, and it is in the order of a 100 m for a smooth surface under near-neutral atmospheric conditions. The analytically derived mean evaporation rates of such a smooth wet surface compare well, i.e., within 10%, to the Penman equation estimates, most frequently employed within the CR framework.

AB In humid, well-vegetated areas, such as in the northeastern US, runoff is most commonly generated from relatively small portions of the landscape becoming completely saturated, however, little is known about the spatial and temporal behavior of these saturated regions. Indicator kriging provides a way to use traditional water table data to quantity probability of saturation to evaluate predicted spatial distributions of runoff generation risk, especially for the new generation of water quality models incorporating saturation excess runoff theory. When spatial measurements of a variable are transformed to binary indicators (i.e., I if above a given threshold value and 0 if below) and the resulting indicator semivariogram is modeled, indicator kriging produces the probability of the measured variable to exceed the threshold value. Indicator kriging gives quantified probability of saturation or, consistent with saturation excess runoff theory, runoff generation risk with depth to water table as the variable and the threshold set near the soil surface. The probability of saturation for a 120 in x 180 in hillslope based upon 43 measurements of depth to water table is investigated with indicator semivariograms for six storm events. The indicator semivariograms show high spatial structure in saturated regions with large antecedent rainfall conditions. The temporal structure of the data is used to generate interpolated (soft) data to supplement measured (hard) data. This improved the spatial structure of the indicator semivariograms for lower antecedent rainfall conditions. Probability of saturation was evaluated through indicator kriging incorporating soft data showing, based on this preliminary study, highly connected regions of saturation as expected for the wet season (April through May) in the Catskill Mountain region of New York State. Supplementation of hard data with soft data incorporates physical hydrology of the hillslope to capture significant patterns not available when using hard data alone for indicator kriging. With the need for water quality models incorporating appropriate runoff generation risk estimates on the rise, this manner of data will lay the groundwork for future model evaluation and development.

AB [1] We use regionally available digital elevation models and land cover data, calibrated with ground- and photo-based landslide inventories, to produce spatially distributed estimates of shallow, translational landslide density (number/unit area). To discern effects of land use, we focus on resolving landslide density relationships with forest cover. We account for topographic variability between sites and landslide detection bias in air photo mapping. Even so, for sites in the Oregon Coast Range, we find great variability in the ratios of landslide density in forest classes among sites. We present strategies for subsampling available data to quantify this variability. For these data, we find that older forests, when sampled over tens of square kilometers, commonly exhibited the highest landslide densities but over hundreds of square kilometers always exhibited the lowest densities, averaging 30% of that in recently harvested areas and 79% of that in younger, managed forests.

AB We investigate trapping of a nonwetting (NW) phase, air, within Bentheimer sandstone cores during drainage-imbibition flow experiments, as quantified on a three dimensional (3D) pore-scale basis via x-ray computed microtomography (X-ray CMT). The wetting (W) fluid in these experiments was deionized water doped with potassium iodide (1: 6 by weight). We interpret these experiments based on the capillary- viscosity-gravity force dominance exhibited by the Bentheimer-air-brine system and compare to a wide range of previous drainage-imbibition experiments in different media and with different fluids. From this analysis, we conclude that viscous and capillary forces dominate in the Bentheimer-air-brine system as well as in the Bentheimer-supercritical CO2-brine system. In addition, we further develop the relationship between initial (post-drainage) NW phase connectivity and residual (post-imbibition) trapped NW phase saturation, while also taking into account initial NW phase saturation and imbibition capillary number. We quantify NW phase connectivity via a topological measure as well as by a statistical percolation metric. These metrics are evaluated for their utility and appropriateness in quantifying NW phase connectivity within porous media. Here, we find that there is a linear relationship between initial NW phase connectivity (as quantified by the normalized Euler number, (chi) over cap) and capillary trapping efficiency; for a given imbibition capillary number, capillary trapping efficiency (residual NW phase saturation normalized by initial NW phase saturation) can decrease by up to 60% as initial NW phase connectivity increases from low connectivity ((chi) over cap approximate to 0) to very high connectivity ((chi) over cap approximate to 1). We propose that multiphase fluid-porous medium systems can be efficiently engineered to achieve a desired residual state (optimal NW phase saturation) by considering the dominant forces at play in the system along with the impacts of NW phase topology within the porous media, and we illustrate these concepts by considering supercritical CO2 sequestration scenarios.

ID SUSPENDED SAND CONCENTRATION; PARTICLE-SIZE; SCATTERING; PROFILES
AB We construct vertical profiles of the acoustic attenuation and back-scattering properties of a river column from measured particle concentration and size distribution profiles. The particle size and concentration data were collected in situ in the Cowlitz River in Washington, U.S., using a laser diffraction-instrument LISST-SL. The particle size distribution was bimodal, comprising a vertically well-mixed washload, and a suspended load that was similar to Rouse profiles. We then explore how well the results of converting these synthetic profiles to recover an acoustic equivalent sediment concentration and acoustic equivalent size compare with laser data in this bimodal environment. The acoustic scattering and attenuation properties are computed for four distinct frequencies: 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 MHz. It is seen that at the lowest frequency, 500 KHz, the acoustic attenuation throughout the water column is nearly constant and determined primarily by particles of size smaller than similar to 30 microns, i.e., the washload. At the next higher frequency, 1 MHz, the suspended load also contributed to attenuation, but even so, attenuation remained nearly constant over the vertical profile. Thus, at the two lower frequencies, attenuation was decoupled from scattering, making the inverse problem explicit for inversion. In contrast, at the two highest frequencies, scattering of sound by the suspended mode became the dominant contributor to attenuation, and attenuation varied by an order of magnitude over river depth. As for backscatter, the computed acoustic backscatter strength was determined by a combination of the washload and suspended sediment mode at all four frequencies. A fairly narrow monotonic relationship was found between total sediment concentration and locally computed backscatter, effectively providing a calibration between local backscatter signal strength and suspended sediment concentration. Such a relationship existed throughout the water column, for every frequency. The sediment concentration derived from backscatter at a pair of frequencies was within similar to 50% of the value measured by laser diffraction; however, the acoustic equivalent diameter exceeded the laser volume mean diameter by up to an order of magnitude. The robustness of these results for application to other flow regimes or rivers remains to be investigated.

AB Upscaling the microscopic processes in charged porous media which are responsible for pore pressure evolution and swelling is a topic of ongoing research. Current theories assume homogeneous media with uniform pore sizes and the impact of microscopic heterogeneity is neglected. This is a preliminary study to determine the significance of such pore-scale heterogeneity on the pressure evolution in charged porous media, where we neglect deformation of the solid phase. We present a pore-network model to simulate salt transport and pressure evolution in a charged porous medium. Results show that, for pore radii following a log-normal distribution, the average pressure in heterogeneous networks are significantly lower than in homogeneous networks with the same mean pore size. This is expressed by lower average pressures, as well as lower streaming potentials and faster ion transport rates in heterogeneous networks. These results indicate that heterogeneity in charged porous media should be investigated further.

AB A method is proposed for calculating the equivalent hydraulic conductivity (EHC) within a finite difference block (171313). Application of the constant-flux assumption of Darcy's Law, the EHC equals to the integration of effective hydraulic conductivity (K-w) as a function of pressure head (h(w)) divided by the head difference at the ends of the FDB. Error analysis show that the constant-flux (CF) EHC estimates are better than those computed by the commonly used arithmetic-mean (AM), geometric-mean (GM), and harmonic-mean (HM) techniques. CF EHC results are even more superior at larger interblock head difference situations.
   Simulations of water infiltration experiments show that simulations using the CF EHC or AM or GM weighting technique have only slight difference while applying the Neumann type boundary condition at the ground surface. In case of the Dirichlet type boundary condition, however, the CF EHC is superior to the other two in correctly estimating the depth of infiltration while enlarging the grid size. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt the CF EHC with a larger grid size to the more stable and more efficient results. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Over the central United States, a large fraction of heavy precipitation and flood events have been tied to atmospheric rivers (ARs) and to two large-scale atmospheric modes, the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern (PNA) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Here, we build on these insights to model the frequency of heavy precipitation events at 88 locations across the central United States. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to develop and compare different models with varying degrees of complexity and nonstationary parameters that are conditioned on ARs and the prevalent climate. We show that Bayesian hierarchical models with a prior layer that allows spatially correlated parameters result in improved prediction skills over the traditional regression-based modeling frameworks. While ARs, PNA, and AO have statistically significant relationships with the frequency of heavy precipitation events over large areas of the central United States, we find that ARs can significantly improve upon the other two covariates in the statistical modeling of extremes over the region.

AB The effects of storm movement on rainfall-runoff processes through a V-shaped watershed are investigated using a dynamic wave model based on shallow water equations. The governing equations are solved by a fourth-order accurate finite volume method to obtain accurate computational results. Once the numerical model is verified, a series of rainfall-runoff events on a V-shaped watershed are simulated. To investigate the contribution of each term in the depth-averaged momentum equation, a scale analysis, and quantitative assessment are conducted on the basis of the computational results. As a result, it is found that the speed and the direction of storm movement can play an important role in determining peak discharge and peak arrival time. In addition, the storm movement can generate loop in the stage-discharge relationship curve. Finally, it is revealed that the rating curve depends on the watershed characteristics rather than the rainfall conditions, at least in the idealized V-shaped watershed.

AB Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen have the potential to serve as tracers for both source and flow paths in a groundwater system. The ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen (delta(18) O) and hydrogen (delta D) can be used as natural tracer parameters to separate multiflow groundwater paths by applying a simple inversion analysis method to determine the differences between observed and calculated delta O-18 and delta D data in a simple mixing model. The model presented here assumes that the distribution of natural tracers in the steady state is governed by simple mixing between flow paths with a normal distribution of flow rate. When the inversion analysis and simple mixing model were applied to the multiflow system of the Matsumoto Basin, which is surrounded by Japanese alpine ranges, the end-members of the relationship between observed delta O-18 and delta D could be separated spatially into specific groundwater flow paths in the multiflow system of shallow and deep groundwater flow paths.

AB With the deep mining of North China-type coalfield, the threat of mixed water source is increasingly serious, and water inrush accidents occur from time to time. Identifying the water inrush dynamic of limestone-mixed water source in high geothermal coal mine is difficult. This paper constructs a radioisotope distribution model of deep groundwater and obtains the dynamic data of radium and radon on the basis of the decay law of radionuclides and the principle of water balance and mass conservation. The radium-radon dating model is used to obtain the age of groundwater. Combined with the data of uranium and temperature, a dynamic identification model of multilayer limestone-mixed water source in coal seam floor is established by using a multielement mixed mass balance calculation method (M3). The relationship between the age of mixed water source and the mixing proportion of temperature and the contribution of recharge end member can be interpreted. The age of deep groundwater is negative correlation to the temperature. The temporal and spatial changes in mixed water sources and the response mechanism of radium-radon are described. Research results provide a new method to identify the source of water gushing in high geothermal coal mine, which is of great importance to improve coal mine safety production.

AB This paper focuses on experiments and simulations conducted in very sharp open-channel bends with flat and equilibrium bathymetry, corresponding to the initial and final phases of the erosion and deposition processes, respectively. The study of flow in curved open bends is relevant for flow in natural river configurations, as most river reaches are not straight. The configuration considered in the present work was designed as a test case in which the role of the cross-sectional flow is more severe than in meandering natural river reaches ( radius of curvature of the channel is close to the channel width) and, thus, can serve for validation of numerical models used to predict flow and sediment transport in river engineering applications. This paper presents detailed new experimental data on the equilibrium bathymetry as well as depth-averaged distributions, vertical profiles, and cross-sectional patterns of the streamwise velocity, the cross-stream circulation, streamwise vorticity, and the turbulent kinetic energy at the initial and final stages of the erosion and deposition processes. The numerical simulations are performed using a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic RANS model for flow, sediment transport, and bathymetry, which employs fine meshes, accounts for the effect of small bed forms, and avoids the use of the law of the wall. The model predicts, rather accurately, the distribution of the streamwise velocity, the cross-stream circulation, and the turbulent kinetic energy in the simulations conducted with a fixed ( flat and deformed bed corresponding to equilibrium conditions) prescribed bathymetry. In the case of a simulation conducted with loose bed, the model predicts satisfactorily the main features of the bathymetry at equilibrium conditions, despite the fact that including the interaction between the flow and the bathymetry increases the overall uncertainty in the model predictions. Results indicate that both improvements in the level of turbulence modeling and in the modeling of the sediment transport would allow further improvement in the predictive capabilities of morphodynamic models.

AB In this study the interfacial tension (IFT) between CO2 and brines, in the context of geological storage of CO2, was investigated. Investigations covered both experimental and theoretical aspects of this property over a broad range of conditions, including those found in subsurface formations. Measurements for CO2+NaCl(aq) systems, of salt molalities 0.98 and 1.98 mol.kg(-1), were performed for temperatures and pressures up to 423K and 69.51 MPa, respectively. Results clearly showed an increase from IFT upon the addition of the salt, helping to resolve some discrepancies observed in literature data. Furthermore, a predictive method, based on the Density Gradient Theory, was extended to CO2+brine systems, with modelled IFT values yielding a good agreement with experiments from this work and literature for brines of single and mixed salts, including NaCl, KCI and CaCl2, and ionic strength up to 2.7 mol.kg(-1).

AB Floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe. The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models.

AB In this paper, several lines of investigation of atmospheric turbulence, by Wilfried Brutsaert, his students, and collaborators, are reviewed. Overall, we classify these lines as K-theory, surface roughness parameterization dealing with momentum and scalar fluxes, radiative effects on temperature fluctuations, stable conditions, scalar similarity, and atmospheric boundary-layer parameterization. Emphasis is placed on turbulence parameterization. Although these topics are presented more or less in chronological order, this order is broken whenever connections need to be established. Hopefully, these connections are the most interesting part of this review: it is there that Brutsaert's insights and long-range scientific questions may be found. His approach invariably included a careful formulation of the physical and mathematical basis of the problem at hand, and proceeded to focus on some essential issues that allowed analytical, numerical or statistical treatment. There is much to be learned from this approach; it is hoped that some of it can be glimpsed here.

AB The entire chain of events of human disease transmitted through contaminated water, from pathogen introduction into the source (E. coli, rotavirus, and Hepatitis A), pathogen migration through the aquifer pathway, to ingestion via a supply well, and finally, the potential infection in the human host, is investigated. The health risk calculations are based on a relevant hazardous event with safe setback distances estimated by considering the infection risk from peak exposure in compliance with an acceptable level defined by a regulatory agency. A site-specific hypothetical scenario is illustrated for an aquifer with similar characteristics as the Cape Cod site, Massachusetts (United States). Relatively large variation of safe distances for the three index pathogens is found; individually, none of the index pathogens could predict the safe distance under the wide range of conditions investigated. It is shown that colloid filtration theory (CFT) with spatially variable attachment-detachment rates yields significantly different results from the effective CFT model (i.e., assuming spatially constant parameters).

AB The evaluation of sampling is presented in the form of a sampling error defined as a difference between the true average and the sampled average of the measured process over the sampling domain. The sampling error is quantified as a product between the process point variance (defined at the scale of a sampling device's support volume) and the sampling variance function, which quantifies the reduction of uncertainty due to the sampling activity. The sampling variance function is expressed analytically as a function of the scale of fluctuation of the measured process. For a single sampling point the sampling variance function defines the reduction in the process point variance as a result of sampling over a certain support volume. The presented evaluation of the sampling performance can be used for designing the monitoring activity and for measurement conditioning of stochastic theories. The presented examples demonstrate the use of sampling evaluation for the purpose of conditioning on the concentration measurements.

AB The global wavelet energy spectrum (GWES) has been used on one-dimensional transects of porous media to identify the characteristic length scale of a material property. The characteristic length scale is a measure of the distance over which property values are correlated. We extend the wavelet analysis technique to two-dimensional stationary porous media for identifying both the characteristic length scales and orientation of heterogeneity. We theoretically develop and evaluate the GWES for isotropic and anisotropic random fields using the two-dimensional Mexican hat wavelet. The relationship between the wavelet scale and the characteristic length scale of a two-dimensional random field is investigated for different covariance structures. The ability of the GWES to identify multiple characteristic length scales and orientations in a random field with nested covariance structures is also investigated. We use the technique to identify the characteristic length scales of a log hydraulic conductivity field used in a laboratory experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The southwestern Adirondack region of New York receives among the highest rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in the USA. Atmospheric N deposition to sensitive ecosystems, like the Adirondacks, may increase the acidification of soils through losses of exchangeable nutrient cations, and the acidification of surface waters associated with enhanced mobility of nitrate (NO3-). However, watershed attributes, including surficial terrestrial characteristics, in-lake processing, and geological settings, have been found to complicate the relationships between atmospheric N deposition and N drainage losses. We studied two lake-watersheds in the southwestern Adirondacks, Grass Pond and Constable Pond, which are located in close proximity (similar to 26 km) and receive similarly high N deposition, but have contrasting watershed attributes (e.g. wetland area, geological settings). Since the difference in the influence of N deposition was minimal, we were able to examine both within- and between-watershed influences of land cover, the contribution of glacial till groundwater inputs, and in-lake processes on surface water chemistry with particular emphasis on N solutes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Monthly samples at seven inlets and one outlet of each lake were collected from May to October in 1999 and 2000. The concentrations of NO3- were high at the Grass Pond inlets, especially at two inlets, and NO3- was the major N solute at the Grass Pond inlets. The concentrations of likely weathering products (i.e. dissolved Si, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) as well as acid neutralizing capacity and pH values, were also particularly high at those two Grass Pond inlets, suggesting a large contribution of groundwater inputs. Dissolved organic N (DON) was the major N solute at the Constable Pond inlets. The higher concentrations of DON and DOC at the Constable Pond inlets were attributed to a large wetland area in the watershed. The DOC/DON ratios were also higher at the Constable Pond inlets, possibly due to a larger proportion of coniferous forest area. Although DON and DOC were strongly related, the stronger relationship of the proportion of wetland area with DOC suggests that additional factors regulate DON. The aggregated representation of watershed physical features (i.e. elevation, watershed area, mean topographic index, hypsometric-analysis index) was not clearly related to the lake N and DOC chemistry. Despite distinctive differences in inlet N chemistry, NO3- and DON concentrations at the outlets of the two lakes were similar. The lower DOC/DON ratios at the lake outlets and at the inlets having upstream ponds suggest the importance of N processing and organic N sources within the lakes. Although an inverse relationship between NO3- and DOC/DON has been suggested to be indicative of a N deposition gradient, the existence of this relationship for sites that receive similar atmospheric N deposition suggest that the relationship between NO3- and the DOC/DON ratio is derived from environmental and physical factors. Our results suggest that, despite similar wet N deposition at the two watershed sites, N solutes entering lakes were strongly affected by hydrology associated with groundwater contribution and the presence of wetlands, whereas N solutes leaving lakes were strongly influenced by in-lake processing.

DE Recession flow analysis; Boussinesq equation; Double-layered hillslope
   aquifers
ID DROUGHT FLOW; SUDDEN DRAWDOWN; DRAINAGE
AB Recession flow analysis based on the Boussinesq equation has been widely used to estimate hydraulic parameters of hillslope aquifers. However, previous studies mainly focused on homogeneous hillslope aquifers and showed that the recession curves satisfy the power law, with two transition points and three power law regimes (b(1), b(2) and b(3)). Since the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslopes are inconsistent and even opposite, it is necessary to investigate the law of recession curves of double-layered hillslope aquifers. In the current study, a modified Boussinesq equation applicable to double-layered hillslope aquifers was proposed. After validating against laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, this modified Boussinesq equation was used to examine the recession characteristics of double-layered hillslope aquifers. The results show that the recession curves of double-layered hillslope aquifers also follow three power law regimes. However, the variations of b values are more complex than those of homogeneous hillslopes. Specifically, while b monotonically changes with slope angle for homogeneous hillslopes, the variations of b are non-monotonic for double-layered hillslopes, depending on the soil configuration, e.g., the thickness of subsoil. These findings are of great significance for determining the hydraulic parameters of hillslopes.

AB Uncertainty analysis has become an important topic in environmental research. Uncertainty in hydrological modeling, in general, has been studied by investigating mainly the influence of the parameter uncertainty on the uncertainty of the simulated outputs. This paper focuses essentially on the impact of point input uncertainty on fully distributed hydrological modeling and proposes an integrated approach to cope with input and parameter uncertainty. The approach uses Bayesian theory in two steps: first, to compute the uncertainty in input forcing data, and second, to compute the hydrological parameter uncertainty and the uncertainties of a lumped-error term that include other sources of errors: response errors and model error. The method is applied with a fully distributed model: WaSiM-ETH. The results show that the methodology proposed here is a valuable tool to assess different sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling and show the effects of uncertainty in the input forcing when a fully distributed, physically based hydrological model is used.

TI Reservoir regulation by means of a 'goal-oriented' inflow predictor
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
ID LINEAR DECISION RULE; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; OPERATION; DESIGN
AB A reservoir regulation scheme for the control of deficiency yields is described in the paper. According to such scheme, at the end of each decade (= ten days) the release in the following decade is established on the basis of current storage, downstream users' requirements and forecast of future inflows. Such forecast is supplied by a mathematical predictor, namely a recursive relationship, which points out the most likely values of future inflows on the basis of current and recent inflow measurements. It is a goal-oriented predictor, in the sense that its parameters are evaluated through a procedure, which takes into account the objective of reservoir regulation (= control of downstream deficits). The regulation scheme is applied to a real case and the resulting sequence of yearly deficits is evaluated. Such deficits are compared with the ones obtained by introducing a different (= non-goal-oriented) predictor into the scheme.

AB An equation for evaluating the sediment transport capacity of overland flow is a necessary part of a physically based soil erosion model describing sediment detachment and transport as distributed processes. At first, for the hydraulic conditions of small-scale and large-scale roughness, the sediment transport capacity relationship used in the WEPP model is calibrated by Yalin and Govers' equation. The analysis shows that the transport coefficient K-t depends on the Shields parameter, Y, according to a semi-logarithmic (Yalin) or a linear (Govers) equation. The reliability of the semi-logarithmic equation is verified by Smart's, and Aziz and Scott's experimental data. Then the Low's formula, whose applicability is also proved by Smart's, and Aziz and Scott's data, is transformed as a stream power equation in which a stream power coefficient, K-SP, depending on Shields parameter, slope, sediment and water-specific weight, appears. A relationship between transport capacity and effective stream power is also proposed. Finally, the influence of rainfall on sediment transport capacity and the prediction of critical shear stress corresponding to overland flow are examined. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Multiphysics (or hybrid) algorithms, which couple Darcy and pore-scale descriptions of flow through porous media in a single numerical framework, are usually employed to decrease the computational cost of full pore-scale simulations or to increase the accuracy of pure Darcy-scale simulations when a simple macroscopic description breaks down. Despite the massive increase in available computational power, the application of these techniques remains limited to core-size problems and upscaling remains crucial for practical large-scale applications. In this context, the Hybrid Multistate Finite Volume (HMsFV) method, which constructs the macroscopic (Darcy-scale) problem directly by numerical averaging of pore-scale flow, offers not only a flexible framework to efficiently deal with multiphysics problems, but also a tool to investigate the assumptions used to derive macroscopic models and to better understand the relationship between pore-scale quantities and the corresponding macroscale variables. Indeed, by direct comparison of the multiphysics solution with a reference pore-scale simulation, we can assess the validity of the closure assumptions inherent to the multiphysics algorithm and infer the consequences for macroscopic models at the Darcy scale. We show that the definition of the scale ratio based on the geometric properties of the porous medium is well justified only for single-phase flow, whereas in case of unstable multiphase flow the nonlinear interplay between different forces creates complex fluid patterns characterized by new spatial scales, which emerge dynamically and weaken the scale-separation assumption. In general, the multiphysics solution proves very robust even when the characteristic size of the fluid-distribution patterns is comparable with the observation length, provided that all relevant physical processes affecting the fluid distribution are considered. This suggests that macroscopic constitutive relationships (e.g., the relative permeability) should account for the fact that they depend not only on the saturation but also on the actual characteristics of the fluid distribution.

AB The processes that affect reorganization of flow and transport in fractures during precipitation were investigated experimentally and numerically in order to highlight the interplay between calcite precipitation, flow and growth substrate. Calcite was precipitated from a supersaturated solution at two different flow rates (0.4 or 12 cm(3).hr(-1)) into artificial fractures made in dolomitic limestone. Although the inlet fluid composition and temperature were identical for all the experiments, facture sealing and precipitation patterns were closely linked to the mineral substrate, fracture geometry and flow field reorganization. Calcite precipitation rate is highly variable along and between the flow paths and depends on the local saturation index of the reactive fluid. In addition, calcite precipitates preferentially on calcite comparatively to dolomite substrate. 2D reactive transport modeling accounting for the negative feedback between porosity and permeability decrease succeeded in quantitatively reproducing the experimental observations, such as the evolution of the fracture void obtained from X-ray micro-tomography (XMT), the evolution of the calcium breakthrough concentration and fracture sealing. The corresponding model was then used to evaluate the impacts of fluid flow and reactivity on randomly generated anisotropic fractures geometries. Simulation results reveal that the sealing capacity of fractures and associated reorganization of flow depends on the Damkohler number, i.e., the ratio between characteristic times for advective transport and reaction, although other factors like the fracture geometry and kinetic law play also a role at this stage. More importantly, the existence of a critical saturation index for initiating precipitation onto mineral substrate can substantially impair the prediction of the sealing capacity, and will depend on the spatial heterogeneity and connectivity of the mineral substrate. Most cases result in a strong precipitation gradient along the flow direction that will increase the permeability anisotropy. However, under certain conditions, precipitation allows the fracture to recover more isotropic properties that will lead back to a more uniform flow field and sealing. Negative feedback between precipitation process and transport during fracture closure supports a strong reorganization of flow of supersaturated fluids during geo-engineering operations.

AB Improving understanding of chemical transport in the subsurface commonly employs evolving groundwater monitoring networks. The objective of this work was to apply the information theory to propose an objective algorithm for augmenting a subsurface monitoring network (SMN) with the purpose of discrimination of conceptually different subsurface flow and transport models. This method determines new monitoring locations where the Kullback-Leibler total information gain is maximized. The latter is computed based on estimates of the uncertainty in modeling results and uncertainty in observations. The method was applied to discriminate models in (1) a synthetic case of groundwater contamination from a point source; (2) the tracer experiment conducted at the USDA-ARS OPE3 research site where a pulse of KCL solution was applied with irrigation water and CL- concentrations were subsequently monitored. Models were compared that included or ignored the effect of subsurface soil lenses on chemical transport. Pedotransfer functions were used to develop the ensemble of models for estimating the uncertainty in modeling results obtained with the numerical 3D flow and transport model. Peak tracer breakthrough concentrations were used to define the information gains. The determination of the new locations to augment existing ones was conducted on a 2-D grid. The information gain peaked in small area, and additional observation locations were very well spatially defined. Well-calibrated models provided a single optimal location, whereas, if models were not calibrated well, the Bayesian estimates of the new observation location depended on the activation sequence assumed for existing locations. The information gain maximization can suggest data collection locations to reduce uncertainties in the conceptual models of subsurface flow and transport. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Precipitation and dissolution are prime processes in carbonate rocks and being able to monitor them is of major importance for aquifer and reservoir exploitation or environmental studies. Electrical conductivity is a physical property sensitive both to transport phenomena of porous media and to dissolution and precipitation processes. However, its quantitative use depends on the effectiveness of the petrophysical relationship to relate the electrical conductivity to hydrological properties of interest. In this work, we develop a new physically-based model to estimate the electrical conductivity by upscaling a microstructural description of water-saturated fractal porous media. This model is successfully compared to published data from both unconsolidated and consolidated samples, or during precipitation and dissolution numerical experiments. For the latter, we show that the permeability can be linked to the predicted electrical conductivity.

TI Soil water retention and maximum capillary drive from saturation to oven
   dryness
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INFILTRATION; EQUATION; LENGTH; FIELD
AB This paper provides an alternative method to describe the water retention curve over a range of water contents from saturation to oven dryness. It makes two modifications to the standard Brooks and Corey [1964] (B-C) description, one at each end of the suction range. One expression proposed by Rossi and Nimmo [1994] is used in the high-suction range to a zero residual water content. (This Rossi-Nimmo modification to the Brooks-Corey model provides a more realistic description of the retention curve at low water contents.) Near zero suction the second modification eliminates the region where there is a change in suction with no change in water content. Tests on seven soil data sets, using three distinct analytical expressions for the high-, medium-, and low-suction ranges, show that the experimental water retention curves are well fitted by this composite procedure. The high-suction range of saturation contributes little to the maximum capillary drive, defined with a good approximation for a soil water and air system as H-cM = integral(0)(infinity) k(rw) dh(c), where k(rw) is relative permeability (or conductivity) to water and h(c) is capillary suction, a positive quantity in unsaturatedsoils. As a result, the modification suggested to describe the high-suction range does not significantly affect the equivalence between Brooks-Corey (B-C) and van Genuchten [1980] parameters presented earlier. However, the shape of the retention curve near "natural saturation" has a significant impact on the value of the capillary drive. The estimate using the Brooks-Corey power law, extended to zero suction, will exceed that obtained with the new procedure by 25 to 30%. It is not possible to tell which procedure is appropriate. Tests on another data set, for which relative conductivity data are available, support the view of the authors that measurements of a retention curve coupled with a speculative curve of relative permeability as from a capillary model are not sufficient to accurately determine the (maximum) capillary drive. The capillary drive is a dynamic scalar, whereas the retention curve is of a static character. Only measurements of infiltration rates with time can determine the capillary drive with precision for a given soil.

AB Saturated groundwater flow and tracer experiments using fluorescent dye, chloride, and the herbicides mecoprop and simazine were carried out in the laboratory using three large-diameter (0.5 m) undisturbed columns of fractured clayey till. Hydraulic conductivity of the columns ranged from 10(-5) mis in the shallowest column (1 m depth) to 10(-7) mis in the deepest column (4 m depth) and were similar to field-measured values for these deposits. Results of the tracer experiments are consistent with a conceptual model of advective transport along the fractures combined with diffusion into the fine-grained matrix between the fractures. Arrival of the chloride tracer in the effluent was highly retarded relative to fracture flow velocities calculated on the basis of the cubic law and measured values of fracture spacing and hydraulic conductivity. The herbicides were more strongly retarded than the chloride at low flow rates, but at higher flow rates the herbicides arrived with the chloride, indicating the influence of nonequilibrium sorption of the herbicides to fracture walls and the matrix solids, The columns were dismantled following the tracer experiments and mapping under UV light showed that nearly all of the visible, weathered fractures (and the few root holes in the case of the shallowest sample) were active transport pathways, with the dye appearing mainly on the fracture surfaces and as a "rim" in the adjacent matrix. Concentration profiles measured perpendicular to the fracture surfaces showed that the herbicides had also moved into the matrix, apparently by diffusion. Simulations of solute transport with a discrete fracture flow/matrix diffusion model showed that the simulations could be "fit" to the data if all of the visible fractures were hydraulically active, but could not be fit if all or most of the flow was channelled through just the primary fractures (defined by prominent oxidation stains). Simulations with an equivalent porous media (EPM) model could not fit the data using the measured total porosity as the effective porosity. The simulations could likely be fit with a smaller value of effective porosity, but this would limit applicability to held situations because fitted effective porosity is expected to change with physical scale and residence time of the solute in the soil.

AB Impacts of forest harvesting on groundwater properties, water flowpaths and streamflow response were examined 4 years after the harvest using a paired-basin approach during the 2001 snowmelt in a northern hardwood landscape in central Ontario. The ability of two metrics of basin topography (Beven and Kirkby's ln(a/tan 6) topographic index (TI) and distance to stream channel) to explain intra-basin variations in groundwater dynamics was also evaluated. Significant relationships between TI and depth to potentiometric surface for shallow groundwater emerged, although the occurrence of these relationships during the melt differed between harvested and control basins, possibly as a result of interbasin differences in upslope area contributing to piezometers used to monitor groundwater behaviour. Transmissivity feedback (rapid strearnflow increases as the water table approaches the soil surface) governed strearnflow generation in both basins, and the mean threshold depths at which rapid strearnflow increases corresponded to small rises in water level were similar for harvested (0-41 +/- 0.05 m) and forested (0-38 +/- 0.04 m) basins. However, topographic properties provided inconsistent explanations of spatial variations in the relationship between streamflow and depth to water at a given piezometer for both basins. Streamflow from the harvested basin exceeded that from the forested basin during the 2001 melt, and hydrometric and geochemical tracer results indicated greater runoff from the harvested basin via surface and near-surface pathways. These differences are not solely attributable to harvesting, since the difference in spring runoff from the harvested basin relative to the forested control was not consistently larger than under preharvest conditions. Nevertheless, greater melt rates following harvesting appear to have increased the proportion of water delivery to the stream channel via surface and near-surface pathways.

AB It is widely recognized that multi-year drought can induce changes in catchment hydrological behaviours. However, at present, our understanding about multi-year drought-induced changes in catchment hydrological behaviours and its driving factors at the process level is still very limited. This study proposed a new approach using a data assimilation technique with a process-based hydrological model to detect multi-year drought-induced changes in catchment hydrological behaviours and to identify driving factors for the changes in an unimpaired Australian catchment (Wee Jasper) which experienced prolonged drought from 1997 to 2009. Modelling experiments demonstrated that the multi-year drought caused a significant change in the catchment rainfall-runoff relationship, indicated by significant step changes in the estimated time-variant hydrological parameters SC (indicating catchment active water storage capacity) and C (reflecting catchment evapotranspiration dynamics), whose average values increased 23.4% and 10.2%, respectively, due to drought. The change in the rainfall-runoff relationship identified by the data assimilation method is consistent with that arrived at by a statistical examination. The proposed method provides insights about the drivers of the changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship at the processes level. Increasing catchment water storage capacity and decreasing ratio of rainfall to soil moisture for supplying actual evapotranspiration during drought are the main driving factors for the catchment behaviours change in the Wee Jasper catchment in terms of model structure. And they are related to decrease in catchment groundwater level and deep soil moisture. The proposed new method can be used as an effective technique for detecting both the change of hydrological behaviours induced by prolonged drought and its driving factors at the process level.

AB In recent decades, the Rocky Mountain West has been one of the fastest growing regions in the United States. Headwater streams in mountain environments may be particularly susceptible to nitrogen enrichment from residential and resort development. We utilized stream water chemistry from six synoptic sampling campaigns combined with land use/land cover (LULC) and terrain analysis in geostatistical modeling to examine the spatial and seasonal variability of LULC impacts on stream water nitrate. Stream water nitrate was spatially correlated for longer distances during the dormant season than during the growing season, suggesting the importance of biological retention. Spatial linear models indicated that anthropogenic sources best predicted stream water nitrate in the dormant season, while variables describing biological processing were the best predictors in the growing season. This work demonstrates the importance of (1) incorporating spatial relationships into water quality modeling and (2) investigating stream water chemistry across seasons to gain a more complete understanding of development impacts on stream water quality.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the most widely used techniques for solving a variety of problems including classification and function approximation type of problems. However, the use of ANNs in hydrology is limited to academics and research; and hydrologists/policymakers are skeptical to use the ANNs in operational hydrology, especially where a premium is placed on the comprehensibility of the systems. This is probably because of the perceived 'black-box' nature of the ANNs as they do not provide an insight into their learning process or elucidation of obtaining a particular result. Since a long time, researchers have been trying to improve the comprehensibility of trained ANN models by knowledge extraction for improving their reliability and acceptability among the decision makers for operation purposes. There are few such attempts in hydrology particularly for ANN models developed for function approximation problems such as flow forecasting and evaporation estimation. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed that is capable of extracting knowledge from trained ANN models for classification type of problems in hydrology. This is achieved by extracting knowledge in terms of rules by inducing a Decision Tree using input-output relation of a trained ANN model for forecasting drought classes with standardized precipitation index for Indian Meteorological sub-divisions. The reported researches on knowledge extraction in hydrology is primarily been for the function approximation type of problems, however, the present approach is fundamentally different from them and useful for knowledge extraction exclusively for classification problems in hydrology. The findings of this research indicate that definite rules are learned by ANN models during their training to forecast a specific drought class. These extracted rules are simple, easily implementable, and can be used as the drought class forecasting tool in a drought management activity. The results suggest that due to the nature of the drought index used, the rules extracted from one region may be suitable for drought monitoring of other regions.

AB This paper presents analytical solutions for pumping from a poroelastic, confined aquifer where the combined effects of a finite-thickness skin zone and the wellbore storage are fully incorporated. The pumping-induced axisymmetric stress, plane strain deformation, and pore pressure are derived in the Laplace transform domain. Time-domain solutions are obtained using the Stehfest inversion algorithm. Numerical examples are presented to investigate the effects of hydromechanical coupling and poroelasticity on the hydraulic drawdown at the pumping well and at an observation well. The results show that traditional methods substantially underestimate the drawdown at the pumping well in a low-permeability hard rock compared with the drawdown predicted using the fully coupled poroelastic theory. The difference becomes more pronounced when a finite-thickness positive skin is present with a permeability that is lower than the permeability of the formation. For finite-radius pumping wells with storage, the effects of poroelasticity on drawdown are masked by the effects associated with wellbore storage.

AB Because human and environmental systems in the Anthropocene are increasingly coupled, hydrologists and economists often find themselves studying the same systems from different vantage points. Here we argue that synthesis across economics and hydrology can help address two pressing sociohydrologic challenges: actionable prediction and the generation of transferable knowledge from place-based studies. Specifically, we review (1) empirical methods and (2) theoretical approaches from economics and connect the two through a proposed iterative framework. First, we find that empirical methods for statistical analysis of natural and quasi-experiments in economics can be leveraged to distinguish causal relations from mere correlations in complex and data scarce systems, which can help address the challenge of sociohydrologic prediction. Second, we find that economic theories based on rational choice can be used to decipher known paradoxes in water resources, which can help address the challenge of sociohydrologic knowledge generation. In both empirical and theoretical domains, specialized knowledge in hydrology remains critical to properly applying techniques from economics to coupled human-water systems. We propose that linkages between the two fields highlight a large potential for interaction.

TI Hydrologic uncertainty processor for probabilistic river stage
   forecasting
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOOD; DISTRIBUTIONS
AB The hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) is a component of the Bayesian forecasting system that produces a short-term probabilistic river stage forecast based on a probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast (PQPF). The task of the HUP is to quantify the hydrologic uncertainty under the hypothesis that there is no precipitation uncertainty. The hydrologic uncertainty is the aggregate of all uncertainties arising from sources other than those quantified by the PQPF; these sources include the hydrologic model (model and parameter uncertainties), inputs estimated deterministically (measurement, estimation, and prediction uncertainties), and inputs not forecasted (e.g., precipitation beyond the period covered by the PQPF). Bayesian theory for the HUP is presented, and a meta-Gaussian model is developed. This parametric model allows for (1) any form of marginal distributions of river stages, (2) a nonlinear and heteroscedastic dependence structure between the model river stage and the actual river stage, and (3) an analytic solution of the Bayesian revision process. Estimation and validation of the model are described using data from the operational forecast system of the National Weather Service for a 1430-km(2) headwater basin.

AB Low Impact Development (LID) facilities are the key to realizing the source control of stormwater. However, there are few studies on the control effects of different LID facilities on runoff volume and runoff quality. In this paper, based on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), a Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the runoff process for five LID facilities. The correlation analysis and scoring of the three indicators of runoff co-efficient, peak runoff, and Suspended Solid (SS) wash-off in the simulation results were conducted to evaluate the control effects of different LID facilities. The simulation results showed an evident law of decreasing marginal effect in the deployed area of LID facilities. In addition, the uncertainty of the hydrological response of permeable pavement is the smallest among the five types of LID facilities, and the uncertainty of vegetative swales is the largest. Under the suitable combination of parameters, the area percentage of permeable pavement reaching the upper limit of the control effect of three indicators is the smallest; the control effect of three indicators of infiltration trench is the best. Correlation analysis showed that the three indicators of the LID facilities could be estimated from each other through the regression relationship equation.

AB Investigating precipitation concentration (PC) is significant for a deeper understanding of the formation of floods and droughts. Taking a Chinese region, Huaihe River basin (HRB), as the study area, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of annual/seasonal PCs and their teleconnections with El Nino-Southern Oscilation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Specifically, the daily and monthly precipitation data are employed to build two annual indices (CIDyear and CIMyear) and four seasonal PC indices. The modified Mann -Kendall test is used to identify the significant trends of PC indices. Besides, the correlation test and cross wavelet transform are used to examine the relationship between CIDyear and CIMyear, the spatiotemporal characteristics of PC indices, and the teleconnections of PC indices with ENSO and PDO. The results show that (1) CIDyear has a significantly positive correlation with CIMyear, and shows a dominate downward trend across the HRB; (2) the precipitation temporal distribution in winter and autumn is more variable and more irregular than that in spring and summer at the HRB; (3) the annual and seasonal precipitation temporal distribution of the HRB become more variable and more irregular with increasing latitude, and the downward trends of CIDyear and CIMyear tend to be more significant with increasing latitude and longitude; (4) ENSO and PDO have potentially negative effects on the annual and seasonal PCs of HRB, and their negative impacts on the annual PC significantly strengthen from south to north in the HRB; and (5) Compared with PDO, ENSO has more pronounced negative impacts on seasonal PCs of the HRB, and its negative impacts on summer PC and winter PC decrease and increase from west to east of HRB, respectively. These findings could provide a new perspective for understanding regional precipitation temporal distribution.

AB Spatial variability of throughfall (TF) isotopic composition, used as tracer input, influences isotope hydrological applications in forested watersheds. Notwithstanding, identification of the dominant canopy factors and processes that affect the patterns of TF isotopic variability remains ambiguous. Here, we examined the spatio-temporal variability of TF isotopic composition in a Japanese cypress plantation, in which intensive strip thinning was performed and investigated whether canopy structure at a fine resolution of canopy effect analysis is related to TF isotopic composition and how this is affected by meteorological factors. Canopy openness, as an index of canopy structure, was calculated from hemispherical photographs at different zenith angles. TF samples were collected in a 10x10m experimental plot in both pre-thinning (from July to November 2010) and post-thinning (from May 2012 to March 2013) periods. Our results show that thinning resulted in a smaller alteration of input O-18 of gross precipitation, whereas the changes in deuterium excess varied in both directions. Despite the temporal stability of spatial patterns in TF amount, the spatial variability of TF isotopic composition was not temporally stable in both pre- and post-thinning periods. Additionally, after thinning, the isotopic composition of TF was best related to canopy openness calculated at the zenith angle of 7 degrees, exhibiting three different relationships, that is, significantly negative, significantly positive, and nonsignificant. Changes in meteorological factors (wind speed, rainfall intensity, and temperature) were found to affect the relationships between TF O-18 and canopy openness. The observed shifts in the relationships reveal different dominant factors (partial evaporation and the selection), and canopy water flowpaths control such differences. This study provides useful insights into the spatial variability of TF isotopic composition and improves our understanding of the physical processes of interception through canopy passage.

AB Flow in a single fracture (SF) is an important research subject in groundwater hydrology, hydraulic engineering, radioactive nuclear waste repository and geotechnical engineering. An abruptly changing aperture is a unique type of SF. This study discusses the relation between the values of the critical Reynolds number (Re-c) for the onset of symmetry breaking of flow and the expansion ratio (E) of SF, which is defined as the ratio between the outlet (D) and inlet (d) apertures. This study also investigates the effect of inlet aperture d on Re-c for flow in an SF with abruptly changing apertures (SF-ACA) using the finite volume method. Earlier numerical and experimental results showed that flow is symmetric in respect to the central plane of the SF-ACA at small Reynolds number (Re) but becomes asymmetric when Re is sufficiently large. Our simulations show that the value of Re-c decreases with the increasing E, and the relationship between the logarithm of Re-c and E can be described accurately using either a quadratic polynomial function or a logarithmic function. However, the relationship of Re-c and d for a given E value is vague, and Re-c becomes even less sensitive to d when E increases. This study also reveals that the hydraulic gradient (J) and flow velocity (v) follow a super-linear relationship that can be fitted almost perfectly by the Forchheimer equation. The inertial component (J(i)) of J increases monotonically with Re, whereas the viscous component (J(v)) of J decreases monotonically with Re. The Re value corresponding to equal inertial and viscous components of J (named as the transitional point Re) decreases when E increases, and such a transitional point Re should be closely related to the critical Reynolds number Re-c, although a rigorous theoretical proof is not yet available.

AB Although sediment yield (SY) from water erosion is ubiquitous and its environmental consequences are well recognized, its impacts on the global carbon cycle remain largely uncertain. This knowledge gap is partly due to the lack of soil erosion modeling in Earth System Models (ESMs), which are important tools used to understand the global carbon cycle and explore its changes. This study analyzed sediment and particulate organic carbon yield (CY) data from 1,081 and 38 small catchments (0.1-200 km(2)), respectively, in different environments across the globe. Using multiple statistical analysis techniques, we explored environmental factors and hydrological processes important for SY and CY modeling in ESMs. Our results show clear correlations of high SY with traditional agriculture, seismicity and heavy storms, as well as strong correlations between SY and annual peak runoff. These highlight the potential limitation of SY models that represent only interrill and rill erosion because shallow overland flow and rill flow have limited transport capacity due to their hydraulic geometry to produce high SY. Further, our results suggest that SY modeling in ESMs should be implemented at the event scale to produce the catastrophic mass transport during episodic events. Several environmental factors such as seismicity and land management that are often not considered in current catchment-scale SY models can be important in controlling global SY. Our analyses show that SY is likely the primary control on CY in small catchments and a statistically significant empirical relationship is established to calculate SY and CY jointly in ESMs.
   Plain Language Summary Sediment and organic carbon in the rivers produced by soil erosion are ubiquitous. Although they have important effects on the global carbon cycle, current models have limitations in representing sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) yield at temporal and spatial scales relevant to Earth System Models (ESMs). By analyzing the sediment yield data from over 1000 small catchments across the globe, we identified environmental factors and hydrological processes important for modeling sediment yield in ESMs. Based on the POC yield data, we indicated that sediment yield is likely the primary control on POC yield. Importantly, we also established a statistical significant empirical relationship relating POC yield to sediment yield that can be used in ESMs.

AB We investigate capillary pressure-saturation (P-C-S) relationships for drainage-imbibition experiments conducted with air (nonwetting phase) and brine (wetting phase) in Bentheimer sandstone cores. Three different flow rate conditions, ranging over three orders of magnitude, are investigated. X-ray microcomputed tomographic imaging is used to characterize the distribution and amount of fluids and their interfacial characteristics. Capillary pressure is measured via (1) bulk-phase pressure transducer measurements, and (2) image-based curvature measurements, calculated using a novel 3D curvature algorithm. We distinguish between connected (percolating) and disconnected air clusters: curvatures measured on the connected phase interfaces are used to validate the curvature algorithm and provide an indication of the equilibrium condition of the data; curvature and volume distributions of disconnected clusters provide insight to the snap-offprocesses occurring during drainage and imbibition under different flow rate conditions.

AB This paper reports the first effort to include carbon, water, and heat exchange in a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for 3D canopy flows with dynamic response of leaf temperature and stomatal aperture. The LES model simulates eddy motion from 3D), transient integration of a filtered form of the Navier-Stokes equations. Carbon exchange between the vegetation and air is predicted in space and time following biophysical considerations, which act to maximize carbon assimilation while minimizing water loss. The vegetation's stomatal conductance is inferred from these same considerations and used to regulate both transpiration and carbon assimilation rates. Variations in transpiration and radiation distribution propagate to foliage temperature and ultimately heat exchange through a local, transient vegetation energy balance. The wind field is affected by the foliage patterns and by the temperature profile's control on vertical mixing. These temperature and mixing patterns control the concentration profiles that, in turn, affect water and CO2 exchange processes. By comparing a simulation of horizontally heterogeneous canopy behavior to simulations of several homogeneous canopies with different leaf area index (LAI) values we evaluate the relative importance of local and regional LAI values on the local microenvironment variables and fluxes from the forest canopy. We focus on a pine forest with ample soil moisture as a case study. We demonstrate from these simulations that primitive state variables (e.g. concentrations and velocity) exhibit noticeable non-local controls. However, these features are offset in their effects on land surface fluxes, such that the local fluxes scale well with local LAI values. Furthermore, the resulting relationships between LAI and fluxes are quasi-linear (for the forest morphology studied here) allowing for robust relationships between forest averaged LAI and forest averaged fluxes. The offsetting nature of the non-local effects is described in the context of the dual regulation of stomatal conductance by the rates of carbon assimilation and water loss as opposed to independent regulating effects of the various state variables. Hence, non-local variations in state variables naturally induce offsetting variations in stomatal conductance thereby buffering the water use efficiency of the plant from environmental excursions associated with the turbulent microclimate.

AB Numerical hydrologic simulation, in combination with synthetic weather generation, was used to assess the sensitivity of the peak flow regime for hourly, daily, and 7-day discharge to hypothetical harvesting scenarios in Redfish Creek in southern British Columbia. Simulation was based on stationary vegetation cover, thus representing potential peak flow regime adjustments during the first few critical years following harvesting. The relative difference between preharvest and postharvest peak discharge quantiles (DeltaQ(T)), estimated by comparing GEV distributions fit to the simulated preharvest and postharvest annual maximum series, tended to increase with increasing harvest area; however, the relationship was strongly influenced by the elevation distribution of harvest blocks. Although rainfall was determined to be a factor in roughly three quarters of all peak discharge events, the flood frequency of Redfish Creek is fundamentally a function of the frequency structure of snowmelt runoff. Consequently, changes in runoff synchronization between various elevation bands largely drove the magnitude of DeltaQ(T), and the degree of increased synchronization was found to be greatest following harvesting above H60 ( elevation above which lies 60% of basin area) and least following harvesting below H60. As a result, only harvesting schemes that incorporated cut blocks above H60 tended to generate significant (alpha = 0.05) DeltaQ(T) for a wide range of return periods ( T), regardless of discharge timescale. Significant DeltaQ(T) ranged from 6 to 14% for hourly, 5 to 14% for daily, and 5 to 20% for 7-day discharge in the range of 1.25 less than or equal to T less than or equal to 100 years. For a given scenario, hourly and daily DeltaQ(T) showed little variation with T, suggesting that small and large discharge events responded similarly to forest harvesting. However, this apparent trend substantially overstates DeltaQ(T) for the largest hourly and daily peak discharge events such that the relationship of DeltaQ(T) to T is inconclusive for T > 30 years. For 7-day discharge, DeltaQ(T) increases with increasing T for 1.25 less than or equal to T less than or equal to 100 years.

AB This paper presents a weather generator that allows simulation of hydrometeorological variables representative of a given geographic location: precipitation, total cloud cover, incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The approach captures the essential relationships among the quantities of interest, while modeling the diurnal variation of weather conditions at the hourly scale. Precipitation is considered to be the key driver of simulated hydrometeorological conditions, which leads to a consistent covariation of the weather variables. The generator was calibrated and validated with data from three meteorological stations located in New Mexico, Arizona, and Oklahoma. The set of variables reproduced by the weather generator can serve as input to a number of models of environmental systems, involving hydrological, ecological, water resources, and agricultural applications. The model is also suitable for creating scenarios of climate regimes (e. g., dry versus wet climates) useful in sensitivity studies. The source codes of the weather generator, manual, and test applications are publicly available.

AB HydroTrend, a hydrologic- transport model, is used to simulate the water and suspended sediment discharge of the Waipaoa River system over the last 3 Kyr, a time period in which a well- documented sequence of natural events and anthropogenic activities that profoundly impacted drainage basin processes occurred. Comparisons between observed and simulated data show that the model output replicates the frequency and distribution of flow events and the suspended sediment concentration- discharge relationship, and the long- term trends in suspended sediment discharge are consistent with the sediment record preserved on the middle shelf. Water discharge tracks precipitation, and average annual discharge may have been up to 20% higher and 6% lower at different times in the past. Suspended sediment discharge changed from 2.3 +/- 4.5 to 14.9 +/- 8.7 Mt yr (-1) during the Anthropocene, increasing by 140% after Polynesian arrival, by 350% after European colonization, and by 660% after the catchment headwaters were deforested.

   FLOW; DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; SURFACE; PROBABILITY; DOWNSTREAM; ADVECTION
AB In conventional analysis of sedimentation in open channel flow, suspended sediment transport is regarded as an advection diffusion process. A series of theories based on Brownian motion are developed for describing the diffusion process of sediment particles attributed to turbulence. However, difficulties remain because these models cannot represent the time coherence of turbulence structures that affect instantaneous local sediment concentrations. Focusing on the impact of two flow structures in the near-wall region on suspended sediment transport, ejection, and sweep events, this study proposes a new stochastic Lagrangian model to simulate sediment particle trajectory. While the occurrences of ejection/sweep events are confirmed to change the instantaneous sediment flux, their impact on the long-term average sediment flux has yet to be confirmed. The simulation results identify the contributions of these structures to suspended sediment transport and show that the time coherence of flow velocity may be essential for flow to carry sediment particles in suspension. This study also points out that the duration of the flow events may be the key to interpret the diffusion coefficient in terms of turbulence intensity.

AB Laboratory-scale columns were employed to study the effect of oxygen and ionic strength on the transport of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in porous media. In anaerobic experiments, cells were grown and transport experiments were conducted in a well-controlled anaerobic chamber. Cell surface electrokinetic potentials were measured and surface elemental composition was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Transport experimental results showed reduced travel distance of PAO1 with increased ionic strength under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, consistent with calculated Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The deposition rates of PAO1 were significantly higher in aerobic than in anaerobic condition at higher ionic strength (10 and 100 mM), although the electrokinetic potentials were similar throughout the tested ionic strength (1, 10, and 100 mM). No difference in PAO1 deposition rate was observed at 1 mM. XPS analysis showed that variation in cell surface composition due to different growth conditions played a primary role in determining the different deposition behaviors.

AB [1] Using radiative reflectance as the discriminatory functional trait, we find scale-free signatures of local functional diversity density of vegetation in river basins, implying a high likelihood of locations with very high diversity relative to the overall diversity of the riparian systems (i. e., riparian diversity hot spots). The spatial series of average local functional diversity exhibits correlation structures that indicate long-range communication of diversity information along river networks. The riparian area of a randomly selected streamlink is found to be exponentially distributed. Our findings suggest that landscape structure and dispersal directionality play crucial roles in determining biodiversity patterns, and thus should be addressed in comprehensive biodiversity theories and fieldwork and conservation campaigns. Finally, the connection between the spectral-group-based functional diversity signatures and those associated with the actual species richness is yet to be verified and quantified; such connection will significantly enhance the importance of the already meaningful signatures reported here.

AB In this paper, an operational algorithm is proposed for the mapping of surface moisture over the northern and central parts of Tunisia, in North Africa. A change detection approach is applied, using 160 multiincidence Envisat ASAR Wide Swath images acquired in the horizontal polarization over a 7 year period. Parameterization of this algorithm is considered for three classes of vegetation cover density (NDVI<0.25, 0.25<NDVI<0.5, and NDVI>0.5), retrieved from SPOT-VGT decadal images. A relative soil moisture index, ranging between 0 (for the driest surfaces) and 1 (for saturated soils), is proposed for each date, with a resolution of 1 km. The retrieved soil moistures are validated by means of ground measurements based on continuous thetaprobe measurements, as well as low-resolution (25 km) ERS and ASCAT soil moisture products from the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien). A qualitative relationship between spatiotemporal variations of moisture and precipitation is also discussed.

This paper defines precise criteria for nonequilibrium to occur during evaporation in soils. In doing so a physically based model of the pore transfer coefficient critical to quantifying the degree of nonequilibrium is developed. The likelihood of departure from the equilibrium assumption for various soil textures and temperature conditions, including the extreme case of surface fire, is presented. Furthermore the pore transfer coefficient is incorporated into steady-state nonequilibrium simulations of evaporation from a coarse sand under field conditions and compared with the corresponding equilibrium simulation. Outside of the narrow subsurface evaporation zone there were no significant differences between the nonequilibrium and equilibrium simulations. Since nonequilibrium effects were most likely to be seen with the coarse sand abandoning the standard assumption in future work is unnecessary, and all previous work based on it need not be questioned.

AB Heterogeneity of aquifer permeability has a significant influence on the transport of solutes; therefore characterization of aquifer heterogeneity is needed to accurately predict the behavior of solutes. A critical characteristic of heterogeneity is a characteristic length scale that is a measure of the distance over which property values are correlated. We show that the characteristic length scale of a statistically homogeneous permeability field can be identified through wavelet analysis using the global wavelet energy spectrum (GWES). The relationship between the wavelet scale and the characteristic length scale of a random field is investigated for the Mexican hat and Morlet wavelets and different covariance structures. The ability of the GWES to identify multiple characteristic length scales in a random field with nested covariance structures is also investigated. We use the technique to identify the characteristic length scales of a laboratory-collected permeability transect from Massillon sandstone.

AB Empirical power law sediment rating curves of the form C=aQ(b) (where C is the sediment concentration, Q is the discharge rate, and the coefficient a and exponent b are fitted parameters), or the alternative form given by log(Q(s)) = log(a) + (b+ 1)log(Q) (where Q(s) = CQ is the sediment delivery rate, and the natural logarithm is used) are widely used for characterising sediment transport across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Fire frequently has a large effect on erosion rates and sediment delivery. We investigate the temporal changes in the coefficient a and exponent b for 3 years following a wildfire between February 2003 and April 2006, for two South Eastern Australian Eucalyptus forested catchments (136 and 244 ha) with mean annual rainfall of 1900 mm. Storm-event integrated sediment loads and discharges were calculated for each of 596 storm events using stage-discharge control structures and in situ turbidity measurements at 15 min intervals. Measurements were converted to sediment concentrations using regression relationships developed from storm activated water auto-samplers. The analysis identified: (i) strong negative linear relationships between the rating coefficient log(a), and the rating exponent b, reflecting sediment rating curves that "pivot" around a common fulcrum point in log-log space, (ii) a systematic shift in this linear relationship between log(a) and b as a function of time since fire, (iii) maximum values of b of ca. 2.5 (i.e. maximum non-linearity in the relationship between discharge and sediment delivery, and therefore maximum sensitivity to high peak-discharge events) immediately following the fire, which decline rapidly and monotonically by a factor of 10 to ca. 0.25 in the first 8 months, attributed to a dominance of hillslope erosion processes and declining rill and interill erodibility, (iv) irregular patterns in the value of b during the vegetation recovery period, probably reflecting a shift from hillslope dominated erosion processes to a greater contribution from channel processes (8-24 months after the fire) and (v) annual cycles in the value of b in the recovered state (24-38 months after the fire) ranging from a minimum of ca. 0.5 in the dry season to a maximum of ca. 1.5 in the wet season. The physical cause of these cycles could not be isolated in this study. The results provide a robust quantitative perspective on the magnitude and temporal variability of the sensitivity of catchments recovering from wildfire.

ID WATER-FLOW; THRESHOLD
AB The study is focused on runoff formation processes at two scales: the scale of a small mountainous catchment at its outlet and the scale of an experimental plot located in a typical hillslope subregion. The heterogeneous soil profile of the catchments is formed by Cambisols developed on granite bedrocks. The surface runoff appears rarely, the subsurface flow forms a dominant part of the hydrograph. From the period 1998-2008, a set of 44 rainfall-runoff episodes was selected to analyse the rainfall-runoff relationship using multiple regression analysis. From a set of physical parameters, the initial soil water content came out as the statistically significant parameter that controls the runoff forming process at the catchment scale. The rainfall-runoff relationship at the experimental plot scale is more scattered. The dynamic thresholds of rainfall totals apparently control the ratio and the magnitude of stormflow at both scales. Up to the threshold value, the runoff strongly depends on the initial saturation conditions. Above the threshold value, the initial soil moisture conditions are less important.

AB Sediment load from agricultural watersheds is a threat to the quality of downstream waters in many countries. Water-quality trading thus is employed to lower the cost of controlling soil erosion. However, a trading program is not always successful since uncertainties pertaining to erosion control are often not well acknowledged. Such uncertainties can be caused by both physical characteristics of a watershed and agricultural activities. This study presents a modeling approach to investigate water-quality trading in soil erosion control, based on watershed-simulation and optimization models in which various uncertainties are reflected. The simulation-optimization approach is bridged through an assumed linear relationship between simulation outcomes and decision variables in optimization models. The developed modeling approach is demonstrated within the Swift Current Creek watershed, Canada. Results show that the uncertainties play a major role in the successful of lunching a water-quality trading program, and trading costs is also critical for the trading system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The estimation of the extent and timing of solute migration in a fractured medium is a fundamental task for verifying the level of protection against contaminant releases (e.g., toxic chemicals or radionuclides) offered by the engineered and natural barriers of a waste repository. In this paper we present a novel approach for modeling solute transport in a fractured medium, based on an extension of the Kolmogorov-Dmitriev theory of stochastic branching processes. The model equations for the expected values of the solute concentration take a form similar to that of classical dual-continua models. On the other hand, the stochastic nature of the modeling approach lends itself to a new particle tracking scheme of resolution, which allows accounting for realistic features of the transport process. The proposed stochastic modeling framework and simulation solution approach are illustrated with reference to the experimental results from a case study of literature. Some of the model parameters are optimally identified by means of a genetic algorithm search aimed at best fitting the experimental data.

DE tropical rain forest; suspended sediment; source area estimation
AB Suspended solids (SS) discharge from a tropical rain forest was observed at the Bukit Tarek Experimental Watershed in Peninsular Malaysia in order to elucidate mechanisms of SS production and transport. Peaks of water discharge and electrical conductivity (EC) lagged further behind rainfall peaks than did dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that the discharge in the early stage of a storm is mainly formed by rain water with high DO. Stream water showing a high value of EC originating from subsurface water formed the main storm flow and lagged behind the rainfall. SS concentrations rose to a peak quickly and, like DO, the peak preceded that of water discharge. A clockwise hysteresis loop in the relationship between SS and water discharge exists, and the magnitude of hysteresis loop is in proportion to storm size. The values of SS concentration correlate positively with the values of rainfall intensity on logarithmic axes. The time intervals between peaks of rainfall and SS concentrations are assumed to be a delivery term expressing distance from sediment source to measuring point. Immediate transport of SS from the source to the sampling site, the short time gap between the peaks of rainfall and SS concentrations, and the high rate of infiltration on the hillslope suggest that the sources of high SS concentrations are located close to the stream. The calculated source area is located at a gentler part of the stream, where wet riparian areas exist. The strong relationship between water discharge and SS concentration during the small storm proves that the source areas of SS and water were the same. In contrast, the source area of SS disappeared when rainfall ceased, whereas the source area of water discharge was still expanding in the larger storm. These phenomena may produce clockwise loops in the SS concentration-water discharge relationship. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB A Monte Carlo simulation of flow and transport is employed to study tracer migration in porous media with evolving scales of heterogeneity (fractal media). Transport is studied with both conservative and reactive chemicals in media that possess physical as well as chemical heterogeneity. Linear kinetic equations are assumed to relate the sorbed phase and the aqueous phase concentrations. The fluctuating log conductivity possesses the power law spectrum of a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Chemical heterogeneity is represented as spatially varying reaction rates that also are assumed to obey fBm statistics and may be correlated to the conductivity field. The model is based on a finite difference approximation to the flow problem and a random walk particle-tracking approach for solving the solute transport equation. The model is used to make comparisons with the nonlocal transport equations recently developed by Deng et al. [1993], and Hu et nl. [1995, 1997]. The results presented herein support these nonlocal models for a wide range of heterogeneous systems. However, the infinite integral scale associated with the fractal conductivity has a significant effect on the prediction of the nonlocal theories, This suggests that integral scale should play a role in stochastic Eulerian perturbation theories. The importance of the local-scale dispersion depends to a great extent on the magnitude of the local dispersivities. The effect of neglecting local dispersion decreases with the decrease in local dispersivity.

AB The original review of macropores and water flow in soils by Beven and Germann is now 30 years old and has become one of the most highly cited papers in hydrology. This paper attempts to review the progress in observations and theoretical reasoning about preferential soil water flows over the intervening period. It is suggested that the topic has still not received the attention that its importance deserves, in part because of the ready availability of software packages rooted firmly in the Richards domain, albeit that there is convincing evidence that this may be predicated on the wrong experimental method for natural conditions. There is still not an adequate physical theory linking all types of flow, and there are still not adequate observational techniques to support the scale dependent parameterizations that will be required at practical field and hillslope scales of application. Some thoughts on future needs to develop a more comprehensive representation of soil water flows are offered.

AB Floods are risky events ranging from small to catastrophic. Although expected flood damages are frequently used for economic policy analysis, alternative measures such as option price (OP) and cumulative prospect value exist. The empirical magnitude of these measures whose theoretical preference is ambiguous is investigated using case study data from Baltimore City. The outcome for the base case OP measure increases mean willingness to pay over the expected damage value by about 3%, a value which is increased with greater risk aversion, reduced by increased wealth, and only slightly altered by higher limits of integration. The base measure based on cumulative prospect theory is about 46% less than expected damages with estimates declining when alternative parameters are used. The method of aggregation is shown to be important in the cumulative prospect case which can lead to an estimate up to 41% larger than expected damages. Expected damages remain a plausible and the most easily computed measure for analysts.

AB We derive analytical relationships between the spatial covariance of the (natural) logarithm of hydraulic conductivity (K) and that of representative soil particle sizes and porosity. The latter quantities can be directly measured during routine sedimentological analyses of soil samples and provide a way of incorporating K estimates into groundwater flow models at a relatively modest experimental cost. Here we rely on widely used empirical formulations requiring measurements of representative particle diameters and, in some cases, of medium porosity. We derive exact formulations relating the spatial covariance of these quantities and K and present workable approximations on the basis of perturbation methods. Our formulations provide a direct link between key geostatistical descriptors of sedimentological and hydraulic parameters of heterogeneous aquifers which can be employed in classical estimation and simulation procedures. The approach and theoretical results are tested on an extensive data set comprising 411 particle size curves collected at 12 boreholes in a small-scale alluvial aquifer.

TI Precipitation uncertainty processor for probabilistic river stage

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NATIONAL-WEATHER-SERVICE; FLOOD PROGRAM
AB The precipitation uncertainty processor (PUP) is a component of the Bayesian forecasting system which produces a short-term probabilistic river stage forecast (PRSF) based on a probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast (PQPF). The task of the PUP is to process a probability distribution of the total precipitation amount through a deterministic hydrologic model (of any complexity) into a probability distribution of the model river stage. An analytic-numerical PUP is developed based on the theory of response functions and empirical data simulated from the operational forecast system of the National Weather Service for a 1430 km(2) headwater basin. The PUP outputs a five-parameter two-piece Weibull distribution of the model river stage. The corresponding response function is a two-piece power function. Structural properties of the PUP are investigated empirically, including the deterministic equivalence principle: Under certain conditions a deterministic forecast of the temporal disaggregation of the total precipitation amount is equivalent to a probabilistic forecast. This considerably simplifies the PQPF, without affecting the optimality of the PRSF.

AB [1] The distributed predictions of the original version of TOPMODEL are here compared with distributed observations of water table levels in the Uhlirska catchment in the Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic. The calibration of the model has been carried out within the GLUE framework, which allows the estimation of uncertainties in predicting the distributed patterns of the water table at different times. Many of the water table levels are predicted within the limits of uncertainty, but it is shown that the predictions could be improved by the calculation of a local effective transmissivity value (or local upslope contributing areas) at each observation site. These effective transmissivities show a similar relationship to the topographic index as found in a previous study of a small catchment in Norway. Some of the anomalies can be explained by deficiencies in the topographic analysis but this may also be an indication of possible structural deficiencies in the model. Interpretation is, however, difficult, and it remains to be seen whether these anomalies they might be avoided in more dynamic distributed models.

AB This paper presents a methodology for the identification of the time tipping point where historical operating rules of a reservoir system should be replaced by new alternatives due to climate change. The time tipping point is a time indicator of the failure probability change point of the historical operating rules for the reservoir system under future climate change, called the failure warning time. For this study, the primary purpose of the reservoir system is hydropower generation. We first estimate the probability density function of the annual benefit of hydropower generation. Then, based on the estimated probability density function and the given risk tolerance level of the reservoir system, we determine the risk-based warning threshold, and further identify the failure warning time of the historical operating rules via the probability change-point analysis technique. We apply the proposed methodology to the Xiluodu-Xiangjiaba-Three Gorges cascade reservoir system on the Yangtze River in China. The results indicate that the failure warning time for the cascade reservoir system will occur in at least another 10 years in the future under climate change. We also find that the failure response in the cascade reservoir system is determined by both the reservoir that has the first failure occurrence and its storage capacity. The developed methodology can be used to determine the time tipping point to launch adaptation strategies for the river basin management, and further can help policymakers cope with climate change.

AB [1] Bed form evolution remains dynamic even in the special case of steady, uniform flow. Data from the sandy, braided North Loup River, Nebraska, show that roughness features on the channel bottom display a statistical steady state and robust scaling that are maintained through the collective interactions of transient (short-lived) bed forms. Motivated by such field data, and laboratory observations of bed form growth, we develop a nonlinear stochastic surface evolution model for the topography of bed load dominated sandy rivers in which instantaneous sediment flux explicitly depends on local elevation and slope. This model quantitatively reproduces laboratory observations of initial growth and saturation of bed forms from a flat surface, and also generates long-term dynamical behavior characteristic of natural systems. We argue that the variability in geometry and kinematics of bed forms in steady flow, and the existence of roughness at all wavelengths up to the largest dunes, are a consequence of the nonlinear relationship between sediment flux and topography, subject to noise.

AB Quantitatively describing complex natural systems and their processes is a challenging task; additionally, the random nature of these processes adds more difficulty to this problem. This paper considers fracture networks as a system and the concepts of percolation theory and fractal geometry are combined to define the conductivity characteristics of such structures. Correlations between fracture network properties and network permeability are searched using the fractal dimensions (box-counting, mass, correlation dimensions) of different fracture network features (density, length, orientation, connectivity, distribution, anisotropy). The conditions of a strong relationship with different fractal characteristics and scale-dependency of correlations are addressed. The results will be useful in defining universal constants in scaling equations used to model transport processes in complex fracture network systems.

AB The paper presents a thermodynamic basis for water balance partitioning at the catchment scale, through formulation of flux-force relationships for the constituent hydrological processes, leading to the derivation of optimality conditions that satisfy the principle of Maximum Entropy Production (MEP). Application of these optimality principles at three different time scales leads to the derivation of water balance equations that mimic widely used, empirical models, i.e., Budyko-type model over long-term scale, the abcd model at monthly scale, and the SCS model at the event scale. The applicability of MEP in each case helps to draw connections between the water balances at the three different time scales, and to demonstrate a common thermodynamic basis for the otherwise empirical water balance models. In particular, it is concluded that the long time scale Budyko-type model and the event scale SCS model are both special cases of the monthly abcd model.

AB Analytic stage-discharge formulae are derived for flow in straight trapezoidal channels, based on the 2D analytic velocity distribution in open channels given by Shiono and Knight [Shiono K, Knight DW, Turbulent open-channel flows with variable depth across the channel. J Fluid Mech 1991;222:617-46]. A simple hand-calculation method is provided. Legendre incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds and a binomial series expansion are used in the derivation of these analytic formulae, together with physically based hydraulic parameters, such as local friction factor (f), dimensionless eddy viscosity (lambda) and secondary flow (Gamma). The stage-discharge results obtained from the formulae are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data, as are the corresponding analytic velocity and boundary shear stress distributions. The influences f, lambda and Gamma on the stage-discharge relationship are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term (>20 y) suspended sediment (SS) and particulate organic carbon (POC) records are relatively rare and yet are necessary for understanding linkages between climate, erosion and carbon export. We estimated long-term (>23 y) SS and POC yields from four nested catchments that ranged from <1 to 54 km(2) in area across the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory (RCEW-CZO) in southwestern Idaho, USA. We found strong relationships between log(10)SS and log(10)POC (R-2 = 0.38-0.86) that varied across catchments but remained robust across years, one dry and one of the wettest water years on record. Mean annual SS yields varied from 18 to 89 g SS m(-2) y(-1) and POC from 0.6 to 11.0 g C m(-2) y(-1) across the four catchments. Water yield explained much of the temporal variation (72%-85%) in SS and POC yields except in a small, snow-dominated headwater catchment where it explained 15%-51%. The largest five water years accounted for 69%-84% of the total SS and POC yields in catchments with 24 y records. All catchments had positive slopes (>0) for SS and POC concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships, with large catchments exhibiting greater slopes (0.66-0.97) than smaller ones (0.14-0.16). In addition, most catchments were dominated (80%) by clockwise hysteretic curves. Lack of seasonal exhaustion in the SS-POC relationships, positive C-Q and clockwise relations indicated that these systems were transport-rather than supply limited, and that sediment and POC appeared to be sourced from channel/bank erosion and remobilization. POC yields represent 1%-10% of mean water year net ecosystem exchange depending on elevation; lower elevation catchments may shift from being carbon sinks to sources after accounting for fluvial POC export associated with changes in climate.

AB Forecasts of hydroclimatic variables and incorporation of their error bounds are invaluable in water resources planning and operations under uncertainty; In this study, regional long-term operational hydrologic forecast models conditioned on climatic precursor are presented. The forecasts also include uncertainty intervals and confidence limits. The forecasts are based on the temporal and spatial variability of hydrometeorologic anomalies and their relationships with climatic interannual and intraseasonal El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The forecast skills of the proposed model, which incorporates ENSO forecasts on tropical rainfall and streamflow, are compared with those that are unconditional and do not incorporate ENSO. Significantly improved skills are achieved by incorporating forecasted ENSO indices and their errors. The seasonal variability of the forecast model skills are also evaluated. These ENSO-based forecasts of regional and seasonal-to-interannual hydrometeorologic variables consistently merged with systematic error analysis can provide outputs for direct use in water resources planning and operation under uncertainty.

AB This paper describes a novel approach to river flood prediction using Time Series Data Mining which combines chaos theory and data mining to characterize and predict events in complex, nonperiodic and chaotic time series. Geophysical phenomena, including earthquakes, floods and rainfall, represent a class of nonlinear systems termed chaotic, in which the relationships between variables in a system are dynamic and disproportionate, however completely deterministic. Chaos theory provides a structured explanation for irregular behavior and anomalies in systems that are not inherently stochastic. While nonlinear approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Nonlinear Prediction are useful in forecasting of daily discharge values in a river, the focus of these approaches is on forecasting magnitudes of future discharge values rather than the prediction of floods. The described Time Series Data Mining methodology focuses on the prediction of events where floods constitute the events in a river daily discharge time series. The methodology is demonstrated using data collected at the St. Louis gauging station located on the Mississippi River in the USA. Results associated with the impact of earliness of prediction and the acceptable risk-Level. vs. prediction accuracy are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fluid flow environment associated with high Glossosoma abundance is predicted by large-eddy simulation of a natural turbulent open-channel flow. The spatial distribution of Glossosoma was depicted by high resolution physical variables described by fluid flow and streambed topography. Variogram analysis of the streambed topography revealed a characteristic length scale of the streambed of the order 0.2 m over which bed roughness height was correlated. Flow simulation output was spatially and temporally averaged over the streambed characteristic length scale and linked to Glossosoma spatial density. A dimensionless scaling relationship between Glossosoma spatial distribution and streamwise velocity averaged in the longitudinal and transverse direction, spatial velocity fluctuation, and spanwise vorticity from the computational fluid dynamics simulation output explained 79% of the variation in observed dimensionless Glossosoma spatial density. The analysis demonstrated that computational fluid mechanics and high resolution bed topography could be instrumental in predicting benthic macroinvertebrate spatial distribution in streams and rivers.

AB Hysteresis in the relationship between suspended sediment concentration and flow during run-off events is commonly used to inform on sediment sources and hydrological pathways. Less attention, however, has been paid to comparing the water and sediment hydrographs, which provide a more direct appreciation of in-event sediment dynamics and their relationship with the upstream catchment characteristics. The aim of this study is to better understand the catchment and hydrological controls on the phasing of water and sediment discharges during events and, in particular, to explore what controls sediment concentrations late on event recessions. Continuous records of flow and turbidity data (calibrated to suspended sediment concentration) were collected from 17 catchments across New Zealand for this purpose. Relationships between event sediment yield and peak flow showed, as anticipated, higher event sediment loads were generated in pasture compared with forested catchments and were also higher from catchments in more erodible terrain. One novel result was that these differences were greater during smaller, more frequent events, whereas the loads from larger flood events tended to converge between pasture and forest catchments. Another novel result was that event sediment load tends to be evenly split between rising and falling stages of the hydrograph in pasture catchments, but forested catchments yield more of their event loads on flood recessions, probably because of delayed erosion or more sediment sources remote from the channel network. Land cover, distance of the sediment sources from the monitoring site, and size of the catchments control sediment concentrations late on event recession. Pasture-dominated and more erodible catchments show longer sediment recessions and therefore stay dirtier for longer time periods. In addition, the size of previous flood events appeared to control the extent of sediment exhaustion after the flood peaks in some catchments.

TI A new equation for shallow groundwater flow over a curved impermeable

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID STORAGE BOUSSINESQ MODEL
AB The flow of recharge-induced shallow groundwater over an impermeable boundary is a basic process in hillslope hydrology, which has usually been simplified by taking the boundary as having a constant slope. Previously published equations in curvilinear coordinates have been reduced here to a single equation for shallow groundwater flow over an impermeable boundary with continuous curvature, subject to conditions. The equation has been verified by comparison with a finite difference solution of the steady flow case, and with a range of experimental data from a viscous flow physical model, for both steady and transient flows. The results show that, while the bed profile affects flow depths, it has relatively little impact on the outflow hydrograph. It was found that the outflow is closely approximated by a power relationship with the volume in storage, and this leads to a simple algorithm for predicting the outflow hydrograph under conditions of variable recharge.

AB Characterization of stable isotope compositions (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of surface water and groundwater in a catchment is critical for refining moisture sources and establishing modern isotope-elevation relationships for paleoelevation reconstructions. There is no consensus on the moisture sources of precipitation in the Yellow River source region during summer season. This study presents delta H-2 and delta O-18 data from 111 water samples collected from tributaries, mainstream, lakes, and groundwater across the Yellow River source region during summertime. Measured delta O-18 values of the tributaries range from -13.5 parts per thousand to -5.8 parts per thousand with an average of -11.0 parts per thousand. Measured delta O-18 values of the groundwater samples range from -12.7 parts per thousand to -10.5 parts per thousand with an average of -11.9 parts per thousand. The delta O-18 data of tributary waters display a northward increase of 1.66 parts per thousand per degree latitude. The delta O-18 data and d-excess values imply that moisture sources of the Yellow River source region during summertime are mainly from the mixing of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the Westerlies, local water recycling, and subcloud evaporation. Analysis of tributary delta O-18 data from the Yellow River source region and streamwater and precipitation delta O-18 data from its surrounding areas leads to a best-fit second-order polynomial relationship between delta O-18 and elevation over a 4,600 m elevation range. A delta O-18 elevation gradient of -1.6 parts per thousand/km is also established using these data, and the gradient is in consistence with the delta O-18 elevation gradient of north and eastern plateau. Such relationships can be used for paleoelevation reconstructions in the Yellow River source region.

AB Rivers and aquifers are, in many cases, a connected resource and as such the interactions between them need to be understood and quantified for the resource to be managed appropriately. The objective of this paper is to advance the understanding of riveraquifer interactions processes in semi-arid environments stressed by groundwater abstraction. This is performed using data from a specific catchment where records of precipitation, evapotranspiration, river flow, groundwater levels and groundwater abstraction are analysed using basic statistics, hydrograph analysis and a simple mathematical model to determine the processes causing the spatial and temporal changes in riveraquifer interactions. This combined approach provides a novel but simple methodology to analyse riveraquifer interactions, which can be applied to catchments worldwide. The analysis revealed that the groundwater levels have declined (similar to 3m) since the onset of groundwater abstraction. The decline is predominantly due to the abstraction rather than climatic changes (r=0.84 for the relationship between groundwater abstraction and groundwater levels; r=0.92 for the relationship between decline in groundwater levels and magnitude of seasonal drawdown). It is then demonstrated that, since the onset of abstraction, the river has changed from being gaining to losing during low-flow periods, defined as periods with flow less than 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5GL/day (1GL/day=1x106m3/day). If defined as<1.0GL/day, low-flow periods constitute approximately 65% of the river flows; the periods where the river is losing at low-flow conditions are thus significant. Importantly, there was a significant delay (>10 years) between the onset of groundwater abstraction and the changeover from gaining to losing conditions. Finally, a relationship between the groundwater gradient towards the river and the river flow at low-flow is demonstrated. The results have important implications for water management as well as water ecology and quality. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID FREQUENCY; PO; MAGNITUDE; PATTERNS; TRENDS
AB Several studies have found that the frequency, magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution of droughts and floods have significantly increased in many regions of the world. Yet, most of the methods used in detecting trends in hydrological extremes 1) focus on either floods or droughts, and/or 2) base their assessment on characteristics that, even though useful for trend identification, cannot be directly used in decision making, e.g. integrated water resources management and disaster risk reduction. In this paper, we first discuss the need for a consistent approach to assess changes on both floods and droughts, and then propose a method based on the theory of runs and threshold levels. Flood and drought changes were assessed in terms of frequency, length and surplus/deficit volumes. This paper also presents an example application using streamflow data from two hydrometric stations along the Po River basin (Italy), Piacenza and Pontelagoscuro, and then discuss opportunities and challenges of the proposed method.

AB Our understanding of hillslope subsurface flow relies on assumptions about how storm characteristics affect the hillslope runoff response. Experiments in hillslopes dominated by preferential flow features often show that runoff is dynamic and is affected by antecedent conditions, rainfall conditions, and position of the slope. We applied tracers to a hillslope under natural and steady state flow boundary conditions to determine the relationship between lateral tracer velocities and various hillslope lengths and storm indicators. Tracer velocities were similar to the fastest velocities measured in other similar experiments. The velocities were dependent on the boundary conditions and slope length, and the subsurface flow velocity was most closely related to the 1-h rainfall intensity. Unlike some studies, there was little correlation between our measured flow velocities and storm volume or antecedent conditions. We attributed this to the hillslope characteristics and the relatively consistent wet antecedent conditions during the experiments. This experiment showed that the connectivity of the hillslope preferential flow network is an important factor governing the average subsurface flow velocity.

AB This study presents a new algorithm for parallel computation of river flow that builds on recent work demonstrating the relative independence of distant river reaches in the update step of the Muskingum method. The algorithm is designed to achieve enhanced fixed-size parallel speedup and uses a mathematical approximation applied at the boundaries of large subbasins. In order to use such an algorithm, a balanced domain decomposition method that differs from the traditional classifications of river reaches and subbasins and based on network topology is developed. An application of the algorithm and domain decomposition method to the Mississippi River Basin results in an eightfold decrease in computing time with 16 computing cores which is unprecedented for Muskingum-type algorithms applied in classic parallel-computing paradigms having a one-to-one relationship between cores and subbasins. An estimated 300 km between upstream and downstream reaches of subbasins guarantees the applicability of the algorithm in our study and motivates further investigation of domain decomposition methods.

AB In humid upland catchments wetlands are often a prominent feature in the vicinity of streams and have potential implications for runoff generation and nutrient export. Wetland surfaces are often characterized by distinct micro-topography (hollows and hummocks). The effects of such micro-topography on surface-subsurface exchange and runoff generation for a 10 by 20 m synthetic section of a riparian wetland were investigated in a virtual modeling experiment. A reference model with a planar surface was run for comparison. The geostatistically simulated structure of the micro-topography replicates the topography of a peat-forming riparian wetland in a small mountainous catchment in South-East Germany (Lehstenbach). Flow was modeled with the fully-integrated surface-subsurface code HydroGeoSphere. Simulation results showed that the specific structure of the wetland surface resulted in distinct shifts between surface and subsurface flow dominance. Surface depressions filled and started to drain via connected channel networks in a threshold controlled process, when groundwater levels intersected the land surface. These networks expanded and shrunk in a spill and fill mechanism when the shallow water table fluctuated around the mean surface elevation under variable rainfall inputs. The micro-topography efficiently buffered rainfall inputs and produced a hydrograph that was characterized by subsurface flow during most of the year and only temporarily shifted to surface flow dominance (>80% of total discharge) during intense rainstorms. In contrast the hydrograph in the planar reference model was much "flashier" and more controlled by surface runoff. A non-linear, hysteretic relationship between groundwater level and discharge observed at the study site was reproduced with the micro-topography model. Hysteresis was also observed in the relationship between surface water storage and discharge, but over a relatively narrow range of surface water storage values. Therefore it was concluded that surface water storage was a better predictor for the occurrence of surface runoff than groundwater levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dendroclimatological data were used to reconstruct the discharge history of Chilko River, which drains a glacierized watershed in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. We correlated ring-width records from Engelmann spruce (ES) (Picea engelmanni) and mountain hemlock (MH) (Tsuga mertensiana) trees to historical hydroclimate data. Over the period of record, spruce and hemlock radial growth correlates significantly with temperature and snow depth, respectively. We found that a multi-species approach provided a better model fit and reconstructive power. Using these relationships, we developed generalized linear models for mean June, July, and June-July discharge. The proxy records provide insights into streamflow variability of a typical Coast Mountains river over the past 240 years and confirm the long-term influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on hydroclimatic regimes in the region. A relationship also exists between the reconstructed June-July discharge record and the North Pacific (NP) Index, suggesting that winter atmospheric patterns over the North Pacific influence the hydrology of coastal British Columbia.

AB An analytical model is developed to evaluate mixing induced by natural convection in a fluid-saturated porous medium. First, the velocity and concentration fields are decoupled to generate a steady state velocity field and initiate a naturally convective system. In order to decouple the velocity and concentration fields, a steady thermal natural convection is established by imposing a destabilizing vertical temperature gradient across a porous layer and then introducing a passive tracer into the system. Based on the steady velocity field, effective longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are evaluated using the shear flow dispersion theory, and convective mixing of the passive tracer is obtained using the developed analytical mixing model. The estimated dispersion coefficients and convective mixing are then characterized by the system Rayleigh and Sherwood numbers. The mixing obtained by the analytical model is then compared with high-resolution numerical simulations. The results reveal that the simple analytical solution represents the nonlinear mixing involved in such a system and agrees with the numerical results. The developed model has potential applications in geophysical and geothermal buoyancy-driven flows.

However, most reported applications have been calibrated to homogeneous soils in a laboratory, while inexpensive efficient in situ calibration procedures useful in heterogeneous soils are lacking. Here we employed the Hydrus 2-D/3-D code to define a soil-specific calibration curve. We define a 2-D geometry of the fiber optic cable and the surrounding soil media, and simulate heat pulses to capture the soil thermal response at different soil water contents. The model was validated in an irrigated field using DTS data from two locations along the FO deployment in which reference moisture sensors were installed. Results indicate that u was measured with the model-based calibration with accuracy better than 0.022 m(3) m(-3).

AB This paper presents a vision that advocates hydropedology as an advantageous integration of pedology and hydrology for studying the intimate relationships between soil, landscape, and hydrology. Landscape water flux is suggested as a unifying precept for hydropedology, through which pedologic and hydrologic expertise can be better integrated. Landscape water flux here encompasses the source, storage, flux, pathway, residence time, availability, and spatiotemporal distribution of water in the root and deep vadose zones within the landscape. After illustrating multiple knowledge gaps that can be addressed by the synergistic integration of pedology and hydrology, we suggest five scientific hypotheses that are critical to advancing hydropedology and enhancing the prediction of landscape water flux. We then present interlinked strategies for achieving the stated vision. It is our hope that by working together, hydrologists and pedologists, along with scientists in related disciplines, can better guide data acquisition, knowledge integration, and model-based prediction so as to advance the hydrologic sciences in the next decade and beyond.

TI Self-organizing maps with multiple input-output option for modeling the
   Richards equation and its inverse solution
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB [ 1] Inverse solutions of the Richards equation, either for evaluating soil hydraulic parameters from experimental data or for optimizing irrigation parameters, require considerable numerical effort. We present an alternative methodology based on self-organizing maps (SOM) which was further developed in order to include multiple input-output (MIO) relationships. The resulting SOM-MIO network approximates the Richards equation and its inverse solution with an outstanding accuracy, and both tasks can be performed by the same network. No additional training is required for solving the different tasks, which represents a significant advantage over conventional networks. An application of the SOM-MIO simulating a laboratory irrigation experiment in a Monte Carlo - based framework shows a much improved computational efficiency compared to the used numerical simulation model. The high consistency of the results predicted by the artificial neural network and by the numerical model demonstrates the excellent suitability of the SOM-MIO for dealing with such kinds of stochastic simulation or for solving inverse problems.

AB The relation between the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties and effective asymptotic transport is studied for microscopically heterogeneous but macroscopically homogeneous unsaturated media with steady flow. Heterogeneity is described by the scaling of the hydraulic functions theta(psi(m)) and K(theta). The study is based on an analytical approximation of asymptotic dispersivity under the assumption that matric potential is spatially constant. For the special case of a water-saturated medium the result of the stochastic continuum theory is recovered. When applied to several published numerical simulations, the approximated asymptotic dispersivities are found to agree well with the numerical values. By exploring the heterogeneous media for various hydraulic states, the approximation resolves some apparent inconsistencies found in the simulations. The cases considered span the entire range from perfect to zero correlation between scaling factors of matric potential and hydraulic conductivity. It is demonstrated that this correlation is crucial for the behavior of asymptotic dispersivity with changing flow rate. Since weak to moderate correlations are often found in soils, this result has significant implications for solute transport through heterogeneous soils.

AB In this paper a semi-analytical approach is proposed to understand the mechanism by which a non-uniform vegetated flow passes over a finite thick soil layer covered with grass. The flow region is divided into three layers: a homogenous water layer, a mixed water-grass layer, and a finite thick soil layer (hereafter referred to as the water layer, the grass layer, and the soil layer). The flow of the water layer is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Both the grass and soil layers are regarded as porous media and the Biot's theory of poroelasticity is applied to the porous medium flow. The semi-closed solutions are then obtained by the Runge-Kutta method. The drag force induced by the flow through the grass layer and the flow profiles of three patterns: submerged grass, emergent grass and mixed type are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present results from laboratory experiments on flow through submerged arrays of rigid cylinders embedded in a sandy bed. Using rigid, cylindrical elements to mimic vegetation and benthos, we account for only the physical effects resulting from their presence, eliminating biological factors, such as biofilms and root systems. In line with previous findings, rigid arrays modify the flow mean and turbulent velocity statistics. However, even if the flow speed is significantly damped within dense arrays, the amount of sediment that gets lifted into suspension increases as the density of the array increases due to array- and cylinder-scale turbulence. We present a first attempt to provide predictive relationships of suspended sediment concentration using an alternative approach for the Shields parameter with an empirical coefficient to account for turbulence generated by submerged arrays of rigid cylinders. A similar analysis, using a ratio of populated to non-populated Shields parameter, is conducted to predict resuspension as a function of array density. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new generation large-eddy simulation (LES), based on a Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic subgrid model, is applied to neutral atmospheric flow over heterogeneous land surfaces. This LES is faithful to the physics of the interaction of the lower atmosphere and the land surface based on classical validation tests of the simulated mean wind profile and the atmospheric turbulence. Simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over heterogeneous land surfaces with a range of characteristic lengths and surface roughness values are performed, each simulated surface consisting of equal-size stripes of different roughness. The simulated mean wind profiles are analyzed to identify the height of the blending layer and used to develop a relationship between blending layer height and characteristic surface length scales. For hydrologic and atmospheric applications where the regional-scale surface roughness needs to be known, the analysis is extended to derive an effective surface roughness knowing local surface patch roughness values.

AB Proglacial fields typically have complex topography and heterogeneous sediments, resulting in highly variable flow and temperature regimes in surface runoff and groundwater. Using data from the Damma glacier forefield (Switzerland), we examined how longitudinal stream temperature changes can be used to infer reach-averaged hydrological and thermal processes in proglacial riparian zones. A simple energy balance showed that (1) radiative forcing and frictional warming largely explained the observed temperature patterns in three stream reaches, and that (2) groundwater inflow and/or hyporheic exchange appear to influence stream warming along a fourth reach. Daytime stream warming depends on channel width, and here we show that stream temperature measurements can be used to infer reach-averaged hydraulic geometry relationships between stream width and discharge, which are normally difficult to obtain by other methods in braided gravel bed streams. Our results illustrate how proglacial stream temperatures can yield spatially integrated information about hydrological and thermal processes in glacial forefields, where extreme spatial heterogeneity makes conventional methods difficult to apply.

AB Seven high-altitude headwater catchments were studied from 1990 to 1994 to evaluate susceptibility to episodic acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) depression. Dilution (decreasing base cation concentrations) was the primary factor in ANC depression during snowmelt, accounting for 75 to 97% of the ANC reduction. In lakes where acidification (increasing anion concentrations) was noted, nitrate and sulfate were equally important during the first half of snowmelt, while sulfate dominated the latter half. A linear model, based on the relationship between minimum and fall-overturn ANC for the lakes in our study, estimated that none of the 114 lakes sampled during the 1985 EPA Western Lakes Survey had been episodically acidified (ANC < 0). Modifications of the model were used to predict that approximately 6 and 10% of Sierran lakes will become episodically acidified with increases in nitrate and sulfate deposition of 50 and 150%, respectively. No lakes will be chronically acidified with these depositional increases.

TI FITTING A GROUNDWATER CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT MODEL BY L1 AND L2 PARAMETER

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

DT Article
DE GROUNDWATER; CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; PARAMETER ESTIMATION
AB This paper presents a study on the use of linear and nonlinear L1-norm parameter estimators to fit an analytical groundwater contaminant transport model with nonuniform contaminant source distributions. The model solution is obtained as a superposition of an analytical solution developed by Cleary (Cleary, R.W., Analytical Models for Groundwater Pollution and Hydrology, 208 Long Island Groundwater Pollution Study, draft report, vol. 3, Princeton University, NJ, 1978). Comparisons with the commonly used linear and nonlinear L2-norm estimators are conducted. The posterior statistical inference theory by Nyquist (Nyquist, H., Commun.Statist.- Theor. Meth., 1983, 12, 2511-24) and Gonin and Money (Gonin, G. & Money, A.H., Commun. Statist. Theor. Meth., 1985, 14, 827-40) is used to provide the posterior covariance matrix and the probability distribution for the unknown parameter vector. As the conclusion, it is suggested that in view of the nature of groundwater contaminant transport modeling, L1-norm estimators may be preferred as robust alternatives to L2-norm estimators in solving parameter estimation problems.

AB This paper describes an application of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in which streamflow observations are used to update states in a distributed hydrological model. We demonstrate that the standard implementation of the EnKF is inappropriate because of non-linear relationships between model states and observations. Transforming streamflow into log space before computing error covariances improves filter performance. We also demonstrate that model simulations improve when we use a variant of the EnKF that does not require perturbed observations. Our attempt to propagate information to neighbouring basins was unsuccessful, largely due to inadequacies in modelling the spatial variability of hydrological processes. New methods are needed to produce ensemble simulations that both reflect total model error and adequately simulate the spatial variability of hydrological states and fluxes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Automated Thiessen polygon generation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
AB Data uncertainty research of rain gauge network requires generation of large numbers of Thiessen polygons. Despite its importance in hydrology, few studies on computational Thiessen polygons have been carried out, and there is little published information in the hydrological literature. This paper describes two automated approaches and the ways for their implementation in hydrological applications: triangulation method and grid method. Triangulation is a lossless method but suffers from complications in coding and slow computational speed with small numbers of gauges. Grid method is easy to implement, but a compromise must be made between the computational grid size, accuracy, and speed. This paper describes a procedure to derive the relationship between the catchment area, grid size, and accuracy indicator based on weighted mean error. The computational speed comparison between the two methods has been found to follow a logarithm curve, and the critical number of gauges could be found from this curve for deciding the method choice if the computational speed is the limiting factor in a project.

AB One-dimensional uniform flow in homogeneous porous media was experimentally investigated. Head drop experiments were conducted in four test tubes with cubic arrays of spheres in diameter 3 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The experimental results indicate that Darcy's law should be an approximate expression by neglecting the inertial term for flow at low velocity. Nonlinearity is attributed to inertial term in porous medium before the turbulent flow emerges. Forchheimer equation with constant coefficients can well predict the flow in porous medium. The relationship between the diameter of the particles and the coefficients a and b in the equations were verified. Different Ergun type equations were used to predict the head drop and compared to the experimental data. It shows that the Irmay equation could well predict the fluid flow in cubic arrays of spheres, while the prediction of head drop by Ergun equation was much higher than observed data. It indicates that the coefficients alpha and beta in the Ergun type equations have certain relations with porosity or the pore structure and would vary for different medium. The discontinuity observed was interpreted by transition from steady flow to weakly turbulence and compared with previous studies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The forward Fractional Advection Dispersion Equation (FADE) provides a useful model for non-Fickian transport in heterogeneous porous media. The space FADE captures the long leading tail, skewness, and fast spreading typically seen in concentration profiles from field data. This paper develops the corresponding backward FADE model, to identify source location and release time. The backward method is developed from the theory of inverse problems, and then explained from a stochastic point of view. The resultant backward FADE differs significantly from the traditional backward Advection Dispersion Equation (ADE) because the fractional derivative is not self-adjoint and the probability density function for backward locations is highly skewed. Finally, the method is validated using tracer data from a well-known field experiment, where the peak of the backward FADE curve predicts source release time, while the median or a range of percentiles can be used to determine the most likely source location for the observed plume. The backward ADE cannot reliably identify the source in this application, since the forward ADE does not provide an adequate fit to the concentration data.

AB The snow cover in the Alps is heavily affected by climate change. Recent data show that at altitudes below 1200 In a.s.l. a time-continuous winter snow cover is becoming all exception rather than the rule. This would also change the timing and characteristics of river discharge in Alpine catchments. We present an assessment of future snow and runoff in two Alpine catchments, the larger Inn catchment (1945 km(2)) and the smaller Dischma catchment (43 km(2)), based on two common climate change scenario (IPCC A2 and B2 (IPCC, 2007)). [etc]. The changes in snow cover and discharge are predicted using Alpine3D, it model for the high-resolution simulation of Alpine surface processes, in particular snow, soil and vegetation processes. The predicted changes in snow and discharge are extreme. While the current climate still Supports permanent snow and ice on the highest peaks at altitudes above 3000 in a.s.l., this zone Would disappear under the future climate scenarios. The changes in snow cover could be summarized by approximately shifting the elevation zones down by 900 in. The corresponding changes in discharge are also severe: while the current climate scenario shows a significant contribution from snow melt until middle to late summer, the future climate scenarios Would feature it much narrower snow melt discharge peak ill spring. A further observation is that heavy precipitation events in the fall would change from mainly snow to mainly rain and would have a higher probability of producing flooding. Future work is needed to quantify the effect of model uncertainties on such predictions. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
ID COMPLEX HILLSLOPES; DIFFUSION; MODEL; FLOW
AB The linearized hillslope Boussinesq equation, introduced by Brutsaert (1994), describes the dynamics of saturated, subsurface flow from hillslopes with shallow, unconfined aquifers. In this paper, we use a new analytical technique to solve the linearized hillslope Boussinesq equation to predict water table dynamics and hillslope discharge to channels. The new solutions extend previous analytical treatments of the linearized hillslope Boussinesq equation to account for the impact of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in water table recharge. The results indicate that the spatial character of recharge may significantly alter both steady state subsurface storage characteristics and the transient hillslope hydrologic response, depending strongly on similarity measures of controls on the subsurface flow dynamics. Additionally, we derive new analytical solutions for the linearized hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation and explore the interaction effects of recharge structure and hillslope morphology on water storage and base flow recession characteristics. A theoretical recession analysis, for example, demonstrates that decreasing the relative amount of downslope recharge has a similar effect as increasing hillslope convergence. In general, the theory suggests that recharge heterogeneity can serve to diminish or enhance the hydrologic impacts of hillslope morphology.

AB Cascade reservoirs are complex engineering systems. The operation of these reservoirs is not only affected by external effects such as natural flow conditions but is also related to the state of the reservoir project, the operating rules of the reservoirs and the operating mode of the discharge facilities. The realization of refined simulations that can consider various natural and engineering factors is of great significance to improve the reservoir management level. As a method to study the dynamic behavior of complex systems, system dynamics (SD) simulation models have the potential to realize the refined simulation of cascade reservoirs. However, when the SD model is controlled by deterministic rules, the various functional objectives of reservoirs cannot be weighed and emergent scenarios cannot be addressed. In this paper, a mechanical-artificial intelligence (AI) coupling modeling paradigm is proposed, in which the AI algorithm is used to extract adaptive operating rules, and the SD method is used to refined simulate the operations of cascade reservoirs, and the mechanism model and the AI algorithm are coupled to build the cascade reservoir adaptive refined (CRAR) simulation model. The example application shows that the proposed model can be used to effectively reflect the dynamic change in system operations and realize the refined simulation of system operations and adaptive scheduling decisions under various conditions. From this study, a new idea and a reference for the simulation of cascade reservoir operations are provided.

AB Control of coupled hydrology and pollutant transport from urban areas generally specify a runoff (or rainfall) depth for treatment. Incarnations of such coupled transport and control. include the "first flush" and recent, albeit similar, "water quality volume" (WQV) concepts. For a century the first flush, a mass limited behavior, has been held as the singular transport phenomena for urban areas. In contrast, this study hypothesizes that load transport can have two classifications; mass or flow Limited for pollutant phases (dissolved and particulate). Recognition, quantification, and differentiation of two limiting behaviors and phases, is less common. Differentiation is defined physically (exponential or linear); and examined statistically (logistical regression, discriminant analysis); deriving load transport rules using only calibrated hydrologic parameters. The study is supported by 28 Baton Rouge and 14 Cincinnati events; both urban, paved source areas. Once calibrated with pollutant data, statistical approaches for such rules provide promise for transport differentiation based on more economical hydrologic data. Results demonstrate load transport from source areas can be differentiated into mass or flow Limited behavior. Results also indicate that within a given event, pollutant phases exhibit differing transport. With hydrologic and chemical pollutant phase transport data, calibrated event-based differentiation rules can be combined with continuous simulations in tools such as SWMM. Such a combination allows time series differentiation of load transport behavior and unit operation volumetric requirements for urban source areas. (C) 2008 Etsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decades of research has concluded that the percent of impervious surface cover in a watershed is strongly linked to negative impacts on urban stream health. Recently, there has been a push by municipalities to offset these effects by installing structural stormwater control measures (SCMs), which are landscape features designed to retain and reduce runoff to mitigate the effects of urbanisation on event hydrology. The goal of this study is to build generalisable relationships between the level of SCM implementation in urban watersheds and resulting changes to hydrology. A literature review of 185 peer-reviewed studies of watershed-scale SCM implementation across the globe was used to identify 52 modelling studies suitable for a meta-analysis to build statistical relationships between SCM implementation and hydrologic change. Hydrologic change is quantified as the percent reduction in storm event runoff volume and peak flow between a watershed with SCMs relative to a (near) identical control watershed without SCMs. Results show that for each additional 1% of SCM-mitigated impervious area in a watershed, there is an additional 0.43% reduction in runoff and a 0.60% reduction in peak flow. Values of SCM implementation required to produce a change in water quantity metrics were identified at varying levels of probability. For example, there is a 90% probability (high confidence) of at least a 1% reduction in peak flow with mitigation of 33% of impervious surfaces. However, as the reduction target increases or mitigated impervious surface decreases, the probability of reaching the reduction target also decreases. These relationships can be used by managers to plan SCM implementation at the watershed scale.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB In a recent article in this journal, Luby, Polasky, and Swackhamer come to the provocative conclusion that urban water prices in the United States are "cheaper when drier." They also argue that utilities fail to provide affordable water and that they charge less for "additional" use compared to "essential" use. We challenge these claims. While the authors correctly point out the many challenges that utilities face in supplying affordable water while meeting conservation and revenue goals, there are serious flaws in their measures of price, scarcity, and affordability. These measurement problems lead the authors to incorrect conclusions about water pricing in the United States. Using improved measures of price and water scarcity, we find little statistical relationship between the marginal price of water/sewer services and scarcity. Our findings cast doubt on Luby et al.'s findings and point to important avenues for future research.

AB As a critical water discharge term in basin-scale water balance, accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is therefore important for sustainable water resources management. The understanding of the relationship between ET and groundwater storage change can improve our knowledge on the hydrological cycle in such regions with intensive agricultural land usage. Since the 1960s, the North China Plain (NCP) has experienced groundwater depletion because of overexploitation of groundwater for agriculture and urban development. Using meteorological data from 23 stations, the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration model is evaluated against estimates of ET derived from regional water balance in the NCP during the period 1993-2008. The discrepancies between calculated ET and that derived by basin water balance indicate seasonal and interannual variations in model parameters. The monthly actual ET variations during the period from 1960 to 2008 are investigated by the calibrated model and then are used to derive groundwater storage change. The estimated actual ET is positively correlated with precipitation, and the general higher ET than precipitation indicates the contributions of groundwater irrigation to the total water supply. The long term decreasing trend in the actual ET can be explained by declining in precipitation, sunshine duration and wind speed. Over the past similar to 50years, the calculated average annual water storage change, represented by the difference between actual ET and precipitation, was approximately 36mm, or 4.8km(3); and the cumulative groundwater storage depletion was approximately 1700mm, or 220km(3) in the NCP. The significantly groundwater storage depletion conversely affects the seasonal and interannual variations of ET. Irrigation especially during spring cause a marked increase in seasonal ET, whereas the rapid increasing of agricultural coverage over the NCP reduces the annual ET and is the primary control factor of the strong linear relationship between actual and potential ET.

AB Multiple-point geostatistics is a general statistical framework to model spatial fields displaying a wide range of complex structures. In particular, it allows controlling connectivity patterns that have a critical importance for groundwater flow and transport problems. This approach involves considering data events (spatial arrangements of values) derived from a training image (TI). All data events found in the TI are usually stored in a database, which is used to retrieve conditional probabilities for the simulation. Instead, we propose to sample directly the training image for a given data event, making the database unnecessary. Our method is statistically equivalent to previous implementations, but in addition it allows extending the application of multiple-point geostatistics to continuous variables and to multivariate problems. The method can be used for the simulation of geological heterogeneity, accounting or not for indirect observations such as geophysics. We show its applicability in the presence of complex features, nonlinear relationships between variables, and with various cases of nonstationarity. Computationally, it is fast, easy to parallelize, parsimonious in memory needs, and straightforward to implement.

TI Improving runoff risk estimates: Formulating runoff as a bivariate
   process using the SCS curve number method
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MOISTURE CONDITION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RAINFALL
AB The Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method is widely used to predict storm runoff for hydraulic design purposes, such as sizing culverts and detention basins. As traditionally used, the probability of calculated runoff is equated to the probability of the causative rainfall event, an assumption that fails to account for the influence of variations in soil moisture on runoff generation. We propose a modification to the SCS-CN method that explicitly incorporates rainfall return periods and the frequency of different soil moisture states to quantify storm runoff risks. Soil moisture status is assumed to be correlated to stream base flow. Fundamentally, this approach treats runoff as the outcome of a bivariate process instead of dictating a 1:1 relationship between causative rainfall and resulting runoff volumes. Using data from the Fall Creek watershed in western New York and the headwaters of the French Broad River in the mountains of North Carolina, we show that our modified SCS-CN method improves frequency discharge predictions in medium-sized watersheds in the eastern United States in comparison to the traditional application of the method.

ID WATER; FLUCTUATIONS
AB The ultimate specific yield, i.e. the specific yield under steady-state condition, is generally dependent on the water table depth in the shallow groundwater systems. This paper presents a new expression to describe this relationship. The expression is based on the relationship between soil water content-soil depths below ground surface near the saturation zone, i.e. water content profile, which can be fitted by the van Genuchten model. Because this model is highly nonlinear, a Taylor series expansion was used to solve the integral equation for specific yield in our study. The new expression was verified by a drainage experiment, and the results demonstrated that the new expression is reliable for eolian sand when the range of water table fluctuation is less than 30cm. The expression is easily applicable because knowledge of the water content profile near the saturation zone is the only requirement. Compared with the expression obtained from the Brooks-Corey model, the new expression can be used for a variety of aquifer and soil media. The improved accuracy of the specific yield provides a better estimate of discharge rates in shallow groundwater systems with water table fluctuations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We study a thermohaline system in which the density gradients arise from salinity and temperature differences. Such systems arise in e.g. geological waste storage and geothermal energy exploitation. A sedimentary-basin set-up is investigated where salinity and temperature increase with depth. In such systems, the buoyancy forces caused by salinity and temperature gradients give rise to counter-acting convection cells. The homogenization theory ideas from Held et al. (2005) [1] are applied to the solute and heat transport equations and the two resulting cell problems solved with the coupling between the heat and solute transport preserved. A dimensionless number whose sign changes to negative when thermal-convection is predominant is derived from the solutions to the cell problems in terms of physical variables. The number is tested against numerical simulations performed with the software package d(3)f on sufficiently refined grids that deliver stable numerical solutions without upwind techniques.

AB The elevated arsenic (As) content of groundwater from wells across Bangladesh and several other South Asian countries is estimated to slowly poison at least 100 million people. The heterogeneous distribution of dissolved arsenic in the subsurface complicates understanding of its release from the sediment matrix into the groundwater, as well as the design of mitigation strategies. Using the tritium-helium (H-3/He-3) groundwater dating technique, we show that there is a linear correlation between groundwater age at depths <20 m and dissolved As concentration, with an average slope of 19 mu g L-1 yr(-1) (monitoring wells only). We propose that either the kinetics of As mobilization or the removal of As by groundwater flushing is the mechanism underlying this relationship. In either case, the spatial variability of As concentrations in the top 20 m of the shallow aquifers can to a large extent be attributed to groundwater age controlled by the hydrogeological heterogeneity in the local groundwater flow system.

AB Water and pollutant fluxes from combined sewer overflows (CSO) have a significant impact on receiving waters. The random nature of rainfall forcing dominates the variability of sewer discharges, pollutant loads, and concentrations. An analytical model developed here shows how sewer network topology and rainfall properties variously impact the stochasticity of CSO functioning. Probability distributions of sewer discharge and concentration compare well with the results from a calibrated Storm Water Management Model in an application to a sewershed located in Dresden, Germany. The model is determined by only four parameters, three of which can be predicted a priori, two from the rainfall record and one from the network topology using geomorphological flow recession theory, while the fourth can be estimated from a short discharge time series. The sensitivity of CSO and wastewater treatment loads to network structure suggests simple topologies may be more vulnerable to poor performance. The analytical model is useful for evaluating various CSO management strategies to reduce adverse impacts on receiving waters in a probabilistic setting.

AB Motivated by field measurements of aquifer hydraulic conductivity ( K), recent techniques were developed to construct anisotropic fractal random fields in which the scaling, or self-similarity parameter, varies with direction and is defined by a matrix. Ensemble numerical results are analyzed for solute transport through these two-dimensional "operator-scaling" fractional Brownian motion ln(K) fields. Both the longitudinal and transverse Hurst coefficients, as well as the "radius of isotropy" are important to both plume growth rates and the timing and duration of breakthrough. It is possible to create operator-scaling fractional Brownian motion fields that have more "continuity" or stratification in the direction of transport. The effects on a conservative solute plume are continually faster-than-Fickian growth rates, highly non-Gaussian shapes, and a heavier tail early in the breakthrough curve. Contrary to some analytic stochastic theories for monofractal K fields, the plume growth rates never exceed A. Mercado's (1967) purely stratified aquifer growth rate of plume apparent dispersivity proportional to mean distance. Apparent superstratified growth must be the result of other demonstrable factors, such as initial plume size.

AB Evaluating the flow paths that contribute to solute flux in stream networks can lead to greater understanding of the linkages between biogeochemistry and hydrology. We compared the contributions of groundwater in spring brooks and in seepage through the streambed to nitrate flux in the Emmons Creek network in the Wisconsin sand plains. We predicted that spring brooks would contribute disproportionately to nitrate flux due to the presumed higher advection rates in springs and less opportunity for nitrate removal relative to seeps. Nitrate flux was measured in 15 spring brooks that entered Emmons Creek. Nitrate flux from seepage was measured at the locations of 30 piezometers, based on Darcy's Law, and by a reach-scale injection of Rhodamine water tracing (RWT). When seepage discharge was estimated from the RWT release, groundwater inputs from seepage and springs accounted for the discharge gain in the Emmons Creek channel. Springs brooks and seepage (based on the RWT release) contributed 37% and 63%, respectively, to nitrate flux inputs in the study reach. Contrary to our prediction, seeps contributed disproportionately to nitrate flux relative to their discharge. Relatively high rates of seepage discharge and higher than anticipated nitrate concentrations in the shallow pore water at seepage locations contributed to the unanticipated result.

In order to develop an improved Understanding of the potential for tine sediment to settle out Of suspension or undergo transport by hydraulic processes. it is important to examine the role of particle structure in detail. In this study, stepwise regression was used to identify which structural properties of particles exert an important control on fine sediment behaviour in river systems. The presence of composite particles and then associated particle size. Porosity and fractal dimension were shown to be the most important controls oil settling potential. Composite particles that form in the aquatic environment (flocs) were shown to have significantly different form and behaviour form composite particles of terrestrial origin (aggregates). Importantly, it was demonstrated that particle structure and bahviour exhibited consistencies between contrasting river catchments in different locations. All Understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of composite particles is viewed as providing a valuable input to efforts to model the mobilisation. transport and fate of fine sediment.

AB Solute concentrations in streamflow typically vary systematically with stream discharge, and the resulting concentration-discharge relationships are important signatures of catchment biogeochemical processes. Solutes derived from mineral weathering often exhibit decreasing concentrations with increasing flows, suggesting dilution of a kinetically limited weathering flux by a variable flux of water. However, previous work showed that concentration-discharge relationships of weathering-derived solutes in 59 headwater catchments were much weaker than this simple dilution model would predict. Instead, catchments behaved as chemostats, with rates of solute production and/or mobilization that were nearly proportional to water fluxes, on both event and interannual timescales. Here, we re-examine these findings using data for a wider range of solutes from 2,186 catchments, ranging from similar to 10 to >1,000,000 km(2) in drainage area and spanning a wide range of lithologic and climatic settings. Concentration-discharge relationships among this much larger set of larger catchments are broadly consistent with the previously described chemostatic behaviour, at least on event and interannual timescales for weathering-derived solutes. Among these same catchments, however, site-to-site variations in mean concentrations of weathering-derived solutes exhibit strong negative correlations with long-term average precipitation and discharge, reflecting strong climatic control on long-term leaching of the critical zone. We use multiple regression of site characteristics including discharge to identify potential controls on long-term mean concentrations and find that lithologic and land cover controls are significant predictors for many analytes. The picture that emerges is one in which, on event and interannual timescales, weathering-derived stream solute concentrations are chemostatically buffered by groundwater storage and fast chemical reactions, but each catchment's chemostatic "set point" reflects site-to-site differences in climatically driven evolution of the critical zone. In contrast to these weathering products, some nutrients and particulates are often near-chemostatic across all timescales, and their long-term mean concentrations correlate more strongly with land use than climatic characteristics.

AB Hydrology and solute concentrations of two intermittent Mediterranean streams draining two nested catchments were compared. The two catchments were mainly underlain by granitic rocks and different types of sericitic schists. Only the lowland catchment had an alluvial zone and a well-developed riparian forest. The rainfall-runoff relationship and the correlation between daily flow concentrations showed that hydrological behaviour was similar at both sites during most of the year. However, reverse fluxes were detected during the wetting and drying up periods only in the stream with an alluvial zone. The intermittence in stream flow also had effects on absolute solute concentrations, temporal solute dynamics and streamwater stoichiometry. Streamwater chemistry was not affected by drainage area, except for cations produced mainly by bedrock dissolution (i.e. calcium and magnesium) that increased with increasing catchment size. Differences in the relationship among cations and anions were detected between the two streams, which could be attributed to biogeochemical processes occurring in the alluvial zone. The multivariate model used in this study showed that stoichiometry was more useful than absolute concentrations when analyzing the influence of different lithologies on streamwater chemistry. Such differences were amplified in autumn, likely due to a low hydrological connectivity between the two nested catchments. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Presently, parametric weather generators do not produce a heavy enough upper tail for the distribution of daily precipitation amount, whereas those based on resampling have inherent limitations in representing extremes. Regarding this issue, we first describe advanced statistical tools from ultimate and penultimate extreme value theory to analyze and model extremal behavior of precipitation intensity (i.e., nonzero amount), which, although interesting in their own right, are mainly used to motivate approaches to improve the treatment of extremes within a weather generator framework. To this end we propose and discuss several possible approaches, none of which resolves the problem at hand completely, but at least one of them (i.e., a hybrid technique with a gamma distribution for low to moderate intensities and a generalized Pareto distribution for high intensities) can lead to a substantial improvement. An alternative approach, based on fitting the stretched exponential (or Weibull) distribution to either all or only high intensities, is found difficult to implement in practice.

AB We present a phase field model of infiltration that explains the formation of gravity fingers during water infiltration in soil. The model is an extension of the traditional Richards equation, and it introduces a new term, a fourth-order derivative in space, but not a new parameter. We propose a scaling that links the magnitude of the new term to the relative strength of gravity-to-capillary forces already present in Richards' equation. We exploit the thermodynamic framework to design a flow potential that constrains the water saturation to be between 0 and 1, its physically admissible values. The model predicts a saturation overshoot at the wetting front, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Two-dimensional numerical simulations predict gravity fingers with the appearance and characteristics observed in visual laboratory experiments. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that there is a direct relation between saturation overshoot and the strength of the front instability. Therefore our theory supports the conjecture that saturation overshoot, a pileup of water at the wetting front, is a prerequisite for gravity fingering.

AB Understanding the influences of local hydroclimatology and two large-scale oceanic-atmospheric oscillations (i.e., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) on seasonal precipitation (P) and temperature (T) relationships for a tropical region (i.e., Florida) is the focus of this study. The warm and cool phases of AMO and ENSO are initially identified using sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The associations of SSTs and regional minimum, maximum and average surface air temperatures (SATs) with precipitation are then evaluated. The seasonal variations in P-SATs and P-SSTs associations considering AMO and ENSO phases for sites in (1) two soil temperature regimes (i.e., thermic and hyperthermic); (2) urban and non-urban regions; and (3) regions with and without water bodies, are analysed using two monthly datasets. The analyses are carried out using trend tests, two association measures, nonparametric and parametric statistical hypothesis tests and kernel density estimates. Decreasing (increasing) trend in precipitation (SATs) is noted in the recent multi-decadal period (1985-2019) compared to the previous one (1950-1984) indicating a progression towards warmer and drier climatic conditions across Florida. Spatially and temporally non-uniform variations in the associations of precipitation with SATs and SSTs are noted. Strong positive (weak negative) P-T associations are noted during the wet (dry) season for both AMO phases and El Nino, while significant (positive) P-T associations are observed across southern Florida during La Nina in the dry season. The seasonal influences are predominant in governing the P-T relationship over the regions with and without water bodies; however, considerable variations between El Nino and La Nina are noted during the dry season. The climate variability influences on P-T correlations for hyperthermic and thermic soil zones are found to be insignificant (significant) during the wet (dry) season. Nonparametric clustering is performed to identify the spatial clusters exhibiting homogeneous P-T relationships considering seasonal and climate variability influences.

AB Mount Baker, North Cascades, WA, has a current glacierized area of 38.6 km2. From 1984 to 2010, the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project has monitored the annual mass balance (Ba), accumulation area ratio (AAR), terminus behaviour and longitudinal profiles of Mount Baker glaciers. The Ba on Rainbow, Easton and Sholes Glaciers from 1990 to 2010 averaged -0.52mw.e.a-1(ma-1). Terminus observations on nine principal Mount Baker glaciers, 1984-2009, indicate retreat ranging from 240 to 520 m, with a mean of 370m or 14ma-1. AAR observations on Rainbow, Sholes and Easton Glaciers for 1990-2010 indicate a mean AAR of 0.55 and a steady state AAR of 0.65. A comparison of Ba and AAR on these three glaciers yields a relationship that is used in combination with AAR observations made on all Mount Baker glaciers during 7years to assess Mount Baker glacier mass balance. Utilizing the AARBa relationship for the three glaciers yields a mean Ba of -0.55?m?a-1 for the 1990-2010 period, 0.03ma-1 higher than the measured mean Ba. The mean Ba based on the AARBa relationship for the entire mountain from 1990 to 2010 is -0.57ma-1. The product of the mean observed mass balance gradient determined from 11?000 surface mass balance measurements and glacier area in each 100-m elevation band on Mount Baker yields a Ba of -0.50 ma-1 from 1990-2010 for the entire mountain. The median altitude of the three index glaciers is lower than that of all Mount Baker glaciers. Adjusting the balance gradient for this difference yields a mean Ba of -0.77 ma-1 from 1990 to 2010. All but one estimate converge on a loss of -0.5 ma-1 for Mount Baker from 1990 to 2010. This equates to an 11-m loss in glacier thickness, 1220% of the entire 1990 volume of glaciers on Mount Baker.

AB Key Points <list list-type="bulleted"> Incomplete mixing at sub-Darcy scale is relevant for reactive solute transport Incomplete mixing at sub-Darcy scale can be modeled using a Beta distribution We propose a reactive transport model which considers incomplete mixing
   The laboratory experiments of Gramling et al. (2002) showed that incomplete mixing at the pore scale exerts a significant impact on transport of reactive solutes and that assuming complete mixing leads to overestimation of product concentration in bimolecular reactions. Successively, several attempts have been made to model this experiment, either considering spatial segregation of the reactants, non-Fickian transport applying a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or an effective upscaled time-dependent kinetic reaction term. Previous analyses of these experimental results showed that, at the Darcy scale, conservative solute transport is well described by a standard advection dispersion equation, which assumes complete mixing at the pore scale. However, reactive transport is significantly affected by incomplete mixing at smaller scales, i.e., within a reference elementary volume (REV). We consider here the family of equilibrium reactions for which the concentration of the reactants and the product can be expressed as a function of the mixing ratio, the concentration of a fictitious non reactive solute. For this type of reactions we propose, in agreement with previous studies, to model the effect of incomplete mixing at scales smaller than the Darcy scale assuming that the mixing ratio is distributed within an REV according to a Beta distribution. We compute the parameters of the Beta model by imposing that the mean concentration is equal to the value that the concentration assumes at the continuum Darcy scale, while the variance decays with time as a power law. We show that our model reproduces the concentration profiles of the reaction product measured in the Gramling et al. (2002) experiments using the transport parameters obtained from conservative experiments and an instantaneous reaction kinetic. The results are obtained applying analytical solutions both for conservative and for reactive solute transport, thereby providing a method to handle the effect of incomplete mixing on multispecies reactive solute transport, which is simpler than other previously developed methods.

AB This study develops and assesses two methods for estimating median surface grain sizes using digital image processing from centimeter-resolution airborne imagery. Digital images with ground resolutions of 3 cm and 10 cm were combined with field calibration measurements to establish predictive relationships for grain size as a function of both local image texture and local image semivariance. Independently acquired grain size data were then used to assess the algorithm performance. Results showed that for the 3 cm imagery both local image semivariance and texture are highly sensitive to median grain size, with semivariance being a better predictor than image texture. However, in the case of 10 cm imagery, sensitivity of image semivariance and texture to grain size was poor, and this scale of imagery was found to be unsuitable for grain size estimation. This study therefore demonstrates that local image properties in very high resolution digital imagery allow for automated grain size measurement using image processing and remote sensing methods.

AB In a context of water scarcity in Peruvian Pacific catchments as a crucial issue for Peru, added to the paucity of data availability, we propose a methodology that provides new perspectives for freshwater availability estimation as a base reference for unimpaired conditions. Under those considerations, a regional discharge of 709 m(3)/s to the Pacific Ocean is estimated with a significant increasing trend of about 43 m(3)/s per decade over the 1970-2010 period. To represent the multidecadal behaviour of freshwater runoff along the region, a regional runoff analysis is proposed based on hydrological modelling at annual and monthly time step for unimpaired conditions over the whole 1970-2010 period. Differential Split-Sample Tests are used to assess the hydrological modelling robustness of the GR1A and GR2M conceptual lumped models, showing a satisfactory transposability from dry to wet years inside the thresholds defined for Nash-Sutcliffe and bias criteria. This allowed relating physical catchment characteristics with calibrated and validated model parameters, thus offering a regional perspective for dryland conditions in the study area (e.g., the anticlockwise hysteresis relationship found for seasonal precipitation-runoff relationship) as well as the impacts of climate variability and catchment characteristics.

AB Failure to effectively coordinate opportunistic extractions by individual well owners with groundwater recharge has led to increasing Indian groundwater scarcity, affecting future opportunities for improved rural livelihoods and household wellbeing. Investigation of the relationship between groundwater institutions, management attitudes and subjective wellbeing of Indian rural households has substantial potential to reveal initiatives that jointly improve aquifer sustainability and household wellbeing, yet has received limited attention. Subjective wellbeing was calculated as an index of dissatisfaction (IDS), revealing ranked importance and the level of dissatisfaction of individual factors selected from economic, environmental and social/relational wellbeing dimensions. High economic and environmental IDS scores were calculated for respondents in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds, India, respectively. We tested an exploratory hypothesis that observed IDS differences were correlated with differences in life circumstances, (household attributes, income and assets) and psychological disposition (life guiding values and willingness to adapt). The distribution of ranked IDS wellbeing scores was estimated across four statistically distinct clusters reflecting attitudes towards sustainable groundwater management and practice. Decision tree analysis identified significantly different correlates of overall wellbeing specific to cluster membership and the watershed, supporting the research hypothesis. High income IDS scores were weakly correlated with actual total household income (r < 0.25) consistent with international studies. The results suggest a singular reliance on initiatives to improve household income is unlikely to manifest as improved individual subjective wellbeing for the Dharta and Meghraj watersheds. In conclusion, correlates were tabulated into a systematic decision framework to assist the design of participatory processes at the village level, by targeting specific factors likely to jointly improve aquifer sustainability and household wellbeing.

AB The impacts of warming temperatures and declining snowpack on seasonal water yields in the Missouri River Headwaters are not well understood, revealing a gap in our understanding of regional hydroclimate and drivers of streamflow within the Upper Missouri River basin. This study presents the first annually resolved tree-ring reconstruction of spring precipitation for the Missouri River Headwaters. This reconstruction along with existing tree-ring reconstructions of 1 April snow water equivalence (SWE) and water year streamflow are used to detect variable influences of winter and spring precipitation on streamflow over past centuries, and relative to the modern period. The results suggest that spring precipitation has been a more consistent influence on water year streamflow in the Missouri River Headwaters over past centuries than winter snowpack. The strong relationship between 1 April SWE values and water year streamflow in the Missouri River Headwaters observed over much of the 20th century is not found to be a consistent feature of these multicentury paleorecords. Instead, the climatic influences on streamflow within the Missouri River Headwaters are likely more variable than 20th-century instrumental records indicate.

AB Standard models of flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium make use of an expression for the dependence of capillary pressure on the saturation of a fluid phase. Data to support the mathematical expression is most often obtained through a sequence of equilibrium experiments. In addition to such expressions being hysteretic, recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the equilibrium functional forms obtained may be inadequate for modeling dynamic systems. This situation has led to efforts to express relaxation of a system to an equilibrium capillary pressure in relation to the rate of change of saturation. Here, based on insights gained from the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) we propose that dynamic processes are related to changes in interfacial area between phases as well as saturation. A more complete formulation of capillary pressure dynamics is presented leading to an equation that is suitable for experimental study. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the discovery of novel regimes of calcium carbonate dissolution in micron-scale confined spaces through microfluidic experiments. In the experiments, hydrochloric acid is injected into a microfluidic chamber with pre-deposited calcium carbonate solids. As the acid flow rate is decreased, the dissolution of calcium carbonate transits from a liquid/solid single-phase reactive transport regime to a gas/liquid/solid two-phase one. The two-phase regime further splits into two different regimes, one with fluctuating and the other with nonfluctuating gaseous CO2 phase. We name the three regimes as "Nongaseous", "Gaseous Breathing", and "Gaseous Nonbreathing". The experimental observations are reproduced and interpreted by mathematical modeling. Results show that the regimes are controlled by the ratio of H+ concentration and saturated CO2 concentration, the Peclet number and the second Damkohler number. Dimensionless diagrams distinguishing different regimes are presented and an empirical relationship is proposed. Our results offer insights into various engineering and natural processes, e.g., geological carbon storage, petroleum reservoir acidizing, Karst dissolution, and others that are governed by small scale multiphase reactive flow physics.

AB We studied the drought patterns in the arid region of northwestern China between 1960 and 2010 using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The general evolution of drought was obtained by empirical orthogonal function (EOF), rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF), the Mann-Kendall test, and the continuous wavelet transform method. Additionally, relationships between rotated principal component time series (RPCs) and seven selected climate indices were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Four moisture-related spatial patterns (North Xinjiang, western South Xinjiang, Central Xinjiang, and the Hexi Corridor) were objectively defined by REOF analysis. These patterns are related to distinct geographical areas and are associated with distinct temporal variations. (2) The PDSI increased significantly in most regions of Xinjiang, while decreased in the eastern Hexi Corridor. The significant 4-8 year band is the major period band for the annual and seasonal PDSI derived. (3) The seasonal REOFs (RPCs) and EOFs (PCs) have consistent spatial distribution patterns with the annual REOF. The seasonal trends of PDSI are also the same as the annual PDSI trends, indicating space-time consistency between annual PDSI and seasonal PDSI. (4) The drought evolution in this region is affected by the area of northern hemisphere polar vortex, the Arctic Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation. In addition, the changes of drought in South Xinjiang and the Hexi Corridor may also be associated with the Tibetan Plateau High. Changes in drought pattern are expected to have a strong impact on the economic livelihood of the region, especially for agricultural production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [ 1] General upscaling of density-dependent flow is investigated for the classical two-dimensional Henry problem of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. Combined theoretical and numerical results are here presented. Effective flow and transport parameters for saline intrusions could be derived for statistically isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneous permeability fields by use of homogenization theory, applying also to the preasymptotic regime. Our numerical results indicate that heterogeneities in permeability affect foremost the transient evolution of saltwater intrusion, whereas the steady state saltwater distribution is less sensitive to spatially varying permeabilities and longitudinal dispersion. For the isotropic media the effective permeability is found to correspond to the geometric mean, as under conditions without fluid density contrast. The extension of results to anisotropic media requires nontrivial corrections for the effective permeability, which include the variance of log(k) and the directional correlation lengths. The appropriate dispersion coefficients for the problem correspond to the local dispersion coefficients, rather than macrodispersion coefficients. These results are discussed in light of the specific flow configuration posed in the Henry problem.

AB The field deployment of a heated distributed temperature sensor (DTS) for over three years has revealed two obstacles to estimating soil moisture () that may hamper subsurface DTS applications as well as use of other subsurface thermal probes. The first observed obstacle was a hysteretic response of the DTS sensor. The relationship between and the temperature response (T) within the cable was not only dependent on of the soil, but also on the previous wetting and drying cycles leading to that state. The second observed obstacle was soil structure healing. Soil structure healing causes the relationship between T and to evolve through time; this calibration curve becomes flatter, or less sensitive, as the surrounding soil makes better contact with the cable. Effects of the hysteretic response of the instrument and soil structure healing are largely the result of small gaps between the cable and soil. These small gaps can be approximated by a contact resistance between the cable and soil. In this article we characterize the occurrence of hysteretic and soil structure healing effects from field data and parameterize contact resistance by simulating heat transfer using a numerical modelling approach Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The scalar roughness for sensible heat flux, Z(0h), which appears in Monin and Obukhov similarity theory has been shown to exhibit substantial variability. Brutsaert and Sugita (cf W. Brutsaert and M. Sugita, J. Atmos. Sci. 53 (1996) 209-16) derived an expression for Z(0h) to account for variability in Z0h as a result anisothermal vegetation skin temperature, which assumes an exponential profile of canopy skin temperature. We examined this assumption through directional radiometric measurements of temperature profiles in a relatively uniform grass canopy. The temperature gradient steepened monotonely throughout the morning and was modeled successfully with an exponential profile. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between measured and modeled profiles was small and ranged between 0.038 degreesC and 0.530 degreesC. One of the most significant findings of this research is that the decay coefficient, b, of the exponential profile model was approximately constant with time for this canopy. This may provide a useful simplification in applying Brutsaert and Sugita's (loc. cit.) parameterization for z(0h). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated groundwater-surface water interaction model is proposed for generalized ground surface profile. To simulate ground water flow, Boussinesq's equation and Darcy's law are applied. Surface water formulation utilizes depth averaged Navier-Stokes equation of continuity and momentum. The mathematical model uses finite difference method with upwinding scheme for discretization of the governing equations and Newton-Rhapson method for solving the equations. A novel dry zone-wet zone theory is proposed for modeling the system. It is assumed that the spatial domain is made up of dry and wet zones. Further, dry and wet zones are considered as clusters of dry and wet cells respectively. Verification of the model is performed for beach with vertical and inclined faces. Test results show that numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytical/experimental ones. Experimental verification of the model is performed using a sand-box set-up. Observation data obtained from pressure sensors show good match with the numerical solution. A plausible field situation is considered with arbitrary generalized ground surface profile. Obtained numerical solution for the generalized ground profile shows intuitively correct results. The coastal wetland with arbitrary ground profile demonstrates the potential applicability of the integrated groundwater-surface water interaction model for generalized ground surface conditions.

AB Field observations of near-surface soil moisture, collected over several seasons in a watershed in suburban Maryland, are compared with values of the topographic soil moisture index generated using digital elevation models (DEMs) at a range of grid cell sizes from photogrammetric and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data sources. A companion set of near-surface soil moisture observations, DEMs and topographic index values are also presented for a nearby forested catchment. The degree to which topographic index values are an effective indicator of near-surface soil moisture conditions varies in the two environments. The urbanizing environment requires topographic index values from a DEM with a much finer grid cell resolution than the LIDAR data can provide, and the relationship is stronger in wetter conditions. In the forested environment, the DEM resolution required is considerably lower and adequately supported by the photogrammetric data, and the relationship is strong under all moisture conditions. These results provide some insights into the length scales of near-surface hydrological processes in the urbanizing environment, and the resolution of terrain data required to model those processes.

AB Hydraulic fracturing is a process aimed at improving the productivity of oil, gas or geothermal reservoirs. During hydrofracturing, backflow follows injection and represents the second phase of the process, when part of the fracturing fluid returns from fractures to well, and from well to surface. A conceptual model is presented to grasp the essential features of the phenomenon, conceiving the draining subsurface domain as a planar and rigid fracture. Backflow against an outlet pressure in the injection well is induced by the relaxation of the fracture wall, exerting a force on the fluid proportional to h(lambda), with h the time-variable aperture and lambda a non-negative exponent; an overload on the fracture may contribute to slowing or accelerating the closure process. The fluid rheology is described by the three-parameter Ellis constitutive equation, well representing the shear-thinning rheology typical of hydrofracturing fluids and coupling Newtonian and power-law behaviour. The interplay between these tendencies is modulated by a dimensionless number lambda encapsulating most problem parameters; the range of variation of lambda is discussed and found to vary around unity. The time-variable aperture and discharge rate, the space-time variable pressure field, and the time to drain a specified fraction of the fracture volume are derived as functions of geometry (length and initial aperture), wall elastic parameters, fluid properties, outlet pressure p(e) and overload f(0). The late-time behaviour of the system is practically independent from rheology as the Newtonian nature of the fluid prevails at low shear stress. In particular, aperture and discharge scale asymptotically with time as t(-1/(lambda+2)) and t(-1/(lambda+3)) for p(e) - f(0) = 0; else, the aperture tends to a constant, residual value proportional to (p(e) - f(0))lambda. A case study with equally spaced fractures adopting realistic geometric, mechanical and rheological parameters is examined: two fluids normally used in fracking technology show completely different behaviours, with backflow dynamics and drainage times initially not dissimilar, later varying by orders of magnitude.

AB A model framework is presented for simulating nitrogen and carbon cycling at the sediment-water interface, and predicting oxygen consumption by oxidation reactions inside the sediments. Based on conservation of mass and invoking simplifying assumptions, a coupled system of diffusive-reactive partial differential equations is formulated for two-layer conceptual model of aerobic-anaerobic sediments. Oxidation reactions are modeled as first-order rate processes and nitrate is assumed to be consumed entirely in the anoxic portion of the sediments. The sediments are delineated into a thin oxygenated surface layer whose thickness is equal to the oxygen penetration depth, and a lower, but much thicker anoxic layer. The sediments are separated from the overlying water column by a relatively thin boundary layer through which mass transfer is diffusion controlled. Transient solutions are derived using the method of Laplace transform and Green's function, which relate pore-water concentrations of the constituents to their concentrations in the bulk water and to the flux of decomposable settling organic matter. Steady-state pore-water concentrations are also obtained including expressions for the extent of methane saturation zone and methane gas flux. A relationship relating the sediment oxygen demand (SOD) to bulk water oxygen is derived using the two-film concept, which in combination with the depth-integrated solutions forms the basis for predicting the extent of oxygen penetration in the sediment. Iterative procedure and simplification thereof are proposed to estimate the extent of methane saturation zone and thickness of the aerobic layer as functions of time. Sensitivity of steady-state solutions to key parameters illustrates sediment processes interactions and synergistic effects. Simulations indicate that for a relatively thin diffusive boundary layer, d, oxygen uptake is limited by biochemical processes inside the sediments, whereas for a thick boundary layer oxygen transfer through the diffusive boundary layer is limiting. The results show an almost linear relationship between steady-state sediment oxygen demand and bulk water oxygen. For small d methane and nitrogen fluxes are sediment controlled, whereas for large d they are controlled by diffusional transfer through the boundary layer. It is shown that the two-layer model solution converges to the one-layer model (anaerobic layer) solution as the thickness of the oxygenated layer approaches zero, and that the transient solutions approach asymptotically their corresponding steady-state solutions.

AB Laboratory column experimental results are frequently used to estimate field-scale, fecal bacterial transport distances. However, it is not uncommon for fecal bacteria to be observed at greater distances than predicted by up-scaling laboratory results. Fluctuating or varying velocity conditions is one complex in-situ condition that might account for such inaccurate prediction, yet it is often neglected in laboratory column experiments. In this study, one-dimensional, laboratory column experiments were performed under both constant and varying velocity conditions using 2 mu m microspheres and 100 mu m glass beads to simulate bacterial transport in saturated porous media. Particle breakthrough curves and particle concentrations retained in the column at the end of an experiment were obtained for five constant and three varying velocity conditions. The range of constant velocities investigated was between 3.17 m/day and 27.65 m/day. For varying velocity conditions, the velocity was steadily increased and/or decreased over the period of the experiment within the same range. Results from the constant velocity experiments were successfully modeled using first order, irreversible particle attachment kinetics. The irreversible attachment coefficients obtained from the constant velocity experiments were used to derive a power function relationship between a dimensionless irreversible attachment coefficient, K-i* and velocity, v. This relationship was then used to model the varying velocity experiments, with limited success (NRMSE > 10% for all model fits). A comparison of K-i* values obtained from direct fitting of the varying velocity tests, with the K-i* values derived from the results of the constant velocity experiments, revealed a potential dependence of K-i* on the rate of change of velocity. Observed particle breakthrough curves (BTCs) for the varying velocity experiments were also modeled using a constant value of K-i* based on the average velocity of each experiment. The results of this modeling under-estimated observed maximum breakthrough concentrations for the column experiments where velocity increased, and especially under conditions where velocity increased then decreased. Overall, the results of this study point to the need for better understanding of how varying velocity conditions impact bacterial transport in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new computational fluid dynamics approach for simulating two-phase flow in hybrid systems containing solid-free regions and deformable porous matrices. Our approach is based on the derivation of a unique set of volume-averaged partial differential equations that asymptotically approach the Navier-Stokes Volume-of-Fluid equations in solid-free regions and multiphase Biot Theory in porous regions. The resulting equations extend our recently developed Darcy-Brinkman-Biot framework to multiphase flow. Through careful consideration of interfacial dynamics (relative permeability and capillary effects) and extensive benchmarking, we show that the resulting model accurately captures the strong two-way coupling that is often exhibited between multiple fluids and deformable porous media. Thus, it can be used to represent flow-induced material deformation (swelling, compression) and failure (cracking, fracturing). The model's open-source numerical implementation, hybridBiotInterFoam, effectively marks the extension of computational fluid mechanics into modeling multiscale multiphase flow in deformable porous systems. The versatility of the solver is illustrated through applications related to material failure in poroelastic coastal barriers and surface deformation due to fluid injection in poro-visco-plastic systems.

AB We use a three-dimensional mixed-wet random pore-scale network model to investigate the impact of wettability and trapping on the relationship between interfacial area, capillary pressure and saturation in two-phase drainage and imbibition processes. The model is a three-dimensional network of interconnected pores and throats of various geometrical shapes. It allows multiple phases to be present in each capillary element in wetting and spreading layers, as well as occupying the center of the pore space. Two different random networks that represent the pore space in Berea and a Saudi Arabia reservoir sandstone are used in this study. We allow the wettability of the rock surfaces contacted by oil to alter after primary drainage. The model takes into account both contact angle and trapping hystereses. We model primary oil drainage and water flooding for mixed-wet conditions, and secondary oil injection for a water-wet system. The total interfacial area for pores and throats are calculated when the system is at capillary equilibrium. They include contributions from the arc menisci (AMs) between the bulk and corner fluids, and from the main terminal menisci (MTMs) between different bulk fluids. We investigate hysteresis in these relationships by performing water injection into systems of varying wettability and initial water saturation. We show that trapping and contact angle hystereses significantly affect the interfacial area. In a strongly water-wet system, a sharp increase is observed at the beginning of water flood, which shifts the area to a higher level than primary drainage. As we change the wettability of the system from strongly water-wet to strongly oil-wet, the trapped oil saturation decreases significantly. Starting water flood from intermediate water saturations, greater than the irreducible water saturation, can also affect the non-wetting phase entrapment, resulting in different interfacial area behaviors. This can increase the interfacial area significantly in oil-wet systems. A qualitative comparison of our results with the experimental data available in literature for glass beads shows, with some expected differences, an encouraging agreement. Also, our results agree well with those generated by the previously developed models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil consolidation, involving time-dependent coupling between deformation of a porous medium and interstitial fluid flows within it, is of relevance to many subsurface engineering problems. A comprehensive model of poroelasticity for consolidation in unsaturated soils has been recently developed by Lo et al. ( 2014), but it still remains elusive how variations in soil texture and water content affect consolidation behavior, and the underlying parameters deriving this behavior.
   In the current study, a boundary-value problem is first setup corresponding to two symmetric semi-permeable drainage conditions, and then solved analytically for describing the excess pore air and water pressures along with the total settlement in response to time-invariant external loading using the Laplace transform. These solutions are numerically calculated for unsaturated soils with eleven texture classes as a function of three initial water saturations as representative examples. Our results reveal that the excess pore water pressure and time-dependent total settlement are indeed significantly sensitive to both soil texture and initial water saturation. We demonstrate that the coefficient of consolidation for water and its loading efficiency are two important physical parameters controlling consolidation behavior. With respect to the same soil texture, the coefficient of consolidation for water increases with an increase in initial water saturation, taking a value approximately four to five orders of magnitude greater in saturated soils than that in unsaturated ones. For a given initial water saturation, the rate of dissipation of excess pore water pressure is smallest in clay, followed by silty clay, silty clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand. A comparative study shows that in the early stage of consolidation, unsaturated soils bear smaller excess pore water pressure, but its dissipation is completed faster in saturated soils. The loading efficiency for water exhibits a concave upward relationship with initial water saturation in silty clay and clay, whereas a positively-correlated relationship between the efficiency and initial water saturation is observed in other soil textures. Unlike saturated soils, a considerable amount of total settlement is shown to occur immediately after application of external loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; RAINFALL; REPRESENTATION; RESOLUTION
AB [1] The conceptual foundation, behavior, and implementation of semidistributed hydrological models such as TOPMODEL and VIC are reviewed from a "saturation path modeling'' perspective, hereinafter referred to as SPM. A general family of SPM models is analyzed, based on the assumptions that ( 1) an event-invariant relationship between the saturated area and catchment storage exists ( which may include hysteretic and stochastic components) and ( 2) ponding is negligible and quick flow is generated from precipitation on saturated areas. The VIC and TOPMODEL are then obtained from specific constitutive functions and numerical approximations. In general, SPM leads to compact equations in canonical ODE form, making the behavior of the model transparent and facilitating improvements of both the conceptual model itself and its numerical implementation. A comprehensive numerical analysis of SPM, TOPMODEL, and VIC is presented, providing insight into the timescale dependence of their parameters. It is demonstrated that uncontrolled numerical implementations, particularly traditional fixed-step explicit Euler methods, can introduce considerable artifacts into the behavior of conceptual models such as TOPMODEL, corrupting calibration and prediction.

AB Fire is an important and natural process in the lifecycle of chaparral systems, removing old growth and recycling nutrients. Recent catastrophic wildfires in southern California chaparral have heightened concerns about increased runoff and nutrient export. The goal of this study was to improve understanding of how overland flow is generated in unburned and post-fire chaparral watersheds. Samples of overland flow were collected from burned and unburned watersheds after rainfall events and multiple regression analysis was used to examine the influence of individual storm characteristics and system moisture on overland flow volume. The results indicate that variation in overland flow generation in the unburned watershed is best explained by storm size, while overland flow in the burned watershed was positively related to storm size and time between storms. These findings suggest that the burned system had decreased infiltration rates and increased soil water repellency. In contrast, there is a statistically significant negative relationship between overland flow 1 year after a fire against different system and precipitation factors revealed a negative correlation with drying period and a positive relationship with rainfall intensity, a combination that suggests reduced repellency.

AB Despite human is an increasingly significant component of the hydrologic cycle in many river basins, most hydrologic models are still developed to accurately reproduce the natural processes and ignore the effect of human activities on the watershed response. This results in non-stationary model forecast errors and poor predicting performance every time these models are used in non-pristine watersheds. In the last decade, the representation of human activities in hydrological models has been extensively studied. However, mathematical models integrating the human and the natural dimension are not very common in hydrological applications and nearly unknown in the day-to-day practice. In this paper, we propose a new simple data-driven flow forecast correction method that can be used to simultaneously tackle forecast errors from structural, parameter and input uncertainty, and errors that arise from neglecting human-induced alterations in conceptual rainfall-runoff models. The correction system is composed of two layers: (i) a classification system that, based on the current flow condition, detects whether the source of error is natural or human induced and (ii) a set of error correction models that are alternatively activated, each tailored to the specific source of errors. As a case study, we consider the highly anthropized Aniene river basin in Italy, where a flow forecasting system is being established to support the operation of a hydropower dam. Results show that, even by using very basic methods, namely if-then classification rules and linear correction models, the proposed methodology considerably improves the forecasting capability of the original hydrological model.

AB This paper proposed an integrated simulation model to incorporate the impact of flood-induced reservoir turbidity into water supply. The integrated model includes a regional water allocation model and a one-dimensional settling model of cohesive particles based on Kynch's theory. It simulates the settling of sediment flocculation in a turbid reservoir. The restrictions of water supply during floods is mimicked by simulating turbidity profiles for control points and then quantifying the associated treatment capability of raw water in the regional water allocation model for each time step. This framework can simulate shortages caused by flood-induced high turbidity as well as extended droughts, thus provide a basis for comprehensive evaluations of emergent and regular water supply facilities. A case study of evaluating different measures to mitigate the impact of turbid reservoir on water supply in northern Taiwan is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Developments in the statistical extreme value theory, which allow non-stationary modeling of changes in the frequency and severity of extremes, are explored to analyze changes in return levels of droughts for the Colorado River. The transient future return levels (conditional quantiles) derived from regional drought projections using appropriate extreme value models, are compared with those from observed naturalized streamflows. The time of detection is computed as the time at which significant differences exist between the observed and future extreme drought levels, accounting for the uncertainties in their estimates. Projections from multiple climate model-scenario combinations are considered; no uniform pattern of changes in drought quantiles is observed across all the projections. While some projections indicate shifting to another stationary regime, for many projections which are found to be non-stationary, detection of change in tail quantiles of droughts occurs within the 21st century with no unanimity in the time of detection. Earlier detection is observed in droughts levels of higher probability of exceedance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Observations of the surface layer and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) were collected as part of the Lower Atmosphere and Precipitation Study (LAPS), which investigated the relationship between the surface conditions and the ABL processes. The LAPS was part of the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program, under the auspices of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Observations began in August 2003 over a flat surface region in mid-latitude China at 32-55 degrees N, 116-78 degrees E. Observations before, during, and after the Meiyu season in China provided data for surface conditions varying from relatively dry to moist. Preliminary analysis of the surface and the ABL observations shows relationships between the surface fluxes and the ABL structure. ABL depth was enhanced by sensible heat flux. Fluctuations in the ABL depth corresponded to plume-like wind structures within the ABL. Day-to-day variability in ABL depth was controlled mainly by buoyancy flux over the surface during dry periods. It was also affected by vertical motion at the top of the ABL, especially during wet periods. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this work, we provide a physically-consistent modeling approach for two-phase porous media flow, by including percolating interfacial area and saturation as state variables. For this purpose, we combine two continuum theories for two-phase flow which have been individually proven to be conditionally valid. This means the potential use of the connected-to-the-flow interfacial area as a state variable is tested utilizing time-resolved microfluidic experiments, for various flux boundary conditions. Moreover, we observe and study a linear relation between the percolating saturation and interfacial area, which is persistent for the tested boundary conditions. In our microfluidic experiments, we employ optical microscopy to perform cyclic immiscible displacement experiments. Our results show that a continuum model, where capillary pressure, saturation , and specific interfacial area of the clusters connected to the flow are considered, is closer to a universal description of two-phase flow than the common approaches, where the only state variable is saturation.

AB Stable water isotopes delta O-18 and delta H-2 are used to investigate precipitation trends and storm dynamics to advance knowledge of precipitation patterns in a warming world. Herein, delta O-18 and delta H-2 were used to determine the relationship between extratropical cyclonic precipitation and local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) in the eastern Ohio Valley and the eastern United States. Precipitation volume weighted and unweighted central Ohio LMWLs, created with samples collected during 2012-2018, showed that temperature had the greatest effect on precipitation isotopic composition. HYSPLIT back trajectory modelling showed that precipitation was primarily derived from a mid-continental moisture source. Remnants of major hurricanes were collected as extratropical precipitation during the 2012-2018 sampling period in central Ohio. Extratropical precipitation samples were not significantly different from the samples that created the central Ohio LMWL. Six additional LMWLs were derived from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) samples collected in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Tennessee, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Oxford, Ohio. Meteoric water lines describing published samples from Superstorm Sandy, plotted with these AIRMoN LMWLs, showed isotopic composition of Superstorm Sandy precipitation was commonly more depleted than the average isotopic composition at the mid-latitude locations. Meteoric water lines describing the Superstorm Sandy precipitation were not significantly different in slope from LMWLs generated within 300 km of the USGS AIRMoN site. This finding, which was observed across the eastern Ohio Valley and eastern United States, demonstrated a consistent precipitation delta H-2-delta O-18 relationship for extratropical cyclonic and non-cyclonic events. This work also facilitates the analysis of storm development based on the relationship between extratropical event signature and the LMWL. Analysis of extratropical precipitation in relation to LMWLs along storm tracks allows for stronger development of precipitation models and understanding of which climatic and atmospheric factors determine the isotopic composition of precipitation.

AB Uncertainty in model predictions is caused to a large extent by the uncertainty in model parameters, while the identification of model parameters is demanding because of the inherent heterogeneity of the aquifer. A variety of inverse methods has been proposed for parameter identification. In this paper we present a novel inverse method to constrain the model parameters (hydraulic conductivities) to the observed state data (hydraulic heads). In the method proposed we build a conditioning pattern consisting of simulated model parameters and observed flow data. The unknown parameter values are simulated by pattern searching through an ensemble of realizations rather than optimizing an objective function. The model parameters do not necessarily follow a multi-Gaussian distribution, and the nonlinear relationship between the parameter and the response is captured by the multipoint pattern matching. The algorithm is evaluated in two synthetic bimodal aquifers. The proposed method is able to reproduce the main structure of the reference fields, and the performance of the updated model in predicting flow and transport is improved compared with that of the prior model.

ID RAPOPORTS RULE; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; BODY-SIZE; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY;

AB We study the observed geographic distribution of freshwater fish species in the Mississippi-Missouri river system, focusing on the size and spatial distribution of geographic ranges. We use a particular metric of geographic distribution known as environmental resistance, a biogeographic index that quantifies the pointwise average spatial loss of community similarity to identify biogeographic regions of the river basin. Empirical patterns are compared with the results of a neutral metacommunity model in which local fish communities are interconnected through the ecological corridors provided by the river networks. Because neutral theory assumes that all individuals across all the species are functionally equivalent, the comparison is aimed to quantify how much of the geographic range patterns are the result of species' similarity rather than species differences, thus searching for an ecological null model for the analysis of biogeographic range. We also analyze how river network topology affects the spatial arrangement of species. Our results suggest that broad patterns of geographic range of freshwater fish in the Mississippi-Missouri can be explained simply by neutral dynamics engaged in river topology and competition for resources among species without invoking mechanisms that involve asymmetric interspecific interactions.

TI PARTITIONING SOLUTE TRANSPORT BETWEEN INFILTRATION AND OVERLAND-FLOW
   UNDER RAINFALL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RUNOFF WATER; SURFACE RUNOFF; SOIL; MODEL; RELEASE
AB Solute transport from soil to overland flow is an important source of nonpoint pollution and was investigated through tracer studies in the laboratory and at an outdoor laboratory catchment. The depth of surface water interaction with soil, defined as the mixing zone is a useful value for approximate estimation of potential solute transport into surface water under rainfall. It was measured in the laboratory for a noninfiltration case (0.90 to 1.0 cm) and estimated through mass balance modeling for an infiltration case (0.52 and 0.73 cm). At an outdoor laboratory catchment, mixing zones were calculated through calibration of a numerical model that describes unsteady, uniform, infiltration and chemical transport. Overland flow was simulated using kinematic wave theory. Mixing zone depths ranged from 0.47 to 1.02 cm and were a linear function of rainfall intensity. Also, the fraction of solute present in the mixing zone at the time of ponding which was extracted into overland flow was a linear function of the initial soil moisture content. A steady state analytical approximation of the solute transport model was also developed which overpredicted solute transport into overland flow by 1 to 60%.

TI A Physically Based Model of a Two-Pass Digital Filter for Separating
   Groundwater Runoff From Streamflow Time Series

ID AUTOMATED BASEFLOW SEPARATION; FLOW; RECESSION; RECHARGE; RIVERS
AB Groundwater runoff is an important component of river runoff and is sensitive to climate change. However, it is difficult to differentiate groundwater runoff from total river runoff by current base flow separation methods. Here, we propose a physically based model with a two-pass digital filter for separating groundwater runoff from streamflow time series. The proposed method is based on the fundamental theory of surface-groundwater interactions under a variable groundwater recharge process that is highly associated with river stages. Our results show that the groundwater flow recession constant and the base flow recession constant can be determined separately by performing variogram analysis on long-term streamflow time series data. For watersheds with areas of 10(3)-10(4) km(2), the groundwater flow recession constant differs from the typical values of the base flow recession constant by an order of magnitude or more. Therefore, the developed method can be used to quantify groundwater runoff dynamics on a temporal scale spanning tens of years. Unlike other approaches to base flow separation, our proposed method can reveal the effects of climate change on groundwater runoff.

AB [1] We investigate the use of dielectric spectroscopy to estimate ice content in frozen porous media. A dielectric mixing model was used to determine the volumetric fractions of the different phases, based on knowledge of the bulk and single-phase dielectric permittivities. Measurement of the dielectric permittivities at two different frequencies with an impedance analyzer is required to infer ice content. One of the frequencies (25 kHz) has to be close to the relaxation frequency of ice; the other frequency (158 kHz or higher) must be well above the relaxation frequency of ice to obtain a different permittivity value of the ice phase. The theory was tested with three soil samples containing different amounts of clay. Dielectric permittivities of the soil samples were determined between 0.1 and 200 kHz, and in the temperature range of - 30 degreesC to + 5 degreesC. Ice content was successfully determined for a loamy sand sample. However, surface phenomena at low frequencies ( such as double-layer polarization, surface conduction, and Maxwell-Wagner type effects) made ice content estimation using our proposed methods unfeasible in silty loam and clay samples, which had 13% and 46% clay by weight, respectively.

TI Trend estimation from frequently observed data
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; MODELS
AB This paper concerns the analysis of data collected at a much higher frequency than is of interest for trend estimation. With particular reference to water quality data, the trend is represented by a smooth curve in a generalized additive model (GAM) which includes terms for flow and seasonal effects. The residuals in the GAM form a stationary process consisting of an unobserved highly correlated stochastic process and a measurement error. It is shown how standard GAM software can be applied to prewhitened data and the trend obtained by back transformation. The main conclusion is that the data should be reduced to seasonal (e.g., monthly) means. In particular, adjustment for flow effects to assess long-term trends should depend on the relationship derived from monthly rather than short-term fluctuations in flow. There is very limited benefit from recording data at high frequency. An application to daily electrical conductivity data over a period of 34 years is given. Flow adjustment for the trend is discussed in this context.

AB Internal stresses in soils evolve as a result of the various interactions among soil particles and the pore fluids in response to natural or human-induced activities. Whether attributed to suction, structure, or the various physicochemical forces that may develop, assessing the internal stresses in soils has been an active area of research in soil science and engineering. This paper presents the restrained ring method as an experimental tool for measuring the stresses that develop in a drying soil when it is restrained from shrinking freely. The internal stress that develops can be related to the water content of the soil. This method is validated using results for both silty clay loam and clay loam soils. Tensile stress at failure (estimated from the restrained ring method) was compared to tensile strength ranges of similar soils, and a good correlation was observed. Moreover, internal stresses measured by the restrained ring method were compared with existing empirical relationships (using suction and degree of saturation). This comparison concluded that suction is not the sole contributor to the soil's internal stress.

AB Stream temperature (T-s) is a key water quality parameter that controls several biological, ecological, and chemical processes in aquatic systems. In forested headwaters, exchanges of energy across air-water-streambed interfaces may influence T-s regimes, especially during storm events as the sources of runoff change over space and time. Analysis of the hysteretic behaviour of T-s during storm events may provide insights into rainfall-runoff responses, but such relationships have not been thoroughly investigated. As such, our objectives were to (a) quantify the variability of stream temperature hysteresis across seasons in different sub-regions and (b) investigate the relationship between the hysteretic response and catchment characteristics. T-s hysteresis during storm events was assessed based on the hysteresis index (HI), which describes the directionality of hysteresis loops, and the temperature response index (TRI), which indicates whether T-s increased or decreased during a storm event. We analysed T-s data from 10 forested headwater reaches in two sub-regions (McGarvey and West Fork Tectah) in Northern California. We also performed a clustering analysis to examine the relationship amongst HI, TRI, topographic metrics, and meteorological characteristics of the study areas. Overall, the hysteretic behaviour of T-s varied across seasons-the greatest HI occurred during spring and summer. Interestingly, in the McGarvey streams the variability in T-s hysteresis co-varied strongly with topographic metrics (i.e., upslope accumulative area, average channel slope, topographic wetness index). Comparatively, in West Fork Tectah the variability of T-s hysteresis co-varied most strongly with meteorological metrics (i.e., antecedent rainfall events, solar radiation, and air temperature). Variables such as the gradient between stream and air temperatures, slope, and wetted width were significant for both sub-regional hysteretic patterns. We posit that the drivers of T-s response during storms are likely dependent on catchment physiographic characteristics. Our study also illustrated the potential utility of stream temperature as a tracer for improving the understanding of hydrologic connectivity and shifts in the dominant runoff contributions to streamflow during storm events.

AB The hydraulic head distribution in a wedge-shaped aquifer depends on the wedge angle and the topographic and hydrogeological boundary conditions. In addition, an equation in terms of the radial distance with trigonometric functions along the boundary may be suitable to describe the water level configuration for a valley flank with a gentle sloping and rolling topography. This paper develops a general mathematical model including the governing equation and a variety of boundary conditions for the groundwater flow within a wedge-shaped aquifer. Based on the model, a new closed-form solution for transient flow in the wedge-shaped aquifer is derived via the finite sine transform and Hankel transform. In addition, a numerical approach, including the roots search scheme, the Gaussian quadrature, and Shanks' method, is proposed for efficiently evaluating the infinite series and the infinite integral presented in the solution. This solution may be used to describe the head distribution for wedges that image theory is inapplicable, and to explore the effects of the recharge from various topographic boundaries on the groundwater flow system within a wedge-shaped aquifer.

AB River discharge is one of the most important quantities in hydrology. It provides fundamental records for water resources management and climate change monitoring. Even very short data-gaps in this information can cause extremely different analysis outputs. Therefore, reconstructing missing data of incomplete data sets is an important step regarding the performance of the environmental models, engineering, and research applications, thus it presents a great challenge. The objective of this paper is to introduce an effective technique for reconstructing missing daily discharge data when one has access to only daily streamflow data. The proposed procedure uses a combination of regression and autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) called dynamic regression model. This model uses the linear relationship between neighbor and correlated stations and then adjusts the residual term by fitting an ARIMA structure. Application of the model to eight daily streamflow data for the Durance river watershed showed that the model yields reliable estimates for the missing data in the time series. Simulation studies were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the procedure.

AB A record spanning almost 20 years of suspended sediment and discharge measurements on two reaches of an agricultural watershed is used to assess the influence of in-channel sediment supplies and bed composition on suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). We analyse discharge-SSC relationships from two small streams of similar hydrology, climate and land use but widely different bed compositions (one dominated by sand, the other by gravel). Given that sand-dominated systems have more fine sediment available for transport, we use bed composition and the relative proportion of surface sand and gravel to be representative of in-channel sediment supply. Both high flow events and lower flows associated with onset and late recessional storm flow ('low flows') are analysed in order to distinguish external from in-channel sources of sediment and to assess the relationship between low flows and sediment supply. We find that SSC during low flows is affected by changes to sediment supply, not just discharge capacity, indicated by the variation in the discharge-SSC relationship both within and between low flows. Results also demonstrate that suspended sediment and discharge dynamics differ between reaches; high bed sand fractions provide a steady supply of sediment that is quickly replenished, resulting in more frequent sediment-mobilizing low flow and relatively constant SSC between floods. In contrast, SSC of a gravel-dominated reach vary widely between events, with high SSC generally associated with only one or two high-flow events. Results lend support to the idea that fine sediment is both more available and more easily transported from sand-dominated streambeds, especially during low flows, providing evidence that bed composition and in-channel sediment supplies may play important roles in the mobilization and transport of fine sediment. In addition, the analysis of low-flow conditions, an approach unique to this study, provides insight into alternative and potentially significant factors that control fine sediment dynamics.

AB We use a streamtube based decomposition and a recently developed, simple relationship between tracer concentrations and ages to estimate groundwater age distributions. The decomposition assumes that an age distribution can be approximated using a superposition of linearly independent streamtubes. Transport in each streamtube is modeled with inverse Gaussian functions, the parameters of which are inferred from radiometric tracer concentrations. Three simple sampling methods are considered for weakly and moderately heterogeneous aquifers and the method gives reasonable approximations in both systems. The method is sensitive to errors in the measured concentrations but some of these errors are easily identifiable and a range of plausible age distributions can still be found. The method was then tested in a highly heterogeneous system and reasonable estimates of the age distribution were also obtained. The simplicity of this method and its insensitivity to the heterogeneity structure suggest that this approach may be an effective tool for obtaining estimates of age distributions in natural systems.

AB The determination of the temporal variability of water resources is of high importance with respect to long-term water policy. This contribution provides a wavelet-based global analysis of 55 large river discharge fluctuations located on the five continents.
   It shows that large river runoff records should be considered as valuable climatic proxies (such as temperature or precipitation records) since discharge series integrate intermittent 4-year and longer processes. Effectively, continuous Morlet wavelet analysis allows to identify statistically significant bands of intermittent fluctuations from interannual 5-8-year to decadal, 12-15-year, bidecadal, 28-year fluctuations and 4-70-year considering the longest time series available in Europe and North America.
   Reasonable physical relationships between land-water cycle oscillations and climate forcings (such as ENSO or NAO) are documented and investigated but all these results should later on be more systematically confirmed by cross-wavelet analyses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we consider a sinusoidal-walled tube (a three-dimensional tube with sinusoidally-varying diameter) as a simplified conceptualization of flow in porous media. Direct numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods was used to compute velocity fields by solving the Navier-Stokes equations, and also to numerically solve the volume averaging closure problem, for a range of Reynolds numbers (Re) spanning the low-Re to inertial flow regimes, including one simulation at Re = 449 for which unsteady flow was observed. The longitudinal dispersion observed for the flow was computed using a random walk particle tracking method, and this was compared to the longitudinal dispersion predicted from a volume-averaged macroscopic mass balance using the method of volume averaging; the results of the two methods were consistent. Our results are compared to experimental measurements of dispersion in porous media and to previous theoretical results for both the low-Re, Stokes flow regime and for values of Re representing the steady inertial regime. In the steady inertial regime, a power-law increase in the effective longitudinal dispersion (D-L) with Re was found, and this is consistent with previous results. This rapid rate of increase is caused by trapping of solute in expansions due to flow separation (eddies). One unsteady (but non-turbulent) flow case (Re = 449) was also examined. For this case, the rate of increase of D-L with Re was smaller than that observed at lower Re. Velocity fluctuations in this regime lead to increased rates of solute mass transfer between the core flow and separated flow regions, thus diminishing the amount of tailing caused by solute trapping in eddies and thereby reducing longitudinal dispersion. The observed tailing was further explored through analysis of concentration skewness (third moment) and its assymptotic convergence to conventional advection-dispersion behavior (skewness = 0). The method of volume averaging was applied to develop a skewness model, and demonstrated that the skewness decreases as a function of inverse square root of time. Our particle tracking simulation results were shown to conform to this theoretical result in most of the cases considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes two modelling frameworks for diagnosing temporal variations in nonlinear rating curves that describe suspended sediment-discharge relationships. A variant of the weighted regression on time, discharge, and season model is proposed and is compared against dynamic nonlinear modelling, a newly developed nonlinear time series filter based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling. Both approaches estimate a time series of rating curve parameters, with uncertainty, that can be used to diagnose variability in the sediment-discharge relationship over time. We evaluate the models with a variety of synthetic scenarios to highlight their ability to estimate signals of known rating curve change. Results reveal important bias-variance trade-offs unique to each approach, and in general, suggest that dynamic nonlinear modelling is better suited for rapid rating curve changes, whereas the weighted regression on time, discharge, and season variant more precisely estimates slow change. The techniques are then applied in two case studies in the Upper Hudson and Mohawk Rivers in New York. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of dynamic rating curves for the management of water quality in riverine and estuary systems.

AB [1] Dewatering and consolidation of saturated swelling soils are governed by pressure-dependent soil hydraulic properties. Existing measurement techniques are difficult and slow. We illustrate a simple, rapid desorption technique, developed for industrial slurries, to measure hydraulic properties of a gel-like sulfidic, estuarine soil (similar to 70% water content). Measured hydraulic conductivities, K(psi), were very small, similar to 10(-10) m/s, giving a representative capillary fringe thickness of similar to 7 m and characteristic gravity drainage times around 40 years. Capillarity therefore dominates flow in these soils. Estimated times for dewatering this soil under surface loading with closely spaced, vertical wick drains, are 2 to 70 years, consistent with experience. A Netherlands marine clay soil, saturated with seawater, is unexpectedly wetter than the brackish estuarine soil here at the same matric potential, psi. However, K(psi) for both soils overlap, suggesting the engineering approximation, K(psi) proportional to \psi\(-1), for marine-deposited clays. The functional dependencies of hydraulic properties surprisingly are not consistent with similar-media or double-layer theories.

ID 2-PHASE FLOW
AB Two-phase flow through fractured media is important in geothermal, nuclear, and petroleum applications. In this research an experimental apparatus was built to capture the unstable nature of the two-phase flow in a smooth-walled fracture and display the flow structures under different flow configurations in real time. The air-water relative permeability was obtained from experiment and showed deviation from the X curve behavior suggested by earlier studies. Through this work the relationship between the phase channel morphology and relative permeability in fractures was determined. A physical tortuous channel approach was proposed to quantify the effects of the flow structure. This approach could replicate the experimental results with a good accuracy. Other relative permeability models (viscous coupling model, X curve model, and Corey curve model) were also compared. Except for the viscous coupling model, these models did not interpret the experimental relative permeabilities as well as the proposed tortuous channel model. Hence we concluded that the two-phase relative permeability in fractures depends not only on liquid type and fracture geometry but also on the structure of the two-phase flow.

AB The interest about the exchange of water between streams and aquifers has been increasing among the hydrologic community because of the implications of the exchange of heat, solutes, and colloids for the water quality of aquatic environments. Unfortunately, our understanding of the relevance of the exchange processes is limited by the great number of coupled hydrological and geomorphological factors that interact to generate the complex spatial patterns of exchange. In this context, the present work presents a mathematical model for the surface-subsurface exchange through the streambed of a meandering stream. The model is based on the linearization of the equations that govern the hydrodynamics and the morphodynamics of the system, and it provides a first-order analytical solution of the coupled flow field of both the surface and the subsurface flows. The results show that stream curvature determines a characteristic spatial pattern of hyporheic exchange, with water upwelling and downwelling concentrated near the stream banks. The exchange can drive surface water deep into the sediments, thus keeping deep alluvium regions connected with the stream. The relationships between hyporheic exchange flux and the geometrical and hydrodynamical properties of the stream-aquifer system are also investigated.

TI An evolutionary multiobjective strategy for the effective management of

DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; MODELS; REGRESSION
AB This paper introduces a modeling approach aimed at the management of groundwater resources based on a hybrid multiobjective paradigm, namely Evolutionary Polynomial Regression. Multiobjective modeling in hybrid evolutionary computing enables the user (a) to find a set of feasible symbolic models, (b) to make a robust choice of models and (c) to improve computational efficiency, simultaneously developing a set of models with diverse structural parsimony levels. Moreover, this methodology appears to be well suited to those cases where process input and the boundary conditions are not easily accessible. The multiobjective approach is based on the Pareto dominance criterion and it is fully integrated into the Evolutionary Polynomial Regression paradigm. This approach proves to be effective for modeling groundwater systems, which usually requires (a) accurate analyses of the underlying physical phenomena, (b) reliable forecasts under different hypothetical scenarios and (c) good generalization features of the models identified. For these reasons it is important to construct easily interpretable models which are specialized for well defined purposes. The proposed methodology is tested on a case study aimed at determining the dynamic relationship between rainfall depth and water table depth for a shallow unconfined aquifer located in southeast Italy.

AB This is a review of physical, chemical, and biological processes governing microbial transport in the saturated subsurface. We begin with the conceptual models of the biophase that underlie mathematical descriptions of these processes and the physical processes that provide the framework for recent focus on less understood processes. Novel conceptual models of the interactions between cell surface structures and other surfaces are introduced, that are more realistic than the oft-relied upon DLVO theory of colloid stability. Biological processes reviewed include active adhesion/detachment (cell partitioning between aqueous and solid phase initiated by cell metabolism) and chemotaxis (motility in response to chemical gradients). We also discuss mathematical-issues involved in upscaling results from the cell scale to the Darcy and field scales. Finally, recent studies at the Oyster, Virginia field site are discussed in terms of relating laboratory results to field scale problems of bioremediation and pathogen transport in the natural subsurface.

AB In climatology and hydrology, univariate Extreme Value Theory has become a powerful tool to model the distribution of extreme events. The Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is routinely applied to model excesses in space or time by letting the two GPD parameters depend on appropriate covariates. Two possible pitfalls of this strategy are the modeling and the interpretation of the scale and shape GPD parameters estimates which are often and incorrectly viewed as independent variables. In this note we first recall a statistical technique that makes the GPD estimates less correlated within a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation approach. In a second step we propose novel reparametrizations for two method-of-moments particularly popular in hydrology: the Probability Weighted Moment (PWM) method and its generalized version (GPWM). Finally these three inference methods (ML, PWM and GPWM) are compared and discussed with respect to the issue of correlations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; LEVEL-SET; INVERSE METHOD
AB In the analysis of the unsaturated zone, one of the most challenging problems is to use inverse theory in the search for an optimal parameterization of the porous media. Adaptative multi-scale parameterization consists in solving the problem through successive approximations by refining the parameter at the next finer scale all over the domain and stopping the process when the refinement does not induce significant decrease of the objective function any more. In this context, the refinement indicators algorithm provides an adaptive parameterization technique that opens the degrees of freedom in an iterative way driven at first order by the model to locate the discontinuities of the sought parameters. We present a refinement indicators algorithm for adaptive multi-scale parameterization that is applicable to the estimation of multi-dimensional hydraulic parameters in unsaturated soil water flow. Numerical examples are presented which show the efficiency of the algorithm in case of noisy data and missing data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a methodology to predict the shape of solute breakthrough curves in heterogeneous aquifers at early times and/or under high degrees of heterogeneity, both cases in which the classical macrodispersion theory may not be applicable. The methodology relies on the observation that breakthrough curves in heterogeneous media are generally well described by lognormal distributions, and mean breakthrough times can be predicted analytically. The log-variance of solute arrival is thus sufficient to completely specify the breakthrough curves, and this is calibrated as a function of aquifer heterogeneity and dimensionless distance from a source plane by means of Monte Carlo analysis and statistical regression. Using the ensemble of simulated groundwater flow and solute transport realizations employed to calibrate the predictive regression, reliability estimates for the prediction are also developed. Additional theoretical contributions include heuristics for the time until an effective macrodispersion coefficient becomes applicable, and also an expression for its magnitude that applies in highly heterogeneous systems. It is seen that the results here represent a way to derive continuous time random walk transition distributions from physical considerations rather than from empirical field calibration.

AB We present a generalized framework for the stability of infinite slopes under steady unsaturated seepage conditions. The analytical framework allows the water table to be located at any depth below the ground surface and variation of soil suction and moisture content above the water table under steady infiltration conditions. The framework also explicitly considers the effect of weathering and porosity increase near the ground surface on changes in the friction angle of the soil. The factor of safety is conceptualized as a function of the depth within the vadose zone and can be reduced to the classical analytical solution for subacrial infinite slopes in the saturated zone. Slope stability analyses with hypothetical sandy and silty soils are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework. These analyses indicate that for hillslopes of both sandy and silty soils, failure can occur above the water table under steady infiltration conditions, which is consistent with some field observations that cannot be predicted by the classical infinite slope theory. A case study of shallow slope failures of sandy colluvium on steep coastal hillslopes near Seattle, Washington, is presented to examine the predictive utility of the proposed framework.

AB We consider the dynamics of a fluid interface in heterogeneous porous media, whose hydraulic properties are uncertain. Modeling hydraulic conductivity as a random field of given statistics allows us to predict the interface dynamics and to estimate the corresponding predictive uncertainty by means of statistical moments. The novelty of our approach to obtaining the interface statistics consists of dynamically mapping the Cartesian coordinate system onto a coordinate system associated with the moving front. This transforms a difficult problem of deriving closure relationships for highly nonlinear stochastic flows with free surfaces into a relatively simple problem of deriving stochastic closures for linear flows in domains with fixed boundaries. We derive a set of deterministic equations for the statistical moments of the interfacial dynamics, which hold in one and two spatial dimensions, and analyze their solutions for one-dimensional flow.

AB Faulty oil and gas wellbores are a primary pathway of concern for gas migration from the deep subsurface into shallow freshwater aquifers. Leaked gases migrating vertically along wellbores either collect and build a pressure at the wellhead known as sustained casing pressure (SCP) or escape into the atmosphere as surface casing vent flow (SCVF). SCP and SCVF are valuable indicators of integrity loss that provide insight into the potential for groundwater contamination through gas migration. Previous models of SCP and SCVF have focused on offshore wells and have not considered the relationship between SCP/SCVF and gas migration away from onshore wells. We present the first modeling framework for SCP and SCVF that is applicable to onshore oil and gas wells constructed with outermost annuli that are hydraulically connected or open to the surrounding formation. Our results show that SCP behavior is unique in onshore wells with open annuli, because steady state SCP is not achieved in an open annulus unless gas escapes the wellbore via gas migration (Darcy Flow), a wellhead leak, or a controlled bleed-off test. We show that appropriately modeling gas leakage along the wellbore and SCP/SCVF helps to constrain methane leakage fluxes from faulty wells and could be integrated with subsurface flow and transport models of stray gas contamination. By relating gas fluxes to SCP/SCVF, our model can provide information used to support regulatory actions informed by SCP/SCVF, which are easy to measure and monitor.
   Plain Language Summary Oil and gas wells can leak gas into groundwater if they are improperly constructed or become faulty over their lifetime. Gas contamination degrades groundwater quality and poses an explosion or asphyxiation hazard if allowed to degas in a confined space. Gas leakage in an oil and gas well can be detected easily at the surface by monitoring for undesirable pressure or gas flow at the wellhead, which are referred to as sustained casing pressure (SCP) and surface casing vent flow (SCVF), respectively. In this study, we present process-based models for SCP and SCVF, which can be used to develop a relationship between measured values and gas leakage from the well into groundwater. We demonstrate the validity of our model based on comparisons to SCP field data and illustrate its applicability for diagnosing gas leakage based on several case studies in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. We also identify well construction practices that increase the risk of groundwater contamination and suggest better management practices for faulty oil and gas wells that will help to protect groundwater.

AB Copulas are shown in this paper to provide an effective strategy to describe the statistical dependence between peak flow discharge and flood volume featuring hydrographs forcing a flood control reservoir. A 52 year time series of flow discharges observed in the Panaro River (Northern Italian Apennines) is used to fit an event-based bivariate distribution and to support time-continuous modeling of a flood control reservoir, located online along the river system. With regard to reservoir performances, a method aimed at estimating the bivariate return period is analytically developed, by exploiting the derived distribution theory and a simplified routing scheme. In this approach, the return period is that of the peak flow discharge released downstream from the reservoir. Therefore, in order to verify the reliability of the proposed method, a nonparametric version of its frequency distribution is assessed by means of continuous simulation statistics. Copula derived and nonparametric distributions of the downstream peak flow discharge are found to be in satisfactory agreement. Finally, a comparison of bivariate return period estimates carried out by using alternative approaches is illustrated.

AB Despite the intensive research over the past decades in the field of stochastic subsurface hydrology, our ability to analyze and model heterogeneous groundwater systems remains limited. Most existing theories are either too restrictive to handle practical complexity or too expensive to be applied to realistic problem sizes. In this paper we present approximate, closed-form equations that allow modeling 2D nonstationary flows in statistically inhomogeneous aquifers, including composite aquifers containing multiple zones characterized by different statistical models. The composite representation has the effect of decreasing the variance of deviations from the mean, relaxing the limitation of the small-perturbation assumption. The simple formulas are illustrated with a number of examples and compared with a corresponding first-order nonstationary numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that, despite the gross simplifications, the closed-form equations are robust and able to capture complex variance dynamics, reproducing surprisingly well the first-order numerical solutions and the Monte Carlo simulation even in highly nonstationary, variable situations.

AB Although two-phase fluid flow in porous media has been an established research field for decades, its theoretical background is still incomplete. In particular, while a universal definition of capillary pressure exists at the microscale, its upscaling to the macro-scale is still rather vague. In this work, a clear and rigorous definition of the macroscopic capillary pressure is proposed, which follows naturally from application of the method of volume averaging to interface properties in multiphase systems. The relationship between the macroscopic capillary pressure and the average properties of the medium is given by the macroscopic momentum balance for the fluid-fluid interfaces, in a form which can be interpreted as a generalized Young-Laplace equation at the macro-scale. We then present simulation results of drainage in a porous region extracted from a three-dimensional micro-CT image of a real carbonate rock, and show how our formulation differs from the standard one which is commonly employed in field-scale computational codes.

AB An atmosphere-ocean climate box model is used to examine the influence of cloud feedback on the equilibria of the climate system. The model consists of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which are simplified forms of the first law of thermodynamics for the atmosphere and ocean and the continuity equation for the atmospheric component of the hydrological cycle. The mass continuity equation expresses the cloud liquid water content as a function of the evaporation rate from the ocean surface and the precipitation rate. Cloud formation releases latent heat. The model clouds also absorb solar energy at a rate consistent with recent findings. The model simulates snow-ice albedo feedback, water vapour feedback and cloud feedback. The global mean precipitation and surface temperature are analysed as they respond to enhanced greenhouse warming. Model results show that cloud feedback can lead to the occurrence of multiple climate equilibria. Some of these are warmer than the present equilibrium, with increased precipitation, while others are colder, with reduced precipitation. If the cloud feedback is weak, enhanced greenhouse forcing leads to a small alteration of the present equilibrium. If the cloud feedback is strong enough, the climate system can be forced into a warmer and wetter equilibrium.

AB Appropriate spatial scales of dominant variables are determined and integrated into an appropriate model scale. This is done in the context of the impact of climate change on flooding in the River Meuse in Western Europe. The objective is achieved by using observed elevation, soil type, land use type and daily precipitation data from several sources and employing different relationships between scales, variable statistics and outputs. The appropriate spatial scale of a key variable is assumed to be equal to a fraction of the spatial correlation length of that variable. This fraction was determined on the basis of relationships between statistics and scale and an accepted error in the estimation of the statistic of 10%. This procedure resulted in an appropriate spatial scale for precipitation of about 20 km in an earlier study. The application to river basin variables revealed appropriate spatial scales for elevation, soil and land use of respectively 0.1, 5.3 and 3.3 km. The appropriate model scale is determined by multiplying the appropriate variable scales with their associated weights. The weights are based on SCS curve number method relationships between the peak discharge and some specific parameters like slope and curve number. The values of these parameters are dependent on the scale of each key variable. The resulting appropriate model scale is about 10 km, implying 225-250 model cells in an appropriate model of the Meuse basin meant to assess the impact of climate change on river flooding. The usefulness of the appropriateness procedure is in its ability to assess the appropriate scales of the individual key variables before model construction and integrate them in a balanced way into an appropriate model scale. Another use of the procedure is that it provides a framework for decisions about the reduction or expansion of data networks and needs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Dynamic behavior of extreme rainfall characteristics heightened by the abrupt warming of the environment has affected the sustainability of the existing water resources systems and infrastructure, which were designed employing the traditional 'stationary' assumption. Here, we propose a realistic and efficient framework to detect non-stationarity in the observed hydrologic variables, to overcome a few limitations suffered by the traditional non-stationary approaches. The methodology is demonstrated over the short period rainfall series of four major metropolitan cities of India, where the intensity of the rainfall is reportedly increasing sharply accompanied by the changes in the pattern of rainfall. Since direct runoff is influenced by the intensity and duration of rainfall, it is important to study the joint characteristics of intensity and duration in the context of non-stationarity, especially in urban regions where the relationship is more distinct. Hence, we estimated the time-varying joint return period/return level of its extremes, utilizing a dynamic Bayesian copula. We have implemented time-varying multivariate probability frequency analysis to derive the time-varying Intensity-Duration relationship. Here we employed a Bayesian approach through Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) algorithm to estimate the uncertainty bound of the time-varying return level. The results emphasize that the probabilistic distribution parameters vary both temporally and spatially, and recommend the incorporation of non-stationarity in the extreme event modeling, only if there is a change in the probabilistic distribution parameters. This non-stationary model can be seamlessly employed to compute return levels with better accuracy and reliability than traditional stationary/non-stationary methods. We observe that the short duration return level increases at a faster rate than the longer ones, with the credibility interval larger than that of long duration return levels. The results also highlight the importance of adopting event based non-stationary IDF curves for the design of water resource systems and to devise long-term decision-making strategies to address the changing climate. However, we do not draw any conclusion concerning climate change, in general, from the short duration rainfall records used in this study.

AB Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) is an important variable linking climate with the terrestrial water cycle and the biosphere. Understanding the dynamics of AED has substantial economic, ecological, and social implications. However, how AED varies at different time scales and the drivers of variability remain elusive. This study used spectral coherence analysis to analyze the relationships between observed and modeled AED and climate drivers across multiple time scales at 228 Chinese stations and explored the cross-scale effects of climate forcings on AED. The results highlight the crucial role of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in both energy-limited and water-limited regions, therefore models that do not incorporate VPD or underestimate the relative importance of VPD have relatively lower skill in predicting AED. Short-term forcing variability has potential impacts on the long-term AED changes through temperature and associated land-atmosphere feedbacks. Our study implies that model predictions for AED and associated hydrologic impacts may not be valid in a changing climate when the key controls on AED and their relative importance are not appropriately represented.

AB This paper presents a typology of international rivers based on asymmetries in economic and political power among riparian states. This typology is then used, along with other factors such as the spatial location of riparians on the river, to explore the question of why some riparians on international rivers have been able to successfully negotiate treaties and others have not. The findings lend support to both economic and political economy explanations of cooperative action on international rivers. International rivers with riparians with countervailing economic and political power are far more likely to have negotiated treaties than other river types. Riparian states on international rivers sharing a "western civilization" were much more likely to have concluded treaties than riparian states on rivers in other civilizations. Somewhat surprisingly, rivers that cross "civilization boundaries" appear no less likely to have treaties than international rivers than run entirely through riparian states that share a single civilization. Adjacent upstream/downstream or "side-by-side" riparians were less likely to have concluded treaties than "country pairs" with other spatial relationships.

AB We analyze the scaling behaviors of two field-scale log permeability data sets showing heavy-tailed frequency distributions in three and two spatial dimensions, respectively. One set consists of 1-m scale pneumatic packer test data from six vertical and inclined boreholes spanning a decameters scale block of unsaturated fractured tuffs near Superior, Arizona, the other of pneumatic minipermeameter data measured at a spacing of 15 cm along three horizontal transects on a 21m long and 6m high outcrop of the Upper Cretaceous Straight Cliffs Formation, including lower-shoreface bioturbated and cross-bedded sandstone near Escalante, Utah. Order q sample structure functions of each data set scale as a power xi (q) of separation scale or lag, s, over limited ranges of s. A procedure known as extended self-similarity (ESS) extends this range to all lags and yields a nonlinear (concave) functional relationship between xi (q) and q. Whereas the literature tends to associate extended and nonlinear power-law scaling with multifractals or fractional Laplace motions, we have shown elsewhere that (a) ESS of data having a normal frequency distribution is theoretically consistent with (Gaussian) truncated (additive, self-affine, monofractal) fractional Brownian motion (tfBm), the latter being unique in predicting a breakdown in power-law scaling at small and large lags, and (b) nonlinear power-law scaling of data having either normal or heavy-tailed frequency distributions is consistent with samples from sub-Gaussian random fields or processes subordinated to tfBm or truncated fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn), stemming from lack of ergodicity which causes sample moments to scale differently than do their ensemble counterparts. Here we (i) demonstrate that the above two data sets are consistent with sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to tfBm or tfGn and (ii) provide maximum likelihood estimates of parameters characterizing the corresponding Levy stable subordinators and tfBm or tfGn functions.

AB We introduce a new representation of coupled solute and water age dynamics at the catchment scale, which shows how the contributions of young runoff waters can be directly referenced to observed water quality patterns. The methodology stems from recent trends in hydrologic transport that acknowledge the dynamic nature of streamflow age and explores the use of water age fractions as an alternative to the mean age. The approach uses a travel time-based transport model to compute the fractions of streamflow that are younger than some thresholds (e.g., younger than a few weeks) and compares them to observed solute concentration patterns. The method is here validated with data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during spring 2008, where we show that the presence of water younger than roughly 2 weeks, tracked using a hydrologic transport model and deuterium measurements, mimics the variation in dissolved silicon concentrations. Our approach suggests that an age-discharge relationship can be coupled to classic concentration-discharge relationship, to identify the links between transport timescales and solute concentration. Our results highlight that the younger streamflow components can be crucial for determining water quality variations and for characterizing the dominant hydrologic transport dynamics.

AB In practice, rainfall-runoff relationships are achieved through a simply defined runoff coefficient concept that is widely used in many engineering hydrological designs in urban and rural areas. The simplicity of the method, with the sole requirement of runoff coefficient assessment, is the main attractiveness, in addition to its successful prediction of average runoff rates for a given rainfall record. Unfortunately, in the classical regression approach of the rainfall-runoff relationship, internal variabilities are not taken into consideration explicitly. The runoff coefficient is considered a constant value, and it is used without distinction of antecedent conditions for the calculation of runoff from the rainfall record. In this paper, various other uncertainty embedded versions of the runoff coefficient, and hence rainfall-runoff formulation, are presented in terms of statistics, probability, perturbation and, finally, fuzzy system modelling. It is concluded that the fuzzy logic approach yields the least relative error among the various alternative runoff calculation methods; therefore, it is recommended for use in future studies. The application of various alternatives is presented for two monthly rainfall-runoff records around Istanbul, Turkey. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The effect of forest litter on snow surface albedo has been subject to limited study, mainly in the hardwood-dominated forests of the northeastern United States. Given the recent pine beetle infestation in Western North America and associated increases in litter production, this study examines the effects of forest litter on snow surface albedo in the coniferous forests of south-central British Columbia. Measured changes in canopy transmittance provide an indication of canopy loss or total litterfall over the winter of 2007-2008. Relationships between percent litter cover, an index of albedo, snow depth, and snow ablation during the 2008 melt season are compared between a mature, young, and clearcut coniferous stand. Results indicate a strong feedback effect between canopy loss and subsequent enhanced shortwave transmittance, and litter accumulation on the snow surface from that canopy loss. However, this relationship is confounded by other variables concurrently affecting albedo. While results suggest that a relatively small percent litter cover can have a significant effect on albedo and ablation, further research is underway to extract the litter signal from that of other factors affecting albedo, particularly snow depth.

AB Snow water equivalent was measured during three springs on north- and south-exposed sites representing a range of stand structure and development stages of Quebec's balsam fir forest. Maximum snow water equivalent of the season, mean seasonal snowmelt rate, snowmelt season duration and total snowmelt season degree-day factor were related to canopy height, canopy density, light interception fraction and basal area of the stands using random coefficient models. Seasonal mean snowmelt rate was better explained by stand characteristics (R-2 from 0.41 to 0.61) than was maximum snow water equivalent (R-2 from 0.08 to 0.23). The best relationship was found with light interception, which explained 61% of snowmelt rate variability between stands. These relationships were not significantly affected by stand aspect (Pr >= S = 0.14 or higher), as snow dynamics seemed less dependent on aspect than on stand characteristics. Snowmelt recovery rates could be used by forest planners to establish an acceptable time step for the harvesting of different parts of a watershed in order to prevent peak flow augmentations.

AB This study examines the ability of well-known hydrological and geomorphological descriptors and statistics to differentiate between catchments with spatially varying geology, size and shape subject to the same climate in the Northern Territory, Australia. The effect of digital elevation model grid resolution on these statistics is also examined. Results demonstrate that catchment descriptors such as the area-slope relationship, cumulative area distribution and hypsometric curve can differentiate between catchments with different geology and resultant morphology, but catchment network statistics are insensitive to differences in geology. Examination of the effects of digital elevation model grid scale demonstrates that while considerable catchment information can be gained at digital elevation grids greater than 10 m by 10 m, hillslope and hydrological detail can be lost. Geomorphic descriptors such as the area-slope relationship, cumulative area distribution, width function and Strahler statistics were shown to be sensitive to digital elevation model grid scale, but the hypsometric curve was not. Consequently, caution is needed when deciding on an appropriate grid resolution as well as the interpretation and analysis of catchment properties at grid scales greater than hat for optimal hillslope and area aggregation definition.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate flow of discrete microbubbles through a water-saturated porous medium. During the experiments, bubbles, released from a diffuser, moved upward through a quasi-2-D flume filled with transparent water-based gelbeads and formed a distinct plume that could be well registered by a calibrated camera. Outflowing bubbles were collected on the top of the flume using volumetric burettes for flux measurements. We quantified the scaling behaviors between the gas (bubble) release rates and various characteristic parameters of the bubble plume, including plume tip velocity, plume width, and breakthrough time of the plume front. The experiments also revealed circulations of ambient pore water induced by the bubble flow. Based on a simple momentum exchange model, we showed that the relationship between the mean pore water velocity and gas release rate is consistent with the scaling solution for the bubble plume. These findings have important implications for studies of natural gas emission and air sparging, as well as fundamental research on bubble transport in porous media.

AB A coupled inversion of transient pressure observations and surface displacement measurements provides an efficient technique for estimating subsurface permeability variations. The methodology has the advantage of utilizing surface observations, which are typically much less expensive than measurements requiring boreholes. Furthermore, unlike many other geophysical observables, the relationship between surface deformation and reservoir pore fluid volume changes is relatively well understood. Our treatment enables us to partition the estimation problem into a sequence of three linear subproblems. An application of the approach to a set of tilt and borehole pressure data from the Raymond field site in California illustrates its efficiency and utility. The observations are associated with a well test in which fluid is withdrawn from a shallow fracture zone. During the test, 13 tiltmeters recorded the movement of the ground surface. Simultaneously, nine transducers measured pressure changes in boreholes intersecting the fracture system. We are able to image a high permeability, north trending channel located within the fracture zone. The existence and orientation of this high-permeability feature is substantiated by a semiquantitative analysis of some 4000 transient pressure curves.

AB In this study a simulation-based fuzzy chance-constrained programming (SFCCP) model is developed based on possibility theory. The model is solved through an indirect search approach which integrates fuzzy simulation, artificial neural network and simulated annealing techniques. This approach has the advantages of. (1) handling simulation and optimization problems under uncertainty associated with fuzzy parameters, (2) providing additional information (i.e. possibility of constraint satisfaction) indicating that how likely one can believe the decision results, (3) alleviating computational burdens in the optimization process, and (4) reducing the chances of being trapped in local optima. The model is applied to a petroleum-contaminated aquifer located in western Canada for supporting the optimal design of ground-water remediation systems. The model solutions provide optimal groundwater pumping rates for the 3, 5 and 10 years of pumping schemes. It is observed that the uncertainty significantly affects the remediation strategies. To mitigate such impacts, additional cost is required either for increased pumping rate or for reinforced site characterization. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global change is predicted to increase temperature substantially in the North as well as altering run-off regimes with less synchronicity as the importance of snow melt declines. River biota and ecosystem processes will be influenced across all levels of organization, both in concert and individually. It is of vital importance that the impacts, and their likely magnitude, can be identified in order to deploy suitable adaptation strategies at the catchment scale. In this paper, we re-analyse four data sets from studies conducted in Greenland (6669oN), Iceland (64oN), Sweden (60oN) and Denmark (5557oN) to try and tease out the likely impacts of water temperature and hydrology in shaping the stream communities and ecosystem processes in high-latitude catchments. Water temperature was the environmental variable that best explained macroinvertebrate community composition across latitudes. In contrast, no significant relationship between macroinvertebrate community composition and measures of hydraulic stability (or nutrients) was found. We found a strong linear relationship between decay rate of leaf litter and water temperature (r2=0.68; p<0.0001) independent of latitudes. Our study suggests that temperature could be the primary driver of ecosystem change in future with northern catchments likely to be especially vulnerable. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Meteorological and environmental data measured in semiarid watersheds during the summer monsoon and winter periods were used to study the interrelationships among flux, meteorological and soil water variables, and to evaluate the effects of these variables on the daily estimation of actual evapotranspiration (AET). The relationship between AET and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as a function of soil water content, as suggested by Thornthwaite-Mather and by Morton, was studied to determine its applicability to the study area. Furthermore, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was employed to evaluate the order of importance of the meteorological and soil water factors involved.
   The results of MLR analysis showed that the combined effects of available energy, soil water content and wind speed were responsible for more than 70% of the observed variations in AFT during the summer monsoon period. The analyses also indicate that the combined effects of available energy, vapour pressure deficit and wind speed were responsible for more than 70% of the observed variations in AET during the winter period. However, the test results of two different approaches, using the relationships between AET and PET as a function of soil water content, indicated some inadequacy.

AB Based on the runoff and sediment load data series obtained at the Guide hydrological station (GHS) in the upper reaches of the Yellow River from 1960 to 2013, the varying quasi-periodic fluctuations of runoff and sediment load existing in different decomposed time scales are revealed by using the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method pre- and post-reservoir operation. Combined with entropy theory, the concepts of multi-time scale entropy (MTSE) and multi-time scale structural entropy (MTSSE) are proposed to analyze the complex fluctuation characteristics of runoff and sediment load at different time scales. The results show that reservoir operation has a greater influence on sediment load than that on runoff at multi-time scales, and that their correlations change as well. Additionally, reservoir operation can aggravate the complexity of the runoff and sediment load, but with longer fluctuation time scales, this complexity decreases and predictability increases. After reservoir operation, the fluctuation period of high frequency components in runoff and sediment load is elongated, and the information content of runoff and sediment load is focused at the short-middle time scale. Therefore, the available and reasonable monitoring and research periods for runoff and sediment load in the upper reaches of the Yellow River are suggested as 4-7 years and 3-4 years, respectively.

AB Hypoxia or low bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) is a world-wide problem of management concern requiring an understanding and ability to monitor and predict its spatial and temporal dynamics. However, this is often made difficult in large lakes and coastal oceans because of limited spatial and temporal coverage of field observations. We used a calibrated and validated three-dimensional ecological model of Lake Erie to extend a statistical relationship between hypoxic extent and bottom water DO concentrations to explore implications of the broader temporal and spatial development and dissipation of hypoxia. We provide the first numerical demonstration that hypoxia initiates in the nearshore, not the deep portion of the basin, and that the threshold used to define hypoxia matters in both spatial and temporal dynamics and in its sensitivity to climate. We show that existing monitoring programs likely underestimate both maximum hypoxic extent and the importance of low oxygen in the nearshore, discuss implications for ecosystem and drinking water protection, and recommend how these results could be used to efficiently and economically extend monitoring programs.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; LINEAR MIXED MODELS; EXTREMES; CLIMATE
AB In a peaks over threshold analysis of a series of river flows, a sufficiently high threshold is used to extract the peaks of independent flood events. This paper reviews existing, and proposes new, statistical models for both the annual counts of such events and the process of event peak times. The most common existing model for the process of event times is a homogeneous Poisson process. This model is motivated by asymptotic theory. However, empirical evidence suggests that it is not the most appropriate model, since it implies that the mean and variance of the annual counts are the same, whereas the counts appear to be overdispersed, i.e., have a larger variance than mean. This paper describes how the homogeneous Poisson process can be extended to incorporate time variation in the rate at which events occur and so help to account for overdispersion in annual counts through the use of regression and mixed models. The implications of these new models on the implied probability distribution of the annual maxima are also discussed. The models are illustrated using a historical flow series from the River Thames at Kingston.

AB Regional water cycles increasingly reflect the dual influences of natural and social processes, and are affected by global climate change and expanding human activities. Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010-2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m(3) of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010-2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub -healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub -healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state. Beijing's water cycle health level is expected to further improve with increasing water diversion from the SNWDP and industrial restructuring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We tested an empirical modeling approach using relatively low-cost continuous records of turbidity and discharge as proxies to estimate phosphorus (P) concentrations at a subhourly time step for estimating loads. The method takes into account nonlinearity and hysteresis effects during storm events, and hydrological conditions variability. High-frequency records of total P and reactive P originating from four contrasting European agricultural catchments in terms of P loads were used to test the method. The models were calibrated on weekly grab sampling data combined with 10 storms surveyed subhourly per year (weekly+ survey) and then used to reconstruct P concentrations during all storm events for computing annual loads. For total P, results showed that this modeling approach allowed the estimation of annual loads with limited uncertainties (approximate to -10%+/- 15%), more reliable than estimations based on simple linear regressions using turbidity, based on interpolated weekly+ data without storm event reconstruction, or on discharge weighted calculations from weekly series or monthly series. For reactive P, load uncertainties based on the nonlinear model were similar to uncertainties based on storm event reconstruction using simple linear regression (approximate to 20%+/- 30%), and remained lower than uncertainties obtained without storm reconstruction on weekly or monthly series, but larger than uncertainties based on interpolated weekly+ data (approximate to -15%+/- 20%). These empirical models showed we could estimate reliable P exports from noncontinuous P time series when using continuous proxies, and this could potentially be very useful for completing time-series data sets in high-frequency surveys, even over extended periods.
   Plain Language Abstract Phosphorus (P) loads transported by rivers and streams have to be estimated reliably, but this is a difficult task because P loads can be transported during very short period of time, like during storm events, and most P surveys are executed with low sampling frequencies. Because continuous surveys of P are costly, we tested a modeling approach using commonly used low-cost continuous records of turbidity and discharge as surrogate variables. This had to take into account nonlinear relationships and the fact that the relationship between P and turbidity or discharge is different during a rising phase or a descending phase. The model we developed estimates P concentration variations during storm events and provides continuous time series of P. From the model estimations, total annual loads of P could be predicted with low uncertainty ranges when using turbidity as a surrogate variable, showing its ability at estimating phosphorus exports values closer to the reality. The soluble reactive form was however less reliably predicted by discharge records, but our method could still be improved.

AB Monitoring networks typically generate large amounts of data. Before the data can be added to the database, they have to be validated. In this paper, a semi-automatic procedure is presented to validate river water quality data. On the basis of historical data, additive models are established to predict new observations and to construct prediction intervals ( PI's). A new observation is accepted if it is located in the interval. The coverage of the prediction intervals and its power to detect anomalous data are assessed in a simulation study. The method is illustrated on two case studies in which the method detected abnormal nitrate concentrations in the water body provoked by a dry summer which was followed by an extreme winter period. The case studies also show that similar to classical multivariate outlier detection tools, the semi-automatic procedure allows the detection of suspicious observations lying at the edges as well as observations lying at the center of the univariate distribution of the observations, but, without having to impose linear relationships typically associated with these classical methods.

AB [1] This study investigates the influence of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) on rainfall and streamflow regimes of eastern Australia. An analysis of historical rainfall and streamflow data for Queensland (QLD), New South Wales ( NSW), and Victoria (VIC) reveals strong relationships between these indices and seasonal rainfall and streamflow totals. Rainfall and streamflow in NSW and QLD are shown to be significantly enhanced during the La Nina phase of ENSO, with La Nina impacts diminishing as one moves south into VIC. In addition, the study shows that on a multidecadal timescale the negative phase of the IPO is associated with "wetter'' conditions than the positive phase. Importantly, the already enhanced La Nina rainfall and streamflow is demonstrated to be even further magnified during La Nina events that occur in the IPO negative phase. This result is of particular importance as the influence of ENSO in VIC appears to be weak; however, the results indicate that some useful predictability of ENSO impacts can be achieved during the negative phase of the IPO for VIC.

AB Understanding multiphase flow in porous media, especially how velocity is distributed at the pore-scale, has been the aim of several studies. However, these studies address the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase experimentally without any comprehensive numerical study of the impact of different governing mechanisms related to the fluid configurations and properties, including drag force and capillary number analysis at low capillary number regime. In this study, we analyzed the recirculation phenomenon inside the trapped phase for various displacement mechanisms, fluid configurations, and dynamic properties. To simulate the pore-scale displacement at low capillary number, we used a filtered surface-force formulation of volume of fluid method, which was implemented in a separately available solver for OpenFoam package. The results showed that within the ranges of capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study (in the order of 1 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-2)), the recirculation phenomenon exists in trapped phases. During the imbibition mechanism, two stagnant regions are created adjacent to the fluid-fluid interface inside the invading fluid. Drag-force analysis on fluid-fluid interfaces shows that during imbibition the maximum force is exerted near the center of the interface, whereas during drainage more force is applied on two elongated interface tails on a solid surface. The centroids are elongated parallel to the interface during drainage and perpendicularly during imbibition, which is in concordance with drag-force distribution along with the interface. The existence of a solid surface near the fluid-fluid interface affects the recirculation process in a way that one or more centroids can be created depending on displacement mechanisms. When the ratio of trapped-phase radius to cavity depth is lower, two simultaneous recirculation zones are formed inside the invading and trapped phases While the changes in viscosity ratio and interfacial tension shifted the centroid location inside the trapped zone, the center of rotation seems to be independent of injection velocity. The average velocity of trapped phase is individually a logarithmic function of the surface tension and fluids viscosity ratio. The stationariness of centroid results in a linear relationship between the average velocity inside the trapped zone and injection velocity. For all ranges of viscosity ratios, a linear relationship between the capillary number of invading and trapped phase is obtained. The findings of this study lead to a better understanding of trapping and mobilization mechanisms in microchannels where various forces are acting on fluid-fluid interfaces.

AB Yanhe watershed, as a typical and experimental district of Soil and Water Conservation District, has long been plagued by soil erosion due to severe human disturbances. Exploring the relationship between watershed landscape pattern and hydrological processes can find effective ways to solve soil erosion problems. At first, with remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) technology and based on SWAT model, this paper analyzed and simulated ecological hydrological processes in Yanhe watershed. It is on subbasin scale that the runoff and sediment yields were simulated monthly in Yanhe watershed using SWAT model. Secondly, it quantified landscape pattern with landscape indices. The seven landscape indices at the landscape level were selected with principal component factor analysis, including Disjunct Core Area Density (DCAD), Radius of gyration (GYRATE_SD), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Shannon's diversity index (SHEI), Total Core Area (TCA), Perimeter-Area Fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), Interspersion and juxtaposition Index (IJI), etc. Thirdly, a new composite landscape index was constructed on the basis of eco-hydrological processes, which was closely related to soil erosion. The results are as follows: (1) Coupled analysis on the relationship of landscape indices and annual runoff as well as annual sediment yields in each subbasin, the correlation coefficient of seven selected landscape indices and runoff is very small, no passing all significant tests. But the correlation between sediment yields and the indices except for TCA and III is significant, and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is between 0.3 and 0.5. (2) According to the "source-sink" theory of soil erosion, Slope-HRUs landscape index (SHLI) was built and can reflect the relationship between landscape pattern and soil erosion processes to a certain extent. The coupling relationship between Slope-HRUs landscape index (SHLI) and annual sediment yields in each subbasin is very clear, and correlation coefficient is -0.6, which is significantly negatively correlated.

AB Rough rock fractures have complex geometries which result in highly heterogeneous aperture fields. To accurately estimate the permeability of such fractures, heterogeneity of the aperture fields must be quantified. In this study heterogeneity of single rough rock fractures is for the first time parametrized by connectivity metrics, which quantify how connected the bounds of a heterogeneous field are. We use 3000 individual realizations of synthetic aperture fields with different statistical parameters and compute three connectivity metrics based on percolation theory for each realization. The sensitivity of the connectivity metrics with respect to the determining parameter, i.e the cutoff threshold, is studied and the correlation between permeability of the fractures and the computed connectivity metrics is presented. The results show that the.. connectivity metric predicts the permeability with higher accuracy. All three studied connectivity metrics provide better permeability estimations when a larger aperture value is chosen as the cutoff threshold. Overall, this study elucidates that using connectivity metrics provides a less expensive alternative to fluid flow simulations when an estimation of fracture permeability is desired.

AB We develop and implement the groundwater model, Saturated/Unsaturated Flow and Transport in 3D (SUFT3D), to integrate water quantity/quality data and simulations with models of other hydrologic cycle components, namely, rivers and the ocean. This work was done as part of the Sea Air Land Modeling Operational Network (SALMON) project supported by the IBM International Foundation through its Environmental Research Program. The first research steps, presented here, address the simulation of typical hydrologic conditions to demonstrate SUFT3D's effectiveness and accuracy. The theory behind the modeling of seawater intrusion and groundwater-river interaction is summarized along with the numerical methods and characteristics of SUFT3D. The code was applied to different, increasingly complex scenarios: confined to unconfined conditions, local to regional scale, homogeneous to increasing heterogeneity, two- to three-dimensional. Of particular interest were the impacts of different boundary conditions and influence of river interactions on seawater intrusion. Results are illustrated, discussed, and compared, when possible, to those in the literature. Simulating groundwater exchange between both the river and the ocean has provided interesting results that better depict the dynamics of flow and transport in coastal zone groundwater systems.

AB Hydrogeophysical surveys were carried out in a 3.2km(2) Scottish catchment where previous isotope studies inferred significant groundwater storage that makes important contributions to streamflow. We used electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to characterize the architecture of glacial drifts and make an approximation of catchment-scale storage. Four ERT lines (360-535m in length) revealed extensive 5-10m deep drift cover on steeper slopes, which extends up to 20-40m in valley bottom areas. Assuming low clay fractions, we interpret variable resistivity as correlating with variations in porosity and water content. Using Archie's Law as a first approximation, we compute likely bounds for storage along the ERT transects. Areas of highest groundwater storage occur in valley bottom peat soils (up to 4m deep) and underlying drift where up to 10000mm of precipitation equivalent may be stored. This is consistent with groundwater levels which indicate saturation to within 0.2m of the surface. However, significant slow groundwater flow paths occur in the shallower drifts on steeper hillslopes, where point storage varies between similar to 1000mm-5000mm. These fluxes maintain saturated conditions in the valley bottom and are recharged from drift-free areas on the catchment interfluves. The surveys indicate that catchment scale storage is >2000mm which is consistent with tracer-based estimates. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB There is increasing consensus in the hydrologic literature that an appropriate framework for streamflow forecasting and simulation should include explicit recognition of forcing and parameter and model structural error. This paper presents a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, entitled differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM), that is especially designed to efficiently estimate the posterior probability density function of hydrologic model parameters in complex, high-dimensional sampling problems. This MCMC scheme adaptively updates the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during sampling and maintains detailed balance and ergodicity. It is then demonstrated how DREAM can be used to analyze forcing data error during watershed model calibration using a five-parameter rainfall-runoff model with streamflow data from two different catchments. Explicit treatment of precipitation error during hydrologic model calibration not only results in prediction uncertainty bounds that are more appropriate but also significantly alters the posterior distribution of the watershed model parameters. This has significant implications for regionalization studies. The approach also provides important new ways to estimate areal average watershed precipitation, information that is of utmost importance for testing hydrologic theory, diagnosing structural errors in models, and appropriately benchmarking rainfall measurement devices.

AB Baseflow is often treated according to a unique storage-discharge relationship. However, recent innovations in baseflow recession analysis have allowed novel findings regarding the variability of both the stability of baseflow and its nonlinearity (i.e., the concavity of the hydrograph), as well as the regional clustering of these characteristics. We investigate spatial and temporal patterns in the character of baseflow recession for over 1,000 watersheds in the continental United States. We discover seasonal patterns in both the stability and nonlinearity of baseflow which vary systematically across large regions. Further, we relate these baseflow characteristics to their potential physical drivers, including estimates of evapotranspiration, watershed storage, the distribution of watershed storage, and precipitation. While coincident watershed storage is the best predictor of baseflow stability in many regions (particularly the Appalachian Mountains), evapotranspiration from 2 to 3 months previous is the best predictor of baseflow stability in other regions (particularly the Pacific Northwest). We also discuss the novel finding that baseflow nonlinearity has increased significantly in most watersheds across the United States since 1980.

   CHANNEL; MODEL; TIME; NONLINEARITY; EQUATION
AB It has been suggested that hydrograph skewness depends on the relative dominance between hillslope and channel network transport processes, where the former ones make the hydrograph positively skewed while the latter tends to make it negatively skewed. More recently, however, the role of river hydraulics in shaping the hydrograph has been highlighted. We present a set of numerical modeling experiments using a hydrodynamic model of river networks in which we investigate how channel hydraulics influence the shape of the hydrograph, particularly its skewness. We further investigate the influence of base flow, rainfall intensity, cross section geometry, and basin scale on unit hydrograph response. We show that river hydraulics has a decisive role because positively skewed hydrographs may occur even when water inputs to the river network are negatively skewed, and in catchments whose width function is also negatively skewed. We show additional results related to the effect of the degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between celerity and discharge, the effects of base flow and rainfall intensity. These further confirm that hydraulic factors may be decisive in determining hydrograph shape.

AB River ecosystems are influenced by contaminants in the water column, in the pore water and adsorbed to sediment particles. When exchange across the sediment-water interface (hyporheic exchange) is included in modeling, the mixing coefficient is often assumed to be constant with depth below the interface. Novel fiber-optic fluorometers have been developed and combined with a modified EROSIMESS system to quantify the vertical variation in mixing coefficient with depth below the sediment-water interface. The study considered a range of particle diameters and bed shear velocities, with the permeability Peclet number, PeK between 1000 and 77,000 and the shear Reynolds number, Re*, between 5 and 600. Different parameterization of both an interface exchange coefficient and a spatially variable in-sediment mixing coefficient are explored. The variation of in-sediment mixing is described by an exponential function applicable over the full range of parameter combinations tested. The empirical relationship enables estimates of the depth to which concentrations of pollutants will penetrate into the bed sediment, allowing the region where exchange will occur faster than molecular diffusion to be determined.

ID PARTIALLY PENETRATING WELL; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SLUG TEST; VERTICAL
   VARIATIONS; IN-SITU; TESTS; BOUNDARY; FLOW; PRESSURE; PERMEABILITY
AB Local estimates of hydraulic conductivity are often obtained from constant-head double-packer tests. The tests yield ratios of flow against head difference. These are converted to values of hydraulic conductivity by dividing by a shape factor. Previously used shape factors have generally assumed that the packers are infinitely large. Such shape factors lead to overestimates of hydraulic conductivity as they ignore the effect of water flow around the packers. A semianalytical solution is derived for a constant-head double-packer permeameter test. The solution is compared with existing, approximate techniques, including the spheroidal equipotential solution, the narrow packer approximation of Rehbinder (1996), and the long-packer approximation of Rehbinder (2005). Generally, it is shown that ignoring the length of the packer and assuming a fully cased well lead to an overestimate of hydraulic conductivity. The significance of this reduces with increasing well-screen aspect ratio. Evaluation of the solution is nontrivial. For this reason, a polynomial relationship between shape factor, well-screen aspect ratio, and packer length (obtained by curve fitting with the semianalytical solution) is provided.

AB Winter-forest processes affect global and local climates. The interception-sublimation fraction (F) of snowfall in forests is a substantial part of the winter water budget (up to 40%). Climate, weather-forecast and hydrological modellers incorporate increasingly realistic surface schemes into their models, and algorithms describing snow accumulation and snow-interception sublimation are now finding their way into these schemes. Spatially variable data for calibration and verification of wintertime dynamics therefore are needed for such modelling schemes. The value of F was determined from snow courses in open and forested areas in Hokkaido, Japan. The value of F was related to species and canopy-structure measures such as closure, sky-view fraction (SVF) and leaf-area index (LAI). Forest structure was deduced from fish-eye photographs. The value of F showed a strong linear correlation to structure: F = 0(.)44 - 0(.)6 x SVF for SVF < 0(.)72 and F = 0 for SVF > 0(.)72, and F = 0(.)11 LAI. These relationships seemed valid for evergreen conifers, larch trees, alder, birch and mixed deciduous stands. Forest snow accumulation (SF) could be estimated from snowfall in open fields (S-o) and to LAI according to S-F = S-o (1 - 0(.)11 LAI) as well as from SVF according to S-F = S-o (0(.)56 + 0(.)6 SVF) for SVF < 0(.)72. The value of S-F was equal to S-o for SVF values above 0(.)72. The value of sky-view fraction was correlated to the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) using a Landsat-TM image for observation plots exceeding 1 ha. Variables F and S-F were related to NDSI for these plots according to: F = -0(.)37NDSI + 0(.)29 and S-F = S-o (0(.)81 + 0(.)37NDSI). These relationships are somewhat hypothetical because plot-size limitation only allowed one sparse-forest observation of NDSI to be used. There is, therefore, a need to confirm these relationships with further studies. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

   TEMPERATURE; IMPACT
AB The accurate specification of modeling and observational error information required by data assimilation algorithms is a major obstacle to the successful application of a land surface data assimilation system. The source and statistical structure of these errors are often unknown, and poor assumptions concerning the relative magnitude of modeling and observation uncertainty degrade the quality of land data assimilation products. In theory, adaptive filtering approaches are capable of estimating model and observation error covariance information during the online cycling of a data assimilation system. To date, however, these approaches have not been widely applied to land surface models. Here, we implement and compare four separate adaptive filtering schemes in a data assimilation system designed to ingest remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals. Upon testing of each scheme via a synthetic twin data assimilation experiment, three of the four adaptive approaches are found to provide substantially improved soil moisture estimates. However, the specific model and observation characteristics of satellite-based surface soil moisture retrievals contribute to the relatively slow convergence of all schemes. Overall, results highlight the need to consider unique aspects of the land data assimilation problem when designing and/or evaluating the relative performance of adaptive filtering algorithms.

ID MODEL; AGRICULTURE; INVESTMENT; QUALITY
AB A soil physics theory of solute movement through a drained saturated zone underlying agricultural land is introduced into a long-term economic analysis of farm-level irrigation management; this is an alternative to the immediate, homogeneous blending assumption employed in previous studies as a base for calculating changes in drainage salinity over time. Using data from California, the effect of drainage salinity evolution is analyzed through a year-by-year profit optimization under the requirement of on-farm drainage disposal. Paths of optimal land allocation among crop production with fresh surface water, saline drainage reuse and evaporation ponds appear to depend on the relative profitability of the first two; that of reuse is affected by the trend of drainage salinity. Tile spacing and environmental regulations associated with evaporation ponds affect the timing of evaporation pond construction. The system converges into a solution involving both drainage-disposal activities; this solution includes an outlet for salts and is therefore sustainable. Following this strategy, the system is asymptotically approaching a steady state that possesses both hydrological and salt balances. Economic implications associated with land retirement programs in California are discussed.

AB Understanding the nature of streamflow response to precipitation inputs is at the core of hydrological applications and water resource management. Indices such as the base flow index, recession constant, and response lag of a watershed retain an important place in hydrology as metrics to compare watersheds and understand the impact of human activity, geology, geomorphology, soils, and climate on precipitation-runoff relations. Extracting characteristics of the hyetograph-hydrograph relationship is often done manually, which is time consuming and may result in subjective and potentially inconsistent outcomes. Here, we present a MATLAB-based toolbox, called HydRun, for rapid and flexible rainfall-runoff analysis. HydRun uses a series of flexible routines to extract base flow from the hydrograph and then computes commonly used time instants of the rainfall-runoff relationship. HydRun provides users the flexibility to decide thresholds and limits of analysis, but objectively computes hydrometric indices. The toolkit includes a graphical user interface and example files. In this paper, we apply HydRun to 4 watersheds, 3 in Scotland and 1 in Canada, to demonstrate the software functions and highlight important decisions the user must make in its application.

AB The longevity of chemicals in subsurface NAPL releases is a function of their partitioning into different phases. Hysteresis can affect distribution and partitioning of compounds in the vadose zone. We separated and modified hysteresis code from NAPL Simulator (which include hysteresis caused by fluid entrapment and capillary effects) and embedded it into TMVOC. For the first time, the resulting framework is used to model multi-component and multi-phase NAPL release, partitioning and transport. We then applied the verified framework to model effects of hysteresis on partitioning of BTEX, TMB and short and long chain alkanes from a typical gasoline spill. Excluding hysteresis resulted in an expanded LNAPL plume and underestimated the compounds longevity. Hysteresis altered the spatial distribution of LNAPL molar fractions as well as gas flow path and contaminants distribution compared to the non-hysteretic case. The amplifying effect of hysteresis on the longevity of mixtures (and associated risks) should be considered if non-hysteretic relationships are applied.

AB Infiltration is a key process in aspects of hydrology, agricultural and civil engineering, irrigation design, and soil and water conservation. It is complex, depending on soil and rainfall properties and initial and boundary conditions within the flow domain. During the last century, a great deal of effort has been invested to understand the physics of infiltration and to develop quantitative predictors of infiltration dynamics. Jean-Yves Parlange and Wilfried Brutsaert have made seminal contributions, especially in the area of infiltration theory and related analytical solutions to the flow equations. This review retraces the landmark discoveries and the evolution of the conceptual approaches and the mathematical solutions applied to the problem of infiltration into porous media, highlighting the pivotal contributions of Parlange and Brutsaert. A historical retrospective of physical models of infiltration is followed by the presentation of mathematical methods leading to analytical solutions of the flow equations. This review then addresses the time compression approximation developed to estimate infiltration at the transition between preponding and postponding conditions. Finally, the effects of special conditions, such as the presence of air and heterogeneity in soil properties, on infiltration are considered.

DT Article
ID WATER-TABLE; SIGNALS; FLOW; VOLCANO
AB [ 1] An infiltration test was performed from a ditch with the purpose of monitoring the evolution of the piezometric levels using self-potential measurements made at the ground surface. We used a set of 18 piezometers and a network of 41 nonpolarizable (Pb/PbCl2) electrodes. The variations of the self-potential signals are linearly correlated to the piezometric level changes with an apparent voltage coupling coefficient of - 5.5 +/- 0.9 mV m(-1). We measured, independently of this infiltration test, the three material properties entering the macroscopic field equations. They are the resistivity distribution of the soil, its mean hydraulic conductivity, and its intrinsic streaming potential coupling coefficient ( - 5.8 +/- 1.1 mV m(-1)). Then, we modeled numerically the infiltration test and the associated self-potential signals using a two-dimensional finite difference code. The numerical model reproduces fairly well the observed results. This investigation demonstrates the effectiveness of the self-potential method in field conditions to monitor small variations (< 0.60 m) of the water table. It offers for the first time a test of the electrokinetic theory in the field with independent evaluation of the material properties entering the field equations.

AB Upscaling transport in porous media including both biomass development and simultaneous structural changes in the solid matrix is extremely challenging. This is because both affect the medium's porosity as well as mass transport parameters and flow paths. We address this challenge by means of a multiscale model. At the pore scale, the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is used to solve differential equations describing particularly the bacteria's and the nutrient's development. Likewise, a sticky agent tightening together solid or bio cells is considered. This is combined with a cellular automaton method (CAM) capturing structural changes of the underlying computational domain stemming from biomass development and solid restructuring. Findings from standard homogenization theory are applied to determine the medium's characteristic time- and space-dependent properties. Investigating these results enhances our understanding of the strong interplay between a medium's functional properties and its geometric structure. Finally, integrating such properties as model parameters into models defined on a larger scale enables reflecting the impact of pore scale processes on the larger scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the nature of water conflicts is a prerequisite to developing sustainable management of common water resources. Therefore, the main idea of this research was to understand the internal process of farmers' water conflicts. An extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as the theoretical research framework by incorporating multiple intentions (an expectation of conflict with industry, organization, and farmer) and four conflict types: within group in similar settlement, within group out of the same settlement, between farmers and industry, and between farmers and water state organization. The data were collected by survey method with a structured questionnaire from 215 fanners using random sampling and analyzed with the help of structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings indicated that all significant conflict types are influenced by their intentions. Some conflict behaviors, such as industry and water state organization conflicts were influenced not only by their own intentions, but also by their counterpart behaviors' intentions. Furthermore, inclusion of additional constructs improved the predictive utility of the proposed model. At the end, implications of the study are discussed.

AB Dissipation and flux-variance methods, derived from the turbulent kinetic energy and temperature variance budget equations in conjunction with Monin-Obukov similarity theory, were used to estimate surface fluxes of momentum and sensible heat. To examine the performance of these two methods, direct eddy correlation measurements were carried out above a nonuniform grass-covered forest clearing in Durham, North Carolina. The dissipation method sensible heat flux predictions were iii good agreement with eddy correlation measurements. Also, the flux-variance method reproduced the measured sensible heat flux well following an adjustment to the similarity constant. However, the momentum flux (or friction velocity) estimated by the dissipation and flux-variance methods were both inferior to those for sensible heat flux. The data from this experiment indicated that the above two methods are sensitive to the dimensionless wind shear (phi(m)) and temperature standard deviation (phi(theta)) functions. On the basis of dimensional analysis and the temperature variance budget equation a new dissipation approach for estimating sensible heat flux was derived. The similarity constant for this new approach was shown to be around 1.6 for uniform surfaces and from the data of this experiment.

AB The factors that control the transport of bacteria through porous media are not well understood. The relative importance of the processes of dispersion, of immobilization of bacterial cells by various mechanisms (deposition), and of subsequent release of these trapped cells (entrainment) in describing transport has not been elucidated experimentally. Moreover, the variability of the phenomenological coefficients used to model these processes, given changes in such primary factors as grain size, organism, and ionic strength of the water, is unknown. We report results of fitting solutions of an advection-dispersion equation, modified to account for deposition and entrainment, to breakthrough curves from packed sand columns using two sizes of sand, two ionic strengths of the carrier solution, and two organisms with different sizes. A solution to the advection-dispersion equation including three processes, that is, dispersion, deposition, and entrainment, provides a match to the data that is superior to that achieved by solutions ignoring one of the processes. Fitted values of the coefficient describing deposition vary in a consistent manner with the control variables (organism, grain size, and ionic strength) and are generally within one order of magnitude of those predicted on the basis of theory.

AB The pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties, including saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve (SWRC), for granite residual soil under different particle gradation were carried out by high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) and pressure plate. The relationship between three-dimensional pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties were quantitatively analyzed. The results show that the decrease of the average pore/throat radius and the CT-connected porosity with the particle diameter decreases, but the fractal dimension value increases, indicating that the soil pore structure became complex. The effect on hydraulic properties is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure. Adding big particles improved the saturated hydraulic conductivity by increasing the soil pore connectivity and decreasing the fractal dimension. In addition, the micropore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to increase the water retention capacity.

AB The recent increase in extreme climatic phenomena has gradually attracted the attention of researchers regarding urban flooding. This paper used a hydrological model combined with the Computational Fluid Dynamics software to assess the drainage efficiency, predict the hydrological processes under different precipitation intensities and establish the relationship between rainfall intensity and inundation depth under extreme rainstorm events. The study proposed several thresholds such as specific rainfall intensities (that is, RI95% and RI50%), drainage efficiency, and the limited flow rate of pipes. Based on 2021 July 20, 0:00 to 24:00 precipitation monitoring data from the "7.20 Zhengzhou Rainstorm Extreme Event," the relationship between rainfall intensity and road-pipe overflow patterns was determined by analysing these thresholds for different drainpipe diameters and spacings of catchment wells. The results demonstrated the evaluation parameters varied with rainfall intensities and pipe characteristics and revealed the main limitation of drainage efficiency and flow rate of drainpipes. The simulation helped the drainage systems design for different precipitations and proposed several relative suggestions for drainage-system improvements, wherein the diameter of the branch pipes plays a dominant role in coping with extreme rainstorm events.

AB Vegetation water stress plays an important role in the movement of water through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. However, the effects of water stress on evapotranspiration (ET) and other hydrological processes at the watershed scale remain poorly understood due in part to spatially and temporally heterogeneous conditions within the watershed, especially in areas of mountainous terrain. We used a spatially distributed model to understand and evaluate the relationship between water stress and ET in a forested mountain watershed during the snow-free growing season. Vegetation water stress increased as the growing season progressed, due to continued drying of soils, and persisted late into the growing season, even as vapor pressure deficit decreased with lower temperatures. As a result, ET became decoupled from vapor pressure deficit and became increasingly dependent on soil moisture later in the growing season, shifting from demand limitation to supply limitation. We found water stress and total growing season ET to be distributed nonuniformly across the watershed due to interactions between topography and vegetation. Areas having tall vegetation and low topographic index experienced the greatest water stress, yet they had some of the highest evapotranspiration rates in the watershed.

AB This paper presents a framework for studying regional water balance in which the physical processes are first described at the local instantaneous scale and then integrated to the annual, basin-wide scale. The integration treats the relative soil saturation (i.e., the soil moisture divided by the porosity) and precipitation intensities as stochastic variables in space and time. A statistical equilibrium characterizes the annual water balance, resulting in a specific relation that predicts the space-time average of soil saturation in terms of soil, climate, and vegetation parameters. Specific relationships are proposed to relate the space-time average soil saturation to runoff, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration. This framework is applied to the Illinois River Basin. The shape of the spatial and temporal distributions of soil saturation are determined from observations. The other parameters are determined from the physical characteristics of the basin and calibration procedures. The resulting model is able to reproduce an observed relation between the space-time average soil saturation and precipitation. It is also able to reproduce observed relations between space-time average soil saturation and space-time average evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and groundwater runoff.

AB Variations in vegetation patterns can provide a scientific basis for assessing environmental quality and monitoring ecosystem dynamics under environmental pollution and global warming conditions. To evaluate the ecological environment of the Bohai Rim, Theil-Sen trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the Hurst exponent were applied to analyze the patterns of variation in the vegetation coverage, climate factors (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity) and particulate matter and to assess sustainability in the near future. Fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5 (PM2.5, mu g/m3), refers to atmospheric particles with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 mu m, also known as respirable particles. These not only lead to a decline in atmospheric visibility but also increase human mortality and respiratory disease rates. Given the spatiotemporal nonstationarity of climate factors and PM2.5, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to confirm the spatially heterogeneous relationship among the vegetation coverage, climate factors and PM2.5. The vegetation coverage in the Bohai Rim was mostly comprised of slightly degraded areas, followed by unchanged areas, improved areas, and severely degraded areas from 2002 to 2017. The slightly degraded area accounted for 30.9 %, while 15.8 % of the area remained at the same level during the period, and 16.8 % improved. Slight degradation was mainly observed on agricultural lands and forests, whereas severely degraded areas were distributed among grasslands and wetlands. Approximately 20.9 % of the improved area, most of which was agricultural lands, forests and grasslands, continued to improve. Seasonal trends indicated that a large proportion of the areas remained unchanged or were slightly degraded from autumn to spring, whereas areas improved from spring to autumn. During the winter, slightly and severely degraded areas continuously expanded. GWR indicated that temperature, PM2.5, and precipitation displayed a significant heterogeneous spatial relationship with the vegetation coverage and had an obvious influence on the medium, high and low vegetation cover areas. When considering the joint influence of climate factors and PM2.5 on the vegetation coverage, the model accuracy was not high for the high and medium vegetation cover areas. In the Bohai region, human activities significantly affect coastal areas. These results can support sustainable coastal ecosystem management, relevant management measures and ecological development plans.

ID CATCHMENTS; FREQUENCY
AB A flow-duration curve (FDC) illustrates the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of streamflow. Applications of FDC are of interest for many hydrological problems related to hydropower generation, river and reservoir sedimentation, water quality assessment, water-use assessment, water allocation and habitat suitability. This study addresses the problem of FDC estimation for ungauged river basins, assessing the effectiveness and reliability of several regional approaches. The study refers to a wide region of eastern central Italy and adopts a jack-knife cross-validation procedure to evaluate the uncertainty of regional FDC's, comparing it with the uncertainty of empirical FDC's constructed from short samples of streamflow data. The results (a) provide an evaluation of the reliability of the regional FDC's for ungauged sites, (b) show that the reliability of the three best performing regional models are similar to one another, and (c) demonstrate that empirical FDC's based on limited data samples generally provide a better fit of the long-term FDC's than regional FDC's.

AB With the accelerated climate change, the selection of globe-warming related drought monitoring tools is vitally significant. To select the most suitable multi-source precipitation product for drought monitoring, this study comprehensively evaluated the performance of 7 latest version of multi-source precipitation estimate products (MPEs, including PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS, ERA5, MERRA2, APHRODITE, GPCC and MSWEP) and compared their drought monitoring applicability combined with GLEAM potential evapotranspiration (ETP) product based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) during 1983-2015 over China. The SPEI estimated by the China monthly Precipitation Analysis Product (CPAP) was used as the reference to assess their performance. In addition, the drought area ratio, frequency, duration and intensity were analyzed based on the multi-threshold run theory. The results showed that: (1) The precision of MPEs was higher in eastern China but lower in western China, and the overall accuracy of MPEs summarized as 4 levels from top to end respectively was GPCC and APHRODITE, MERRA2 and MSWEP, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR as well as ERA5. GLEAM ETP performed well in eastern China but poor in western China with large underestimations. (2) The applicability of MPEs in drought monitoring was regional-specific (low in parts of Northwest Desert and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but high in other areas). The accuracy of estimated SPEI for most MPEs dropped with expanding timescale in most sub-regions. Among of MPEs, GPCC product comprehensively performed best in drought monitoring. (3) Drought events occurring in northern China were usually with larger area ratio, lower frequency and longer duration than other regions. Drought events had an exacerbating trend in southeastern China. Overall, this study provides significant information to choose suitable datasets for globe-warming related drought studies.

AB This paper introduces a flexible framework for conceptual hydrological modeling, with two related objectives: (1) generalize and systematize the currently fragmented field of conceptual models and (2) provide a robust platform for understanding and modeling hydrological systems. In contrast to currently dominant "fixed" model applications, the flexible framework proposed here allows the hydrologist to hypothesize, build, and test different model structures using combinations of generic components. This is particularly useful for conceptual modeling at the catchment scale, where limitations in process understanding and data availability remain major research and operational challenges. The formulation of the model architecture and individual components to represent distinct aspects of catchment-scale function, such as storage, release, and transmission of water, is discussed. Several numerical strategies for implementing the model equations within a computationally robust framework are also presented. In the companion paper, the potential of the flexible framework is examined with respect to supporting more systematic and stringent hypothesis testing, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward more unified hydrological theory at the catchment scale.

AB Measuremental and methodological problems arising from the presence of ice cover on waterways have seriously hindered the progress in predicting timely and accurate streamflow, which is a prerequisite for the effective management of ice-covered waterways (e.g. streams, rivers, channels, and canals). Among various methods in the attempt to address this issue, the most attractive is the physically-based method, which does not require abundant, and often unobtainable, data. This paper develops a physically based K-factor method, in the form of a generalized Manning equation, for discharge estimations in ice-covered channels. The main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice-affected seasons by a K-factor adjustment of the stage-discharge relationship developed in the open-water seasons. The results of parameter estimation show that the K-factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio, which is parameterized by two exponents of the two power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile. Experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula, and to compare its relative accuracy with the Sabaneev and Larsen formulae. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice-covered channels than these two widely-used formulae based on traditional two layer hypothesis.

AB Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of vertical stratification in soil erodibility on the development and migration of steady state headcut scour holes in upland concentrated flows typical of agricultural fields. Packed soil beds with a preformed step were subjected to identical simulated rainstorms and clear- water overland flow rates, which resulted in predictable, actively migrating headcut scour holes with nearly identical characteristics. When an erosion- resistant layer was incorporated into the packed soil bed at a depth that exceeded this expected plunge pool scour depth, the erosion and hydraulic processes of the migrating headcuts remained unchanged. When the erosion- resistant layer was placed so as to intersect this potential headcut scour depth, the erosivity of the reattached wall jet was unable to erode this layer, and the depth of scour, the nappe entry angle, and sediment efflux all were reduced inversely proportional to the relative depth of the resistant layer. These data were successfully predicted using modified jet impingement theory for headcut scour holes and demonstrate further the effects of soil management and tillage practices on total soil losses from agricultural fields.

AB The use of predictive models for the understanding and management of sediment and contaminant transport generally requires knowledge of particle size and settling velocity. Particle size is often obtained by direct measurements, and the settling velocities are usually predicted using the Stokes' law (or a modification thereof) for single-grained spherical particles. Such measurements and estimates are not satisfactory measures for cohesive sediments, which exist as agglomerated particles called floes and whose behaviour is significantly different from that of the single-grained particles. Direct measurement of settling velocity and size using optical methods in settling columns has also been employed to improve these predictions; however, the subjectivity in determining which particles are in focus results in unreliable size data. An out-of-focus particle will generally possess a larger size than in reality. This paper evaluates a laser-assisted particle sizing/settling velocity determination technique's ability to eliminate the subjectivity and improve particle-sizing accuracy during settling column experiments. Although the diffraction of light by the translucent standard beads (used for evaluating the technique's accuracy for determining particle size) posed a problem, the results suggest that this technique has potential for assisting researchers to obtain the most accurate settling particle size data possible.

AB The infiltration process into the soil is generally modeled by the Richards' partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper a new approach for modeling the infiltration process through the interface of two different soils is proposed, where the interface is seen as a discontinuity surface defined by suitable state variables. Thus, the original 1D Richards' PDE, enriched by a particular choice of the boundary conditions, is first approximated by means of a time semidiscretization, that is by means of the transversal method of lines (TMOL). In such a way a sequence of discontinuous initial value problems, described by a sequence of second order differential systems in the space variable, is derived. Then, Filippov theory on discontinuous dynamical systems may be applied in order to study the relevant dynamics of the problem. The numerical integration of the semidiscretized differential system will be performed by using a one-step method, which employs an event driven procedure to locate the discontinuity surface and to adequately change the vector field.

AB A soil hydraulic model that considers capillary hysteretic and adsorptive water retention as well as capillary and film conductivity covering the complete soil moisture range is presented. The model was obtained by incorporating the capillary hysteresis model of Parker and Lenhard into the hydraulic model of Peters-Durner-Iden (PDI) as formulated for the van Genuchten (VG) retention equation. The formulation includes the following processes: capillary hysteresis accounting for air entrapment, closed scanning curves, nonhysteretic sorption of water retention onto mineral surfaces, a hysteretic function for the capillary conductivity, a nonhysteretic function for the film conductivity, and a nearly nonhysteretic function of the conductivity as a function of water content (theta) for the entire range of water contents. The proposed model only requires two additional parameters to describe hysteresis. The model was found to accurately describe observed hysteretic water retention and conductivity data for a dune sand. Using a range of published data sets, relationships could be established between the capillary water retention and film conductivity parameters. Including vapor conductivity improved conductivity descriptions in the very dry range. The resulting model allows predictions of the hydraulic conductivity from saturation until complete dryness using water retention parameters.

ID PARABOLIC METHOD PPM
AB In this paper, a unified approach for developing streamline tracing method is proposed based on piecewise polynomial pressure approximation functions. It is designed for the numerical schemes that solve the pressure solution at grid blocks while the interior velocity field remains unknown. The suitable velocity approximation functions are derived through analytical differentiation of pressure functions. They better represent the relationship between velocity field and pressure distribution in reality, satisfy the Laplace equation everywhere in a grid block, and ensure local mass conservation and normal flux continuity. Based on different polynomial pressure functions, the Trilinear/Bilinear and Cubic streamline tracing methods are developed. Additionally, a piecewise parabolic velocity reconstruction method is proposed to extend the application of the Cubic method to first-order numerical schemes. The accuracy and efficiency of the newly proposed methods are evaluated through comparing it with the Pollock and the high-order method in terms of velocity approximations and computational cost in numerical cases. Comparison results indicate that the Cubic method delivers the most accurate results at the same computational cost.

TI Equations for hydraulic conductivity estimation from particle size
   distribution: A dimensional analysis
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE hydraulic conductivity; particle size distribution; dimensional analysis
AB Estimating hydraulic conductivity from particle size distribution (PSD) is an important issue for various engineering problems. Classical models such as Hazen model, Beyer model, and Kozeny-Carman model usually regard the grain diameter at 10% passing (d(10)) as an effective grain size and the effects of particle size uniformity (in Beyer model) or porosity (in Kozeny-Carman model) are sometimes embedded. This technical note applies the dimensional analysis (Buckingham's Pi theorem) to analyze the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and particle size distribution (PSD). The porosity is regarded as a dependent variable on the grain size distribution in unconsolidated conditions. It indicates that the coefficient of grain size uniformity and a dimensionless group representing the gravity effect, which is proportional to the mean grain volume, are the main two determinative parameters for estimating hydraulic conductivity. Regression analysis is then carried out on a database comprising 431 samples collected from different depositional environments and new equations are developed for hydraulic conductivity estimation. The new equation, validated in specimens beyond the database, shows an improved prediction comparing to using the classic models.

AB Wetland biogeochemical transformations are affected by flow and mixing in wetland surface water. We investigate the influence of wind on wetland water flow by simultaneously measuring wind and surface water velocities in an enclosed freshwater wetland during 1 day of strong-wind conditions. Water velocities are measured using a Volumetric Particle Imager while wind velocities are measured via sonic-anemometer. Our measurements indicate that the wind interacting with the vegetation canopy generates coherent billows and that these billows are the dominant source of momentum into the wetland water column. Spectral analysis of velocity time series shows that the spectral peak in water velocity is aligned with the spectral peak of in-canopy wind velocity, and that this peak corresponds with the Kelvin-Helmholtz billow frequency predicted by mixing layer theory. We also observe a strong correlation in the temporal pattern of velocity variance in the air and water, with high variance events having similar timing and duration both above and below the air-water interface. Water-side variance appears coupled with air-side variance at least down to 5 cm, while the theoretical Stokes' solution predicts momentum transfer down to only 2 mm assuming transfer via molecular viscosity alone. This suggests that the wind-driven flow contributed to significant mixing in the wetland water column.

AB [ 1] The presence of free charges and numerous discontinuities separating liquid, gas, and solid phases in partially saturated soils give rise to Maxwell-Wagner polarization that may significantly affect bulk dielectric permittivity measurements. Evidence suggests a complex interplay shaping the response of low-frequency (< 100 MHz) dielectric permittivity to changes in ambient temperature and amount of ionic charges present in a wet soil. Model calculations based on the Maxwell-Wagner-Brugermann-Hanai (MWBH) theory are supported by direct measurements using a network analyzer, showing an increase in soil bulk dielectric permittivity with increasing temperature and with higher bulk electrical conductivity at low frequency range (< 100 MHz). Beyond a certain frequency the decrease in permittivity of free water becomes dominant and results in a decrease in soil bulk dielectric permittivity with increasing temperature. The value of this crossover frequency can be predicted as a function of solution electrical conductivity (EC) as confirmed in limited tests. The dielectric permittivity inferred from TDR waveform travel time analysis is not significantly influenced by the low frequency range of the dielectric spectrum. In contrast, dielectric permittivity sensors operating at frequencies lower than 100 MHz are likely to show significant sensitivity to factors affecting the Maxwell-Wagner effect ( temperature and electrical conductivity), hence requiring special care in measurement interpretation.

AB We use Approximate Bayesian Computation and the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure to quantify to what extent horizontal and vertical equivalent electrical conductivity time-series observed during tracer tests constrain the 2-D geostatistical parameters of multivariate Gaussian log-hydraulic conductivity fields. Considering a perfect and known relationship between salinity and electrical conductivity at the point scale, we find that the horizontal equivalent electrical conductivity time-series best constrain the geostatistical properties. The variance, controlling the spreading rate of the solute, is the best constrained geostatistical parameter, followed by the integral scales in the vertical direction. We find that horizontally layered models with moderate to high variance have the best resolved parameters. Since the salinity field at the averaging scale (e.g., the model resolution in tomograms) is typically non-ergodic, our results serve as a starting point for quantifying uncertainty due to small-scale heterogeneity in laboratory-experiments, tomographic results and hydrogeophysical inversions involving DC data.

AB An original nonlinear mull-dimensional model for the inertial fluid flow through a fluid-porous interface is derived by asymptotic theory for arbitrary flow directions. The interfacial region between the pure fluid and the homogeneous porous region is viewed as a thin transition porous layer characterized by smoothly evolving heterogeneities. The asymptotic analysis applied to the homogenized Navier-Stokes equations in this thin heterogeneous porous layer leads to nonlinear momentum jump conditions at the equivalent dividing interface. These jump conditions involve slip and friction coefficients whose dependence on porosity are analyzed. Moreover, we show that the resulting Navier-Stokes/Darcy-Forchheimer macroscale coupled model is globally dissipative in the porosity range 0 < phi(p) <= 0.95,which also contributes to its physical relevance. To our knowledge, this innovative asymptotic model is the first nonlinear mull-dimensional model proposed in the literature for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface. Besides, it clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid-porous interface.

AB Coastal cities and ports are located along estuaries and deltas where flooding from rivers can be as devastating as storm surges. Precise river discharge measurements are taken far inland of marine influences and backwater environments, creating large timing and magnitude uncertainties downstream at the coast. Long-term discharge, water level, velocity, and salinity measurements in coastal Alabama were used to observe the timing and magnitude of discharge events flowing 238 km from rivers to the Gulf of Mexico as river flood (fluvial) waves. Waves were described and simplified using a momentum balance, phasing techniques, and wave theory from inland rivers. Results showed the coastal backwater environment transitioned to a drawdown (i.e., plunging water profile) at bankfull discharge and suggested the drawdown location and intensity was strongly influenced by the frictional transition of the delta from tupelo-cypress forest to oligohaline marsh. The horizontal (velocity) and vertical (water level) components of fluvial waves were observed propagating through this dynamic deltaic-estuarine environment transitioning from in phase diffusive waves to out of phase dynamic waves. The wave celerity increased with surface water slope and decreased with cross-sectional area. Instead of larger events propagating faster, the geometry (i.e., levees and floodplains) and flooding significantly delayed and attenuated the magnitude of discharge reaching the gulf. This flooding downstream of discharge measurements modulated the estuarine water level, velocity, and flushing of salt. The use of fluvial wave theory will increase the precision of coastal flooding predictions for stakeholders and research now, as well as under future sea level rise.
   Plain Language Summary Most coastal cities and ports are located along rivers near the sea and are increasingly vulnerable to flooding from both sources due to intense development and sea level rise. River discharge is measured far inland where deltas, estuaries, and marine forces do not interfere, but these same influences make it difficult to observe when and how much flooding occurs near the coast. Usually in rivers, large flooding events move from upstream to downstream faster than small events. A study was conducted to track flooding events through a coastal environment using long-term observations in Alabama. In contrast to flooding behavior in rivers, the results showed small flooding events moved downstream faster than large events. This occurred because large events caused water to flow out of the river channel, spilling over the forested floodplains where it traveled more slowly. This flooding of the delta also decreased the impact of large events and demonstrates large river discharge events can be tracked in coastal areas. These findings indicate stakeholders can decrease the intensity of coastal flooding and provide more time to prepare by allowing inland regions of rivers to flood and/or by managing vegetation type, both of which reduce the downstream height of water.

TI BUILDING FLOOD-CONTROL RULE CURVES FOR MULTIPURPOSE MULTIRESERVOIR
   SYSTEMS USING CONTROLLABILITY CONDITIONS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID EUROPEAN HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEM; DISTRIBUTED MODELING SYSTEM; SHE
AB Building flood control rule curves (FCRC) for multipurpose multireservoir systems involves treating simultaneously the stochasticity of future inflows and the multivariate aspect of the problem.  The study demonstrates how theoretical findings concerning flood control multireservoir systems regulation obtained by Marien (1984) (the so-called controllability conditions) can be used to build generalized FCRC in multipurpose multireservoir systems.  These FCRC are generalized FCRC in the sense that they consist of a time varying constraint set on the needed empty space provisions in the different reservoirs of the system.  The applicability of the proposed technique is enhanced by the derivation of new controllability conditions for systems with more than one flood control section and mandatory releases.  By means of several examples, it is shown how the proposed methodology is superior to the approach which consists of lumping all the reservoirs of the system into a single imaginary reservoir.  A practical example with an eight-reservoir hydropower system in Brazil demonstrates the applicability of the methodology.

AB Spontaneous imbibition profiles are widely used for wettability evaluation of porous media such as rocks. However, mostly the equilibrium imbibed volume is the basis for wettability evaluation. Here, we model the relationship between the shape of imbibition profile and wettability of a medium. We develop a wettability evaluation criterion based on the change in Helmholtz free energy of the system during the imbibition process. The model relates the Helmholtz free energy to the area under the profile, the slope of the imbibition profile, equilibrium imbibed volume, and equilibrium time. We propose a modified form of Lucas-Washburn equation to model the capillary-driven flow of a viscous wetting phase into a porous medium saturated with a viscous nonwetting phase. We introduce a wettability index using the volume-normalized Helmholtz free energy. Finally, the model is tested on imbibition data of eight twin rock samples, and the wettability results show moderate to strong correlations with rock properties. The results show that wettability indices predicted by the proposed technique exhibit more accurate correlations compared with those obtained by the volume-based method.

AB Accurate estimation of single-phase permeability (k) has broad application in numerous areas, particularly modeling flow and transport in porous materials. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to estimate k from other medium's properties, such as porosity, grain and/or pore size distribution, and pore connectivity. Among them critical path analysis (CPA) from statistical physics - first developed to model fluid flow in media with broad conductance distributions - has been successfully applied to heterogeneous soils and rocks. However, its application to uniform sphere and/or glass bead packs that represent homogeneous porous media with narrow conductance distributions needs to be investigated. In this study, we invoke concepts from CPA and estimate k from average grain diameter and formation factor in uniform sand and glass bead packings. By comparing theory with eight datasets including 105 packs from the literature, we demonstrate that CPA estimates permeability in homogeneous media accurately. We also compare our CPA-based model estimations with those from the Kozeny-Carman, Revil and Cathles, and RGPZ models. Results indicate that the CPA approach estimates k more precisely than other three models studied here.

TI Analytical Solution for Predicting Salt Precipitation During CO2
   Injection Into Saline Aquifers in Presence of Capillary Pressure
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE CO2 storage; analytical solution; salt precipitation; capillary pressure
ID STORAGE; FLOW
AB Salt precipitation within pores of the reservoir is an important phenomenon occurring during CO2 injection into saline aquifers. The phenomenon results in permeability reduction and injectivity impairment. Salt precipitation mainly happens because of water vaporization inside the CO2-saturated (dry-out) region. For water-wet systems, the capillary pressure acts toward the lower water saturation regions in the reservoir, thereby displacing a film of brine backward to the dry-out region. This results in more precipitation. Overlooking this phenomenon, referred to as capillary-driven backflow, results in over-estimations of injectivity in the dried region. Here, we have developed an analytical solution based on fractional flow theory and shock waves for CO2-brine systems considering the effect of capillary pressure. The validity of the solution is verified by comparing the outputs of our model with those of numerical results from a commercial numerical simulator for a hypothetical reservoir. An equation is derived to calculate the distance at which capillary pressure is most influential, and also the injectivity impairment at injection well due to salt precipitation was reasonably accurately estimated. The results emphasize that effects of capillary pressure should not be ignored.

TI NEW WATER TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS - THE WEST RETURNS TO RIPARIANISM
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RIGHTS
AB Fundamental shifts in water allocation and management are occurring throughout the West.  Changing public values have reversed our historic preference for supply augmentation through the construction of new storage systems and replaced it with one for the reallocation of existing supplies.  The emerging reallocation era will be characterized by the better management of existing supplies to serve both traditional and new user communities.  Reallocation can be accomplished in three ways:  (1) the rededication of unallocated or unused blocks of stored water on federal and state reservoirs, (2) the voluntary transfer of existing water rights, and (3) the redefinition of existing rights by judicial decisions and legislation which trim consumptive entitlements.  We currently lack a coherent water allocation principle to replace the equation of conservation with storage and maximum consumption, but we are simultaneously trying to reduce the transaction costs of transfers and to impose a number of ad hoc state and federal restraints on water transfers to accommodate the previously neglected claims of nontraditional water users and other interested parties.  These new laws can greatly increase the costs of transfers and make them politically unattractive.  The expanded recognition of traditional and new third party rights could produce a new riparianism in the West.  This would overturn the law of prior appropriation which has thrived because it was premised on the serverance of the right to use water from its source and allowed water to be allocated to new demands.  In contrast, the common law of riparian rights confines water rights to landowners in the watershed of a stream.  From the beginning, western courts rejected the watershed limitation, but many recent transfer restraints modify the law of prior appropriation and reintroduce the principle of watershed protection rule in the form of a premise that river systems should be managed on an ecosystem basis.  Emerging new watershed rules could make all transfers presumptively suspect.

AB 1] This work presents methods where monthly based climate data are used to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The objective was to evaluate two monthly ET0 models (Hargreaves-Samani, HS; Droogers-Allen HS, DAHS) and compare the results with an improved model ( reference evapotranspiration model for complex terrains, REMCT). HS and DAHS are both based on the monthly temperature range (Delta T), while REMCT replaces Delta T with a monthly adjusted function ( reference minimum air temperature). The test area was peninsular-insular Italy, where 13 stations with sufficient data to calculate FAO-56 Penman-Monteith ET0 were available. The three models were evaluated against FAO-56 over a validation data set of six stations, using a multiple-statistics indicator: 0 ( best) <= I-ET <= 1 ( worst). The REMCT estimates generally compared well with the FAO-56 estimates ( mean I-ET = 0.029 against 0.187 and 0.255 with HS and DAHS, respectively). The three models performed similarly at low-altitude sites. REMCT was superior at sites higher than 500 m above sea level, where the ET0 - Delta DT relationship was distorted ( e. g., by an asymmetric lapse rate between maximum and minimum air temperatures).

AB Discharge and luminescence properties of waters feeding a flowstone in Lower Cave, Bristol, were measured at both three weekly and 30 minute sampling intervals within rainfall events over the period April 1994-April 1995 and July-December 1995, respectively. Results are compared with the discharge and luminescence of lower(< 0.01 mi s(-1)) discharge waters supplying five stalagmites in the cave (Baker ed al., 1997). When sampled at three weekly intervals, the flowstone waters exhibit a statistically significant relationship between discharge and luminescence intensity (r = 0.75), with luminescence maxima in late autumn and early winter. When compared with the stalagmite waters, the flowstone waters have a higher luminescence intensity at 420 nm (28 +/- 11 vs. 12 +/- 1 luminescence units) and a higher wavelength of maximum luminescence intensity (430 +/- 2 vs. 419 +/- 1 nm). The relationship between discharge and luminescence is weaker for the flowstone than for the fastest dripping stalagmite waters (r = 0.75 vs. r = 0.85), suggesting that hysteresis and other non-linear effects on the luminescent fraction in the waters may be important under higher flow regimes (> 0.01 mi s(-1)) feeding flowstones. When 30 minute sampling results are considered, dilution and hysteresis effects can be observed in the discharge-luminescence relationship, both on an intra-event basis and over the winter as a whole. Exhaustion of organic matter within the karst groundwater system over the hydrological year may also be important. A very rapid flux of luminescent organic matter in early autumn generates a non-linear, order of magnitude change in water luminescence intensity. Flowstone water luminescence properties can be interpreted as having: (1) higher concentrations of luminescent organic matter compared with stalagmites (from luminescence intensity data); (2) a greater proportion of humic acid in relation to fulvic acid (from luminescence wavelength data); (3) a more rapid response to surface rainfall events; and (4) a consequently greater proportion of non-linear responses to surface rainfall variations. These results are considered in terms of the utility of the analysis of luminescence variations in solid samples of stalagmites and flowstones in aiding the reconstruction of past rainfall variations, and it is suggested that stalagmites are more useful than flowstones.

TI Moving beyond heterogeneity and process complexity: A new vision for

AB Field studies in watershed hydrology continue to characterize and catalogue the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of rainfall runoff processes in more and more watersheds, in different hydroclimatic regimes, and at different scales. Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity. This commentary addresses a number of related new avenues for research in watershed science, including the use of comparative analysis, classification, optimality principles, and network theory, all with the intent of defining, understanding, and predicting watershed function and enunciating important watershed functional traits.

AB The complex mechanisms driving runoff dynamics in mountainous watersheds with thick glacial till and fractured bedrock are not well understood. We examined long- and short-term precipitation-runoff relationships and quantified subsurface storage in watersheds on the eastern slopes of Canada's Rocky Mountains to develop a conceptual understanding of runoff generation processes in this region. Fractured permeable bedrock (bedrock storage) and glacial till deposits (soil and till storage) collectively result in large dynamic storage (hydrologically active storage). The transition from multiyear dry to multiyear wet patterns increased specific discharge due to less bedrock storage opportunity but did not influence event-scale rainfall-runoff responses. Rather, event-scale rainfall-runoff responses were governed by snowmelt and soil and till storage capacity. While winter snowfall was an important predictor of annual runoff ratios, storage at the end of the previous fall also influenced runoff ratios. These complex subsurface dynamics and large storage capacities are important for understanding how mountainous watersheds with glacial till deposits may respond to disturbance or climate change.

AB This study presents a bivariate extension of the goodness-of-fit measure for regional frequency distributions developed by Hosking and Wallis (1993) for use with the method of L-moments. Utilizing the approximate joint normal distribution of the regional L-skewness and L-kurtosis, a graphical representation of the confidence region on the L-moment diagram can be constructed as an ellipsoid. Candidate distributions can then be accepted where the corresponding theoretical relationship between the L-skewness and L-kurtosis intersects the confidence region, and the chosen distribution would be the one that minimizes the Mahalanobis distance measure. Based on a set of Monte Carlo simulations, it is demonstrated that the new bivariate measure generally selects the true population distribution more frequently than the original method. Results are presented to show that the new measure remains robust when applied to regions where the level of intersite correlation is at a level found in real world regions. Finally the method is applied to two different case studies involving annual maximum peak flow data from Italian and British catchments to identify suitable regional frequency distributions.

AB Diffusive mass transfer in rock fractures is strongly affected by fluid flow in addition to material properties. The flow-dependence of matrix diffusion is quantified by a random variable ("transport resistance'') denoted as beta [T/L] and computed from the flow field by following advection trajectories. The numerical methodology for simulating fluid flow is mesh-free, using Fup basis functions. A generic statistical model is used for the transmissivity field, featuring three correlation structures: (i) highly connected non-multiGaussian; (ii) poorly connected (or disconnected) non-multi-Gaussian; and (iii) multi-Gaussian. The moments of beta are shown to be linear with distance, irrespective of the structure, after approximately 10 integral scales of ln T. Percentiles of beta are found to be linear with the mean beta when considering all three structures. Taking advantage of this property, a potentially useful relationship is presented between beta percentiles and the fracture mean water residence time that integrates all structures with high variability; it can be used in discrete fracture network simulations where T statistical data on individual fractures are not available.

AB Stream water nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N:P) ratios influence algal community composition and nutrient limitation in lotic ecosystems. N:P ratios trend across climates, with low stream water N:P ratios more common in arid climates, yet little is known about mechanisms that cause this spatial and temporal variation. This study evaluates the relationship between precipitation regime (mean annual precipitation and its frequency), watershed flow pathways, and stream water total N-to-total P (TN:TP) ratios, using a model based on a central Minnesota watershed. The purpose of the study was to examine hydrologic mechanisms that control stream water TN:TP ratios. We constructed a model that accounted for hydrological and biogeochemical processes, followed by 161 simulations under a wide range of precipitation frequency and intensity scenarios. Precipitation regime controlled total runoff and subsurface hydrologic connectivity, which had implications for TN and TP concentrations and TN:TP ratios. Results supported the hypothesis that watershed hydrology is an important control on stream water TN:TP ratios and suggested that variation of flow pathways can lead to fundamental changes of N:P ratios.

AB There is now widespread awareness of the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme floods (and droughts) and thus an increasing need for methods to account for such influences when estimating a frequency distribution. We introduce a parsimonious approach to nonstationary flood frequency analysis (NFFA) based on a bivariate regression equation which describes the relationship between annual maximum floods, x, and an exogenous variable which may explain the nonstationary behavior of x. The conditional mean, variance and skewness of both x and y = ln (x) are derived, and combined with numerous common probability distributions including the lognormal, generalized extreme value and log Pearson type III models, resulting in a very simple and general approach to NFFA. Our approach offers several advantages over existing approaches including: parsimony, ease of use, graphical display, prediction intervals, and opportunities for uncertainty analysis. We introduce nonstationary probability plots and document how such plots can be used to assess the improved goodness of fit associated with a NFFA.

AB Hydroclimate variations inferred from proxies, such as tree rings, provide a long-term context for the understanding of the current climate change. In humid Southeastern China (SEC), relatively limited long-term tree-ring records were published due to the paucity of old trees. This study develops a robust tree-ring width chronology from the Chinese cedar (Cryptomeria fortune) Fengshui woods, spanning from 1781 to 2015, by far the longest in SEC. Common growth anomalies of the Fengshui trees can well capture long-term springtime (March-May) Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) changes over the past 230 years in SEC. This hydroclimate-sensitive chronology shows significant correlations with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) like sea surface temperature modes, indicating that ENSO may act as an important regulator in local springtime SPEI. However, interdecadal shifts in the relationships between the variances of tree rings and ENSO reveal that the ENSO-SPEI teleconnection over SEC was an unstable process, and it collapsed during the periods of 1820s-1860s and 1920s-1960s, when ENSO was in its decaying phases.

AB A nutrient mass balance and a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model, calibrated and validated for Lake St. Clair with observations from 2009 and 2010, were integrated to estimate monthly lake-scale nutrient loss rates, and to calculate 3 monthly transport time scales: flushing time, water age, and water residence time. While nutrient loss rates had statistically significant relationships with all transport time scale measures, water age had the strongest explanatory power, with water age and nutrient loss rates both smaller in spring and fall and larger in summer. We show that Lake St. Clair is seasonally divided into two discrete regions of contrasting water age and productivity. The north-western region is dominated by oligotrophic waters from the St. Clair River, and south-eastern region is dominated by the nutrient enriched, more productive waters from the Thames-Sydenham River complex. The spatial and temporal variations in local transport scales and nutrient loss rates, coupled with strong seasonal variations in discharge and nutrient loads from the major tributaries, suggest the need for different load reduction strategies for different tributaries.

AB Basin response and hydrologic fluxes are functions of hydrologic states, most notably of soil moisture. However, characterization of hillslope-scale soil moisture is challenging since it is both spatially heterogeneous and dynamic. This paper introduces an entropy-based and discretization-invariant dimensionless index of hydrologic complexity H that measures the distance of a given distribution of soil moisture from a Dirac delta (most organization) and a uniform distribution (widest distribution). Applying the distributed hydrologic model MOBIDIC to seven test basins with areas ranging 10(0)-10(3) km(2) and representing semiarid and temperate climates, H is shown to capture distributional characteristics of soil moisture fields. It can also track the temporal evolution of the distributional features. Furthermore, this paper explores how basin attributes affect the characteristic H, and how H can be used to explain interbasin variability in hydrologic response. Relationships are found only by grouping basins with the same climate or size. For the semiarid basins, H scales with catchment area, topographic wetness, infiltration ratio, and base flow index; while H is inversely related to relief ratio.

AB A network of shallow groundwater wells in a headwater catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, U.S. was used to investigate the hydrologic behavior of five distinct soil morphological units. The soil morphological units were hypothesized to be indicative of distinct water table regimes. Water table fluctuations in the wells were characterized by their median and interquartile range of depth, proportion of time water table was present in the solum, and storage-discharge behavior of subsurface flow. Statistically significant differences in median, interquartile range, and presence of water table were detected among soil units. Threshold responses were identified in storage-discharge relationships of subsurface flow, with thresholds varying among soil units. These results suggest that soil horizonation is indicative of distinct groundwater flow regimes. The spatial distribution of water table across the catchment showed variably connected/disconnected active areas of runoff generation in the solum. The spatial distribution of water table and therefore areas contributing to stormflow is complex and changes depending on catchment storage.

AB Well hydraulics is a discipline to understand the process of flow to the well in an aquifer which is regarded as a source of groundwater. A variety of analytical and numerical models have been developed over the last few decades to provide a framework for understanding and quantifying the flow behavior in aquifer systems. In this review, we first briefly introduce the background of the theory of well hydraulics and the concepts, methodologies, and applications of analytical, semi-analytical, numerical and approximate methods in solving the well-hydraulic problems. We then address the subjects of current interests such as the incorporation of effects of finite well radius, wellbore storage, well partial penetration, and the presence of skin into various practical problems of groundwater flow. Furthermore, we also summarize recent developments of flow modeling such as the flow in aquifers with horizontal wells or collector wells, the capture zone delineation, and the non-Darcian flow in porous media and fractured formations. Finally, we present a comprehensive review on the numerical calculations for five well functions frequently appearing in well-hydraulic literature and suggest some topics in groundwater flow for future research.

AB Hydrological modelling is an important tool for research, policy, and management, but uncertainty remains about parameters transferability from field observations made at small scale to models at the catchment scale and larger. This uncertainty compels the need to develop parameter relationships that are translatable across scale. In this study, we compare the changes to modelled processes as resolution is coarsened from 100-m to 1-km in a topographically complex, 255-km(2) Colorado River headwater catchment. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for hydraulic conductivity (K) and Manning's n parameters across four orders of magnitude. Results showed that K acts as a moderator between surface and subsurface contributions to streamflow, whereas n moderates the duration of high intensity, infiltration-excess flow. The parametric sensitivity analysis informed development of a new method to scale effective hydraulic conductivity across modelling resolutions in order to compensate for the loss of topographic gradients as resolution is coarsened. A similar mathematical relationship between n and lateral resolution changes was not found, possibly because n is also sensitive to time discretization. This research provides an approach to translate hydraulic conductivity parameters from a calibrated coarse model to higher resolutions where the number of simulations are limited by computational demand.

AB A three-dimensional numerical model was used to simulate the impact of different well-field configurations on pump-and-treat mass removal efficiency for large groundwater contaminant plumes residing in homogeneous and layered domains. Four well-field configurations were tested, Longitudinal, Distributed, Downgradient, and natural gradient (with no extraction wells). The reductions in contaminant mass discharge (CMDR) as a function of mass removal (MR) were characterized to assess remediation efficiency. Systems whose CDMR-MR profiles are below the 1:1 relationship curve are associated with more efficient well-field configurations. For simulations conducted with the homogeneous domain, the CMDR-MR curves shift leftward, from convex-downward profiles for natural gradient and Longitudinal to first-order behaviour for Distributed, and further leftward to a sigmoidal profile for the Downgradient well-field configuration. These results reveal the maximum potential impacts of well-field configuration on mass-removal behaviour, which is attributed to mass-transfer constraints associated with regions of low flow. In contrast, for the simulations conducted with the layered domain, the CMDR-MR relationships for the different well-field configurations exhibit convex-upward profiles. The nonideal mass-removal behaviour in this case is influenced by both well-field configuration and back diffusion associated with low-permeability units.

AB Analytical and semi-analytical approaches provide an easy-to-use tool to verify the success of long-term and large-scale deployment of subsurface CO2 storage. Existing classical solutions lack significant features that are essential in the interpretation of the spatiotemporal evolution of pressure plume. We, obviating the limiting assumptions, report a novel general semi-analytical solution to a physical problem where a storage layer and a caprock are embedded in an infinite medium. We exploited the features of an integral transform technique and Laplace transform to derive the new solution. An effective numerical treatment is suggested to evaluate the obtained solutions. We identify a distorted Gaussian spatiotemporal pressure plume for the cases when the overburden/underburden permeabilities are less than that of the storage layer. We investigate the nature of temporal behavior of leakage rates and identify a scaling relation in the form of L-d proportional to t(d)(1/2) for dimensionless leakage rate and time. We also present a benchmark pressure trend to detect the pressure anomaly signaling potential brine and CO2 leakage. This theory will be invoked as a benchmark analytical study in fields where diffusion is of immense interest.

AB [ 1] Spatial patterns of scour and fill in two dryland ephemeral stream channels with sandy bed material have been measured with dense arrays of scour chains. Although the depth and areal extent of bed activity increased with discharge, active bed reworking at particular locations within the reaches resulted in downstream patterns of alternate shallower and deeper areas of scour. The variation was such that mean scour depths for individual cross sections varied about the mean for the reach by a factor of 2 - 4 while the locus of maximum scour traced a sinuous path about the channel centerline. The wavelength of the pattern of scour was about seven times the channel width. During each event, compensating fill returned the streambeds to preflow elevations, indicating that the streams were in approximate steady state over the period of study. Although the patterns of periodically enhanced scour along alternate sides of the channels are consistent with models of periodically reversing helical flow, further work is required to identify the causal relationships between patterns of flow and sediment transport in dryland sand bed channels.

TI A Feature-Based Procedure for Detecting Technical Outliers in
   Water-Quality Data From In Situ Sensors
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB Outliers due to technical errors in water-quality data from in situ sensors can reduce data quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from subsequent data analysis. However, outlier detection through manual monitoring is infeasible given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here we introduce an automated procedure, named oddwater, that provides early detection of outliers in water-quality data from in situ sensors caused by technical issues. Our oddwater procedure is used to first identify the data features that differentiate outlying instances from typical behaviors. Then, statistical transformations are applied to make the outlying instances stand out in a transformed data space. Unsupervised outlier scoring techniques are applied to the transformed data space, and an approach based on extreme value theory is used to calculate a threshold for each potential outlier. Using two data sets obtained from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, we show that oddwater successfully identifies outliers involving abrupt changes in turbidity, conductivity, and river level, including sudden spikes, sudden isolated drops, and level shifts, while maintaining very low false detection rates. We have implemented this oddwater procedure in the open source R package oddwater.

AB The analytical solution for the heat flux from an anisothermal canopy developed from K theory by Brutsaert and Sugita [1996] (hereinafter referred to as B&S) has been extended to provide a parameterization of the difference between the radiometric and the equivalent isothermal surface temperature. The latter is the isothermal temperature at which a canopy would give the correct sensible heat flux if the sensible heat roughness length z(0h) was given its theoretical, isothermal value derived by B&S. A parameterization of the canopy temperature seen by a radiometer is developed which incorporates the same foliage temperature profile as that used by B&S. From this the weighting fraction (i.e., the fraction of canopy top versus canopy bottom temperature "seen" by the radiometer) can be derived, as can an equation for the view zenith angle at which the radiometric and equivalent isothermal surface temperatures are the same. Field data indicate that multiangle radiometric surface temperatures alone cannot determine the three unknowns describing the foliage temperature profile. Several strategies to overcome this problem are outlined. The parameterization may eventually help to interpret remotely sensed infrared surface temperatures and to improve estimates of sensible heat flux and evapotranspiration, but comprehensive field testing is still needed.

AB The project captured a subset of the hydrological cycle for the tropical island of O'ahu, linking precipitation to groundwater recharge and aquifer storage. We determined seasonal storm events contributed more to aquifer recharge than year-round baseline orographic trade wind rainfall. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope values from an island-wide rain collector network with 20 locations deployed for 16 months and sampled at 3-month intervals were used to create the first local meteoric water line for O'ahu. Isotopic measurements were influenced by the amount effect, seasonality, storm type, and La Nina, though little elevation control was noted. Certain groundwater compositions from legacy data showed a strong similarity with collected precipitation from our stations. The majority of these significant relationships were between wet season precipitation and groundwater. A high number of moderate and heavy rainfall days during the dry season, large percentage of event-based rainfall, and wind directions outside of the typical NE trade wind direction were characteristics of the 2017-2018 wet season. This indicates that the majority of wet season precipitation is from event-based storms rather than typical trade wind weather. The deuterium-excess values provided the strongest evidence of a relationship between groundwater and different precipitation sources, indicating that this may be a useful metric for determining the extent of recharge from different rain events and systems.

AB [1] A land surface-atmosphere-radiometer model was applied to field data at the First International Satellite-Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE). The model converts from radiometric surface temperature taken at any zenith view angle to an equivalent isothermal (or aerodynamic) surface temperature. With data from one day at a grassy site with a leaf area index of 1.0, values of the three unknowns in the model, which describe the shape of the vertical foliage temperature profile, were found which best agree with reference radiometric and aerodynamic surface temperatures at the site. Having shown that the model can be optimized to be consistent with field data, the model was applied to data taken at the same site on the next day. In this case the model was not optimized but was used in a predictive mode to convert from a radiometric to an aerodynamic surface temperature. The aerodynamic temperatures predicted by the model were closer to the reference values (that is, estimates of aerodynamic temperature obtained by inverting Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory) than were the radiometric surface temperatures in all cases, for an average improvement of 3.6 K.

   FORMULA
AB The vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration remains a subject of active research given its relevance to a plethora of problems in hydraulics, hydrology, ecology, and water quality control. Many of the classical theories developed over the course of 90 years represent the effects of turbulence on suspended sediments (SS) using an effective mixing length or eddy diffusivity without explicitly accounting for the energetics of turbulent eddies across scales. To address this gap, the turbulent flux of sediments is derived using a co-spectral budget (CSB) model that can be imminently used in SS and other fine particle transport models. The CSB closes the pressure-redistribution effect using a spectral linear Rotta scheme modified to include isotropization of production and interactions between turbulent eddies and sediment grains through a modified scale-dependent de-correlation time. The result is a formulation similar in complexity to the widely used Rouse's equation but with all characteristic scales, Reynolds number, and Schmidt number effects derived from well-established spectral shapes of the vertical velocity and accepted constants from turbulence models. Finally, the proposed CSB model can recover Prandtl's and Rouse's equations under restricted conditions.

AB Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of water storage changes is crucial for Ethiopia, a country that is facing a range of challenges in water management caused by anthropogenic impacts as well as climate variability. In addition to this, the scarcity of in situ measurements of soil moisture and groundwater, combined with intrinsic "scale limitations" of traditional methods used in hydrological characterization are further limiting the ability to assess water resource distribution in the region. The primary objective of this study is therefore to apply remotely sensed and model data over Ethiopia in order to (i) test the performance of models and remotely sensed data in modeling water resources distribution in un-gauged arid regions of Ethiopia, (ii) analyze the inter-annual and seasonal variability as well as changes in total water storage (TWS) over Ethiopia, (iii) understand the relationship between TWS changes, rainfall, and soil moisture anomalies over the study region, and (iv) identify the relationship between the characteristics of aquifers and TWS changes. The data used in this study includes; monthly gravity field data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model. Our investigation covers a period of 8 years from 2003 to 2011. The results of the study show that the western part and the north-eastern lowlands of Ethiopia experienced decrease in TWS water between 2003-2011, whereas all the other regions gained water during the study period. The impact of rainfall seasonality was also seen in the TWS changes. Applying the statistical method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to TWS, soil moisture and rainfall variations indentified the dominant annual water variability in the western, north-western, northern, and central regions, and the dominant seasonal variability in the western, north-western, and the eastern regions. A correlation analysis between TWS and rainfall indicated a minimum time lag of zero to a maximum of six months, whereas no lag is noticeable between soil moisture anomalies and TWS changes. The delay response and correlation coefficient between rainfall and TWS appears to be related to recharge mechanisms, revealing that most regions of Ethiopia receive indirect recharge. Our results also show that the magnitude of TWS changes is higher in the western region and lower in the north-eastern region, and that the elevation influences soil moisture as well as TWS.

AB There are now many examples of hydrological models that utilise the capabilities of Geographic Information Systems to generate spatially distributed predictions of behaviour. However. the spatial variability of hydrological parameters relating to distributions of soils and vegetation can be hard to establish. In this paper, the relationship between a soil hydrological classification Hydrology of Soil Types (HOST) and the spatial parameters of a conceptual catchment-scale model is investigated. A procedure involving inverse modelling using Monte-Carlo simulations on two catchments is developed to identify relative values for soil related parameters of the DIY model. The relative values determine the internal variability of hydrological processes as a function of the soil type.
   For three out of the four soil parameters studied, the variability between HOST classes was found to be consistent across two catchments when tested independently. Problems in identifying values for the fourth 'fast response distance' parameter have highlighted a potential limitation with the present structure of the model. The present assumption that this parameter can be related simply to soil type rather than topography appears to be inadequate. With the exclusion of this parameter. calibrated parameter sets from one catchment can be converted into equivalent parameter sets for the alternate catchment on the basis of their HOST distributions. to give a reasonable simulation of flow.
   Following further testing on different catchments, and modifications to the definition of the fast response distance parameter. the technique provides a methodology whereby it is possible to directly derive spatial soil parameters for new catchments.

AB Physics-based distributed hydrological models that include groundwater are widely used to understand and predict physical and biogeochemical processes within watersheds. Typically, due to computational limitations, watershed modelers minimize the number of elements used in domain discretization, smoothing or even ignoring critical topographic features. We use an idealized model to investigate the implications of mesh refinement along streams and ridges for modeling three-dimensional groundwater flow and transport in mountainous watersheds. For varying degrees of topographic complexity level (TCL), which increases with the level of mesh refinement, and geological heterogeneity, we estimate and compare steady state baseflow discharge, mean age, and concentration of subsurface weathering products. Results show that ignoring lower-order streams or ridges diminishes flow through local flow paths and biases higher the contribution of intermediate and regional flow paths, and biases baseflow older. The magnitude of the bias increases for systems where permeability rapidly decreases with depth and is dominated by shallow flow paths. Based on a simple geochemical model, the concentration of weathering products is less sensitive to the TCL, partially due to the thermodynamic constraints on chemical reactions. Our idealized model also reproduces the observed emergent scaling relationship between the groundwater contribution to streamflow and drainage area, and finds that this scaling relationship is not sensitive to mesh TCL. The bias effects have important implications for the use of hydrological models in the interpretation of environmental tracer data and the prediction of biogeochemical evolution of stream water in mountainous watersheds.
   Plain Language Summary Topography controls the movement of water and solutes within watersheds and their export to streams via groundwater drainage. Mainly due to computational limitations, it is common practice to use numerical meshes that capture the high-order (i.e., large) streams and ignore or undersample low-order (i.e., small) streams and their ridges. However, low-order streams are hotspots for groundwater drainage and solute export, and their ridges recharge a significant amount of water feeding aquifers and alluvial valleys downstream. By systematically comparing groundwater flow and transport characteristics from models with different degrees of topographic fidelity along streams and ridges, we find that even though ignoring low-order streams and ridges has a modest effect in the net amount of discharge generated by the whole watershed, it causes significant changes in the complex network of subsurface flow paths, which distribute water and solutes throughout the system. These changes bias estimates of recharge and discharge, residence times, and solute fluxes to streams, and they are more evident in watersheds with tight bedrock and primarily shallow groundwater flow. This bias hampers our ability to model and predict hydrologic response and directly influences the management of water resources and water quality for human consumption and ecosystem functioning.

ID FIELD
AB The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of simulating the profiles of the mean velocity and turbulence intensities for the steep open channel flows over a smooth boundary using artificial neural networks. In a laboratory flume, turbulent flow conditions were measured using a fibre-optic laser doppler velocimeter (FLDV). One thousand and sixty-four data sets were collected for different slopes and aspect ratios at different locations. These data sets were randomly split into two subsets, i.e. training and validation sets. The multi-layer functional link network (MFLN) was used to construct the simulation model based on the training data. The constructed MFLN models can almost perfectly simulate the velocity profile and turbulence intensity. The values of correlation coefficient (gamma) are close to one and the values of root mean square error (RMSE) are close to zero in all conditions. The results demonstrate that the MFLN can precisely simulate the velocity profiles, while the log law and Reynolds stress model (RSM) are less effective when used to simulate the velocity profiles close to the side wall. The simulated longitudinal turbulence intensities yielded by the MFLN were also fairly consistent with the measured data, while the simulated vertical turbulence intensities by the RSM were not consistent with the measured data.

   UNITED-STATES; FLOW INDEX; DATA SET; HYDROLOGY; CLASSIFICATION;
   RECESSION; RUNOFF
AB There is no general theory to explain differences in baseflow between catchments, despite evidence that it is mainly controlled by climate and landscape. One hypothesis is that baseflow fraction (the ratio between baseflow and precipitation) can be primarily attributed to the aridity index (the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation), that is, that there is a "baseflow Budyko curve." Comparing catchment data from the United States and the United Kingdom shows, however, that aridity is not always a good predictor of baseflow fraction. We use the revised Ponce-Shetty annual water balance model to show that there is no single "baseflow Budyko curve" but rather a continuum of curves emerging from a more universal model that incorporates both climate and landscape factors. In humid catchments, baseflow fraction is highly variable due to variations in a catchment's wetting potential, a parameter that describes catchment storage capacity. In arid catchments, vaporization limits baseflow generation, which leads to lower variability in baseflow fraction. Generally, when the magnitude of precipitation is important, the aridity index only partly explains baseflow response. Adapting the model to explain variability of the baseflow index (the ratio between baseflow and total streamflow) shows that the aridity index is generally a poor predictor of baseflow index. While the wetting potentials and other parameters are obtained by fitting the Ponce-Shetty model to annual catchment data, their links to physical properties remain to be explored. This currently limits the model's applicability to gauged catchments with sufficiently long records.
   Plain Language Summary Baseflow originates from stored water (e.g., groundwater) and sustains river flow in dry periods, which makes it an important water resource. Baseflow is known to vary with climate and landscape properties such as geology or vegetation, but there is no universal theory to explain this variability. To explore baseflow variability, we use data from several hundred catchments in the United States and the United Kingdom. We investigate whether a catchment's baseflow fraction, that is, the fraction of rainfall that becomes baseflow, can be attributed primarily to the aridity index, a commonly used climate index. The aridity index is defined as the ratio between potential evapotranspiration (available energy) and precipitation (available water). We find that in humid catchments (low aridity index), baseflow cannot be attributed primarily to the aridity index. Rather, a catchment's capacity to store water determines how much precipitation becomes baseflow. In arid catchments (high aridity index), the aridity index can be seen as the primary determinant of baseflow fraction. It strongly influences how much of the precipitation can be evaporated back to the atmosphere and thus cannot become baseflow. These results might help to assess how water availability (in the form of baseflow) changes with changing climate and land use.

AB Michaelis-Menten kinetics describe a broad range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Since they are non-linear, spatial averaging of reaction kinetics is non-trivial, and it is not known how concentration gradients affect the global effective kinetics. Here, we use numerical simulations and theoretical developments to investigate the effective kinetics of diffusing solute pulses locally subject to Michaelis-Menten reaction kinetics. We find that coupled diffusion and reaction lead to non-monotonic effective kinetics that differ significantly from the local kinetics. The resulting effective reaction rates can be significantly enhanced compared to those of homogeneous batch reactors. We uncover the different regimes of effective kinetics as a function of the Damkohler number and Michaelis-Menten parameters and derive a theory that explains and quantifies these upscaled kinetics using a weakly-coupled description of reaction and diffusion. We illustrate the consequences of these findings on the accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria. These results are relevant to a large spectrum of reactive systems characterized by heterogeneous concentration landscapes.

AB The use of a neuro-fuzzy approach is proposed to model the dynamics of entrainment of a coarse particle by rolling. It is hypothesized that near-bed turbulent flow structures of different magnitude and duration or frequency and energy content are responsible for the particle displacement. A number of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) architectures are proposed and developed to link the hydrodynamic forcing exerted on a solid particle to its response, and model the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the system. ANFIS combines the advantages of fuzzy inference (If-Then) rules with the power of learning and adaptation of the neural networks. The model components and forecasting procedure are discussed in detail. To demonstrate the model's applicability for near-threshold flow conditions an example is provided, where flow velocity and particle displacement data from flume experiments are used as input and output for the training and testing of the ANFIS models. In particular, a Laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) is employed to obtain long records of local streamwise velocity components upstream of a mobile exposed particle. These measurements are acquired synchronously with the time history of the particle's position detected by a setup including a He-Ne laser and a photodetector. The representation of the input signal in the time and frequency domain is implemented and the best performing models are found capable of reproducing the complex dynamics of particle response. Following a trial and error approach the different models are compared in terms of their efficiency and forecast accuracy using a number of performance indices.

AB Within hydrology performance criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency have been used to condition the parameter space of a model. Their use is motivated by the fact that the stochastic error series between a model output and corresponding observations is the result of the composite effect of multiple error sources which cannot be described, even in form, a priori. This paper formalises the use of such performance criteria within a Bayesian framework, such as Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), by introducing the concept of informal Likelihoods. Informal Likelihoods are used to characterise desirable features in the relationship between the model output and corresponding observed data. A number of common performance criteria are considered as Informal Likelihoods. Analytical results and a simulation indicate all of the performance criteria considered as Informal Likelihoods in this paper have one or more properties which may be considered undesirable, but may perform no less well in conditioning model parameters than formal likelihoods for which the assumptions are only mildly incorrect.

AB Risk analysis plays an important role in decision making for real-time flood control operation of complex flood control systems. A typical flood control system consists of reservoirs, river channels, and downstream control points. The system generally is characterized by nonlinearity and large scale. Additionally, the input variables are mostly stochastic. Because of the dimensionality problem, generally, it would not be possible to carry out risk analysis without decomposition. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-integration approach whereby the original complex flood control system is decomposed into a number of independent subsystems. We conduct risk analysis for each subsystem and then integrate the results by means of combination theory of stochastic processes. We evaluate the propagation of uncertainties through the complex flood control system and calculate the risk of reservoir overtopping, as well as the risk of flooding at selected downstream control points. We apply the proposed methodology to a flood control system in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River basin in China. The results show that the proposed method is practical and provides a way to estimate the risks in real-time flood control operation of a complex flood control system.

TI EULERIAN-LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS OF TRANSPORT CONDITIONED ON HYDRAULIC DATA
   .2. EFFECTS OF LOG TRANSMISSIVITY AND HYDRAULIC-HEAD MEASUREMENTS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALE DISPERSION; MOMENTS; FIELDS; MEDIA
AB In paper 1 of this series we described an analytical-numerical method to predict deterministically solute transport under uncertainty. The method is based on a unified Eulerian-Lagrangian theory which allows conditioning of the predictions on hydraulic measurements. Conditioning on measured concentrations is also possible, as demonstrated by Neuman et al. (1993). In this paper we condition velocity on log transmissivity and/or hydraulic head data via cokriging. We then combine an early time analytical solution with a pseudo-Fickian Galerkin finite element scheme for later time to obtain conditional predictions of concentration and lower bounds on its variance and coefficient of variation. The pseudo-Fickian scheme involves a conditional dispersion tenser which depends on information and varies in space-time. Hence the predicted plumes travel along curved trajectories and attain irregular, non-Gaussian shapes. We also compute a measure of uncertainty for the original source location of a solute ''particle'' whose position at some later time is known from sampling. Spatial maps of this ''particle origin covariance'' provide vivid images of preferential flow paths and exclusion zones identified by the available data. We illustrate these concepts and results on instantaneous point and area sources.

AB Adaptation planning in Alaska, as in other snowy parts of the world, will require snow projections, yet snow is a challenging variable to measure, simulate and downscale. Here we describe the construction and evaluation of 771-m-resolution gridded historical and statistically downscaled projections of snow/rain partitioning for the state of Alaska at decadal temporal resolution. The method developed here uses observational data to describe the relationship between average monthly temperature and the fraction of wet days in that month receiving snow, the snow-day fraction. Regionally and seasonally specific equations were developed to accommodate variability in synoptic scale climatology of rain and snow events. These equations were then applied to gridded decadal temperature data and projections. The gridded products provide a reasonable characterization of snow-day fraction throughout the state. However, there are local deviations from the regional relationships, particularly in the topographically complex areas ringing the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet. When applied to questions about changing precipitation regimes in northern, western and south-eastern Alaska, these data demonstrate the potential for marked changes from snow-dominated to mixed precipitation regimes and also exhibit a wide range of potential future conditions.

AB Stemflow production within a red oak (Quercus rubra L.)-sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) -American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) dominated stand in southern Ontario was evaluated during the growing season of 1995. For events that produced stemflow from all sampled tree boles (rainfall >= 4.3 mm), the geometric mean Herwitz (Earth Surf. Process. Landforms 11 (1986) 401) tunnelling ratios were 7.3, 20.6, and 26.3 for oak, maple, and beech, respectively. Geometric mean funnelling ratios for these three species increased in a linear fashion with increasing rainfall depth for events ranging from 4.3 to 17.4 mm. However, funnelling ratios for the two larger rainfall events measured during the study (27.4 and 40.1 mm) were relatively small, suggesting that after a certain rainfall depth threshold has been reached, trees become less efficient at diverting intercepted rainfall to their holes. Significant (alpha = 0. 10) positive linear relationships were found between stemflow production (1/tree) and beech basal area for all rainfall events >= 2.2 rum, while for oak and maple such relationships corresponded with only some relatively large rainfall events. Possible causes for the discrepancies in the funnelling efficiencies of the three tree species and between relatively small and large events are provided. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Freezing and thawing of soil have a significant impact on the thermal-hydrological processes in cold regions. Freezing point and unfrozen water content are key variables characterizing the freezing and thawing of soil. The testing results show that unfrozen water content is independent of initial water content in nonsaline silt, based on which a unified model for a soil freezing characteristic curve (SFCC) is presented. The SFCC describes the relationship between unfrozen water content and temperature for variably-saturated saline soils. It is also demonstrated that the SFCC can describe the variation of soil freezing point with respect to water content and salt concentration. The SFCC model is validated by comparing the experimental data to the calculated result for unfrozen water content and freezing point in a variety of conditions. When the initial water content varies in saline soil, the SFCC changes with constant initial salt concentration, but it remains unchanged with constant gravimetric salt content. The SFCC model can be adopted in the simulation of thermal-hydrological processes in arid and saline lands and coastal regions. Finally, an example of thermal-hydrological processes was simulated with the new SFCC model to show the application of the presented model.

AB [1] The purpose of this study is to investigate the connection between bed load, channel processes, and sediment sources in mountain basins using data from the Rio Cordon basin ( northeastern Italian Alps). The main channel is a steep, boulder bed, step pool stream, and bed load volumes are measured at a special facility where particles > 20 mm are trapped. Results from a combined frequency analysis of peak water discharges and total bed load volumes based on 17 years of field data are presented, focusing on discrepancies between recurrence intervals of peak discharge and bed load volume for each event. A cause of major disturbance is a high-magnitude, low-recurrence event that occurred in 1994. Dimensional and nondimensional bed load intensity-duration curves are also reported, which emphasize differences between short-and long-duration events. The relationship flow - bed load rates ( investigated using a total of 180 data) shows no breakpoints, and two different curves are evident, representing pre-1994 and post-1994 floods, respectively. The analysis demonstrates both the control exerted by sediment availability on bed load transport rates and the persisting long-term impact of major floods on mountain streams.

AB Forecast ensembles are a convenient means to model water resources uncertainties and to inform planning and management processes. For multipurpose reservoir systems, forecast types include (i) forecasts of upcoming inflows and (ii) forecasts of system variables and outputs such as reservoir levels, releases, flood damage risks, hydropower production, water supply withdrawals, water quality conditions, navigation opportunities, and environmental flows, among others. Forecasts of system variables and outputs are conditional on forecasted inflows as well as on specific management policies and can provide useful information for decision-making processes. Unlike inflow forecasts (in ensemble or other forms), which have been the subject of many previous studies, reservoir system variable and output forecasts are not formally assessed in water resources management theory or practice. This article addresses this gap and develops methods to rectify potential reservoir system forecast inconsistencies and improve the quality of management-relevant information provided to stakeholders and managers. The overarching conclusion is that system variable and output forecast consistency is critical for robust reservoir management and needs to be routinely assessed for any management model used to inform planning and management processes. The above are demonstrated through an application from the Sacramento-American-San Joaquin reservoir system in northern California.

TI Characterizing Physical Properties of Streambed Interface Sediments
   Using In Situ Complex Electrical Conductivity Measurements
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Streambed sediment physical properties such as surface area, are difficult to quantify in situ but exert a high-level control on a wide range of biogeochemical processes and sorption of contaminants. We introduce the use of complex electrical conductivity (CC) methods (also known as spectral-induced polarization (SIP)) that measure both real and imaginary conductivity to noninvasively and efficiently characterize shallow streambed sediments. We explore the method through synthetic modeling, laboratory, and field measurements to demonstrate the sensitivity of imaginary conductivity to sediment surface area, controlled in part by fine-grained iron oxides produced by anoxic groundwater discharge. Laboratory measurements verify expected relationships between CC parameters and sediment properties. Synthetic modeling using a 1D analytical model illustrates the influence of water layer depth and conductivity on the field CC measurements made at the streambed-stream water interface. Specifically, the inverted sediment imaginary conductivity is less impacted by uncertainty in the water layer depth and conductivity relative to the real conductivity and phase shift. Field CC measurements along a landfill-impacted river reveal discrete streambed zones with enhanced bulk surface area generally corresponding to anoxic groundwater discharge zones with high concentrations of fine-grained iron oxide precipitates.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEM; ENERGY; SYSTEM
AB Ecohydrological systems are complex, open dissipative systems characterized by couplings and feedback between subsystems at many scales of space and time. The information flow process network approach is developed to analyze such systems, using time series data to delineate the feedback, time scales, and subsystems that define the complex system's organization. Network statistics are used to measure the statistical feedback, entropy, and net and gross information production of subsystems on the network to study monthly process networks for a Midwestern corn-soybean ecosystem for the years 1998-2006. Several distinct system states are identified and characterized. Particularly interesting is the midsummer state that is dominated by regional-scale information feedback and by information flow originating from the ecosystem's photosynthetic activity. In this state, information flows both "top-down'' from synoptic weather systems and "bottom-up'' from the plant photosynthetic activity. A threshold in air temperature separates this summer state where increased organization appears from other system states. The relationship between Shannon entropy and information flow is investigated. It is found that information generally flows from high-entropy variables to low-entropy variables, and moderate-entropy variables participate in feedback.

AB Two-dimensional numerical simulations of two-phase (DNAPL-water) flow in spatially correlated random fields demonstrate the influence of nonwetting phase (NWP) relative permeability saturation (k(r,N)-S-w) relationships correlated to porous media intrinsic permeability (k). Both the volume of porous media invaded by the NWP and the length of time during which the NWP is migrating are under predicted if k(r),(N)-k correlation is not accounted for in the model formulation. Not accounting for the k(r),(N)-k correlation resulted in under predicting the volume of porous media invaded by up to approximately 10%, which is likely not significant for many practical applications. However, not accounting for the k(r),(N)-k correlation resulted in under predicting field scale migration times by up to a factor of 4, which is likely significant in that the migration times are on the order of years to several decades for the DNAPL (1,2-DCE) considered in this study. The under prediction of migration times was greater for lower permeability aquifers. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a methodology that combines numerical simulations of groundwater flow and advective transport in heterogeneous porous media with analytical retention models for computing the infection risk probability from pathogens in aquifers. The methodology is based on the analytical results presented in [1,2] for utilising the colloid filtration theory in a time-domain random walk framework. It is shown that in uniform flow, the results from the numerical simulations of advection yield comparable results as the analytical TDRW model for generating advection segments. It is shown that spatial variability of the attachment rate may be significant, however, it appears to affect risk in a different manner depending on if the flow is uniform or radially converging. In spite of the fact that numerous issues remain open regarding pathogen transport in aquifers on the field scale, the methodology presented here may be useful for screening purposes, and may also serve as a basis for future studies that would include greater complexity.

AB Free-surface flows are usually modelled by means of the Shallow-water Equations: this system of hyperbolic equations exhibits a source term which is proportional to the product of the water depth by the bed slope, and which takes into account the effect of gravity onto fluid mass. Recently, much attention has been paid to the case in which bottom discontinuities are present in the physical domain to be represented: in this case, it is difficult to define the non-conservative product in the distributional sense. Here, the discontinuous-bottom Shallow-water Equations with hydrostatic pressure distribution at the bed step (Bernetti et al., 2006) are discussed in the context of the theory of Dal Maso et al. (1995)191; finally, a first-order numerical scheme is presented, which is consistent for regular solutions, and which is able to capture contact discontinuities at bottom steps. Numerous tests are presented to show the feasibility of the scheme and its ability to converge to the exact solution in the cases of smooth as well as discontinuous bed profiles.

TI MODEL-BUILDING AND JUDGMENT - IMPLICATIONS FOR BENEFIT TRANSFERS WITH
   TRAVEL COST MODELS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RECREATION DEMAND MODELS; ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS; TIME
AB Benefit transfer is the process by which researchers take recreational demand models or other models which are estimated for one site or region and apply them to another site or region. Model estimation is frequently viewed as a simple exercise in classical statistics. Here it is argued that, while standard hypothesis testing plays a role in model estimation, it may be less important than the researcher's judgment about how the model ought to work. The power of economics lies principally with the logic of theory, and then with the strength of empirical evidence. These arguments are illustrated using the travel cost approach to estimating the demand for recreation. There are several major research issues (for example, the role of substitute prices) which influence the final estimates of benefits but which must be determined at least in part by the researcher. The implication for benefit transfer is that this is also within the realm of judgment for the researcher, but that it will be more acceptable when judgment is recognized. That is, the original benefit estimates are tailored for a specific application. They cannot be treated as if they came from a strictly random process. Recognizing this tailoring process will put the researcher in a better position for transferring model results.

AB Streambed seepage can be predicted using an analytical solution to the one-dimensional heat transport equation to take advantage of the relationship between streambed thermal properties, seepage flux, and the amplitude ratio and phase shift associated with streambed temperature signals. This paper explores the accuracy of streambed-seepage velocity estimates from this method when uncertainty in input parameters exists. Uncertainty in sensor spacing, thermal diffusivity, and the accuracy of temperature sensors were examined both individually and in combination using Monte Carlo analysis. The analytical solution correctly reproduced known thermal front velocities above 1.25 m d(-1), using both the amplitude-ratio and phase-shift methods, despite introduced uncertainty in any of the variables. Noise in temperature measurements (because of sensor accuracy) caused erroneous prediction of velocity for gaining stream conditions using both the amplitude ratio and phase shift. Uncertainty in the thermal diffusivity and sensor spacing resulted in incorrect velocity, primarily under gaining conditions, when using the amplitude ratio and near-zero velocity using the phase shift. For a sensor accuracy of 0.15 degrees C, we present combinations of parameters for which the resulting signal amplitude is sufficiently large for use with the Stallman equation.

AB [1] This study is mainly aimed at assessing the adequacy of laboratory-based soil hydraulic characterization carried out on undisturbed cores for reproducing the in situ soil hydraulic behavior. Assuming that the laboratory sample size is a representative elementary volume (REV) for a single horizon of the soil profiles examined, the analysis of the hysteretic features of the soil water retention function is used to explain the differences observed in the constitutive soil water relationships as obtained from either laboratory or in situ experiments. Because the wetting procedures differ in laboratory and in field experiments, it is argued that the difference in the obtained hydraulic characteristics is the result of different hysteretic paths. From the comparison of measured hydraulic conductivities we deduce that field and laboratory retention curves are a part of the same hysteresis loop. In such a context the field hydraulic functions can be derived from the laboratory functions using the maximum water content (i.e., at zero pressure head) and air entry value measured in the field. It is shown that the field parameters identified from the measurements in the early phases of the field test are sufficient to reliably describe field hydrological behavior.

AB Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used for hydrological simulation. Previous studies have reported that conventional ML models fail to accurately simulate extreme flows which are crucial for design flood estimation and associated risk analysis in the context of climate change. Therefore, this study proposes a joint probabilistic rainfall-runoff model (JPRR) for improving high-to-extreme flow projection. With the aid of paired copula constructions, bootstrap aggregation, and multi-model ensemble approaches, the proposed model is able to effectively characterize the dependence relationships of predictors (i.e., precipitation time series with different moving sums) with various probability distributions. JPRR has been applied to four pristine basins in China, representing different climate zones and landscapes. The results reveal that JPRR significantly outperforms three well-known ML models (i.e., random forest, artificial neural networks, and long short-term memory) in high-to-extreme flow simulations. In JPRR, the copulas exhibiting the right tail dependence play a more important role in streamflow simulations at mountainous basins. Moreover, a significant difference in streamflow projections (from 2030 to 2099) derived from JPRR and benchmark models imply that flood risks from conventional ML models may be underestimated under changing climatic conditions.

ID STACKED GENERALIZATION; TIME-SERIES; MODELS; SITES; CLASSIFICATION
AB In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are introduced to obtain improved regional low-flow estimates at ungauged sites. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) network is used to identify the functional relationship between low-flow quantiles and the physiographic variables. Each ANN is trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To improve the generalization ability of a single ANN, several ANNs trained for the same task are used as an ensemble. The bootstrap aggregation (or bagging) approach is used to generate individual networks in the ensemble. The stacked generalization (or stacking) technique is adopted to combine the member networks of an ANN ensemble. The proposed approaches are applied to selected catchments in the province of Quebec, Canada, to obtain estimates for several representative low-flow quantiles of summer and winter seasons. The jackknife validation procedure is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The ANN-based approaches are compared with the traditional parametric regression models. The results indicate that both the single and ensemble ANN models provide superior estimates than the traditional regression models. The ANN ensemble approaches provide better generalization ability than the single ANN models.

AB A simulation model flow in cutover peat systems (FLOCOPS) was developed to improve the current understanding of the hydrology of cutover peatlands and the water management programs designed to restore them. FLOCOPS considers temporal variability in peat bulk density, shrinkage character and theta-Psi (soil moisture-pressure head) relationships, volume changes due to compression, and changes to saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) and saturated volumetric soil moisture (theta(S)). FLOCOPS was evaluated by comparing simulated and observed 1998-1999 trends in elevation change (thickness of peat deposit), water table, theta, and Psi. FLOCOPS effectively represented observed trends in elevation change, theta, and Psi. A sensitivity analysis indicated that FLOCOPS was most sensitive to the retention, storage, and consolidation characteristics of the peat. Volume changes reduced hydrological variability, whereas low water retentivity and high water storage helped maintain high and stable theta, Psi, and water table position. The sensitivity of the peat system's hydrology to changes in pore structure suggests that minimizing changes to the peat's characteristic pore structure during extraction and subsequent abandonment of the peatland will result in significantly more favorable hydrological conditions for bog restoration.

AB [1] Stream temperature is a measure of water quality and directly influences both the biotic and abiotic dynamics within the aquatic system. Because of its importance, there is a need to find better methods of monitoring and modeling stream temperatures. Gardner et al. [2003] derived a networked geostatistical model to explain the spatial patterns of stream temperatures based on 72 temperature loggers recording stream temperatures hourly throughout the Beaverkill watershed network, New York, for a single time period. Because temperatures and temperature relationships between stream sections change over the season, the covariance structure of the system is likely also to change with time. The covariance structure of stream temperature data collected throughout the month of July was examined and found to be nonstationary temporally. However, the observed changes in the covariance structure were found to be highly dependent on main stem stream temperatures over time. Five nested correlation models were created and compared using Mallow's C-p. One model representing large-scale variation in the sill as a linear function of the main stem temperature for each day was selected as the most parsimonious model.

AB Indigenous water rights contests take many forms, manifesting in conflict over water resource development, exclusion from decision-making, marginalization in regional political economies and opposition to environmental degradation. A growing number of institutional options are available to recognize Indigenous water rights and a diversity of approaches is being taken by governments, courts of law, Indigenous peoples and others in response to historical and contemporary inequities and discrimination in patterns of distribution and participation in the institutions of water governance. Although not the only arena, political action directed towards change in state-based institutions is a principal focus for Indigenous peoples engaged in water struggles. This article reviews the literature on Indigenous water rights in national frameworks of water governance from a range of disciplines. It describes the leading approaches to recognition, representation, and redistribution that exist under the domestic arrangements of nation-states to recognize localized norms and rules of water use and custodianship, as well as Indigenous forms of political organization. These include statutory mechanisms to increase water access, treaties and settlements, constitutional protections for collective rights, self-organized or internal governance models, market-based approaches and moves in law to recognize reciprocal relationships to water and legitimize custodianship of rivers. Rather than take recognition for granted as an essential condition of or ideal end-point to Indigenous water rights struggles, the paper critically reflects on the multi-faceted dimensions of this ambivalent concept, revealing the opportunities as well as tensions and dilemmas in the leading approaches to addressing Indigenous water rights claims.

AB In this paper, we use a theoretical framework of coupled human and natural systems to review the methodological advances in urban water demand modeling over the past 3 decades. The goal of this review is to quantify the capacity of increasingly complex modeling techniques to account for complex human and natural processes, uncertainty, and resilience across spatial and temporal scales. This review begins with coupled human and natural systems theory and situates urban water demand within this framework. The second section reviews urban water demand literature and summarizes methodological advances in relation to four central themes: (1) interactions within and across multiple spatial and temporal scales, (2) acknowledgment and quantification of uncertainty, (3) identification of thresholds, nonlinear system response, and the consequences for resilience, and (4) the transition from simple statistical modeling to fully integrated dynamic modeling. This review will show that increasingly effective models have resulted from technological advances in spatial science and innovations in statistical methods. These models provide unbiased, accurate estimates of the determinants of urban water demand at increasingly fine spatial and temporal resolution. Dynamic models capable of incorporating alternative future scenarios and local stochastic analysis are leading a trend away from deterministic prediction.

   pressure-saturation-interfacial area relation under transient conditions

AB Capillary pressure (P-c) and phase saturation (S-w) in two-phase flow are well known to be hysteretically related. Thermodynamically-derived multiphase flow theories conjecture that this hysteresis will be lifted if specific interfacial area (a(nw)) is included as a new state variable to create a unique P-c-S-a(nw) surface. Specific interfacial area is defined as the total interfacial area per volume of a porous medium. Several studies have confirmed the existence of a unique P-c-S-w-a(nw) surface under equilibrium conditions for a given porous medium. However, there is only one experimental work in the literature, where the uniqueness of this surface under transient conditions was questioned. However, in the data analysis only the terminal menisci were considered to calculate the specific interfacial area.
   In this paper, we investigate the uniqueness of P-c-S-a(nw) surfaces with and without the inclusion of corner fluid-fluid interfacial area, under different dynamic conditions, in two different micro-models bearing two different (granular vs. triangulated) pore morphologies. We establish a systematic metric to analyze hysteresis under different hydrodynamic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Characterizing zones of a watershed based on the water table is used to understand and predict internal watershed processes. In watersheds dominated by lateral preferential flow, the water table response typically shows a distinct hydraulically limited pattern. This response is characterized by a capping of the rising water table when the lateral preferential flow features are activated and subsurface flow still increases. We expected that this response would be related to the contributing area since nearby hillslope excavations showed that the development of preferential flow network was positively correlated with the contributing area. The watershed was stratified into three predetermined zones and installed 25 piezometers to measure the water table dynamics. The objectives were (1) to characterize the water table-runoff relationship, (2) to prove preferential flow by observable characteristics and (3) to test the feasibility of identifying areas within a watershed that are dominated by lateral preferential flow. Watershed zones were not well defined and there was no strong relationship between the hydraulically limited response and observable watershed characteristics. Although zones might still be useful for grouping the hillslope processes, the piezometric response may not be an appropriate indicator for mapping the watershed into areas with runoff dominated by lateral preferential flow.

ID RUNOFF MODEL
AB A geomorphologic kinematic-wave (GKW) model was developed for simulation of extreme floods from small alpine catchments. The GKW model couples the kinematic-wave theory and the geomorphologic representation of the catchment based on the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme. The model was tested on two small alpine catchments in Switzerland, and the agreement between simulated and observed floods was good. Care must however be taken with the computation of slope and roughness parameters. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In crop simulation models the water subroutine computes evaporation and transpiration separately. This property allows a greater confidence in the simulation of the early crop stages in terms of water requirements. In the present article the authors suggest a semiempirical model of the drying stage of soil evaporation that can be easily integrated into various crop models. The model is based on a physical approach, yet it depends solely on permanent soil properties and on some key data on the local climate. The basic theory relies upon the mass balance of a dry surface layer of varying thickness. After successive assumptions on the main limiting factors of the drying process, the authors demonstrate that this process can be described by one equation relating actual to potential evaporation. The advantage of this formula comes from its introducing just one synthetic parameter that can be expressed as the product of two components: a climatic one and a pedological one. When compared with experimental data, the results of the model show that the order of magnitude of the evaporative process is respected, which is required for crop models.

DE Gravity currents; Theoretical model; Reflection process; Entrainment
ID CURRENT FLOW; ENTRAINMENT; SIMULATIONS
AB When a gravity current interacts with a barrier the flow is reflected back in the form of a moving hydraulic jump or bore. This latter phenomenon has important implications for estuarine mixing and sediment reworking in the oceanographic context. In order to examine those reflection processes two-dimensional gravity currents interacting with slopes and overhanging barriers are examined by laboratory experiments and theoretical analysis. Relevant parameters such as the initial volume of the dense fluid, the opening of the fixed gate used for the dense fluid release and the angle of the slope or overhang positioned inside the tank, were varied. An image analysis technique based on light attenuation was applied to evaluate the instantaneous density fields. The theoretical predictions, based on shallow-water theory, give reasonable agreement compared with the laboratory experiments about the spatial position of the dense current and the definition of the point where the reflection process starts. Moreover, the analysis of the density fields highlights the presence of areas within the dense current characterized by a greater dilution due to the reflection of the current. Nevertheless, the bulk entrainment parameter is only slightly affected by the presence of a steep slope or overhang.

   MODEL; SERIES; MULTIFRACTALS; DISTRIBUTIONS; FIELDS
AB Multiplicative random cascades (MRCs) can parsimoniously generate highly intermittent patterns similar to those in rainfall. The elemental MRC model parameter is the cascade weight, which determines how rainfall at one scale is partitioned at the next smallest scale in the cascade. While it is known that the probability density of these weights may vary with both time scale and rainfall intensity, nearly all previous studies have considered either time scale or intensity separately. We examined the simultaneous dependency of the weights on both factors and assessed the impacts of explicitly including these dependencies in the MRC model. On the basis of the observed relationships between cascade weights and time scale and intensity, four progressively more "dependent'' models were constructed to disaggregate a long time series of daily rainfall to hourly intervals. We found that inclusion of the intensity dependency on the model parameters that generate dry intervals greatly improved performance. For the relatively small range of time scales over which the rainfall was disaggregated, varying model parameters with time scale resulted in minor improvement.

AB The lateral distributions of depth-averaged apparent shear stress, depth mean velocity, and diffusion coefficients are essential in certain quantitative analysis for sediment transport and environmental studies. An analytical method for the computation of these parameters is presented. A mathematical relationship between these parameters, based on the concept of surplus energy transport through a minimum relative distance developed by Yang and Lim [1997], is established, the depth-averaged apparent shear stress is determined from the boundary shear stress, depth mean velocity is obtained by considering the influence of nonuniform shear velocity and the free surface in 3-D channels, and the diffusion coefficients are linked to the depth-averaged apparent shear and velocity. The theoretical formulations for the distributions of depth-averaged apparent shear stresses, depth mean velocity and diffusion coefficients in trapezoidal and compound channels are presented. Comparisons between the theoretical and the measured lateral distributions of the depth-averaged apparent shear stresses and the depth mean velocities are also presented, and a reasonable agreement is achieved.

TI A LAND COVER-BASED SNOW COVER REPRESENTATION FOR DISTRIBUTED
   HYDROLOGIC-MODELS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A snow cover depletion curve (SDC) summarizes the relationship between snow cover distribution and an average snow cover property, such as depth or water equivalent, for a given area. Snow cover depletion curves have been developed for, and applied in, hydrological models on a watershed or elevation zone basis. However, land cover-based SDCs are not prominent in the literature. For this study the areal distribution of snow cover for dominant land cover units was measured during the winters of 1991 and 1992 in the Laurel Creek watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. On the basis of these data a general model for land cover-based SDCs is developed for these land cover units, namely, short grass, ploughed fields, and deciduous forests. This model is derived from the three-parameter lognormal distribution, which is shown to characterize the areal depletion curves of the land cover units studied. The SDCs based on this new model provide a formal distributed snow cover representation that can be used in vegetation-based distributed hydrological models requiring accurate spatial representations of snow cover attributes.

AB [1] A hydrologic model of the mountainous snowmelt-dominated Redfish Creek catchment (British Columbia) is used to evaluate Interior Watershed Assessment Procedure (IWAP) guidelines regarding peak flow sensitivity to logging in different elevation bands of a basin. Simulation results suggest that peak flow increases are caused by greater snow accumulation and melt in clear-cut areas while similar evapotranspiration rates are predicted under forested and clear-cut conditions during spring high flow. Snow accumulation and melt are clearly related to elevation, but the relationship between logging elevation and peak flow change is more complex than perceived in the IWAP. Logging in the bottom 20% of the catchment causes little or no change in peak flow because of the small low-elevation snowpack and the timing of snowmelt, while clear-cut area alone appears to be a good indicator of peak flow increases due to logging at higher elevation. Temporal variability in peak flow changes due to clear-cutting is substantial and may depend more on temperatures during snowmelt than on the size of the snowpack. Long-term simulations are needed to improve quantitative estimates of peak flow change while the importance of watershed topographic characteristics for snowmelt and peak flow generation must be further examined.

AB Hyporheic exchange in riverbeds is driven by current-bed topography interactions. Because riverbeds exhibit topographic roughness across scales, from individual grains to bedforms and bars, they can exhibit fractal patterns. This study analyzed the influence of fractal properties of riverbed topography on hyporheic exchange. A set of synthetic fractal riverbeds with different scaling statistics was used as inputs to sequentially coupled numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow and hyporheic flow. In the analysis, the maximum power spectrum (dune size) and the fractal dimension (topographic complexity) were considered as independent variables and we then investigated how interfacial fluxes and hyporheic travel times are functionally related to these variables. As the maximum power spectrum increases (i.e., dune height to flow depth ratio), the average interfacial flux increases logarithmically whereas it increases exponentially with an increase in fractal dimension. Hyporheic exchange is more sensitive to additional roughness (larger fractal dimensions) than to bedform size (larger maximum power). Our results imply that fractal properties of riverbeds are crucial to predicting hyporheic exchange. The predictive relationships we propose could be integrated with reduced complexity, large-scale models. They can also be used to design artificial topographies that target hyporheic ecosystem services.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID UNSATURATED FLOW; POROUS-MEDIA
AB In a recent study by Hsu and Hilpert (2011), the Green-Ampt (GA) model for water infiltration was modified to account for a dynamic capillary pressure that depends on the wetting front velocity. In that study, the only transient flow, to which the modified GA approach was compared, was capillary rise. In this paper, transient downward infiltration experiments were performed using three different ponding depths. We demonstrated that infiltration can be effectively modeled using the modified GA approach. The parameters of the dynamic capillary pressure relationship were fitted and independent of the ponding depth. Furthermore, the experimental data could not be described accurately at early times with the classical GA approach. This was particularly evident when plotting the product between the Darcy velocity and the wetting front position against the wetting front position. In these plots, the initial unphysical infinite rate of infiltration, that occurs in the classical GA model, appears to be a primary element of inaccuracy. It was furthermore verified that the limited ability of the classical GA approach to describe the experimental data is not related to inertial forces arising during the initial phase of infiltration.

AB [1] Tower-based measurements of mass and energy exchanges at the end of the growing season in central Botswana were used to evaluate functional relationships commonly applied to predict water and carbon fluxes between savanna landscapes and the atmosphere. Following a large rainfall event, daily evapotranspiration (ETdaily) exhibited an exponential decay consistent with a derived analytical expression based on critical and wilting-point soil moisture limits for savanna vegetation native to the study region. A piecewise linear soil moisture limitation function provided good estimates of ETdaily as a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture (R-2 = 0.92). Comparison of a soil moisture mass balance with measured ETdaily indicated deeper root water uptake at a site with more woody vegetation compared with a grass-dominated site. Linear correlation (R-2 = 0.90) of daytime CO2 flux and evapotranspiration supported a constant water use efficiency to estimate carbon fluxes from water fluxes. Daytime and nighttime CO2 fluxes responded similarly to soil drying, enabling estimation of total daily CO2 flux from ETdaily. These experimental results support a simple model of savanna land-atmosphere exchange over interstorm periods.

AB A multifractal analysis of hourly and daily rainfall data recorded at four locations of Andalusia (southern Spain) was carried out in order to study the temporal structure of rainfall and to find differences between both time resolutions. The results show that an algebraic tail is required to fit the probability distribution of the extreme rain events for all the cases. The presence of a multifractal phase transition associated with a critical moment in the empirical moments scaling exponent function was also detected. Both facts indicate that the rainfall process is a case of self-organized criticality (SOC) dynamics, although the results differ for each place according to the time resolution and the nature of the rainfall, either convective or frontal. This SOC behaviour is related to a statistically steady state that implies the presence of clusterization in the time-occurrence sequence of rain events. Such fluctuations have been shown by performing the analysis of the Fano and Allan factors and the count-based periodogram. The values for the "synoptic maximum", the typical lifetime of planetary scale atmospheric structures, have been obtained for each place and some important periodicities have been detected when dealing with extremes.

AB The compound dry and hot event has attracted much attention in recent decades due to their disastrous impacts on different sectors. The impact from compound dry and hot events is generally more severe than that from individual dry or hot event. Understanding the physical mechanism of this compound event is thus of particular importance for early warning to reduce potential impacts. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the warm season at the global scale. Monthly precipitation and temperature from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were used to estimate the occurrence of compound events, and Nino 3.4 index (NINO34) was used to represent the ENSO phenomenon. The logistic regression model was employed to model the occurrence of compound events with respect to NINO34. Results from the logistic regression model showed that ENSO played an important role in the occurrence of compound dry and hot events during the warm season in regions such as northern part of South America, southern Africa, southeastern Asia and Australia. A higher likelihood of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in these regions was shown to be associated with higher values of NINO34 based on empirical analysis from observations. Results from this study will help improve our understanding of compound dry and hot events and aid with mitigation efforts for ameliorating their adverse impacts.

AB This paper presents a nonlocal, derivative free model for transient flow in unsaturated, heterogeneous, and anisotropic soils. The formulation is based on the peridynamic model for solid mechanics. In the proposed model, flow and changes in moisture content are driven by pairwise interactions with other points across finite distances, and are expressed as functional integrals of the hydraulic potential field. Peridynamic expressions of the rate of change in moisture content, moisture flux, and flow power are derived, as are relationships between the peridynamic and the classic hydraulic conductivities; in addition, the model is validated. The absence of spacial derivatives makes the model a good candidate for flow simulations in fractured soils and lends itself to coupling with peridynamic mechanical models for simulating crack formation triggered by shrinkage and swelling, and assessing their potential impact on a wide range of processes, such as infiltration, contaminant transport, and slope stability.

AB The estimation of drag exerted by vegetation is of great interest because of its importance in assessing the impact of vegetation on the hydrodynamic processes in aquatic environments. In the current research, genetic programming (GP), a machine learning (ML) technique based on natural selection, was adopted to search for a robust relationship between the bulk drag coefficient (C-d) for arrays of rigid circular cylinders representing emergent vegetation with blockage ratio (psi), vegetation density (lambda) and pore Reynolds number (Re-p) based on published data. We utilize a data set covering a wide range of each parameter involved to cover all possible dependencies. A new predictor, which shares the same form with the Ergun-derived formula, was obtained without any pre-specified forms before searching. The dependence of the two parameters in Ergun equation on vegetation characteristics was also estimated by GP. This new C-d predictor for emergent vegetation with a relatively concise form exhibits a considerable improvement in terms of prediction ability relative to existing predictors.

TI Benefits and Limitations of Real Options Analysis for the Practice of
   River Flood Risk Management
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Decisions on long-lived flood risk management (FRM) investments are complex because the future is uncertain. Flexibility and robustness can be used to deal with future uncertainty. Real options analysis (ROA) provides a welfare-economics framework to design and evaluate robust and flexible FRM strategies under risk or uncertainty. Although its potential benefits are large, ROA is hardly used in todays' FRM practice. In this paper, we investigate benefits and limitations of a ROA, by applying it to a realistic FRM case study for an entire river branch. We illustrate how ROA identifies optimal short-term investments and values future options. We develop robust dike investment strategies and value the flexibility offered by additional room for the river measures. We benchmark the results of ROA against those of a standard cost-benefit analysis and show ROA's potential policy implications. The ROA for a realistic case requires a high level of geographical detail, a large ensemble of scenarios, and the inclusion of stakeholders' preferences. We found several limitations of applying the ROA. It is complex. In particular, relevant sources of uncertainty need to be recognized, quantified, integrated, and discretized in scenarios, requiring subjective choices and expert judgment. Decision trees have to be generated and stakeholders' preferences have to be translated into decision rules. On basis of this study, we give general recommendations to use high discharge scenarios for the design of measures with high fixed costs and few alternatives. Lower scenarios may be used when alternatives offer future flexibility.
   Plain Language Summary Worldwide, large amounts of money are needed to protect growing populations against increasing flood risks. Decisions on flood risk management measures are often difficult because the future is uncertain, resulting in possible over- or underinvestments. Integrating flexibility or robustness in the decisions are two different ways to deal with this. Real options analysis (ROA) can help to design and evaluate robust and flexible strategies but is hardly used. We examine benefits and limitations by applying ROA to a realistic case study in the Netherlands. We develop robust dike investment strategies and value the flexibility offered by room for the river measures. The ROA for the realistic case study needs a high level of geographical detail, a large number of future scenarios, and the inclusion of stakeholders' preferences. Limitations are the complexity, the recognition and quantification of uncertainty, and the mapping of possible decisions in time. ROA provides relevant insights for policy makers which can not be reached with standard cost-benefit analysis: first: use high scenarios for the design of measures with high fixed costs (like dikes), and second: the value of flexibility due to room for the river measures increases with uncertainty.

AB Solute transport in randomly heterogeneous media is described by stochastic transport equations that are typically solved via Monte Carlo simulation. A promising alternative is to solve a corresponding system of statistical moment equations directly. We present exact (though not closed) implicit conditional first and second moment equations for advective-dispersive transport in finite domains. The velocity and concentration are generally non-stationary due to possible trends in heterogeneity, conditioning on data, temporal variations in velocity, fluid and/or solute sources, initial and boundary conditions. Our equations are integro-differential and include non-local parameters depending on more than one point in space-time. To allow solving these equations, we close them by perturbation and develop recursive moment equations in Laplace space for the special case of steady state flow, to second order in sigma(Y) where sigma(2)(Y) is a measure of (natural) log hydraulic conductivity variance. We also propose a higher-order iterative closure. Our recursive equations and iterative closure are formally valid for mildly heterogeneous media, or well-conditioned strongly heterogeneous media in which the random component of heterogeneity is relatively small. The non-local moment equations suggest (and a companion paper [Morales Casique E, Neuman SP, Guadagnini A. Nonlocal and localized analyses of nonreactive solute transport in bounded randomly heterogeneous porous media: computational analysis. Adv Water Resour, submitted for publication] demonstrates numerically) that, in general, transport cannot be validly described by means of Fick's law with a (constant or variable) macrodispersion coefficient. We show nevertheless that, under a limited set of conditions, the mean transport equation can be localized to yield a familiar-looking advection-dispersion equation with a conditional macrodispersion tensor that varies generally in spacetime. In a companion paper [Morales Casique E, Neuman SP, Guadagnini A. Nonlocal and localized analyses of nonreactive solute transport in bounded randomly heterogeneous porous media: computational analysis. Adv Water Resour, submitted for publication] we present a high-accuracy computational algorithm for our iterative non-local and recursive localized moment equations, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency in comparison to unconditional and conditional Monte Carlo simulations.

AB Rainfall-induced landslides are a common occurrence in terrain with steep topography and soils that have degradable strength. Rainfall infiltration into a partially saturated slope of infinite extent can lead to either a decrease or complete elimination of soil suction, compromising the slopes' stability. In this research the rainfall infiltration coupled with deformation of a partially saturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration is analyzed. The limit equilibrium conditions and the shear strength relationship of a partially saturated soil are employed to develop an analytical solution for calculating the stability of an infinite partially saturated slope due to rainfall infiltration. The analytical solutions are able to consider the influence of the coupled effects on the stability of the slope. The factors that affect the safety of a partially saturated slope of infinite extent are discussed. The results indicate that the poro-mechanical coupling of water infiltration and deformation has an important effect on the stability of the infinite unsaturated slope. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Theoretical and experimental studies were undertaken to gain insight into physical parameters controlling the flocculation and settling properties of mud floes in the Changjiang Estuary, China. The Rouse equation is applied to vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration to determine the bulk mean settling velocity (w(s)) of sediment suspended in the Changjiang Estuary. Both in situ point-sampled and acoustically measured profiles of suspended mud concentrations were fit selectively. The calculated settling velocities ws mainly ranged from 0(.)4 to 4(.)1 mm s(-1) for the point-sampled data set, and from 1(.)0 to 3(.)0 mm s(-1) for the acoustically measured data set. Furthermore, the settling velocities of mud floes increased with mean concentration ((C) over bar) of mud floes in suspension and were proportional to increasing bottom shear stress (tau(b)) of tidal flow. The best equation for the field settling velocity of mud floes in the Changjiang Estuary can be expressed by the power law: w(s) = m (C-n) over bar (m, 1(.)14-2(.)37; n, 0(.)84-1(.)03). It is suggested that (C) over bar and tau(b) were the dominant physical parameters controlling the flocculation and ws of mud floes in suspension. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Flows involving immiscible displacement of one fluid by another in a porous media are known to destabilize and form fluid fingering. When the non-wetting fluid is a highly mobile gas (air) and the wetting fluid is an in-compressible liquid (water) the classical macroscopic theory is unable to describe the fingered flow. In Part I of this study we have introduced a model that interprets the mixture of wetting and non-wetting fluids within the pore space as a single saturating non-uniform pore fluid characterized by a phase field parameter, which is considered to be the saturation degree of the wetting fluid. In the current study we present a linear stability analysis of its solutions which describe both imbibition and drainage. The analysis sheds light on the sensitivity of the flow stability on injection flux, imposed pressure gradient and initial saturation degree. Two-dimensional numerical simulation results are as well presented which verify the stability analysis and reveal the rich structure of the fluid fingering realized by this model. While these results are found to be in qualitative agreement with experimental observations, they also warrant further experimentation to explore the additional features predicted by the model.

AB The Southeastern United States experiences recurring hydrological droughts, which can reduce water availability and result in water deficits. Long-term monitoring data from Panola Mountain Research Watershed, a small, forested, seasonally water-limited watershed near Atlanta, GA, was used to quantify interactions of climatic variability with shallow and deep storage and evapotranspiration. Watershed storage (WS) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) were estimated monthly from 1985 through 2015 using a relationship with baseflow and a water-budget approach, respectively. A watershed shallow storage (SS) water budget, based on soil moisture profile data, indicated a transition from recharge to surplus as dormant season SS increased to field capacity, and a transition from utilization of stored water to water deficits as growing season SS declined toward its wilting point. Deeper storage appeared unavailable to AET during dry conditions. The majority of deeper storage recharge occurred during the dormant season and required SS to be near field capacity. WS was an effective drought indicator. Growing season droughts typically occurred when WS was below normal at the end of the dormant season and growing season precipitation (P) was below or near normal. A hydrologic persistence analysis showed that monthly month-standardized WS was significantly correlated (p-value<0.05) with past monthly month-standardized WS for the previous 19 months and with past monthly P for the previous 11 months, indicating the importance of past hydrologic conditions on WS. These findings allowed assessment of expected climatic changes on the water cycle, which included effects on future recharge, water deficits, and drought occurrence.
   Plain Language Summary Drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster in North America, resulting in reduced streamflows that are necessary for human use and aquatic plants and animals and shortages in shallow soil water that are necessary for plant growth and health. Monthly changes in storage of water in shallow and deep soils were estimated at a small, forested research watershed near Atlanta, Georgia to understand the relationships between shallow and deep storage and summertime drought occurrence. Summertime droughts occurred when springtime water storage in deeper soils was below normal and summertime rain was either near or below normal. Water storage in deeper soils was predominantly replenished by rain in the winter, but only after shallow soils were first wetted up. Deeper soils were rarely replenished during the summertime because most of the summertime rain that replenished water in shallow storage was evaporated or used by plants. These observations can be used to better understand conditions that result in drought in the Southeastern U.S. Expected climatic change in this region can affect the future occurrence of droughts by changing the amount of replenishment of water in deep soils in the winter and resulting in larger shortages in shallow soil water in the summer.

AB Stream water concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exhibit large temporal variations during precipitation on forested, headwater catchments. We present a modeling framework appropriate for describing streamflow and event-driven export of DOM from small, forested watersheds. Our model links parametrically simple formulations for rainfall-runoff generation and soil water carbon dynamics. The rainfall-runoff formulation is developed by modifying the catchment model of Kirchner (2009) to account for hysteresis in the relationship between stream discharge and catchment water storage. Time series computations of catchment water storage are used by the soil carbon model to approximate the effects of leaching, adsorption, and mineralization on soil water DOM concentrations and the export of DOM from the terrestrial reservoir to the stream. Our findings show that this model is capable of reproducing hourly variations of stream discharge (ranging from 0.01 to 0.38 mm h(-1)) and stream water DOM concentrations (ranging from 1.8 to 14 mg C L-1) measured in a forested headwater stream in north central Massachusetts.

AB We demonstrate a pore-to-reservoir simulation methodology that does not pre-suppose the functional form of the upscaled transport equations and which automatically accounts for uncertainty in the reservoir description. Single-phase transport is modeled as a continuous time random walk. Particles make a series of hops between nodes with a probability psi(t)dt that a particle will first arrive at a node from a nearest neighbor in a time t to t + dt. We describe transport at four scales: pore, core, grid-block, and field. At each scale the system is represented as a lattice of nodes with an appropriate transition time probability psi derived from a simulation at the next smaller scale.
   At the micron scale, we fit a truncated power law psi(t) for the distribution of transition times between pores. We use the transport algorithm of Rhodes and Blunt [Rhodes ME, Blunt MJ. An exact particle tracking algorithm for advective-dispersive transport in networks with complete mixing at nodes. Water Resour Res 2006;42:W04501. doi:10.1029/2005WR004504] on a network model representation of Berea sandstone whose results are in good agreement with experiment. This psi(P) is then used to calculate transport at the core scale and a psi(c) is found that accounts for cm-scale transitions. Similarly we use psi(c) to derive a meter-scale psi(gb) from simulations of grid-block level transport. At the field scale, we use the upscaled psi(gb) from simulations at the meter-scale.
   We demonstrate the methodology by considering transport in a channeled sandstone reservoir, from a pore-scale representation of the microscopic structure to a million-cell field-scale geological model. Effectively we simulate transport in a model containing of order 10(12) cells while accounting for uncertainty in the reservoir description. Heterogeneity at all scales impacts transport and tends to retard the advance of the plume with particles becoming trapped in slow-moving regions, increasing breakthrough times by up to an order of magnitude compared to those predicted using a traditional advection dispersion model.

AB The presence of well-connected paths is commonly observed in spatially heterogeneous porous formations. Channels consisting of high hydraulic conductivity (K) values strongly affect fate and transport of dissolved species in the subsurface environment. Several studies have established a correlation between connectivity properties of the spatially variable K-field and solute first arrival times. However, due to limited knowledge of the spatial structure of the K-field, connectivity metrics are subject to uncertainty. In this work, we utilize the concept of the minimum hydraulic resistance and least resistance path to evaluate the connectivity of a K-field in a stochastic framework. We employ a fast graph theory-based algorithm to alleviate the computational burden associated with stochastic computations in order to investigate both the impact of the hydrogeological structural conceptualization and domain dimensionality (2-D vs. 3-D) on the uncertainty of the minimum hydraulic resistance. Finally, we propose an iterative data acquisition strategy that can be utilized to identify the least resistance path (which is linked to preferential flow channels) in real sites. A synthetic benchmark test is presented, showing the advantages of the proposed sampling strategy when compared to a regular sampling strategy. By using the iterative data sampling strategy, we were able to reduce first arrival time uncertainty by 47% (when compared to the regular sampling strategy), while maintaining site characterization efforts constant.

TI Delta channel networks: 1. A graph-theoretic approach for studying

AB River deltas are intricate landscapes with complex channel networks that self-organize to deliver water, sediment, and nutrients from the apex to the delta top and eventually to the coastal zone. The natural balance of material and energy fluxes, which maintains a stable hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often disrupted by external perturbations causing topological and dynamical changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative framework for studying delta channel network connectivity and transport dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in computing delta's steady state fluxes and identifying upstream (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas and fluxes from any point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream links. The framework is applied to the Wax Lake delta in the Louisiana coast of the U.S. and the Niger delta in West Africa. In a companion paper, we present a comprehensive suite of metrics that quantify topologic and dynamic complexity of delta channel networks and, via application to seven deltas in diverse environments, demonstrate their potential to reveal delta morphodynamics and relate to notions of vulnerability and robustness.

AB Critical zone science seeks to develop mechanistic theories that describe critical zone structure, function, and long-term evolution. One postulate is that hydrogeochemical controls on critical zone evolution can be inferred from solute discharges measured down-gradient of reactive flow paths. These flow paths have variable lengths, interfacial compositions, and residence times, and their mixing is reflected in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations. Motivation for this special section originates from a U.S. Critical Zone Observatories workshop that was held at the University of New Hampshire, 20-22 July 2015. The workshop focused on resolving mechanistic CZ controls over surface water chemical dynamics across the full range of lithogenic (e.g., nonhydrolyzing and hydrolyzing cations and oxyanions) and bioactive solutes (e.g., organic and inorganic forms of C, N, P, and S), including dissolved and colloidal species that may cooccur for a given element. Papers submitted to this special section on concentration-discharge relations in the critical zone include those from authors who attended the workshop, as well as others who responded to the open solicitation. Submissions were invited that utilized information pertaining to internal, integrated catchment function (relations between hydrology, biogeochemistry, and landscape structure) to help illuminate controls on observed C-Q relations.

AB The scope of the present paper is the evaluation of the exchange of momentum in natural streams to explore the contribution that turbulence and secondary currents have on the shear stress distributions within the flow, and hence evaluate the overall hydraulic resistance. Existing methods for the evaluation of shear stresses in rivers are examined with respect to their applicability to complex flow fields, and a new mathematical formulation for analyzing the shear stresses affecting the longitudinal velocity distribution is presented. This new method enables one to estimate the time-averaged principal shear stress and its particular components due to turbulence and secondary currents directly from three-dimensional velocity data. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) was used to measure the currents and turbulence at five cross-sections of two field sites over a wide range of discharges. The results of the cross-sectional measurements reflect the nonuniformity of the river bed roughness, cross-sectional form, and planform. Limited applicability was found for methods based on the theory of two-dimensional boundary layer flows. Shear stresses estimated using the new method emphasize the dominance of secondary currents on the total momentum flux. Momentum fluxes caused by secondary currents were an order of magnitude larger than momentum fluxes due to turbulence.

AB Identification of a groundwater contaminant source simultaneously with the hydraulic conductivity in highly heterogeneous media often results in a high-dimensional inverse problem. In this study, a deep autoregressive neural network-based surrogate method is developed for the forward model to allow us to solve efficiently such high-dimensional inverse problems. The surrogate is trained using limited evaluations of the forward model. Since the relationship between the time-varying inputs and outputs of the forward transport model is complex, we propose an autoregressive strategy, which treats the output at the previous time step as input to the network for predicting the output at the current time step. We employ a dense convolutional encoder-decoder network architecture in which the high-dimensional input and output fields of the model are treated as images to leverage the robust capability of convolutional networks in image-like data processing. An iterative local updating ensemble smoother algorithm is used as the inversion framework. The proposed method is evaluated using a synthetic contaminant source identification problem with 686 uncertain input parameters. Results indicate that, with relatively limited training data, the deep autoregressive neural network consisting of 27 convolutional layers is capable of providing an accurate approximation for the high-dimensional model input-output relationship. The autoregressive strategy substantially improves the network's accuracy and computational efficiency. The application of the surrogate-based iterative local updating ensemble smoother in solving the inverse problem shows that it can achieve accurate inversion results and predictive uncertainty estimates.
   Plain Language Summary High-dimensional inverse problems are often computationally expensive since a large number of forward model evaluations are usually required. A computationally efficient alternative is to replace in the inversion process the forward model with an accurate but fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. However, most existing surrogate methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we develop a deep autoregressive neural network-based surrogate method to efficiently solve such high-dimensional inverse problems. The autoregressive neural network can efficiently obtain accurate approximations for the time-dependent outputs of forward models with time-varying inputs. In addition, a dense convolutional network architecture is employed to transform the surrogate modeling task to an image-to-image regression problem by leveraging the robust capability of convolutional networks in image-like data processing. The curse of dimensionality was tackled though a series of inherent nonlinear projections of the input into low-dimensional latent spaces. It is shown that the proposed network provides an accurate surrogate of a transport system with high-dimensional uncertain inputs using relatively limited training data. Reliable inversion results are then obtained with a rather minor computational cost by using the surrogate to replace the forward model in the inversion process.

The latter originates from two separate mechanisms: partial dissolution of grains and pore fillings (e. g. clay). We then use the reconstructed network models to estimate the medium flow properties. In this work, we develop unique network construction algorithms and simulate capillary pressure-saturation and relative permeability-saturation curves for cases with inhomogeneous distributions of pores and micropores. Furthermore, we provide a modeling framework for variable amounts of cement and connectivity of the intergranular porosity and quantifying the conditions under which microporosity dominates transport properties. In the extreme case of a disconnected inter-granular network due to cementation a range of saturations within which neither fluid phase is capable of flowing emerges. To our knowledge, this is the first flexible pore scale model, from first principles, to successfully approach this behavior observed in tight reservoirs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stable isotopic composition of precipitation as preserved in continental proxy climate archives (e.g., ice cores, lacustrine sediments, tree rings, groundwater, and organic matter) can sensitively record fluctuations in local meteorological variables. These are important natural climatic tracers to understand the atmospheric circulation patterns and hydrological cycle and to reconstruct past climate from archives. Precipitation was collected at Dokriani Glacier to understand the response of glaciers to climate change in the Garhwal Central Himalaya, Upper Ganga Basin. The local meteoric water line deviates from the global meteoric water line and is useful for the identification of moisture source in the region. The data suggest different clusters of isotopic signals, that is, summer (June-September) and winter (November-April); the mean values of O-18, D, and d parts per thousand during summer are -13.03 parts per thousand, -84.49 parts per thousand, and 19.78 parts per thousand, respectively, whereas during winter, the mean values of O-18, D, and d parts per thousand are -7.59 parts per thousand, -36.28 parts per thousand, and 24.46 parts per thousand, respectively. Backward wind trajectory analysis ascertains that the major source of precipitation during summer is from the Indian Summer Monsoon and during winter from the westerlies. Regression analysis has been carried out in order to establish interrelationship between the precipitation isotopic signatures and meteorological variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. Temperature and precipitation have good correlation with the isotopic signatures of precipitation with R-2 values >.5, suggesting that both temperature and amount effects prevail in the study region. Multiple regression analysis found strong relationships for both the seasons. The relationship of deuterium excess with O-18, relative humidity, and precipitation are significant for the winter season. No significant relationships of deuterium excess were found with other meteorological variables such as temperature and radiation. The correlation and regression analysis performed are significant and valuable for interpretation of processes in the hydrological cycle as well as for interpretation of palaeoclimate records from the region.

AB Statistical distributions of flood peak discharge often show heavy tail behavior, that is, extreme floods are more likely to occur than would be predicted by commonly used distributions that have exponential asymptotic behavior. This heavy tail behavior may surprise flood managers and citizens, as human intuition tends to expect light tail behavior, and the heaviness of the tails is very difficult to predict, which may lead to unnecessarily high flood damage. Despite its high importance, the literature on the heavy tail behavior of flood distributions is rather fragmented. In this review, we provide a coherent overview of the processes causing heavy flood tails and the implications for science and practice. Specifically, we propose nine hypotheses on the mechanisms causing heavy tails in flood peak distributions related to processes in the atmosphere, the catchment, and the river system. We then discuss to which extent the current knowledge supports or contradicts these hypotheses. We also discuss the statistical conditions for the emergence of heavy tail behavior based on derived distribution theory and relate them to the hypotheses and flood generation mechanisms. We review the degree to which the heaviness of the tails can be predicted from process knowledge and data. Finally, we recommend further research toward testing the hypotheses and improving the prediction of heavy tails.

AB Under permit programs stemming from regulated riparian systems of water withdrawal control, significant quantities of water cannot be withdrawn from the stream without a withdrawal-constraining permit. There are two versions of such a permit system, one of which fixes the allowable withdrawal, the other of which allows withdrawals to vary directly with streamflows. However, both tie allowable withdrawal to streamflow at some level, the former simply shutting off all withdrawals when the streamflow breaches a low flow standard. Simple logic and the simulation of such systems with hydrologic models predict, in cases where the indexing gauge is downstream of the withdrawal point, the possibility of unstable feedback, leading to severe variability of both streamflow and allowable withdrawal. In this paper we characterize the streamflow variability with three indices, namely, flow crossing, flow reversal, and standard deviation, and compare the difference in those indices to represent the degree of the streamflow variability under the fixed flow and fractional flow withdrawal permit programs. Techniques based on control theory are proposed for modifying the fractional flow withdrawal program to reduce the streamflow variability. It is concluded that regulatory programs modified by inclusion of a first-order filter are able to reduce streamflow variability without significant sacrifice in net benefit or low flow frequency.

AB Vegetation patches increase the pressure gradient of local channels and can create an uneven pressure distribution at the water-sediment interface, thereby driving hyporheic exchange. However, this process has rarely been discussed. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of hyporheic exchange under the influence of multiple factors. A bidirectional coupling model of the overlying water and sediment with an emergent vegetation patch was adopted. The results show that hyporheic exchange driven by vegetation patches are spatially heterogeneous. The active area of hyporheic exchange was concentrated directly below the vegetation patch. A finger flow was formed at the edge of the active hyporheic exchange zone as the exchange took place. Furthermore, intermittent downward solute transport path (IDSTP) was formed downstream of the vegetation patch, and the exchange rate was one order of magnitude smaller than that of the hyporheic exchange active zone. Hyporheic exchange occurred at the stem and patch scales when the vegetation density was relatively high. There was a logarithmic relationship between the hyporheic exchange flux and sediment permeability, and a power function relationship existed between the hyporheic exchange flux and Reynolds number. The active area of hyporheic exchange will help predict pollutant transport and understand vegetation's nutrient absorption process. IDSTP will provide references for vegetation patch expansion.

AB Links between the carbon and water economies of plants are coupled by combining the biochemical demand for atmospheric CO2 with gas transfer through stomates, liquid water transport in the soil-xylem hydraulic system and sucrose export in the phloem. We formulated a model to predict stomatal conductance (g(s)), consistent with the maximum energy circulation concept of Lotka and Odum, by maximizing the sucrose flux out of photosynthesizing leaves. The proposed modeling approach recovers all prior results derived from stomatal optimization theories and profit-maximization arguments for the xylem hydraulic system aimed at predicting g(s). The novel features of this approach are its ability to 1) predict the price of losing water in carbon units using xylem and phloem properties (i.e., the marginal water use efficiency) and 2) explain why water molecules become more expensive to exchange for CO2 molecules when soil moisture becomes limiting or when plants acclimate to new elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. On short time-scales (sub-daily), predicted g(s) under many environmental stimuli were consistent with measurements reported in the literature, including a general sensitivity of g(s) to vapor pressure deficit and leaf water potential. During progressive droughts, differences in the coordination among the leaf, xylem, and phloem functioning determine the isohydric-to-anisohydric behavior among plants.

AB The effect of aquifer heterogeneity on flow and solute transport in two-dimensional isotropic porous media was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method. The two-dimensional logarithmic permeability (In K) was assumed to be a non-stationary random field with its increments being a truncated fractional Levy motion (fLm). The permeability fields were generated using the modified successive random additions (SRA) algorithm code SRA3DC [http://www.iamg.org/CGEditor/index.htm]. The velocity and concentration fields were computed respectively for two-dimensional flow and transport with a pulse input using the finite difference codes of MODFLOW 2000 and MT3DMS. Two fLm control parameters, namely the width parameter (C) and the Levy index (alpha), were varied systematically to examine their effect on the resulting permeability, flow velocity and concentration fields. We also computed the first- and second-spatial moments, the dilution index, as well as the breakthrough curves at different control planes with the corresponding concentration fields. In addition, the derived breakthrough curves were fitted using the continuous time random walk (CTRW) and the traditional advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Results indicated that larger C and smaller alpha both led to more heterogeneous permeability and velocity fields. The Levy-stable distribution of increments in In K resulted in a Levy-stable distribution of increments in logarithm of the velocity (In v). Both larger C and smaller alpha created sharper leading edges and wider tailing edges of solute plumes. Furthermore, a relatively larger amount of solute still remained in the domain after a relatively longer time transport for smaller a values. The dilution indices were smaller than unity and increased as C increased and alpha decreased. The solute plume and its second-spatial moments increased as C increased and alpha decreased, while the first-spatial moments of the solute plume were independent of C and alpha values. The longitudinal macrodispersivity was scale-dependent and increased as a power law function of time. Increasing C and decreasing alpha both resulted in an increase in longitudinal macrodispersivity. The transport in such highly heterogeneous media was slightly non-Gaussian with its derived breakthrough curves being slightly better fitted by the CTRW than the ADE, especially in the early arrivals and late-time tails.

AB Climate indices characterize climate systems and may identify important indicators for long-term precipitation, which are driven by climate interactions in atmosphere-ocean circulation. In this study, we investigated the climate indices that are effective indicators of long-term precipitation in South Korea, and examined their relationships based on statistical methods. Monthly total precipitation was collected from a total of 60 meteorological stations, and they were decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to identify the inherent oscillating patterns or cycles. Cross-correlation analysis and step-wise variable selection were employed to select the significant climate indices at each station. The climate indices that affect the monthly precipitation in South Korea were identified based on the selection frequencies of the selected indices at all stations. The NINO12 indices with four- and ten-month lags and AMO index with no lag were identified as indicators of monthly precipitation in South Korea. Moreover, they indicate meaningful physical information (e.g. periodic oscillations and long-term trend) inherent in the monthly precipitation. The NINO12 indices with four- and ten-month lags was a strong indicator representing periodic oscillations in monthly precipitation. In addition, the long-term trend of the monthly precipitation could be explained by the AMO index. A multiple linear regression model was constructed to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation. Three identified climate indices successfully explained the monthly precipitation in the winter dry season. Compared to the monthly precipitation in coastal areas, the monthly precipitation in inland areas showed stronger correlation to the identified climate indices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB To clarify the processes of atmospheric water vapour transport to the northern part of the North China Plain (NCP), isotopic variations in precipitation are investigated. Pattern of seasonal variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation over China can be classified into three types: winter depression, summer depression and intermediate. The northern NCP is located at the northern margin of the region where isotopic composition decreases in summertime, associated closely with the Asian summer monsoon. Inter-storm variability of isotopic composition over the northern NCP during the monsoon season has an inverse relationship with atmospheric moisture content, although it cannot be accounted for by the amount effect. Thus, the isotopic composition is inferred to be primarily controlled by large-scale monsoon activity, which supplies water vapour into the northern NCP, rather than by local precipitation processes. From an analysis based on a relationship between the deuterium excess and humidity conditions at possible oceanic source areas, it is revealed that precipitating water in the early monsoon season originates in the South China Sea, and its source area tends to shift to the East China Sea and/or Yellow Sea in the later period of the season.

AB While streams draining peatland and wetland systems are known to be supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere, relatively little is known about short-term temporal variability in response to extreme hydrological events. Here, we use submerged, nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors to make continuous measurements of CO2 concentrations during 18 storm events in a Scottish peatland stream. Individual storms exhibited 3 distinct types of hysteresis loop. We suggest that differences in loop form may be due to differences in the relative contributions of soil water or differences in the contributing catchment source area. We found a negative concentration-discharge relationship over the full study period, suggesting that CO2-rich deep peat/groundwater was the major source of aquatic CO2 under low flow conditions. By removing the effect of dilution and estimating additions and losses of CO2, we also show the importance of both surface peat CO2 inputs into the stream and evasion loss during stormflow. The best model of temporal variability in CO2 was achieved by separating the data set into "stormflow'' and "dry periods.'' Downstream CO2 export during the study period was dominated by stormflow events (71%), highlighting the importance of accurately accounting for high-flow CO2 sources.

AB The coupled water-energy balance on long-term time and catchment scales can be expressed as a set of partial differential equations, and these are proven to have a general solution as E/P = F(E-0/P, c), where c is a parameter. The state-space of ( P, E-0, E) is a set of curved faces in P-E-0-E three-dimensional space, whose projection into E/P - E-0/P two-dimensional space is a Budyko-type curve. The analytical solution to the partial differential equations has been obtained as E = E0P/(P-n + E-0(n))(1/n) (parameter n representing catchment characteristics) using dimensional analysis and mathematic reasoning, which is different from that found in a previous study. This analytical solution is a useful theoretical tool to evaluate the effect of climate and land use changes on the hydrologic cycle. Mathematical comparisons between the two analytical equations showed that they were approximately equivalent, and their parameters had a perfectly significant linear correlation relationship, while the small difference may be a result of the assumption about derivatives in the previous study.

AB The remediation of aquifers contaminated by viscous dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) is a challenging problem. Coal tars are the most abundant persistent DNAPLs due to their high viscosity and complexity. Pumping processes leave considerable volume fractions of DNAPLs in the soil and demand high operational costs to reach cleaning objectives. Thermally enhanced recovery focuses on decreasing DNAPL viscosity to reduce residual saturation. The oil industry has previously applied this technique with great success for enhanced oil recovery applications. However, in soil remediation, high porous media permeabilities and product densities may invalidate those techniques. Additionally, the impacts of temperature on coal tar's physical properties have not been thoroughly discussed in available literature. Here, we investigated how coal tar's physical properties, the capillary pressure-saturation curve and the relative permeability of two-phase flow in porous media depend on the temperature and flow rate experimentally. Drainage and imbibition experiments under quasi-static (steady-state) and dynamic (unsteady-state) conditions have been carried out at 293.15 K and 323.15 K in a 1D small cell filled with 1 mm homogeneous glass beads. Two different pairs of immiscible fluids have been investigated, coal tar-water and canola oil-ethanol. Results demonstrated similar trends for temperature effect and values of fluid properties for both liquid pairs, which backs up the use of canola oil-ethanol to model coal tar-water flow. It was found that there is no temperature effect on drainage-imbibition curves or residual saturation under quasi-static conditions. In dynamic conditions, the DNAPL residual saturation decreased by 16 % when the temperature changed from 293.15 K to 323.15 K. This drop was mainly linked to decreasing viscous fingering, as well as the appearance of wetting phase films around the glass beads. Both phenomena have been observed only in dynamic experiments. A high enough pumping flow rate is needed to generate dynamic effects in the porous medium. Ethanol and oil's relative permeabilities also increase with temperature under dynamic measurement conditions. Our findings indicate that flow rate is an important parameter to consider in thermal enhanced recovery processes. These effects are not taken into account in the classically used generalized Darcy's law for modeling two-phase flow in porous media with temperature variation.

AB While a large number of descriptive studies have delineated the interlinkages between water, food and energy resources in the last decade, there is still need for systematic conceptualization of resource nexus interconnections. This paper proposes a theory of relational analysis of the nexus based on the analytical concept of nexus networks. A taxonomy of nexus interconnections, detailing sequential and hierarchical connections, is characterized between and amongst the technosphere and biosphere. We illustrate the use of a novel diagnostic tool with regard to its ability to integrate macro-, meso- and microscale drivers of nexus problems. We apply this framework to problems generated by intensive crop production for exportation in an arid landscape (driven by external markets) and sustainable management of water resources (driven by public policies) in a southern Spanish region. We elucidate interconnected causal mechanisms for groundwater overexploitation and profile different social-ecological patterns on a spatially-explicit basis. The proposed approach is capable of accounting for the water-energy-food resource nexus in an integrated and mull-level fashion, addressing the tensions generated by both multi-functionality and resource entanglement in complex social-ecological systems.

AB This study examined hyporheic exchange flow and transient storage processes within a steep headwater stream, using both hydrometric and tracer approaches. Vertical hydraulic gradients varied systematically with location within step-pool units, with upwelling located in a relatively narrow zone immediately below the step. Downward hydraulic gradients were greatest immediately above channel steps, and in that zone, gradients were also correlated with step height. Hydraulic conductivity tended to be lower in downwelling zones than in upwelling and neutral locations. Transient storage areas determined from reach-scale tracer tests tended to increase with discharge, whereas transient exchange coefficients were not correlated with discharge. Transient storage exchange fluxes estimated from the reach-scale tracer tests were an order of magnitude greater than hyporheic exchange fluxes estimated by scaling up local estimates based on Darcy's Law and piezometer measurements. This difference could be explained by the presence of lateral hyporheic flow paths and/or the influences of transient storage in pools. Tracer injections into infiltrometers using Rhodamine WT and sodium chloride allowed visual determination of hyporheic discharge zones and calculation of residence times for hyporheic flow through the step (pool inflow) and transport through the downstream pool (pool outflow). These tests indicated that residence time in pools call be comparable to hyporheic residence times, although the lack of replication in time and space limits the drawing of strong inferences.

AB Linear stability analysis and numerical simulations of density-driven flow are presented in order to estimate the effects of temperature-dependent fluid viscosity variation on the onset of free thermal convection within a three-dimensional fault embedded into impermeable rocks. The strongly coupled equations of density-driven flow are linearized. The solution was obtained through expansion into Fourier series. Simple polynomial expressions fitting the neutral stability curves are given for a range of fault aspect ratios, fluid viscosity properties, and thermal conductivity heterogeneity, providing a new tool for the estimation of critical Rayleigh numbers in faulted systems. The results are validated against the limiting case of temperature-invariant viscosity (i.e., constant). 3-D numerical simulations of free convection within a fault are run using the finite element technique in order to verify the theoretical results. It turned out that at average geothermal temperature conditions, thermal convection can develop within faults which permeability is up to 4 times lower than the case of a fluid with constant viscosity, in agreement with the developed linear theory. The polynomial expressions of this study can be applied to any numerical model for testing the feasibility of fault convection in 3-D geothermal basin.

AB A new integrated hydrological and nitrogen model, called TNT2 (topography-based nitrogen transfer and transformation), has been developed to study nitrogen fluxes in small catchments. This model, process-based and spatially distributed in order to take spatial interactions into account, has been kept as simple as possible. Here, only the hydrological module is discussed. The two main hypotheses of the hydrological model are taken from the TOPMODEL concept (constant hydraulic gradient equal to slope and hydraulic conductivity decreasing exponentially with depth). The model is based on a daily water balance for each cell of a regular square grid and computes an explicit cell-to-cell routing. Transfer through the vadose zone is simulated using a conceptual, layer-based algorithm analogous to the Burns model, except that a drainage water reservoir has been added to simulate mobile/immobile water processes and variations of the water table within the soil. The crop growth and nitrogen transformations are simulated using the equations of a generic plant-soil model, STICS. As an example, a preliminary study of the effect of the catchment geomorphology on denitrification is presented. The study was performed on theoretical catchments with contrasted slope shapes and pathway patterns. Results show that the whole-catchment denitrification depends on catchment geomorphology, although not directly through the extent of saturated areas. It is concluded that TNT2 seems to be a powerful tool to explore catchment processes, both by application to actual cases and by exploration on simple scenarios.

ID GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; BLANKET PEAT; RUNOFF; INFILTRATION; PIPEFLOW
AB This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.

AB In this paper, a recently introduced artificial intelligence technique known as Gene Expression Programming (GEP) has been employed to perform symbolic regression for developing a parametric scheme of flow duration curve (FDC) regionalization, to relate selected FDC characteristics to catchment characteristics. Stream flow records of selected catchments located in the Auckland Region of New Zealand were used. FDCs of the selected catchments were normalised by dividing the ordinates by their median value. Input for the symbolic regression analysis using GEP was (a) selected characteristics of normalised FDCs; and (b) 26 catchment characteristics related to climate, morphology, soil properties and land cover properties obtained using the observed data and GIS analysis. Our study showed that application of this artificial intelligence technique expedites the selection of a set of the most relevant independent variables out of a large set, because these are automatically selected through the GEP process. Values of the FDC characteristics obtained from the developed relationships have high correlations with the observed values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flow measurements were conducted by ADV Vectrino to investigate the role of different forms of single natural emergent vegetation elements on kinetic energy characteristics and the flow structure in open channel flow. Experiments were carried out for both forms of "erect" and "compressed" vegetation The findings revealed that the form of "erect" has greater retaining influence on time-averaged mean velocity characteristics than "compressed" form. Furthermore, the turbulence and kinetic energy patterns behind the single vegetation were also examined An empirical equation giving the relationship between the kinetic energy components of flow was derived based on the data The ratio between turbulence kinetic energy and mean kinetic energy at a certain distance downstream of vegetation element was predicted by the empirical equation depending on the vegetation characteristics These predictions were compared with a different experimental data set and produced satisfactory results Also, the mean flow and turbulence characteristics behind an isolated natural plant and a volumetrically equivalent rigid cylinder were also compared (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Two stochastic models of the rainfall process, belonging to different categories, are compared in terms of how well they reproduce certain hyetograph characteristics. The first is the scaling model of storm hyetograph, which belongs to the category of storm-based models. The second is the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model, the most widespread among the category of point process models. The scaling model is further developed introducing one more parameter to better-fit historical data. The Bartlett-Lewis model is theoretically studied to extract mathematical relationships for the intra-storm structure. The intercomparison is based on the storm hyetographs of a data set from Greece and another one from USA. The different storms are identified in each data set and classified according to their duration. Both models are fitted using the characteristics of storms. The comparison shows that the scaling model of storm hyetograph agrees well with the structure of historical hyetographs whereas the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model exhibits some discrepancies in either its original version or its random parameter version. However. it is shown that the performance of the Bartlett-Lewis model is significantly improved, and becomes comparable to that of the scaling model. by introducing a power-law dependence of its cell related parameters (duration and rate of arrivals) on the storm duration.

AB Single-collector efficiency is of paramount importance in colloid filtration theory and widely used to represent the average filtration efficiency of a specific porous medium. In this work we present new formulations (unifying the stochastic and limiting trajectory cases) for efficient evaluation of the single-collector efficiency with Lagrangian simulations in axisymmetric flow field for two commonly adopted particle-releasing scenarios: from the envelope boundary (Happel sphere-in-cell) and from the upstream projected area (sphere-in-cylinder). We introduce an equivalent captured flux and define a capture indicator variable for each particle, to avoid calculation of local capture probability in previous studies. The single-collector efficiencies obtained with the proposed formulations using particle trajectory simulations in axisymmetric flow field are in excellent agreement with full 3D simulation results, which validates our approach. The results are also compared with the Levich equation and published correlation equations. The differences between the two particle-releasing scenarios are clarified and their impact on the single-collector efficiency is quantified. The proposed axisymmetric simulation method can significantly reduce the computational time for obtaining single-collector efficiency in comparison to 3D modeling approach, and can also be conveniently applied to studying particle transport in other practical scenarios involving axial symmetry, such as constricted tubes, impinging jet, stagnation-point flow.

AB In flood risk assessment, there remains a lack of analytical frameworks capturing the dynamics emerging from two-way feedbacks between physical and social processes, such as adaptation and levee effect. The former, adaptation effect, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, levee effect, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two main prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.

AB This study examines effects of solution chemistry on straining of colloids in porous media under unfavorable conditions via theoretical analysis and laboratory column experiments. Geometric analysis was used to estimate the effects of solution chemistry on the critical straining ratio of colloid diameter (d(p)) to collector diameter (d(c)), above which straining occurs. Column experiments were conducted with various sizes of latex particles and glass beads at different solution ionic strengths. A two-or three-step procedure was used to measure colloid rentention and release by monitoring effluent colloid concentrations, and the columns were dissected at the end of experiments to determine distribution profiles of retained colloids. Measured effluent breakthrough curves and spatial deposition profiles were modeled with the convection-diffusion equation including terms of attachment and straining. The experimental results confirm our theoretical analysis that the critical straining ratio is significantly reduced at higher ionic strength due to additional straining induced by attachment, predominantly at the grain-to-grain contacts. Through systematic evaluation of contributions of physical and physiochemical factors to colloid straining, this study provides explanations for the inconsistent and wide range of d(p)/dc ratios reported in the literature as well as some of the reported limitations of filtration theory.

AB The hydrogeological behaviour of fault zones in carbonate aquifers is often neglected in conceptual and numerical models. Furthermore, no information is available regarding the relationships between piezometric levels when significant compartmentalization occurs due to the occurrence of low-flow fault zones. The aim of this study was to refine the conceptualization of subsurface flow in faulted carbonate aquifers and to analyse relationships between sub-basins within a compartmentalized aquifer system in Southern Italy. The interactions between compartments that straddle low-flow faults were investigated over four hydrologic years using a statistical approach to compare (i) the hydraulic heads within two wells located up- and down-gradient of tectonic discontinuities as well as (ii) the rainfall and piezometric levels. The results of this study suggest that a set of barriers exists between the wells, and, therefore, the total head loss observed between the wells (approximately 80m) should be distributed across several aquitards, with one aquitard exhibiting a relatively high permeability or low degree of integrity. Due to slight differences in permeability, transient conditions in aquitards can occur over relatively short periods, which is in agreement with the results of the statistical data analysis. Consequently, rather than being caused by pure aquitards, aquifer system compartmentalization likely results from slight differences in the permeability between lower-permeability fault zones and adjacent higher-permeability protoliths.

AB Conventional roughness-resistance relationships developed for pipe and open-channel flows cannot accurately describe shallow overland flows over natural rough surfaces. This paper develops a new field methodology combining terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and overland flow simulation to provide a high-resolution dataset of surface roughness and overland flow hydraulics as simulated on natural bare soil surfaces. This method permits a close examination of the factors controlling flow velocity and a re-evaluation of the relationship between surface roughness and flow resistance. The aggregate effect of flow dynamics, infiltration and depression storage on retarding the passage of water over a surface is important where runoff-generating areas are distant from well-defined channels. Experiments to separate these effects show that this 'effective resistance' is dominated by surface roughness. Eight measurements of surface roughness are found to be related to flow resistance: standard deviation of elevations, inundation ratio, pit density (measured both perpendicular and parallel to the flow direction), slope, median depth, skewness of the depth distribution and frontal area. Hillslope position is found to affect the significant roughness measures. In contrast, infiltration rate has little effect on the velocity of water fronts advancing over the soil surfaces examined here and the effect of depression storage is limited. Overland flow resistance is depth dependent where complex microtopographic structures are progressively inundated. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Physical and financial approaches each provide different benefits for managing environmental financial risks. Index insurance contracts, a financial approach, have been proposed for managing numerous environmental financial risks. A method for testing when and how physical (dredging) and financial risk management strategies (index insurance) could be deployed in tandem to maximize improvements in utility for commercial shippers on the Great Lakes is developed using principles from the benefit-cost analysis and expected utility theory. Using a utility function with a decreasing marginal utility of income explicitly models the risk aversion of commercial shippers. The probabilistic nature of future revenue and costs is modeled and combined with the utility function to determine a Net Option Value. This value represents the maximum amount commercial shippers would pay more than the cost for reduced variability in net revenues. Results indicate that while the Net Option Value for dredging exceeds the potential benefits of using insurance contracts alone, the combination of dredging and insurance can improve overall utility with less cost than dredging alone. The strong autocorrelation in lake levels over long periods reduces the value of index insurance, such that the results show a potential lower bound of the value of combining physical and financial approaches in highly variable systems.

ID UNCERTAINTY; SEASONALITY; CATCHMENT; SERIES
AB This paper introduces a novel measure to assess similarity between event hydrographs. It is based on cross recurrence plots (CRP) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), which have recently gained attention in a range of disciplines when dealing with complex systems. The method attempts to quantify the event runoff dynamics and is based on the time delay embedded phase space representation of discharge hydrographs. A phase space trajectory is reconstructed from the event hydrograph, and pairs of hydrographs are compared to each other based on the distance of their phase space trajectories. Time delay embedding allows considering the multidimensional relationships between different points in time within the event. Hence, the temporal succession of discharge values is taken into account, such as the impact of the initial conditions on the runoff event. We provide an introduction to cross recurrence plots and discuss their parameterization. An application example based on flood time series demonstrates how the method can be used to measure the similarity or dissimilarity of events, and how it can be used to detect events with rare runoff dynamics. It is argued that this methods provides a more comprehensive approach to quantify hydrograph similarity compared to conventional hydrological signatures.

AB Analytical approximations were derived for solute transport of pesticides subject to Freundlich sorption, and first-order degradation restricted to the liquid phase. Solute transport was based on the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) assuming steady flow. The center of mass (first spatial moment) was approximated both for a non-degraded solute pulse and for a pulse degraded in the liquid phase. The remaining mass (zeroth spatial moment) of a linearly sorbing solute degraded in the liquid phase was found to be a function of only the center of mass (first spatial moment) and the Damkohler number (i.e., the product of degradation rate coefficient and dispersivity divided by flow velocity). This relationship between the zeroth and first spatial moments was shown to apply to nonlinearly sorbing pulses as well. The mass fraction leached of a pesticide subject to Freundlich sorption and first-order degradation in the solution phase only was found to be a function of the Damkohler number and of the dispersivity, so independent of sorption. Hence perceptions of the effects of sorption on pesticide leaching should be reconsidered. These conclusions equally hold for other micropollutants that degrade in the solution phase only.

AB Physical/semi-empirical models that do not require any calibration are of paramount need for estimating hydrological fluxes for ungauged sites. We develop semi-empirical models for estimating the mean and variance of the monthly streamflow based on Taylor Series approximation of a lumped physically based water balance model. The proposed models require mean and variance of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, co-variability of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and regionally calibrated catchment retention sensitivity, atmospheric moisture uptake sensitivity, groundwater-partitioning factor, and the maximum soil moisture holding capacity parameters. Estimates of mean and variance of monthly streamflow using the semi-empirical equations are compared with the observed estimates for 1373 catchments in the continental United States. Analyses show that the proposed models explain the spatial variability in monthly moments for basins in lower elevations. A regionalization of parameters for each water resources region show good agreement between observed moments and model estimated moments during January, February, March and April for mean and all months except May and June for variance. Thus, the proposed relationships could be employed for understanding and estimating the monthly hydroclimatology of ungauged basins using regional parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Subsurface geological formation properties often involve some degree of uncertainty. Thus, for most conditions, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation are necessary for predicting subsurface flow. The surrogate model based method is one common type of uncertainty quantification method, in which a surrogate model is constructed for approximating the relationship between model output and model input. Based on the prediction ability, the constructed surrogate model can be utilized for performing data assimilation. In this work, we develop an algorithm for implementing an iterative ensemble smoother (ES) using the surrogate model. We first derive an iterative ES scheme using a regular routine. In order to utilize surrogate models, we then borrow the idea of Chen and Oliver (2013) to modify the Hessian, and further develop an independent parameter based iterative ES formula. Finally, we establish the algorithm for the implementation of iterative ES using surrogate models. Two surrogate models, the PCE surrogate and the interpolation surrogate, are introduced for illustration. The performances of the proposed algorithm are tested by synthetic cases. The results show that satisfactory data assimilation results can be obtained by using surrogate models that have sufficient accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present the PoreFlow-Net, a 3D convolutional neural network architecture that provides fast and accurate fluid flow predictions for 3D digital rock images. We trained our network to extract spatial relationships between the porous medium morphology and the fluid velocity field. Our workflow computes simple geometrical information from 3D binary images to train a deep neural network (the PoreFlow-Net) optimized to generalize the problem of flow through porous materials. Our results show that the extracted information is sufficient to obtain accurate flow field predictions in less than a second, without performing expensive numerical simulations providing a speed-up of several orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate that our model, trained with simple synthetic geometries, is able to provide accurate results in real samples spanning granular rocks, carbonates, and slightly consolidated media from a variety of subsurface formations, which highlights the ability of the model to generalize the porous media flow problem. The workflow presented here shows the successful application of a disruptive technology (physics-based training of machine learning models) to the digital rock physics community.

AB A geometric-based simulation methodology was developed and incorporated into a computer code to model the hierarchical stratal architecture, and the corresponding spatial distribution of permeability, in braided channel belt deposits. The code creates digital models of these deposits as a three-dimensional cubic lattice, which can be used directly in numerical aquifer or reservoir models for fluid flow. The digital models have stratal units defined from the kilometer scale to the centimeter scale. These synthetic deposits are intended to be used as high-resolution base cases in various areas of computational research on multiscale flow and transport processes, including the testing of upscaling theories. The input parameters are primarily univariate statistics. These include the mean and variance for characteristic lengths of sedimentary unit types at each hierarchical level, and the mean and variance of log-permeability for unit types defined at only the lowest level (smallest scale) of the hierarchy. The code has been written for both serial and parallel execution. The methodology is described in part 1 of this paper. In part 2 (Guin et al., 2010), models generated by the code are presented and evaluated.

AB Consider the advection and dispersion of a conservative nonsorbing solute in a spatially variable but statistically homogeneous velocity field. A Lagrangian approach leads to expressions for the large-time mean and variance of concentration. The expressions require only the macroscopic velocity vector U-m, the macrodispersion tensor D-m, and an additional tensor Theta. The macroscopic velocities and macrodispersivities are well known from numerous previous studies, but Theta is introduced here for the first time. The tensor Theta is needed to describe the kinetics of dilution of a plume: Two cases with the same U-m and D-m, have different dilution characteristics depending on Theta. The characteristic times of dilution are given by tensor Theta D-m(-1). It is demonstrated, for the first time through a Lagrangian approach, that the coefficient of variation of concentration at the center of the plume becomes proportionate to 1/t, as was previously shown in the Eulerian theory of Kapoor ann Gelhar [1994a, b]. Expressions for the geometric mean of the dilution index and the reactor ratio are derived. Numerical simulations support the validity of the approach.

AB The maintenance or development of plant community diversity in species-rich wet grasslands has been a focus of water management considerations in the UK for the past 20 years. Much attention has been given to the control of water levels in the ditch systems within these wet grassland systems. In this paper we report measurements of aeration status and water-table fluctuation made on a peat soil site at Tadham Moor in Somerset, UK, where water management has focused on the maintenance of wet conditions that often result in flooding in winter and wet soil conditions in the spring and summer. Measurement and modelling of the water-table fluctuation indicates the possibility of,variability in the aeration of the root environment and anoxic conditions for much of the winter period and for part of the spring and summer. We have used water content and redox potential measurements to characterize the aeration status of the peat soil. We find that air-filled porosity is related to water-table depth in these situations. Redox potentials in the spring were generally found to be low, implying a reducing condition for nitrate and iron. A significant relationship (p < 0.01) between redox potential and water-table depth exists for data measured at 0.1 m depth, but no relationship could be found for data from 0.4 m depth.

AB We present an improved method for estimating interfacial curvatures from x-ray computed microtomography (CMT) data that significantly advances the potential for this tool to unravel the mechanisms and phenomena associated with multi-phase fluid motion in porous media. CMT data, used to analyze the spatial distribution and capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S) relationships of liquid phases, requires accurate estimates of interfacial curvature. Our improved method for curvature estimation combines selective interface modification and distance weighting approaches. It was verified against synthetic (analytical computer-generated) and real image data sets, demonstrating a vast improvement over previous methods. Using this new tool on a previously published data set (multiphase flow) yielded important new insights regarding the pressure state of the disconnected nonwetting phase during drainage and imbibition. The trapped and disconnected non-wetting phase delimits its own hysteretic P-c-S curve that inhabits the space within the main hysteretic P-c-S loop of the connected wetting phase. Data suggests that the pressure of the disconnected, non-wetting phase is strongly modified by the pore geometry rather than solely by the bulk liquid phase that surrounds it. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Water markets as a vehicle for reforming water resource allocation in
   the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Australian water resources; natural resource management; water markets
AB Water trade and the establishment of water markets continue to gain popularity among legislators as a vehicle for progressing the reform of the water resources sector in Australia. This has manifested itself at the most recent meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, where a range of changes to address the declining health of inland rivers included the strengthening of water property rights. These views appear to be premised on the belief that nonattenuated water rights are a prerequisite for maximizing the productive benefits of water and are broadly in line with notions often derived from neoclassical market theory. However, in spite of the apparent faith in the market mechanism, there is a growing literature illustrating the limitations of the market framework in the context of water resource management. Accordingly, there would appear to be grounds for a more cautious approach that recognizes the potential for market failures to emerge. This article explores the present growth of water markets and the legislative background that circumscribes them in the Murray-Darling Basin. Recognizing the constraints imposed by the status quo, this study then examines the implications of stronger property rights for entitlement holders and the use of water markets in the context of the goals assigned to Australian water managers.

AB Characterization of underground porous media parameters at the micro and macro scales is fundamental in geosciences. A thorough comprehension of flow phenomena requires analyses and observations at the micro scale through adoption of micromodels as representative as possible of real geological formations. In this paper we focus on the analysis of 2D binary images of real rock thin sections to characterize pore network geometry and to estimate effective porosity, pore size distribution and tortuosity with the aim of providing suitable information for designing micromodels. To this end, a geometrical analysis of the pore structure, based on the identification and characterization of the set of the shortest geometrical pathways between inlets and outlets pairs, was implemented. The geometrical analysis is based on a path-finding algorithm derived from graph theory. Results provided by geometrical analysis were validated against hydrodynamic numerical simulation via the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Results show that the path-finding approach provides reasonable and reliable estimates of tortuosity and can be successfully applied for analyzing the distribution of effective pore radius, as well as for estimating the effective porosity.

AB Moment equation methods are popular and powerful tools for modeling transport processes in randomly heterogeneous porous media, but the application of these methods to advection-dispersion equations often leads to erroneous oscillations. Perturbative methods, required to close systems of moment equations, become inaccurate for large perturbations: however, little quantitative theory exists for determining when this occurs for advection-dispersion equations. We consider three different methods (asymptotic approximation, Eulerian truncation, and iterative solution) for closing and solving advection-dispersion moment equations describing transport in stratified porous media with random permeability. We obtain approximate analytical expressions for time above which the asymptotic approximation to the mean diverges, in particular quantifying the impact that dispersion has on delaying but not eliminating divergence. We demonstrate that Eulerian truncation and iterative solution methods do not eliminate divergent behavior either. Our divergence criteria provide a priori estimates that signal a warning to the practitioner of stochastic advection-dispersion equations to carefully consider whether to apply perturbative approaches.

AB Understanding, comparing, and accurately predicting water demand at different spatial scales is an important goal that will allow effective targeting of the appropriate operational and conservation efforts under an uncertain future. This study uses data relating to water consumption available at the household level, as well as postcode locations, household characteristics, and weather data in order to identify the relationships between spatial scale, influencing factors, and forecasting accuracy. For this purpose, a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is used to predict water demand 1-7 days into the future. Results show an exponential decay in prediction accuracy from a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.2% to 17%, for a reduction in group size from 600 to 5 households. Adding explanatory variables to the forecasting model reduces the MAPE up to 20% for the peak days and smaller household groups (20-56 households), whereas for larger aggregations of properties (100-804 households), the range of improvement is much smaller (up to 1.2%). Results also show that certain types of input variables (past consumption and household characteristics) become more important for smaller aggregations of properties, whereas others (weather data) become less important.

AB In this research, a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model (HGT-MPM) is proposed for solving trans-boundary water conflicts in Guanting reservoir basin (GRB) between two cities (Le., Zhangjiakou and Beijing) in north China. A water allocation model, which considers both water quality and quantity, is developed for optimizing water use and pollutant discharge in the two cities, maximizing the net aggregate benefits from these activities and reducing the costs for water supply and pollution removal. The initial rights of water use and pollutant discharge are allocated to the cities of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, as two players based on the incorporation of a negotiation method for ill-defined water rights within the watershed. At this stage, equal treatment of every player's benefit claim can be addressed. The strategy spaces of the two players are delineated through solving the proposed HGT-MPM with mutual benefit claim constraints. The Rubinstein bargaining solution method is employed to identify the equilibrium of bargaining. To achieve maximal benefits for the two players, starting from allocating the results of the second step, the concepts of Core and Nash solutions of cooperative games are used to generate stable basin-wide cooperative solutions. Both players find it beneficial to cooperate with side payment from the downstream to upstream. At this stage, the principle of maximum economic benefits is mainly considered. The results indicate that unclear initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights can be fairly defined through bilateral negotiations between upstream and downstream. Without side payment, the initial water rights and pollutant discharge allocation will be the final outcome, which is sub-optimal, although it is better than the status quo in term of both total and individual benefits. Full cooperation with side payment leads to the greatest total net benefits and the greatest benefits to each individual city. The results not only provide a basis to allocate trans-jurisdictional water rights and pollutant discharge rights in an equal and efficient way but also provide certain inspirations for management policy improvement, such as establishing a water right trading system.

AB The analysis of the hydrological response to meteorological drought events can lead to a deeper understanding of alterations in hydrological processes that can be used to help maintain environmental flow (e-flow) in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we first identified an extreme meteorological drought event and then assessed its hydrological response. Monthly precipitation anomalies were used to identify meteorological drought, while the Lyne-Hollick method (LH filter) was used alongside the baseflow recession constant (calculated using the Automatic Baseflow Identification Technique [ABIT]) to isolate baseflow in the Baiyangdian basin. Results showed that an extreme meteorological drought event occurred in August 1996, continuing for a total of 127 months, which resulted in prolonged hydrological drought (i.e., streamflow and baseflow). A time lag was generally observed between the end of the meteorological drought event and the end of the hydrological drought event, where baseflow recovery lagged behind streamflow (runoff) recovery. Additionally, drought led to an unstable shift in the precipitation-streamflow relationship that subsequently led to a reduction in the annual streamflow of coinciding annual precipitation compared with the historical relationship. Drought also led to a longer response between precipitation and runoff events. Results from this study show that the hydrological response to meteorological drought event is important for water resource management and for addressing effects related to climate change, especially extreme drought events.

TI Erosion prediction on unpaved mountain roads in northern Thailand:
   validation of dynamic erodibility modelling using KINEROS2

DT Article
DE road erosion modelling; model validation; runoff generation; erodibility
ID SEDIMENT PRODUCTION; FOREST; RUNOFF
AB The event- and physics-based KINEROS2 runoff/erosion model for predicting overland flow generation and sediment production was applied to unpaved mountain roads. Field rainfall simulations conducted in northern Thailand provided independent data for model calibration and validation. Validation shows that KINEROS2 can be parameterized to simulate total discharge, sediment transport and sediment concentration on small-scale road plots, for a range of slopes, during simulated rainfall events. The KINEROS2 model, however, did not accurately predict time-dependent changes in sediment output and concentration. In particular, early flush peaks and the temporal decay in sediment output were not predicted, owing to the inability of KINEROS2 to model removal of a surface sediment layer of finite depth. After 15-20 min, sediment transport declines as the supply of loose superficial material becomes depleted. Modelled erosion response was improved by allowing road erodibility to vary during an event. Changing the model values of erosion detachment parameters in response to changes in surface sediment availability improved model accuracy of predicted sediment transport by 30-40%. A predictive relationship between road erodibility 'states' and road surface sediment depth is presented. This relationship allows implementation of the dynamic erodibility (DE) method to events where pre-storm sediment depth can be estimated (e.g., from traffic usage variables).

AB In this paper, two deterministic and stochastic multilateral, multi-issue, non-cooperative bargaining methodologies are proposed for urban runoff quality management. In the proposed methodologies, a calibrated Storm Water Management Model (SW,MM) is used to simulate stormwater runoff quantity and quality for different urban stormwater runoff management scenarios, which have been defined considering several Low Impact Development (LID) techniques. In the deterministic methodology, the best management scenario, representing location and area of LID controls, is identified using the bargaining model. In the stochastic methodology, uncertainties of some key parameters of SWMM are analyzed using the info-gap theory. For each water quality management scenario, robustness and opportuneness criteria are determined based on utility functions of different stakeholders. Then, to find the best solution, the bargaining model is performed considering a combination of robustness and opportuneness criteria for each scenario based on utility function of each stakeholder. The results of applying the proposed methodology in the Velenjak urban watershed located in the northeastern part of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, illustrate its practical utility for conflict resolution in urban water quantity and quality management. It is shown that the solution obtained using the deterministic model cannot outperform the result of the stochastic model considering the robustness and opportuneness criteria. Therefore, it can be concluded that the stochastic model, which incorporates the main uncertainties, could provide more reliable results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plant species are diverse in form, function and environmental response. This provides enormous potential for designing nature-based stormwater treatment technologies, such as biofiltration systems. However, species can vary dramatically in their pollutant-removal performance, particularly for nitrogen removal. Currently, there is a lack of information on how to efficiently select from the vast palette of species. This study aimed to identify plant traits beneficial to performance and create a decision-support tool to screen species for further testing. A laboratory experiment using 220 biofilter columns paired plant morphological characteristics with nitrogen removal and water loss for 20 Australian native species and two lawn grasses. Testing was undertaken during wet and dry conditions, for two biofilter designs (saturated zone and free-draining). An extensive root system and high total biomass were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3-), driven by high nitrogen assimilation. The same characteristics were key to performance under dry conditions, and were associated with high water use for Australian native plants; linking assimilation and transpiration. The decision-support tool uses these scientific relationships and readily-available information to identify the morphology, natural distribution and stress tolerances likely to be good predictors of plant nitrogen and water uptake.

AB We consider advective transport in a steady state random velocity field with homogeneous increments. Such a field is self-affine with a power law dyadic semivariogram gamma(s) proportional to d(2 omega), where d is distance and omega is a Hurst coefficient. It is characterized by a fractal dimension D = E + 1 - omega, where E is topological dimension. As the mean and variance of such a field are undefined, we condition them on measurement at some point x(0). We then introduce a tracer at another point y(0) and invoice elementary theoretical considerations to demonstrate that its conditional mean dispersion is local at all times. Its conditional mean concentration and variance are given explicitly by well-established expressions which, however, have not been previously recognized as being valid in fractal fields. Once the conditional mean travel distance s of the tracer becomes large compared to the distance between y(0) and x(0), the corresponding dispersion and dispersivity tensors grow in proportion to s(1+2 omega), where 0 < omega < 1. This supralinear rate of growth is consistent with that exhibited by apparent longitudinal dispersivities obtained by standard methods df interpretation from tracer behavior observed in a variety of geologic media under varied flow and transport regimes. Filtering out modes from the fractal velocity held with correlation scales larger than some s(0) allows an asymptotic transport regime to develop when s >> s(0). The corresponding asymptotic dispersivities grow in proportion to s(0)(2 omega), when 0 < omega less than or equal to 1/2. This linear to sublinear rate of growth is consistent with that exhibited by apparent longitudinal dispersivities obtained from calibrated numerical models in a variety of media. A self-affine natural log permeability field gives rise to a self-affine velocity field, while s is sufficiently small to insure that the variance of the log permeabilities, which grows as a power of s, remains nominally less than one. An analysis of published apparent longitudinal dispersivity data in light of the above theoretical results supports my earlier conclusion that when one juxtaposes data from a large number of generally dissimilar geologic media from a variety of locales, one observes a tendency toward self-affine behavior with a Hurst coefficient omega similar or equal to 0.25. At any given locale such media may or may not exhibit fractal behavior; if they do, omega may or may not be close to 0.25.
