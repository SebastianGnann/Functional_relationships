AB Root-zone soil moisture is of critical importance to vegetation restoration, runoff and erosion processes in gullies, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Nevertheless, data relating to soil moisture in gullies are rare, since it is difficult to record in such environments. We hypothesize that mean soil moisture and its spatial variability within gullies could be estimated reliably on the basis of measurements from adjacent uplands, where data are much easier to collect. In this study, we proposed five different strategies to estimate root-zone (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm) spatial mean soil moisture in gullies and three different strategies to estimate soil moisture spatial variability at the corresponding depths, using measurements collected from nearby uplands, based on 2-year soil moisture data collection campaigns in the Yuanzegou gully catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The estimation errors were quantified for each strategy. The results showed that spatial mean soil moisture ((theta) over bar (g)) at each depth in gullies was reliably estimated from observations collected at a single upland location when previous soil moisture data collected simultaneously for gullies and uplands were available. The upland locations that were within a +/- 5% relative bias error for the estimation of (theta) over bar (g) had similar average percentage clay content (16.1%) in the surface layer (0-20 cm) to that in the gullies (15.7%), and moderately steeper slopes (from 36.6% to 53.1%) compared to the upland average (39.4%). When previous soil moisture data were not available, the estimation was much less accurate. Furthermore, when different number of upland locations were randomly selected to estimate (theta) over bar (g), the estimation accuracy was only improved slightly when more than 10 locations were used. Based on the best estimated (theta) over bar (g) and the quantitative relationship between spatial means and spatial variability of soil moisture in gullies, we were able to obtain the estimates of spatial soil moisture variability (standard deviation and coefficient of variation) with a certain level of accuracy (R-2 from 0.300 to 0.625) in gullies at each depth. However, when the quantitative relationship was not available, there were much greater estimation errors. Our results demonstrated that spatial means and variability of soil moisture could be reliably estimated using measurements from nearby uplands provided previous soil moisture datasets for gullies and upland locations are simultaneously available.

AB Leaf and stein maximum water storage capacities of nine dominant species (three graminoids and six herbs) from a mountain meadow were investigated employing two different methods-submersing of and spraying at phytoelements, respectively. The resulting maximum water storage capacities were in overall good agreement with literature. The submersing method yielded significantly lower values as compared to the spraying method, but, using ill situ dew measurements, it could not be conclusively determined which method is to be preferred. Significant correlations between maximum water storage capacity and several morphological parameters could be found both across species and within species, yet these relationships usually possessed relatively little predictive power and were not consistent across species. It is concluded that other plant characteristics than those investigated ill the present study are responsible for determining differences between species and that the dependence of the maximum water storage capacities on morphological factors is highly species-specific.

AB Hydraulic profiling tool (HPT) and hydraulic tomography (HT) have been developed as promising techniques for the high-resolution characterization of surficial aquifer systems. HPT surveys can be rapidly conducted at a resolution of 1.5-cm, but provide only one-dimensional vertical profiles and require site-specific formulae to relate HPT measurements to K. Geostatistics-based HT can estimate three-dimensional distributions of hydraulic parameters, but may fail to provide detailed information and can be smooth when pumping/observation data density is sparse and usually are constrained to the area enclosed by the pumping and observation network. In this study, HPT and HT surveys were conducted at the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada to characterize a glaciofluvial multi-aquifer-aquitard system with permeameter K values spanning nearly seven orders of magnitude. We first performed the geostatistical analysis of K values derived from 11 HPT surveys using the power-law model developed for the NCRS by Zhao and Illman (2022b). Then, the benefits of incorporating HPT K profiles into HT were evaluated for the reconstruction of hydraulic parameter fields. Results showed that the arithmetic mean of 11 HPT K profiles was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the 544 permeameter test K measurements. The K fields interpolated by ordinary kriging captured the vertical alternating layering patterns of aquifer and aquitard layers, while they over-predicted the values by nearly one order of magnitude than permeameter K for the top part of the aquifer system. By incorporating the kriged K values as prior means for the geostatistics-based HT, improvements were found in capturing spatial heterogeneity of K fields for areas both inside and outside the well cluster and in drawdown predictions than the inversion case using only pressure head data. The inclusion of vertical variation information of K derived from HPT into HT was also helpful in refining the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and introducing intralayer variation patterns of K for both aquifer and aquitard layers. This study demonstrates the potential ability of HT and HPT and advocates the joint use of both techniques for the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity at highly heterogeneous sites such as the NCRS.

AB Hydraulic diffusivity or imbibition is a well-known unsaturated hydrodynamics phenomenon in water resources and geosciences study. Currently, there have been numerous analytical or numerical models describing the spontanneous imbibition of porous rock and soil. However, the most existing models do not consider hydrostatic pressure and elaborate pore geometry characteristics. Assuming that the penetration direction is one-dimensional and infinitely continuous, a long-term co-current spontaneous imbibition (SI) model is proposed by average and fractal geometries, respectively accordingly obtaining the general expression of dimensionless comprehensive parameter. The practicability and accuracy of the model are verified by experimental data and compared with other models. The influence mechanisms of tortuosity, pore-throat, fractal, shape and topological characteristics on initial and equilibrium SI behaviors are comprehensively revealed. The new models are applied to inversely predict the dimensionless comprehensive parameters, variations of which with porosity are analyzed along with their influence on long-term SI characteristics. The results are shown as follows. Compared with the existing classical models, the prediction accuracy of the new model consistent with experiment is greatly improved, generalizing the existing models. The dimensionless comprehensive parameters based on average and fractal geometries show the decreasing trend in power-law and increasing trend in linear with the increase of porosity, respectively. The equilibrium height or mass is only related to topology factor, fractal dimension and shape factor, whereas the equilibrium time is also correlated to pore-throat ratio and tortuosity. The sensitivities of fractal dimension, topological factor and shape factor to equilibrium time are stronger than that of equilibrium mass or height. The sensitivities of topological characteristics, pore-throat structure, tortuosity, pore geometry and fractal characteristics to SI reduce successively for porous media. The influences of dimensionless comprehensive parameter on evolution of SI mass with time go through four stages, i. e., no influence at initial stage, increasing influence at initial later stage, weakening influence at later stage and increasing influence at end, whereas on evolution of SI velocity versus time and recovery rate go through two stages, that is, significant influence at initial stage and no influence at later stage.

AB Sediment trapping of the synthetic construction site stormwater runoff (SCSSR) by grassed filter strip (GFS) was studied in a laboratory flume with simulated GFS of different slopes and bed surface areas. The polynomial regression model of average rainfall density depended rainfall duration has been approved by Malaysian Storm Water Management Manual. Still the relationship between either stormwater runoff flow rate or sediment trapping efficiency and rainfall duration needs to be verified. This study proposes the use of the empirical equations to determine the SCSSR flow rate and to estimate the efficiency of the GFS models to trap sediment based on the rainfall duration. All the parameters in equations have physical meanings, and experimental data validation showed that the equations are sufficiently accurate. The stormwater runoff flow rate and efficiency of the GFS models were verified for the SCSSR originally coming from a construction site of Kuala Lumpur city. New approaches to investigate the hydrological behaviour of construction site are presented and have significant implications for the ability of stormwater flow to carry sediment.

AB We develop a semi-analytical model to calculate the entry pressure in rough capillaries based on an energy balance principle and wetting theory on rough surfaces. During the drainage process, we assume fluids form arc menisci at corners of capillary cross-sections depending on the apparent angle, and that there is a wetting phase film adsorbed on the rough surface depending on the wetting condition. A Logistic model is proposed to explain the contact angle dependence on the structure of rough surfaces. Then the capillary entry pressure is calculated by extended MS-P (Mayer, Stowe and Princen) method. We verify the model using the pseudopotential Lattice Boltzmann model and obtain good agreement between the analytical and simulated pressures. Taking capillaries with triangular sections with pillar pillar-type rough surfaces as example, we discuss how rough structures and contact angles influence capillary behaviors. The results reveal that both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those in smooth capillaries under the same conditions. Moreover, the entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions and is much more sensitive to the pillar asperity height than the other structure parameters.

AB Relationships between nitrate concentrations and discharge rates (C-Q) at the catchment outlet can provide insights into sources, mobilization and biogeochemical transformations of nitrate within the catchment. Nitrate C-Q relationships often exhibit considerable scatter that might be related to variable hydrologic conditions during runoff events at sampling time, corresponding to variable sources and flow paths despite similar discharge (Q) rates. Although previous studies investigated the origins of this scatter in individual or in a few catchments, the role of different runoff event types across a large set of catchments is not yet fully understood. This study combines a hydrological runoff event classification framework with low-frequency nitrate samples in 184 catchments to explore the role of different runoff events in shaping long-term C-Q relationships and their variability across contrasting catchments. In most of the catchments, snow-impacted events produce positive deviations of concentrations, indicating an increased nitrate mobilization compared to the long-term pattern. In contrast, negative deviations occur mostly for rainfall-induced events with dry antecedent conditions, indicating the occurrence of lower nitrate concentrations (C) in river flows than their long-term pattern values during this type of event. Pronounced differences in event runoff coefficients among different event types indicate their contrasting levels of hydrologic connectivity that in turn might play a key role in controlling nitrate transport due to the activation of faster flow paths between sources and streams. Using long-term, low-frequency nitrate data, we demonstrate that runoff event types shape observed scatter in long-term C-Q relationships according to their level of hydrologic connectivity. In addition, we hypothesize that the level of biogeochemical attenuation of catchments can partially explain the spatial variability of the scatter during different event types.

AB The theory of moving packets is developed, and a practical moving packet model for Richards' equation is created, implemented using linked lists, and verified for vertical flow in variably saturated layered porous media. The model uses a Lagrangian approach. When simulating infiltration, for example, packets of water are injected at the ground surface, and an implicit finite difference approximation to Darcy's law is used to track the vertical movement of the boundaries which separate each packet from its neighbors above and below. In effect, the boundaries define a nonuniform self-adapting grid which is carried along with the flow. The moving packet method was designed to be used as the basis for models of coupled flow, transport, and mixing. Its advantage is that transported properties and matter can be carried within the packets, simplifying the modeling of advection, dispersion, and mixing.

AB Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology, meteorology and agriculture. It is influenced by many factors, such as topography, soil properties, vegetation type, management, and meteorological conditions. The role of these factors in controlling the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics is often not well known. The aim of the current study is to analyze spatio-temporal soil moisture patterns acquired across a variety of land use types, on different spatial scales (plot to meso-scale catchment) and with different methods (point measurements, remote sensing, and modeling). We apply a uniform set of tools to determine method specific effects, as well-as site and scale specific controlling factors. Spatial patterns of soil moisture and their temporal development were analyzed using nine different datasets from the Rur catchment in Western Germany. For all datasets we found negative linear relationships between the coefficient of variation and the mean soil moisture, indicating lower spatial variability at higher mean soil moisture. For a forest sub-catchment compared to cropped areas, the offset of this relationship was larger, with generally larger variability at similar mean soil moisture values. Using a geostatistical analysis of the soil moisture patterns we identified three groups of datasets with similar values for sill and range of the theoretical variogram: (i) modeled and measured datasets from the forest sub-catchment (patterns mainly influenced by soil properties and topography), (ii) remotely sensed datasets from the cropped part of the Rur catchment (patterns mainly influenced by the land-use structure of the cropped area), and (iii) modeled datasets from the cropped part of the Rur catchment (patterns mainly influenced by large scale variability of soil properties). A fractal analysis revealed that all analyzed soil moisture patterns showed a multifractal behavior, with at least one scale break and generally high fractal dimensions. Corresponding scale breaks were found between different datasets. The factors causing these scale breaks are consistent with the findings of the geostatistical analysis. Furthermore, the joined analysis of the different datasets showed that small differences in soil moisture dynamics, especially at the upper and lower bounds of soil moisture (at maximum porosity and wilting point of the soils) can have a large influence on the soil moisture patterns and their autocorrelation structure. Depending on the prevalent type of land use and the time of year, vegetation causes a decrease or an increase of spatial variability in the soil moisture pattern. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB To study difference at the urban scale (a few tens of kilometers), the raindrop size distribution (DSD) characteristics at five sites (Luhe (LH), Pukou (PK), Jingning (JN), Lishui (LS) and Gaochun (GC)) within five districts of Nanjing are compared using five years of PARticle SIze VELocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer data during the East Asian rainy season. The percentage of class C5 (extreme rainfall) to rain amount at LH (industrial zone) is significantly higher than that at the other sites (up to 38%). In addition, LH has the largest log(10)N(w) value, while JN (closest to the city center) has the largest D-m value for all rain rate classes and rainfall types. Compared with those of stratiform rainfall, the A and b values of convective rainfall from the Z-R relationship are remarkably more dispersed among the different sites. Moreover, the X-band is more robust to site differences than the S-band and C-band, and thus may be more suitable for rainfall monitoring at the urban scale.

AB Permeability is a key parameter that controls mass and energy transport in geologic media. Its spatial variation is generally agreed within the research community, while the scale effect in permeability is Still under considerable debate. This debate is mainly due to the lack of consistent measurement and interpretation of site data. Here, we show a strong field evidence of directional permeability scale effect from cross-hole pneumatic injection tests conducted in unsaturated fractured tuff at a field site in central Arizona, USA. The analysis reveals that permeability increases with the radial distance measured between the centroids of injection and monitoring locations of the test, which we consider to be the measurement scale. These results are compared to previously analyzed single-hole tests conducted at Multiple measurement scales. We hypothesize that the permeability scale effect is controlled by the connectivity of fluid conducting fractures, which also increases with Scale. This observation and hypothesis is consistent With existing scaling theories in fracture connectivity, although subsurface fracture connectivity cannot be measured directly with present technology. These results suggest the need to obtain permeability estimates that are commensurate with the scale of intended use. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB Manual and low-tech well drilling techniques have potential to assist in reaching the United Nations' millennium development goal for water in sub-Saharan Africa. This study used publicly available geospatial data in a regression tree analysis to predict groundwater depth in the Zinder region of Niger to identify suitable areas for manual well drilling. Regression trees were developed and tested on a database for 3681 wells in the Zinder region. A tree with 17 terminal leaves provided a range of ground water depth estimates that were appropriate for manual drilling, though much of the tree's complexity was associated with depths that were beyond manual methods. A natural log transformation of groundwater depth was tested to see if rescaling dataset variance would result in finer distinctions for regions of shallow groundwater. The RMSE for a log-transformed tree with only 10 terminal leaves was almost half that of the untransformed 17 leaf tree for groundwater depths less than 10 m. This analysis indicated important groundwater relationships for commonly available maps of geology, soils, elevation, and enhanced vegetation index from the MODIS satellite imaging system.

TI The interstate river compact: Incentives for noncompliance
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ENFORCEMENT; POLLUTION
AB Twenty-one western United States rivers are governed by interstate compacts. This gaper examines the issue of compliance with interstate river compacts in the western United States and some of the factors influencing compact compliance. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence presented in this paper suggest that upper basin states governed by interstate compacts with percentage delivery rules are more likely to comply with compact requirements than states whose rivers are governed by fixed delivery rules. Evidence indicates that both the frequency and level of noncompliance tend to be larger under a fixed allocation rule. Under such a rule the upper basin state bears a greater share of a shortage and experiences greater variability so it would have a greater incentive to cheat. A comparative study of the South Platte and La Plata Rivers is consistent with this hypothesis. Given the large demands imposed on many western United States rivers, our analysis suggests that compliance analysis is likely to be an important component of interstate negotiations and that administration of interstate compacts will become increasingly important.

AB It is commonly assumed that dams retain nutrients and cause eutrophication in reservoirs after impoundment. In this study, we explored denitrification in a riparian zone at the land-water interface in a hydropower reservoir of the upper Mekong River. Results demonstrated that hydropower production intensified water level fluctuations in the reservoir and significantly accelerated riparian denitrification process at the land-water interface; the denitrification rate exhibited a strong positive relationship with the period of water level rising-falling cycle (r(2) = 0.98, P < 0.05). Intensified water level fluctuations created frequently alternate wetting-drying cycles and enhanced hyporheic exchanges in the riparian zone, which accelerated organic carbon mineralization and thereby increased carbon source supply to fuel denitrification. In addition, river impoundment after dam construction appreciably enlarged the hot spots for riparian denitrification. The accelerated denitrification as well as the enlarged hot spots area jointly enhanced nitrogen removal from impounded rivers. These findings could advance fundamental knowledge on the environmental impacts of hydropower development on rivers.

TI Climate change impacts on water yields and demands in south-western

AB A climate shift in the mid 1970s reduced rainfalls in south-western Australia by 10-15% and inflows into reservoirs that supply the city of Perth (population 1.8 m) by more than half. The region has a Mediterranean climate, similar to other areas in the world experiencing reductions in rainfall and rises in temperatures.
   Rainfall-runoff modelling has indicated that streamflows may reduce by a further quarter by 2030 or by half if a dry future climate is experienced. Groundwater levels on the coastal plain in south-western Australia have fallen since the mid 1970s where unconfined aquifers are covered with perennial vegetation, including under the main water supply aquifer for Perth. Modelled projections are that groundwater levels in most areas will continue to fall through to 2030 under most future climate scenarios.
   Projected streamflows and groundwater levels indicate reduced water availability but these need to be converted to projected water yields, i.e. the amount of water that can be diverted for consumptive use. This paper reports how projections of future streamflow and groundwater levels were used to estimate 2030 divertible water yields for a 62,500 km(2) area in south-western Australia. These yields were then compared with estimates of water demands in 2030 to identify areas of water surplus and deficit under clearly defined assumptions. The methods used to define future yields are based on sets of rules that could be varied by water managers if desired.
   Surface water yields are estimated to decrease by about 24% (possible range of -4% to -49%) which is similar to the projected reduction in runoff (-25% with a range of -7% to -42%). Groundwater yields are projected to fall by only about 2% (range of +2% to -7%) because of reductions in evapotranspiration and drainage losses as watertables fall where groundwater levels are close to the surface. In addition, recharge remains relatively high under cleared areas used for non-irrigated agriculture. In some areas with high groundwater recharge and little groundwater use groundwater levels may continue to rise even under a hotter and drier future climate. While overall groundwater yields may be little affected there are very important groundwater resources, especially those covered by perennial vegetation, which will experience large reductions in available yield under most projected future climates.
   Under current per-capita water consumption levels, rapid population and economic growth, along with the reductions in water yields, are expected to result in appreciable water deficits developing near Perth and some regional cities in south-western Australia by 2030. Where both surface water and groundwater resources are available for use, groundwater is anticipated to become increasingly used in future. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   DYNAMICS; OCEANS; SEA
AB Correlations between suspended sediment load rating parameters, river basin morphology, and climate provide information about the physical controls on the sediment load in rivers and are used to create predictive equations for the sediment rating parameters. Long-term time-averaged values of discharge, suspended load, flow duration, flow peakedness, and temporally averaged values of precipitation, temperature, and range in temperature were coupled with the drainage area and basin relief to establish statistical relationships with the sediment rating parameters for 59 gauging stations. Rating parameters (a and b) are defined by a power law relating daily discharge values of a river (Q) and its sediment concentration C-s, where C-s = aQ(b). The rating coefficient n (the mathematical concentration at Q = 1 m(3)/s) is inversely proportional to the long-term mean discharge and is secondarily related to the average air temperature and the basin's topographic relief. The rating exponent b (the log-log slope of the power law) correlates most strongly with the average air temperature and basin relief and has lesser correlations with the long-term load of the river (which is related to basin relief and drainage area). The rating equation describes the long-term character of the suspended sediment load in a river. Each river undergoes higher-frequency variability (decadal, interannual, and storm event) around this characteristic response, controlled by weather patterns and channel recovery from extreme precipitation events.

AB In recent years, nitrogen (N) loss from upland fields has become one of the most important sources for agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Understanding the relationships between soil hydrological processes and N loss in NPS pollution is vital for controlling the agricultural NPS pollution in upland fields. The objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of N loss with different moisture conditions in the freeze-thaw zone. The semi-distributed hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in this study to simulate runoff and different forms of N loss, which provided a basis for analyzing characteristics of N loss in the study region. Results showed that the soil moisture content was an important factor affecting N loss in the study region. Different forms of N loss were also analyzed and it was found that N loss occurred primarily in the form of organic-N, which is likely due to the dominant role of erosion-induced pollution. This study provides useful information for preventing NPS pollution within the study region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to improve drought forecasting skill, this study develops a probabilistic drought forecasting framework comprised of dynamical and statistical modeling components. The novelty of this study is to seek the use of data assimilation to quantify initial condition uncertainty with the Monte Carlo ensemble members, rather than relying entirely on the hydrologic model or land surface model to generate a single deterministic initial condition, as currently implemented in the operational drought forecasting systems. Next, the initial condition uncertainty is quantified through data assimilation and coupled with a newly developed probabilistic drought forecasting model using a copula function. The initial condition at each forecast start date are sampled from the data assimilation ensembles for forecast initialization. Finally, seasonal drought forecasting products are generated with the updated initial conditions. This study introduces the theory behind the proposed drought forecasting system, with an application in Columbia River Basin, Pacific Northwest, United States. Results from both synthetic and real case studies suggest that the proposed drought forecasting system significantly improves the seasonal drought forecasting skills and can facilitate the state drought preparation and declaration, at least three months before the official state drought declaration.

AB Alluvial aquifers are largely used as groundwater resource since large flow rates can be obtained due to infiltration from the neighboring river. Reductive conditions in the infiltration flow path, caused by the degradation of organic matter, can induce effects detrimental to water quality, such as dissolution of Mn and Fe from the aquifer sediments. In the absence of any direct relationship between the redox potential (Eh) and reductive conditions favorable to manganese and/or iron reduction, we propose a quantitative approach, the electron trapping capacity (ETC). It is calculated using dissolved O-2 and NO3 concentrations in groundwater, weighted for the quantity of electrons these two species can trap during the oxidation of organic matter. This approach, tested on several field and laboratory investigations, indicates that reductive dissolution of manganese and iron oxyhydroxides occurs for an ETC lower than 0.2 mmol L-1. Exceptions to that threshold value are observed when Mn-rich groundwater flows too fast out of a reduced zone into an oxidizing environment to permit equilibrium precipitation of Mn oxyhydroxides.

AB The spatial distribution of soil surface water content in a bare soil was evaluated by a thermal inertia approach from high resolution visible/near infrared (VIS/NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) airborne data. Given that the relationship between the thermal inertia and the soil water content strongly depends on the accurate estimation of the soil thermal conductivity, two different empirical models were applied to estimate it. Remotely estimated water contents were tested with time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements collected on a 110 x 90 m(2) bare field in coincidence with airborne over-flights.
   The thermal conductivity model by Johansen (1975) produced more accurate estimates of soil surface water content than that by Campbell (1985), especially for water content higher than 0.15 (m(3) m(-3)). The considered thermal inertia approach allowed prediction of the spatial distribution of the soil water content with a satisfactory level of accuracy. In particular a relatively better accuracy was obtained when the remote sensing images were analyzed directly at the same scale of the field measurements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme climate events such as severe droughts and floods have become more frequent and widespread in the 21st Century. Recent studies have revealed the tele-connections between Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and extreme precipitation over different regions such as South America, India and China. This study investigates the influence of MJO on global extreme dry and wet conditions, and how the strength of the relationship changes across the MJO phases over the globe. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) calculated from global GLEAM evapotranspiration dataset is used to represent extreme dry and wet conditions. Strong correlations between MJO and extreme dry and wet conditions are found, particularly over monsoon regions such as South Asia, South America and East Africa. The underlying mechanism of the influence of MJO on extreme dry and wet conditions is associated with the variation of precipitation, air temperature and soil moisture modulated by the MJO. The study suggests that MJO impacts on extreme dry and wet conditions should be taken into account in investigation of droughts/floods around the world particularly over monsoon areas.

TI Flood damage functions based on a single physics- and data-based impact

AB Direct flood damage is commonly assessed using damage models (i.e., vulnerability functions and fragility curves), which describe the relationship between hazard, vulnerability, and the (probability of) damage for items exposed to floods. In this paper, we introduce a non-dimensional impact parameter that, according to the physics of damage mechanisms and/or tuned on field or lab data, combines water depth and flow velocity in a general and flexible form. We then suggest a general approach to assess relative damage functions for items of different nature, subject to either progressive or on-off damage processes. The proposed method enhances traditional tools that use inundation depth as the main (or only) explicative variable, and allows recasting the results from previous studies in an elegant, flexible and unique form. Compared to multivariate models that link flow variables to damage directly, the physics-based approach allows for an intelligible assessment of flood hazard and the associated damage, even in case of scarce or sparse data. The proposed impact parameter and the related procedure to assess the relative damage functions are applied to different kinds of exposed items (people, vehicles, and buildings), demonstrating the general applicability and validity of the proposed method.

AB River acts as a continuum of dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport and transformation. However, underlying controls of fluvial DOM spatiotemporal variability has yet to be revealed. Here, we explored the DOM component, molecular weight and source in the Longchuan River, a headwater tributary of the Yangtze with Karst characteristic. Concentrated rainfall, severe soil erosion and in-situ metabolism primarily controlled DOM component and molecular weight in the Karst river, resulting in accumulation of recalcitrant (high molecular weight) DOMs from tributaries to the main stem in the post-wet period. We found a robust relationship between DOM absorption coefficients (a(280) and a(350)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations from a multiple linear regression model: [DOC] = 0.098a(285) + 0.591a(350) + 1.337 (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.001). High fluorescence index (FI) values (> 1.9) indicated a dominant origin of autochthonous DOM. Biological index (BIX) values exhibited an increasing trend along the flow direction, suggesting a large amount of recently produced DOM from phytoplankton downstream. Our findings demonstrated that both allochthonous and autochthonous inputs regulated DOM dynamics in a river continuum with Karst characteristic, highlighting spatiotemporal variability of DOM response to River Continuum Concept (RCC).

AB In this paper, a new numerical model for the simulation of constituent transport in both steady and unsteady flow conditions is presented. The transport model is a routing procedure in which the advection process is solved by means of the Lagrangian coordinate transformation, while the dispersion process is approximated within each time step by means of the convolution principle, exploiting a multilinear procedure. In order to facilitate the application of the Lagrangian coordinate transformation during unsteady flow conditions, the unsteady velocity field corresponding to the linearized parabolic approximation of the Saint Venant Equations is provided, taking into account appropriate boundary conditions. Finally, classic BOD-DO relationships are embedded into the routing procedure in order to perform water quality applications with reactive constituents. The model is first demonstrated with respect to a numerical water quality model in both steady and unsteady hydraulic conditions, and is then applied to two real-world cases. Because of its characteristics, the proposed model seems suitable for real time forecast of pollutant concentrations when an emergency event occurs, or for water quality management in real rivers.

ID CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; TUBE; RESUSPENSION; SEDIMENTS; CHANNELS; LAKE
AB The accurate analysis of the contaminant transport process in wetland flows is essential for environmental assessment. However, dispersivity assessment becomes complicated when the wind strength and direction are taken into consideration. Prior studies illustrating the wind effect on environmental dispersion in wetland flows simply focused on the mean longitudinal concentration distribution. Moreover, the results obtained by these analyses are not accurate when done on a smaller scale, namely, the initial stage of the contaminant transport process. By combining the concentration moments method (the Aris' method) and Gill's expansion theory, the previous researches on environmental dispersion in wetland flows with effect of wind have been extended. By adopting up to 4th-order moments, the wind effect-as illustrated by dimensionless parameters Er (wind force) and omega (wind direction)-on kurtosis and skewness is discussed, the up to 4th-order vertical concentration distribution is obtained, and the two-dimensional concentration distribution is illustrated. This work demonstrates that wind intensity and direction can significantly affect the contaminant dispersion. Moreover, the study presents a more accurate analytical solution of environmental dispersion in wetland flows under various wind conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hydraulic properties of three-dimensional (3-D) fractured rock masses are usually reduced to twodimensional (2-D) problems, which may lead to unreliable conclusions. This study provides a theoretical method to identify the connecting status (connected or disconnected) of 3-D isotropic fractured rock masses based on 2-D geometric information on cutting planes. The percolation threshold of 3-D fractured rock masses can be judged by the average number of intersections per fracture I. The relationship between I, number of fractures in per sampled area P-20 and trace length l are established. A connecting parameter P is defined to measure the average geometric information related to P-20 and l. When P < 0.88, the 3-D fractured rock masses is not permeable; and when P >= 0.88, the fractured rock masses are connected and permeable. Numerical experiments are conducted, and the results show that the developed theoretical formulae are valid. In addition, the estimation methods of P are also discussed based on l and number of fractures in per sampled length P10 or Rock Quality Designation (RQD).

AB Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used to examine the complex links between the five characteristics of flow (magnitude, duration, timing, frequency, and variation), defined as part of the "natural flow regime" ecological paradigm, for spring heavy flood, and five climate indices (Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Nord Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)) in southern Quebec, over the period from 1934 to 2004. The two methods yield similar results. AMO and NAO appear to be the main index correlated with the following four flow characteristics: duration, timing, frequency and coefficient of variation. Thus, positive AMO and NAO anomalies are associated with delayed timing, higher frequency, relatively long duration and relatively weak variability of spring heavy floods in Quebec. This relationship reflects sustained climate conditions characterized by low temperature in winter and early spring in eastern Canada during negative phases of AMO and positives phases NAO. No link was noted between climate indices and the magnitude of spring heavy floods in Quebec. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We use numerical modeling to investigate the interactions between laminar flow in a water column, current-bedform induced flow in underlying permeable sediments, and discharge of deep groundwater to the water column. Groundwater discharge reduces the spatial extent of current-induced exchange zones within the sediments and may completely prevent the development of current-bedform induced flow at high groundwater discharge. Although exchange zone size is reduced by groundwater discharge, the reduction in exchange flux is not significant, suggesting reduced residence times of materials cycled through these smaller zones. Fluid exchange zones tend to be centered around the reattachment points of eddies that also mark the location of flow divides within the sediments; while deep groundwater is discharged preferentially along troughs. Exchange zone depth and the water column Reynolds number are functionally related through a Morgan-Mercer-Flodin model. The relationship between the current-induced flux through the sediments and the Reynolds number is described by low-order monotonic polynomial functions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Lee & Mei(7) the macroscale equations for thermal consolidation in a periodic porous medium have been derived by homogenization theory. Here the macroscale coefficients are calculated for a cubic array of Wigner-Seitz grains. We first show that the elastic coefficient tensor of rank four has only three distinct constants and all the second rank tensor coefficients are isotropic. The canonical boundary cell problem for the elasticity tenser is then replaced by a variational principle, which is used as the basis for three-dimensional finite element computation. The dependence of the macroscale coefficients on the porosity is examined by varying an aspect ratio of the Wigner-Seitz cell. It is shown that the effective elastic coefficients and thermal modulus decrease with porosity whereas the pressure coefficient increases with porosity. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBSURFACE STORM FLOW; FORESTED HILLSLOPE; PERCOLATION THEORY; RUNOFF;
   GENERATION
AB Nonlinear relations between rain input and hillslope outflow are common observations in hillslope hydrology field studies. In this paper we use percolation theory to model the threshold relationship between rainfall amount and outflow and show that this nonlinear relationship may arise from simple linear processes at the smaller scale. When the rainfall amount exceeds a threshold value, the underlying elements become connected and water flows out of the base of the hillslope. The percolation approach shows how random variations in storage capacity and connectivity at the small spatial scale cause a threshold relationship between rainstorm amount and hillslope outflow.
   As a test case, we applied percolation theory to the well characterized experimental hillslope at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed. Analysing the measured rainstorm events and the subsurface stormflow with percolation theory, we could determine the effect of bedrock permeability, spatial distribution of soil properties and initial water content within the hillslope. The measured variation in the relationship between rainstorm amount and subsurface flow could be reproduced by modelling the initial moisture deficit, the loss of free water to the bedrock, the limited size of the system and the connectivity that is a function of bedrock topography and existence of macropores. The values of the model parameters were in agreement with measured values of soil depth distribution and water saturation.

AB Disordered systems are known to induce anomalous diffusion. This phenomenon may be important for environmental applications such as contaminant transport and nutrient availability. However, few studies have investigated anomalous diffusion in this context. In particular, the relationship between pore space geometry and anomalous diffusion is not well understood. We report on numerical simulations of solute diffusion within the water-filled pore spaces of two-dimensional geometrical models of heterogeneous porous media. Euclidean and mass, pore, and pore-solid prefractal lattices were used to generate random pore networks with varying porosity (phi) and lacunarity (L). The objectives were to investigate the effects of phi and L on the solute random walk dimension (d(w)) and to identify which of these models best represents a natural porous medium. Solute diffusion was simulated using a stochastic cellular automaton based on the "myopic ant'' algorithm. Estimates of d(w)>> 2 occurred with increasing frequency as phi -> 0, indicating scale dependency in the standard diffusion coefficient at low porosities. The relationship between d(w) and phi for the mass and pore-solid prefractal lattices was the closest to that for natural 2-D systems (i.e., soil thin sections). The presence of large, interconnected pore spaces (L -> 1) at low porosities reduced the intensity of anomalous diffusion (d(w)-> 2). A power law relationship based on the product of d(w) and L explained >96% of the total variation in phi regardless of the type of lattice considered. The potential predictive capability of this approach for natural porous media deserves further investigation.

AB Exploration of incipient motion study is significantly important for the river hydraulics community. The present study, along with experimental investigation, considered a new multi-level ensemble machine learning (ML) to determine critical shear stress (CSS) of gravel particles in a cohesive mixture of clay-silt-gravel, clay-silt-sand gravel, and clay-sand-gravel. The multi-level ensemble ML included a voting-based ensemble meta-estimator integrated with three modern standalone ensemble techniques, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive boosting (Adaboost), and Random Forest (RF), and performance is compared with three standalone ensemble models for prediction of CSS values. Besides, the optimum input combinations were explored using the forward stepwise selection method, as a correlation-based feature selection, and mutual information theory. The outcomes of simulation indicated that the multi-level ensemble machine learning (voting) model in terms of correlation coefficient (R = 0.9641), and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2022) was superior to the standalone ensemble techniques, i.e., XGBoost (R = 0.9482, and RMSE = 0.2375), Adaboost (R = 0.9496, and RMSE = 0.2387), and RF (R = 0.9392, and RMSE = 0.2739) for accurate estimation of CSS.

AB Changes in streambed sediments were monitored in conjunction with Q series of conservative solute tracer injections over a 2-year period to assess the effects of urbanization on two streams in the Valley Creek watershed, located in Chester County, Pennsylvania approximately 30 km west of Philadelphia. The modeling package OTIS was used to analyze the solute transport behavior. Comparison of the results from the two streams demonstrates that the fine sediment fraction of the streambed controls hydraulic conductivity and transient storage exchange in this gravel- and cobble-bed Piedmont system. One site had a narrow (10-40 m) riparian corridor of mowed lawn and woody brush. At this site, the silt-clay fraction (d < 50 mu m) of the fine sediment (d < 2 mm) increased from 6 to 25% during the course of the study. The relationship between sediment characteristics and transient storage exchange was evaluated using the method of Worman et al. [Worman, A., Packman, A.I., Johansson, H., Jonsson, K., 2002a. Effect of flow-induced exchange in hyporheic zones on longitudinal transport of solutes in streams and rivers. Water Resources Research 38. doi: 10.1029/2001WR000769], who showed that the hyporheic residence time, scaled by the hydraulic conductivity and stream depth, is a function of stream velocity and physical channel characteristics. This analysis indicated that the observed change in fine sediment composition caused a two-fold reduction in the hydraulic conductivity, a four-fold reduction in the transient storage area, and an order of magnitude reduction in the exchange coefficient. The second study site had a wide (100-300 m) riparian corridor of deciduous forest. During the study period, a parcel of woodland encompassing 11% of the drainage area was cleared and nine homes were constructed on the site. Despite this prominent development of the watershed, there was no significant change in sediment characteristics or solute transport during the study period. The model-derived transient storage exchange parameters in our urbanizing study sites were found to be statistically similar to the values for forested mountain streams given in the literature. Thus, the relationship between urbanization and transient storage should be determined by examining the temporal change in the characteristics of individual stream reaches rather than by comparing the solute transport parameters obtained in different types of streams.

AB Rainfall in mountainous watershed presents high spatial variability due to elevation effects, and this introduces uncertainty in forecasting hydrological hazards such as water floods and debris flows. This study investigated the spatial variation of rainfall in a small watershed with a network of 10 rain gauges. A rainfall-elevation relationship was established based on data from 52 rainstorm events, which provides a method for rainfall estimation within the watershed. Result indicated that lower errors of interpolation occur when the rainfall amount is high, and that it is more difficult to estimate rainfall in high-elevation regions. Rain gauges become less representative when the distance between gauges is >3.0 km. The spatial variation of rainfall suggests that the gauge at the lowest elevation, or a single gauge within the source region, shows non-negligible errors with regard to calculating water flood discharge and identifying rainfall thresholds for debris flows. This study contributes to the understanding of event rainfall distribution and its impact on hydrological hazard forecasting in a small mountainous watershed.

AB A variational approach for optimized drop size distribution (DSD) retrieval, attenuation correction, and rainfall estimation from polarimetric radar measurements (horizontal reflectivity factor Z(H), differential reflectivity Z(DR), and differential phase shift Phi(DP)) is proposed in this study. The spatial continuity of rain is guaranteed by introducing the radial B-spine filter and azimuthal Kalman filter, which helps to mitigate the impact of the random errors in Z(DR) and Phi(DP). The approach is evaluated using a simulated experiment and two real cases observed by a mobile C-band and an operational S-band polarimetric radar in south China. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed variational approach can correct attenuation more accurately than the conventional method using assumed linear relationships between specific attenuation and specific differential phase. The rainfalls derived from the DSD estimates based on this proposed approach agree well with the rain gauge measurements. It is also shown that the proposed method has a better performance than the existing variational retrieval and the composite estimator.

AB Ensemble size requirements were analyzed using Bayesian ensemble forecasts (Herr and Krzysztofowicz, 2010). These forecasts were generated using output from an analytic-numerical Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) within a Monte-Carlo algorithm. Empirical distributions were estimated from the ensemble forecasts and compared with the analytic distributions output by the BFS. Using the maximum absolute difference as a measure of the quality of fit, it was shown that a single graph described the relationship between the ensemble size and the expected maximum absolute difference. Within the scope of the experiments, the graph was insensitive to forecast point, precipitation event (rain or no rain), and lead time. However, the graph only applied to probabilistic river stage forecast and probabilistic flood forecast, but not to probabilistic stage transition forecast, which is specified by a family of conditional predictive one-step transition distributions. Herein, further mathematical analysis of the estimation algorithm shows that, with a small modification, the single graph can be applied to all three types of forecasts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It is generally acknowledged that in order to apply radar rainfall data for hydrological proposes adjustment against ground observations are crucial. Traditionally, radar reflectivity is transformed into rainfall rates applying a fixed reflectivity - rainfall rate relationship even though this is known to depend on the changing drop size distribution of the specific rain. This creates a transient bias between the radar rainfall and the ground observations due to seasonal changes of the drop size distribution as well as other atmospheric effects and effects related to the radar observational technology. In this study different bias adjustment techniques is investigated, developing a complete 10-year dataset (2002-2012) of high spatio-temporal resolution radar rainfall based on a radar observations from a single C-band radar from Denmark. Results show that hourly adjustment mean field bias adjustment outperform daily mean field bias adjustment with regards to estimation of rainfall totals and peak rain rates. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that radar rainfall estimates can be improved significantly by implementation of a novel advection interpolation technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of river basins often involves trading-off competing objectives in an uncertain environment. Through a stochastic analysis, the trade-off discovery can be enriched to identify vulnerabilities; that is, the sensitivity of those losses with respect to changing conditions in the basin. Using the Senegal River basin as a case study, we generate probabilistic trade-offs to analyze the competition between objectives that are vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Here the natural factors essentially correspond to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability, while the anthropogenic factors include future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the water resources system. Our analysis of the trade-off relationships reveals the existence of two coalitions of objectives: traditional food production (agriculture and floodplain fisheries) versus hydropower-navigation. The probabilistic trade-offs also show that of the two main coalitions of objectives, the one dealing with traditional food production is much more vulnerable to changes in both hydroclimatic conditions and allocation policies. Since traditional food production mostly concerns economically and politically-marginal communities in downstream riparian countries, this larger vulnerability should be factored in when negotiating water and benefits sharing schemes.

AB Groundwater salinization is considered to be one of the most severe and complex phenomena affecting coastal regions worldwide, occurring when high concentrations of water-soluble salts are present in groundwater sys-tems. Geostatistics is a branch of statistics used to analyze and predict the spatio-temporal variability of such complex phenomena. In particular, numerous geostatistical approaches and technologies are currently used to identify and map salinity-affected regions, investigate how salinity indicators influence groundwater mecha-nisms, and eventually design optimal groundwater management policies. This article reviews recent key appli-cations of geostatistical methods to address challenges relevant to groundwater salinization. The basic principles of geostatistics are briefly described, and numerous studies are discussed that employ geostatistical and multi-variate tools for identifying the origin of salinity sources, clarifying the relationship among salinity indicators and groundwater processes, and propagating the uncertainty of the inputs to the outputs of either physically -based or surrogate models of relevant geological systems. Finally, several recommendations and future di-rections are identified with regards to the most popular methods and with regards to key geostatistical methods whose application in this thematic area is still very limited.

AB In this study the flood abatement effect at dams with gated spillways under a wide range of extreme floods is analysed (100 < return period <10,000 years). A group of integrated models (rainfall generator, hydrological model and dam operation model) interacting within a Monte Carlo simulation framework is used for producing numerous hydrologic events at 21 sites across mainland Spain, and the hydrologic response applied to 81 configurations of dams and reservoirs. Common behavioural patterns are identified and dimensionless coefficients classified, based on the hydrologic variables and the dam and reservoir characteristics. The relationships between these coefficients are analysed, with a significant degree of correlation both among the cases and the varying magnitude of floods being obtained. Finally, models that enable evaluation of the abatement capacity of a dam with a gated spillway in the event of a flood with Tr between 500 and 10,000 years are offered. In addition, they allow the frequency curve of such a maximum flow to be obtained, something which could serve of use not only during the design phase but also in the evaluation of the hydrologic safety of dams.

AB This is the first of three related papers that summarizes streamflow characteristics of a set of 1221 global rivers. The rivers are welt distributed world-wide, are unimpacted by upstream reservoirs or diversions for the period of data collection and have at (east 10 years of continuous monthly and annual streamflow data. The following key features of annual flows are examined: mean, variability and skewness, distribution type (Gamma or Lognormal), flow percentiles and dependence. High and tow frequency persistence is examined through the Empirical Mode Decomposition technique. Low flow run Length, magnitude and severity are also explored, where severity is based on Extended Deficit Analysis. It has been observed elsewhere that there are Large differences in hydrologic characteristics between Australia and southern Africa in contrast to the rest of the world. This issue is tested further in this paper. The range of analyses and results presented herein also form a suite of empirical evidence that future unified theories of hydrology at the catchment scale must be able to adequately describe.

AB Hydrologic regionalization consists of regrouping stations and catchments in pools based on a similarity measure. Regionalization is commonly used to extract a robust signal that can be used to describe the hydrology of the region or extrapolated to a location without measured information. Obviously, the similarity measure used af-fects the type of hydrological behavior one would expect from stations within a region. Most regionalization methods assume a stable and/or linear relationship between parameters of interests while it is well known that the physical processes driving the behavior of hydrometeorological variables are inherently non-linear and non-stationary. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure that is based on the location of changepoints in hy-drological time series. The proposed method has the unique advantage over other hydrological region delin-eation methods to detect regions where hydrological member stations are non-linearly correlated, and where the strength of the relation varies with time. It therefore has the potential to uncover similarities that would not have been detected by existing regionalization techniques. The proposed method is applied to the Tensift watershed located in Morocco, North Africa. The coherence of the detected regions is checked using wavelet coherence.

AB In hydrologic models, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) interfaces are commonly used for extracting the channel network, and delineating the watershed. By overlaying soil and land use maps onto the extracted channel network, input files required by the model are prepared. However, the nature of the extracted channel network strongly depends on some pre-selected threshold values within the GIS framework, which in turn, determine the geomorphologic resolution. There are no accepted guidelines for selecting these threshold parameters making the extraction of channel networks a subjective process. In this study, we investigate the effect of geomorphologic resolution on runoff hydrographs and sedimentographs over two small USDA experimental watersheds. The KINEROS model with ArcView interface has been used for this purpose. An empirical relationship between optimal resolution, watershed characteristics and nature of the storm has been developed. Results reveal that geometric simplification of the watershed for rainfall-runoff-erosion studies may be acceptable under right combinations of rainfall events and watershed properties. Our results also indicate that the optimal geomorphologic resolution may not be the same for hydrographs and sedimentographs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low Impact Development (LID) was promoted as an alternative to conventional urban drainage methods. The effects of LID at the site or urban scales have been widely evaluated. This project aims to investigate the impact of LID implementation on basin runoff at a regional scale in a half-urbanized catchment, particularly the overlap of urban and rural sub-flows at peak times. A SUPERFLEX conceptual model framework is adapted as a semi -distributed model to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship in the catchment for San Antonio, Texas, as a case study. Scenario analyses of both urban development and LID implementation are conducted. Results show that (1) the infill urban development strategy benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban devel-opment; (2) in non-flood season, permeable pavements, bioretention cells, and vegetated swales decrease peak runoff significantly, and permeable pavements, bioretention cells, and green roofs are good at runoff volume retention; (3) contrary to the general opinion about the peak reduction effect of LID, for a partly urbanized, partly rural basin, the LID implementation delays urban peaks and may cause larger stacking of rural and urban peak runoffs, leading to larger basin peaks under extremely wet conditions.

AB This work is the third in a series of papers on the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) approach to modeling flow and transport phenomena in multiscale porous medium systems. Building upon the general TCAT framework and the mathematical foundation presented in previous works in this series, we demonstrate the TCAT approach for the case of single-fluid-phase flow. The formulated model is based upon conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy and a general entropy inequality constraint, which is developed to guide model closure. A specific example of a closed model is derived under limiting assumptions using a linearization approach and these results are compared and contrasted with the traditional single-phase-flow model. Potential extensions to this work are discussed. Specific advancements in this work beyond previous averaging theory approaches to single-phase flow include use of macroscale thermodynamics that is averaged from the microscale, the use of derived equilibrium conditions to guide a flux-force pair approach to simplification, use of a general Lagrange multiplier approach to connect conservation equation constraints to the entropy inequality, and a focus on producing complete, closed models that are solvable.

AB The management of river-lake systems is hindered by limitations in the applicability of existing models that describe the relationship between environmental factors and phytoplankton community characteristics but rarely include common and indirect effects on algae dynamics. In this study, we assumed that the interaction of light, water, temperature, pH, and nutrients, including direct and indirect effects, are the potential factors affecting phytoplankton dynamics. We determined which of these are the main drivers of phytoplankton community structure and production in a river-lake system by using three different models based on the partial least squares structural equation modeling method. Our results indicated that the models achieved more than 60% of the overall explanatory power of various environmental factors on phytoplankton characteristics, including indirect and direct effects. In particular, light, pH, and nutrient content and ratios commonly control phytoplankton dynamic characteristics rather than a single nutrient, but light is the main driving force of phytoplankton community characteristics. Controlling the underwater light conditions, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution load could effectively regulate algal blooms, increase productivity, promote ecological balance, and reduce water pollution. Our findings provide a scientific and theoretical basis for water resource management and pollution control.

AB Governed by atmospheric demand, soil water conditions and plant characteristics, plant water status is dynamic, complex, and fundamental to efficient agricultural water management. To explore a centralized signal for the evaluation of plant water status based on soil water status, two greenhouse experiments investigating the effect of the relative distribution between soil water and roots on wheat and rice were conducted. Due to the significant offset between the distributions of soil water and roots, wheat receiving subsurface irrigation suffered more from drought than wheat under surface irrigation, even when the arithmetic averaged soil water content (SWC) in the root zone was higher. A significant relationship was found between the plant water deficit index (PWDI) and the root-weighted (rather than the arithmetic) average SWC over root zone. The traditional soil-based approach for the estimation of PWDI was improved by replacing the arithmetic averaged SWC with the root-weighted SWC to take the effect of the relative distribution between soil water and roots into consideration. These results should be beneficial for scheduling irrigation, as well as for evaluating plant water consumption and root density profile. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims at exploring the anticipation phase before a flash flood, corresponding to the time between the first climatic signs and the peak-flow. We focus the analysis on people's behaviors observing how they use this period to organize themselves for facing the event. The analysis is made through the definition of three specific scales: the timeliness scale, an analytical scale of anticipatory actions and the scale of human response network. Using a cross-scale and cross level analysis enables to define different phases in the anticipation period where different kind of environmental precursors are mobilized by the actors in order to make sense of the situation and adapt. Three main points deserve attention at the end: firstly, the concepts of timeliness, anticipatory actions and crisis network scales enable to understand differently what happens both physically and socially during an extreme event; secondly, analyzing the precursors shows that each level of crisis network uses different kinds of signs for estimating the situation, organizing and reacting; thirdly, there is a potential for improvement in observation on both social and physical processes at different scales, for verifying the theory of the anticipatory phases.

TI ERT and salinity - A method to determine whether ERT-detected

AB The identification of preferential flow generation and the tracking of their pathways in agricultural soils are challenging tasks, in particular while keeping the soil profile undisturbed. The noninvasive electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method seems, a priori, to be an ideal tool for these purposes, but the simultaneous dependence of soil electrical resistivity (ER) on soil moisture content and salt concentration poses a problem when high-salinity water is involved. The dependence of these variables is expressed, for example, by Archie's law. Irrigation with brackish or treated wastewater are two such complicated cases. The latter has been found to render soils water-repellent with inherent flow in preferential pathways. A method that resolves this complication is developed and applied for in-situ-measured ERT data. This method combines a model that simulates the preferential ER(t) as a series of interconnected well-mixed units (WMUs) with frequent ERT scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying. Following validation by comparison of its output to simulations using the Richards equation for flow and convection-dispersion equation for transport, the WMU model was used to simulate scenarios of simultaneous variations in moisture content, salinity, and ER(t) in a well-mixed soil volume (unit). The characteristic patterns acquired by these simulations were compared with in-situ measured ER(z,t) to determine whether the observed preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow or salinity pathways, or both. From the eight sections in the profile where this analysis was made for, five exhibit preferential flow, characterized by fast wetting front propagation that includes by-passing of a certain soil volume, while the wetting front velocity in the other three was moderate. We, therefore, concluded, based on the water content/salinity effect on ER, that the measured preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow pathways. Salinity has, for the current case, a minor, if any, effect on the ER spatial variation. Therefore, ERT is an advantageous mean of mapping of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile, and the method developed herein can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile. Particular irrigation design and management can be then used to ease the negative effects of preferential flow pathways on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone.

AB Multi-satellite sensing of continental water surfaces (WS) represents an unprecedented and increasing potential for studying ungauged hydrological and hydraulic processes from their signatures, especially on complex flow zones such as anabranching rivers. However the estimation of discharge from WS observations only is a very challenging, ill-posed, inverse problem due to unknown bathymetry and friction in ungauged rivers, measurements nature, quality and spatio-temporal resolutions regarding the flow (model) scales. This paper proposes an effective 1D hydraulic modeling approach of sufficient complexity to describe anabranching river flows from sparse multisatellite observations using the HiVDI inverse method presented in Laurier et al. (2019) with an augmented control vector including a spatially distributed friction law K (x, h) depending on the flow depth h. It is shown on 71 km of the Xingu River (anabranching, Amazon basin) with altimetric water height timeseries that a fairly accurate upstream discharge hydrograph and effective patterns of channel bathymetry and friction can be inferred simultaneously. The coherence between the sparse observation grid and the fine hydraulic model grid is ensured in the optimization process by imposing a piecewise linear bathymetry profile b(x), which is consistent with the hydraulic visibility of WS signatures (Garambois et al., 2017; Montazem et al., 2019). The discharge hydrograph Q(t) at observation times and effective bathymetry-friction (b(x), K(x, h)) patterns are retrieved from 8 years of satellite altimetry (ENVISAT) at 6 virtual stations (VS) along flow. Next, the potential of the forthcoming SWOT data, dense in space, is highlighted by inferring a discharge hydrograph and dense patterns of effective river bathymetry and friction; a physically consistent scaling of friction by reaches enables to consider more dense bathymetry controls. Finally a numerical analysis shows: (i) the importance of an unbiased prior information in the inference of a triplet (Q, b(x), K(x, h)) from WS observations; (ii) the clear signatures of river bottom slope break in low flows and width variations in high flows, through the analysis of the friction slope term, which is consistent with the findings of Montazem et al. (2019) from WS curvature analysis.

AB Understanding the variability of water supply reservoir yields is central for planning purposes. The basis of this study is an empirical global relationship between reservoir storage capacity, water supply yield and reliability based on a global database of 729 rivers. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the coefficient of variation of estimates of water supply reservoir yields depend only on the length of streamflows record and the coefficient of variation of the streamflows used to estimate the yield. We compare the results of those Monte Carlo experiments with an analytical uncertainty method First Order Variance Approximation (FOVA). FOVA is shown to produce a general, accurate and useful expression for estimating the coefficient of variation of water supply reservoir yield estimates. We also document how the FOVA analytical model can be used to determine the minimum length of streamflow record required during the design of water supply reservoirs so as to ensure that the yield delivered from reservoir falls within a prespecified margin of error.

AB This study examined radon concentrations in springs in Kumamoto and Aso regions following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, in addition to monitoring springs near the Futagawa-Hinagu fault zone for more than two years following the earthquake to investigate the relationship between crustal deformation and the radon concentration variation. We compared these radon concentrations with those obtained prior to the earthquake. The springs that showed elevated radon concentrations were located within the compressive strain quadrant of the earthquake. The post-seismic concentration variations of the monitored springs can be explained by rock porosity changes. These results suggest that the radon concentration in spring water is affected by porosity changes caused by stress changes derived from earthquake deformation and subsequent post-seismic relaxation. Our results are consistent with the previously inferred permeability enhancement model. Mass conservation calculations for radon release yielded porosity changes ranging from 30% to 70% for some aquifer systems. This study explores the possibility of radon monitoring as a tool to investigate not only seismic precursors but also post-seismic crustal deformation and aquifer property changes due to large earthquakes on a regional scale.

AB Turbulent bursting plays a crucial role in sediment resuspension and transportation in many shallow lakes. This study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension in regions with and without intense wind waves in Lake Taihu. Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS) were used to measure field data sets including flow velocities and intense wind waves respectively. The results showed that the intermittent bursting events contributed significantly to the processes of momentum and sediment exchanges. Turbulent bursting effectively controlled the three patterns of sediment suspension during the 512 s observation period. In the windy region, the bursting motions, i.e. "ejection" and "sweep" events mainly accounted for the Reynolds stress generation and made major contribution to sediment resuspension. While in the current-dominant region, turbulent mixing from inward and outward interactions overwhelmed other processes. The vertical sediment fluxes reduced by an order of magnitude due to the less effect of wind waves and the lack of upwelling currents. It is therefore important to study turbulent coherent structures and sediment resuspension to understand the spatio-temporal and frequency characteristics of bursting events.

AB We estimate local and regional Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution parameters for flood frequency analysis in a multilevel, hierarchical Bayesian framework, to explicitly model and reduce uncertainties. As prior information for the model, we assume that the GEV location and scale parameters for each site come from independent log-normal distributions, whose mean parameter scales with the drainage area. From empirical and theoretical arguments, the shape parameter for each site is shrunk towards a common mean. Non-informative prior distributions are assumed for the hyperparameters and the MCMC method is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution. The model is tested using annual maximum series from 20 streamflow gauges located in an 83,000 km(2) flood prone basin in Southeast Brazil. The results show a significant reduction of uncertainty estimates of flood quantile estimates over the traditional GEV model, particularly for sites with shorter records. For return periods within the range of the data (around 50 years), the Bayesian credible intervals for the flood quantiles tend to be narrower than the classical confidence limits based on the delta method. As the return period increases beyond the range of the data, the confidence limits from the delta method become unreliable and the Bayesian credible intervals provide a way to estimate satisfactory confidence bands for the flood quantiles considering parameter uncertainties and regional information. In order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for regional flood frequency analysis, we estimate flood quantiles for three randomly chosen out-of-sample sites and compare with classical estimates using the index flood method. The posterior distributions of the scaling law coefficients are used to define the predictive distributions of the GEV location and scale parameters for the out-of-sample sites given only their drainage areas and the posterior distribution of the average shape parameter is taken as the regional predictive distribution for this parameter. While the index flood method does not provide a straightforward way to consider the uncertainties in the index flood and in the regional parameters, the results obtained here show that the proposed Bayesian method is able to produce adequate credible intervals for flood quantiles that are in accordance with empirical estimates.

AB Canadian Shield catchments are under increasing pressure from various types of development (e.g., mining and increased cottagers) and changing climate. Within the southern part of the Canadian Shield, catchments are generally characterized by shallow forested soils with high infiltration rates and low bedrock infiltration, generating little overland flow, and macropore and subsurface flow are important streamflow generation processes. Large numbers of wetlands and lakes are also key physiographic features, and snow-processes are critical to catchment modeling in this climate. We have revised the existing, publicly available SWAT (version 2009.10.1 Beta 3) to create SWAT-CS, a version representing hydrological processes dominating Canadian Shield catchments, where forest extends over Precambrian Shield bedrock. Prior to this study, very few studies applying SWAT to Canadian Shield catchments exist (we have found three). We tested SWAT-CS using the Harp Lake catchment dataset, an Ontario Ministry of Environment research station located in south-central Ontario. Simulations were evaluated against 30 years of observational data, including streamflow from six headwater sub-catchments (0.11.9 km(2)), outflow from Harp Lake (5.4 km(2)) and five years of weekly snow water equivalent (SWE). The best Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) results for daily streamflow calibration, daily streamflow validation, and SWE were 0.60, 0.65, and 0.87, respectively, for sub-catchment HP4 (with detailed land use and soil data). For this range of catchment scales, land cover and soil properties were found to be transferable across sub-catchments with similar physiographic features, namely streamflow from the remaining five sub-catchments could be modeled well using sub-catchment HP4 parameterization. The Harp Lake outflow was well modeled using the existing reservoir-based target release method, generating NSEs of 0.72 and 0.67 for calibration and verification periods respectively. With significant changes to the infiltration module (introducing macropore flow and reduced bedrock percolation), more than 90% of interflow was generated close to the soil-bedrock interface and the contribution of groundwater flow to total runoff was reduced to small amounts, consistent with hydrological process understanding in this terrain. These two changes also allowed for a positive linear relationship between NSE of SWE and Q whereas prior to these changes there was a negative relationship. With these key revisions to the infiltration and bedrock percolations modules, it is concluded that SWAT-CS can reasonably capture key hydrological processes within Canadian Shield catchments. Further testing will examine water quality modeling and larger-scale applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis deals with the scaling properties of infinite topologically random channel networks (ITRNs) first introduced by Shreve (1967, J. Geol., 75: 179-186) to model the branching structure of rivers as a random process. The expected configuration of ITRNs displays scaling behaviour only asymptotically, when the ruler (or 'yardstick') length is reduced to a very small extent. The random model can also reproduce scaling behaviour at larger ruler lengths if network magnitude and diameter are functionally related according to a reported deterministic rule. This indicates that subsets of ITRNs can be scaling and, although ITRNs are asymptotically plane-filling due to the law of large numbers, scaling ITRNs can also display fractional dimension.

AB The stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in shallow groundwater reflect the long-term amount-weighted mean isotopic composition of precipitation. Here, we report the isotopic composition of more than 1000 shallow groundwater samples (age < similar to 5,000 yr) across continental Brazil. Recent studies of global precipitation have shown a strong negative correlation between the isotopic compositions (e.g., delta O-18 values) and stratiform fractions of Brazilian precipitation, with geospatial correspondence to the South Atlantic convergence zone pattern. This isotope-precipitation type geospatial correlation is also reflected in the isotopic compositions of shallow groundwaters, and speleothem records from the region show small variations in delta O-18 values, implying general climatic stability in this region during the past few millennia. We propose that shallow groundwater isotopic compositions reflect bulk proportions of convective and stratiform fractions in precipitation and could thus be useful in conjunction with groundwater dating as proxy archives to characterize past changes in the proportions of convective and stratiform precipitation in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This groundwater isotope-precipitation type relationship could also have broader implications when considered for paleoclimatic interpretation of oxygen isotope records in dated speleothems from other locations.

AB Strips of dense and stiff grass are commonly used to reduce sediment delivery to aquatic systems. Grass strips cause changes in resistance to the flow, which can lead to a reduction in transport capacity and an increase in sediment deposition. Experiments were carried out in controlled conditions and the profile of water surface was recorded upstream and within narrow and stiff hedges for different slope length and steepness, and for different flow rates. The results showed that water surface profiles in stiff hedges no longer follow the classic M-2 profile and the friction slope can be quite high within the narrow hedges. A model is developed to simulate the water profile upstream and within grass strips. Simulated water surface profiles compare well with observations, and this study re-confirms the non-linear relationship between the Manning's n and Froude number in densely vegetated areas. As water approaches the downstream end of stiff hedges, the reduction in water depth leads to flow acceleration, and an increase in friction slope and stream power, and as a consequence net deposition of sediment is unlikely to occur.

AB The continuing and increased use of renewable energy sources, including hydropower, is a key strategy to limit the extent of future climate change. Paradoxically, climate change itself may alter the availability of this natural resource, adversely affecting the financial viability of both existing and potential schemes. Here. a model is described that enables the assessment of the relationship between changes in climate and the viability, technical and financial, of hydro development. The planned Batoka Gorge scheme on the Zambezi River is used as a case study to validate the model and to predict the impact of climate change on river flows, electricity production and scheme financial performance. The model was found to perform well, given the inherent difficulties in the task, although there is concern regarding the ability of the hydrological model to reproduce the historic flow conditions of the upper Zambezi Basin. Simulations with climate change scenarios illustrate the sensitivity of the Batoka Gorge scheme to changes in climate. They suggest significant reductions in river flows, declining power production. reductions in electricity sales revenue and consequently an adverse impact on a range of investment measures.

AB Interception of rainfall by urban trees can be an important component of urban landscapes. This work evaluated rainfall interception and distribution patterns of gross precipitation around the canopy of a single evergreen tree Ficus benjamina (L.). Nineteen individual storms occurring from July to October, 2005, were analyzed. Total precipitation for the studied period was 152 mm representing 46% of the annual precipitation. Rainfall was partitioned as follows: 38.1% throughfall, 2.4% stemflow, and 59.5% interception by the tree canopy. Canopy saturation was estimated at 1.5 mm using a linear relationship between throughfall and stemflow. Average time for saturation of canopy was 19.5 min. The screen effect was important and accounted for 18.7% of the interception losses by the tree canopy alone. A kriging model was used to explore spatial distribution patterns of rainfall and the screen effect around the projected crown. The results indicated that the tree modifies the precipitation pattern around the tree and suggested that these patterns were similar among events. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Following primary production of hydrocarbon from naturally fractured reservoirs, secondary recovery by waterflooding relies on Spontaneous Imbibition (SI) as the primary mechanism for oil expulsion to the fracture network, where it can be easily transported to neighboring production wells. Thus, a more complete under-standing of this phenomenon is warranted and essential for process improvement. The imbibition process, taking advantage of inherent preferential affinity for water contact over oil of high energy solids, is the rate determining step in recovery and can proceed in either co-current or counter-current fashion, depending upon entrance and exit boundary conditions. Due to the prominence of linear flow normal to extensive planar fracture faces, the phenomena can be largely described as one-dimensional displacement. In this study, the nonlinear one-dimensional diffusivity equation, derived by combining Darcy's law for both wetting and non-wetting phases with the mass conservation equation, is solved for counter-current spontaneous imbibition using a direct regular perturbation scheme. Saturation and phase pressure profiles in time and space were found to agree with liter-ature solutions. In its analytic formulation, the method constitutes a simpler, more accurate, and more direct way to compute spontaneous imbibition performance than previously available. We claim generality with regard to functional forms for relative permeability and capillary pressure and applicability over the entire range of wettability, provided these effects are reflected in the parameterization of capillary pressure and saturation normalization. In particular, the present method avoids the difficulty in solving nonlinear integral equations. Instead, we reduce computations to a set of simple numerical integrations of the diffusion coefficient. Such a streamlined solution method can more easily provide a compute engine for inverse modeling or optimization schemes to recovery rock and fluid properties from displacement experiments. The solution method is bench-marked against oil-water and air-water solutions by alternative techniques and experimental data. The case of spontaneous imbibition into dry diatomite represents extreme contrast in phase mobility and a rigorous test of the perturbation method as an easier and more direct way to model 1D SI. Following method construction and benchmarking of the new streamlined countercurrent spontaneous imbibition solution method, a subsequent parametric study contributes to a greater understanding of controlling factors in fracture-matrix exchange in porous media.

AB Rainfall event simulation can be very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices such as darn design. The aim of this study is to propose a new single-site stochastic model for generating daily rainfall events. The model has two components: Copula-based joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and rainfall temporal pattern simulation. Compared with prevailing stochastic rainfall models, this new model can not only preserve the dependence relationship between rainfall duration and rainfall depth by using Copula functions, but also take different temporal rainfall patterns that can cause various hydrological responses of watersheds into consideration. Additionally, the internal clustering validation index is introduced in this study to objectively determine the number of representative rainfall patterns in this model. Lastly, a framework is designed to apply the developed stochastic model to 39 gauged meteorological stations in Zhejiang Province, East China and to extend its application to one ungauged site for validation. The final validation results were sound and indicated that the developed stochastic model is robust and can be applied at both gauged stations and ungauged sites for generating long rainfall records.

TI DETERMINING THE ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF SEDIMENTATION IN AN UNDERGROUND
   RIVER SYSTEM USING NATURAL AND FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural and anthropogenic radionuclides were used to characterize the source of sediment reaching the underground river in the karst system at Jenolan, New South Wales, Australia. It was found that the relationship between Ra-226 and Th-232 concentrations, in both spatially averaged soil samples and transpored sediments, distinguished between two of the most likely source subcatchments. Sedimentary sequences, collected from within the underground system, showed that contemporary deposition was made up of an equal mixture of sediment from these two sources. However, at least three earlier deposition periods were also identifiable, each with different relative contributions from the source catchments. The first appearance of Cs-137 in the sedimentary sequence and correlations with historical information provided a chronology for these changes, and it is concluded that the contemporary phase was initiated in the early 1950s, most probably by forestry activities. This work demonstrates that natural radioactivity can be used as a tracer of the origins of sediment, providing an important new approach to problems in sediment supply, transport, and deposition.

DE Sediment transport; Vegetation; Grain shear stress
ID INCIPIENT SEDIMENT MOTION; RESISTANCE; ROUGHNESS; FORMULA
AB The prediction of bedload transport capacity in riverbed with aquatic vegetation is a pressing need for river restoration. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the weak bed-load transport rates with emergent vegetation for different energy slopes and vegetation densities. Such rate was observed to increase as the energy slope increased and the vegetation density decreased. The bed shear stress calculated by subtracting the vegetation drag from the total flow driving force was unable to predict the measured bed-load transport rate. On the other side, the estimation of the grain shear stress using the Einstein partitioning method considering the form drag provided a reasonable prediction. On the basis of these results, an explicit formulation for estimating grain shear stress was developed to predict the bed-load transport rate in a vegetated channel by considering the superimposition of forces. In addition, a simple relationship between grain shear stress and total shear stress was established by the boundary layer model. It was inferred that bed-load transport rate decreases with the increase of vegetation blocking factor while the total shear stress remains constant. Comparatively, the proposed models were more accurate than literature models, improving the understanding of the bed-load transport in a vegetated flow.

AB Post-processing outputs from Coupled Global Circulation Models (CGCM) is required to generate skillful and reliable sub-seasonal precipitation forecasts. However, it is not currently known at what spatiotemporal scale can sub-seasonal precipitation forecasts be improved after post-processing. In this study, a Bayesian joint probability (BJP) method is used to post-process European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) sub-seasonal precipitation forecasts at various spatiotemporal scales across China during the boreal summer monsoon. The relationships between forecasts and observations are built at daily, weekly, and fortnight temporal scales for each grid cell and each hydroclimatic region after normalization. The results suggest that the skills and reliability of ECMWF raw daily precipitation forecasts are improved after post-processing. The forecast skills are further improved at larger spatial scales or longer temporal scales, especially in the Upper and Middle Yangtze River, Southeast Rivers, and Pearl River. Although the forecast skills decrease rapidly as lead time increases, the uncertainty spread of the BJP calibrated sub-seasonal precipitation forecasts is highly reliable at all lead times and spatiotemporal scales. This work will help to realize the potential of CGCM forecasts at sub-seasonal time scales. Future works will investigate the benefits of post-processing precipitation forecasts for sub-seasonal streamflow predictions.

AB Ageing water infrastructure and population growth, issues that are characteristic of megacities, are likely to exacerbate water supply deficits in London. To address this threat, wastewater reclamation and non potable reuse can potentially close the supply-demand gap without impacting on environmental water bodies. There is a need to understand the types of challenges that diverse stakeholders face in relation to the governance of NPR schemes, and how those challenges might be addressed in a megacity context. A case study is used to explore these challenges for an operational sewer mining scheme in London, where reclaimed non-potable water is used for irrigation and toilet flushing at the site of the London 2012 Olympic Park. Through qualitative analysis of interview and document data, the results highlight that collaboration and learning opportunities are perceived as necessary to improve scheme governance. The findings indicate that formal and informal engagement activities centred on risk management can support the development of common understandings, build important inter-stakeholder relationships and help maintain trust. Non-potable reuse can contribute to the resilience of megacities through infrastructure diversification, but its feasibility will depend on the willingness of stakeholders to participate and continually negotiate new risk management practices.

AB The Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations is often used for flood routing, but the corresponding analytic solutions usually neglect the downstream boundary conditions. This is an issue because the presence of hydraulic structures at the end of a river reach, or natural morphologic conditions, may influence the wave propagation. In order to take into account realistic boundary conditions, namely a stage-hydrograph upstream and a stage-discharge relationship downstream, a new set of exact solutions of the Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations with uniformly distributed lateral inflows is presented. This exact solution is demonstrated by using it as a building block in a simplified flood routing model, whose numerical results are compared with those supplied by laboratory experiments from literature. Finally, the new solutions are used to analyze the range of validity of semi-infinite channel models. The comparison shows that semi infinite channel models are accurate when convective effects are prevailing on diffusive effects, and the downstream boundary condition corresponds to uniform flow conditions. In addition, the results show that semi infinite channel models based on the knowledge of the upstream stage-hydrograph can predict flow depths better than those making use of a flow hydrograph, while being practically equivalent in predicting flow rates.

AB A tree-ring delta O-18 chronology for the period 1828-2000 was developed from four Pinus merkusii trees, to find a reliable proxy for reconstructing precipitation in northwest Thailand. Inter-tree delta O-18 correlations were high during the entire period (r = 0.57-0.79). The tree-ring delta O-18 chronology shows significant negative correlations with regional July-October precipitation during the period 1901-2000 (r = -0.62) and with July-October river flow (r = -0.54), and is in good agreement with a shorter tree-ring delta O-18 chronology from living Pinus kesiya in northwest Thailand. The spatial correlation analysis between tree-ring delta O-18 and regional July-October precipitation also support that the tree-ring delta O-18 of P. merkusii is a promising proxy to reconstruct precipitation in northwest Thailand. The tree-ring delta O-18-based July-October reconstruction, which accounts for 37.6% of the precipitation variance, shows a close relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the period 1871-2000, with the exception of during the past two decades; the exception may be related to the southeastward shift of the descending limb of Walker circulation and increased frequency of central Pacific ENSO.

TI A new regionalization approach and its application to predict flow
   duration curve in ungauged basins
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Regionalization; Index model; Flow duration curve
ID AIR-POLLUTION; CATCHMENTS; REGRESSION
AB Prediction in ungauged basins is an important task for water resources planning and management and remains a fundamental challenge for the hydrological community. Regionalization is typically used to estimate parameter values of hydrological predictive tools for catchments without observed streamflow. This study proposes a new regionalization method, called the index model. The index model establishes a nonparametric relationship between each parameter of predictive tools and a linear combination of predicators. This method is able to describe a wide range of functions, linear or nonlinear, and avoids the potential misspecification which usually occurs as a result of using the ordinary linear regression. We illustrate the method by predicting flow duration curves at 227 unimpaired catchments in southeast Australia. This study also compares results from regional models based on the linear regression, nearest neighbour and hydrological similarity. The results show that the index model produces the most accurate prediction with highest coefficients of efficiency, followed by the linear regression. In particular, the index model improves the model performance substantially at catchments where the linear regression is a fair to poor fit. The index model was also interpretable and showed that potential evapotranspiration and summary statistics of rainfall are predominant in prediction.

AB The conventional geo-accumulation index (GI) cannot deal with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of pollutants or conduct a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments. To solve these problems, a geo-accumulation vector (GV) model is designed based on uncertainty analysis theory. GV uses the probability vector to quantify the possibility for the pollution condition of a heavy metal to belong to a certain grade and then uses the first-order moment principle to determine its category. The GV model is applied in this study to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of Western Dongting Lake. The results show that (i) compared with the conventional GI model, the GV model has better capacity in evaluating synthetic pollution and in dealing with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of sediments; (ii) the sediments of Li River estuary, Yuan River estuary, Songzi River estuary, and the central part of Western Dongting Lake are "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately contaminated," and "uncontaminated to moderately contaminated" by heavy metals, respectively. These sediments also have 0.19, 0.36, 0.48, and 0.15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category, respectively; and (iii) all deterioration risks are introduced by cadmium.

AB Our understanding of braided river morphodynamics has improved significantly in recent years, however, there are still large knowledge gaps relating to both long-term and event-based change in braided river morphologies. Furthermore, we still lack methods that can take full advantage of the increasing availability of remotely sensed datasets that are well suited to braided river research. Network analysis based on graph theory, the mathematics of networks, offers a largely unexplored toolbox that can be applied to remotely sensed data to quantify the structure and function of braided rivers across nearly the full range of spatiotemporal scales relevant to braided river evolution. In this article, important commonalities between braided rivers and other types of complex network are described, providing a compelling argument for the wider uptake of complex network analysis methods in the study of braided rivers. We provide an overview of the extraction of graph representations of braided river networks from remotely sensed data and detail a suite of metrics for quantitative analysis of these networks. Application of these metrics as new tools for multiscale characterization of braided river planforms that improve upon traditional, spatially averaged approaches is discussed and potential approaches to network-based analysis of braided river dynamics are proposed, drawing on a range of different concepts from braided river research and other network sciences. Finally, the potential for using graph theory metrics to validate numerical models of braided rivers is discussed. This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Methods

AB Many field indicators have been used to approximate the magnitude and frequency of flows in a variety of streams and rivers, yet due to a scarcity of long-term flow records in tropical mountain streams, little to no work has been done to establish such relationships between field features and the flow regime in these environments Furthermore, the transition between the active channel of a river and the adjacent flood zone (i.e bankfull) is an important geomorphologic and ecological boundary, but is rarely identifiable in steep Mountain channels that lack alluvial flood plains This study (a) quantifies relationships between field indicators and flow frequency in alluvial and steepland channels in a tropical Mountain stream network and (b) identifies a reference active channel boundary in these channels, based oil statistically defined combinations of riparian features. that corresponds to the same flow frequency of the bankfull stage and the effective discharge in adjacent alluvial channels The relative elevation of transitions in riparian vegetation, soil, and Substrate characteristics were first surveyed at nine stream gages in and around the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Northeastern Puerto Rico. The corresponding discharge. flow frequency, and recurrence intervals associated with these features was then determined from long-term 15-min discharge records and a partial duration series analysis Survey data indicate that mosses and short grasses dominate at a stage often Inundated by sub-effective flows Herbaceous vegetation is associated with intermediate discharges that correspond to the threshold for sediment mobilization Near-channel woody shrubs and trees establish at elevations along the channel margin mundated by a less frequent discharge that is coincident with the effective discharge of bed load sediment transport Our data demonstrate that in alluvial channels in the study, both the bankfull stage (as marked by a flood plain) and the channel-forming (effective) discharge are associated with the presence of fine-grained Substrate and soil, and tall, mature woody vegetation In montane reaches that lack a flood plain, a boundary that is characterized by the incipient presence of soil, woody shrubs, and trees corresponds to the same flow frequency as the bankfull discharge of nearby alluvial channels The reference discharge based on these riparian features in steepland sites has an average exceedance probability between 0 09% and 0 30%, and a recurrence interval between 40 and 90 days. We conclude that flows with similar frequencies Influence the establishment of riparian vegetation, soil development, and substrate characteristics along channel margins in similar ways Thus, these riparian features can be used as an indicator of hydrogeomorphic site conditions to identify active channel boundaries that occur at a constant flow frequency throughout the Study stream network (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB A Jarvis based [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 273 (1976) 593] model of canopy stomata] conductance was evaluated in context of its application to simulating transpiration in a conifer forest covered watershed in the Central Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Parameters influencing stomatal conductance were assigned values using Monte Carlo sampling. Model calibration was conducted by evaluating predicted latent heat fluxes against thermal remote sensing estimates of surface temperature. A fuzzy logic approach was used to select or reject simulations and form a restricted set of ensemble parameter solutions. Parameter estimates derived from the ensembles were evaluated using theory on how stomatal conductance regulates leaf water potential to prevent runaway cavitation. Canopy level parameters were found to be sufficient for predicting hydraulically consistent transpiration when soils were well watered. A rooting length parameter controlling the amount of plant available water was a sufficient addition to the parameter set to predict hydraulically consistent transpiration when soil moisture stress was occurring. Variations in maximum stomatal conductance among different hillslopes within the watershed were explained by a light threshold parameter. The results demonstrate that the Jarvis model can be reliably parameterized using thermal remote sensing data for estimating transpiration in meso-scale watersheds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife recently established statewide guidelines for incorporating adult fish migration into culvert design. One of the design options requires an estimate of fish passage design flow for ungaged culvert sites. A new model is presented for estimating fish passage design flows at ungaged sites in Eastern Washington. The model is founded on a unique definition of fish passage design flow and an area-based approach for estimating this flow at ungaged sites.
   The fish passage design flow was developed by combining the concepts of allowable fish delay, established by fisheries experts to be three days, with a consecutive day analysis. This design flow ensures that fish are not delayed for more than three consecutive days during a water year.
   A fish passage design flow per unit area is assigned to previously delineated subwatersheds in Eastern Washington using similarity relationships derived from basin parameters and US Geological Survey gaging stations. The percent standard error for this model is 36%, a significant improvement from the 75% standard error calculated for the model previously developed for fish passage design flows in Eastern Washington.

AB Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) modeling allows for multiple sources of uncertainty by factoring complex relationships into conditional distributions that can be used to draw Inference and make predictions We applied an HB model to estimate the parameters and state variables of a parsimonious hydrological model - GR4J - by coherently assimilating the uncertainties from the model observations and parameters at Coweeta Basin in western North Carolina A state-space model was within the Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate the daily soil moisture levels and their uncertainties
   Results show that the posteriors of the parameters were updated from and relatively insensitive to priors an indication that they were dominated by the data The uncertainties of the simulated streamflow increased with streamflow Increase By assimilating soil moisture data the model could estimate the maximum capacity of soil moisture accounting storage and predict storm events with higher precision compared to not assimilating soil moisture data This study has shown that hierarchical Bayesian model is a useful tool in water resource planning and management by acknowledging stochasticity (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB ; Under the assumption that hydrograph generation was affected by n linear reservoirs with the same value of storage coefficient k, Nash proposed the formulation of the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH), which has been widely used in rainfall-runoff simulation and flood forecasting. However, the assumption of the parameter k having the Same Value in all reservoirs is obviously unphysical as it results in the estimated value of not being integral. In this study, for parameter n integral, the different k value for each reservoir was derived using the Laplace transform and developing a general rule for thee equation of the IUH of any order. The relationship between parameter k and the slope of the river channel estimated using digital elevation model (DEM) data is established. the parameter estimation procedures are given. As in most unit hydrograph studies, only isolated storm events are considered here. Seventeen flood events in three catchments were selected for the case studies. Application results show that the proposed method is slightly better than Nash's IUH with higher model efficiency and smaller absolute relative errors. This work provides a new methodology for the formulation Of file IUH Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley Sons. Ltd.

AB Previous research has found that irrigation water demand is relatively insensitive to water price, suggesting that increased pumping costs due to declining groundwater levels will have limited effects on agricultural water management practices. However, non-linear changes in well yields as aquifer saturated thickness is reduced may have large impacts on irrigated production that are currently neglected in projections of the long-term sustainability of groundwater-fed irrigation. We conduct empirical analysis of observation data and numerical simulations for case studies in Nebraska, USA, to compare the impacts of changes in well yield and groundwater depth on agricultural production. Our findings suggest that declining well pumping capacities reduce irrigated production areas and profits significantly, whereas increased pumping costs reduce profits but have minimal impacts on the intensity of groundwater-fed irrigation. We suggest, therefore, that management of the dynamic relationship between well yield and saturated thickness should be a core component of policies designed to enhance long-term food security and support adaptation to climate change.

AB This paper describes the development and application of a procedure that identifies trends in hydrologic variables. The procedure utilizes the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test to detect trends, a permutation approach to estimate the test distribution, and accounts for the correlation structure in the data in determining the significance level of the test results. The research investigates 18 hydrologic variables that reflect different parts of the hydrologic cycle. The hydrologic variables are analyzed for a network of 248 Canadian catchments that are considered to reflect natural conditions. A selection of catchments identified to have trends in hydrologic variables is studied further to investigate the presence of trends in meteorological variables and the relationship between the hydrologic and the meteorological response to climatic change. It is concluded that a greater number of trends are observed than are expected to occur by chance. There are differences in the geographic location of significant trends in the hydrologic variables investigated implying that impacts are trot spatially uniform. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Empirical relationships between daily hydrometeorological variables for a catchment in Nagano prefecture, Japan and three indices of regional atmospheric circulation are examined with a view to assessing their use in General Circulation Model (GCM) downscaling. The indices (vorticity, flow strength and angular direction of airflow) were calculated by using daily grid-point sea-level pressure data derived from: (a) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, NCEP Re-analysis data set (1979-1995); and (b) the UK Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere model (HadCM2SUL) for two periods indicative of present (1980-1999) and future greenhouse gas plus sulfate aerosol forcing (2080-2099). Statistical models of the surface variables were then "forced" by using the three airflow indices obtained from HadCM2SUL. The differences between the NCEP and HadCM2SUL "present" downscaled variables were generally greater than those arising between the downscaling of the two GCM airflow scenarios. The lack of change in downscaled surface variables between the 1980-1999 and 2080-2099 data was attributed to the low sensitivity of atmospheric circulation patterns in HadCM2SUL to greenhouse gas forcing.

AB Accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources. However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China's Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world's largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.

AB Precipitation types (rain, snow, and sleet) have great impacts on the surface runoff and energy balance. However, many weather stations only record precipitation amount without discriminating its type. Based on CMA (China Meteorological Administration) station data over 30 years, this study investigates the relationship of precipitation types with surface elevation and meteorological variables. Major findings are (1) wet-bulb temperature is a better indicator than air temperature for discriminating precipitation types; (2) precipitation types are highly dependent on surface elevation, and a higher threshold temperature is needed for differentiating snow and rain over a higher-elevation region; and (3) precipitation types are also dependent on relative humidity, and the probability of sleet event rises greatly with the increase of relative humidity. Based on these findings, a new parameterization scheme is developed to determine the precipitation type, with input of daily mean wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and surface elevation. Evaluations for China territory show that the new scheme gives better accuracy than 11 other schemes that are used in hydrological and land surface models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several statistical methods, particularly the Indicator of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), have been successfully employed to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration. This study proposed a new approach, the cloud model combined with the multiple weighting method (CM-MW), for better quantification of the overall degree of hydrologic alteration. This approach adopts game theory to select reasonable weights for the IHA parameters, therefore improving the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation. By estimating the similarity between the evaluation cloud and the category cloud, this method quantifies the percent data for which the overall degree of hydrological alteration (ODHA) would fall into the respective category. Analysis based on the Budyko framework indicated that in the Illinois River Basin, the dominant causes of hydrologic alteration for watersheds with moderate ODHA and low ODHA were human activities and climate change. The proposed method had a distinct advantage over the conventional approach in classifying the overall hydrological alteration, which would provide more accurate information for comprehensive and adaptive river basin management.

AB Growing inorganic and expansive hydrochemical datasets and large differences in the measured concentrations require methods that are capable of compressing data without the loss of critical information and subsequently displaying it in a condensed and comprehensive way. Here we train an artificial neural network, Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM), to model inorganic hydrochemical clusters and associate the salinity source with the distribution of the ionic concentration spatial variation at a former potash mining site. Kohonen's self-organizing maps are applied to project the data onto a two-dimensional grid and the geometric relationship of the projected vectors is subsequently used to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis. The SOM clustering approach succeeded in assigning the groundwater samples automatically according to their inorganic chemical composition. Five different clusters, three geogenic and two anthropogenic, were identified. The final outcome is displayed and compared with the classification from Piper plotting of the same dataset. In order to see the SOM clustering results in the large scale hydrogeological context, the distribution of the clusters is displayed spatially. This approach is a tool for the hydrogeologist to quickly analyze large datasets and present them in a clear and concise format.

AB Mediterranean rivers are characterized by frequent hydrological disturbances, including floods, droughts, and human impacts like water abstraction. During 2008 an exceptionally long drought in NE Spain was irregularly interrupted by rainfall events. We analyzed the relationships between the biological community structure with the ongoing and preceding hydrological patterns during the drought and recovery periods. We aimed: (1) to assess the role of hydrology on different biological assemblages (diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish), (2) to determine which measures of community structure could be better related to hydrology, and (3) to determine the effects of water abstraction on river communities. Three subsets of variables (hydrological, spatial and environmental) were selected to determine the relative importance of hydrological alterations. Variation partitioning analysis and ordination methods were used to determine which subset of variables had higher effects on 20 parameters and six matrices (taxonomic and functional) of the biological communities. The analyses revealed that both parameters and matrices were significantly related to hydrological effects. Reservoirs intensified the effect of drought on downstream community composition and structure, as a result of the competition between human uses of water and environmental values.

AB Annual forest evapotranspiration (ET) is highly variable among various sites. Zhang's model (Zhang et al., 2001) has been widely used for predicting the spatial variation in ET. The forest component of the model employs limiting theory and assumes constant annual potential evaporation (E-0 = 1410 mm) by regressing data recorded at 56 forest sites. However, most of the data used in determining E-0 were recorded for limited regions (Australia, African countries, and the United States). We summarized 829 forest ET data items obtained for sites around the world from earlier publications. Using the dataset, we showed that Zhang's model overestimates forest ET in temperate and boreal regions with low annual mean temperature (T) owing to the E-0 value. We revised the E-0 term of Zhang's model so as to consider the dependency of E-0 on T using the dataset. The revised model did not overestimate forest ET in temperate and boreal regions. Consequently, we recommend revising the E-0 term of Zhang's model when predicting forest ET in these regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ENTROPY; UNCERTAINTY; HYDROLOGY
AB In recent years, climate change impacts on water resources sectors have been extensively documented. Anticipated changes range from more severe storms to more frequent floods and drought at regional scale. Pressure on water resources and hence on the environment will probably increase with the need of quality data for sustainable design of water resources projects. Therefore, for an optimal network design, hydrometric networks are to be reviewed periodically based on the information needs of the various end users and the perspective for future water resources development. This paper evaluates hydrometric networks to identify essential streamflow stations and critical areas (highly poor network density) within major watersheds across the different provinces of Canada using entropy theory. The method is applied to daily streamflow, data and information coefficients such as marginal entropy, joint entropy and trans information index are used for the identification of important stations as well as critical areas in the basin. The analysis results show that almost all Canadian main watersheds contain deficient hydrometric networks. The most deficient streamflow networks are identified in Alberta (North Saskatchewan, Oldman, and Red Deer basins), Northern Ontario (Hudson Bay basin), and the Northwest Territories. The information might prove to be helpful for decision makers to undertake cost-benefit analyses for hydrometric network updating in each region. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the spatial distribution of measured soil moisture was analyzed on the platform of multivariate modeling. Soil moisture time series for two seasons were selected and used for analysis to reveal similarities and differences in soil moisture responses for a few rainfall events. The development of a soil moisture transport process that considers the representative element volume and uncertainty of soil media provides the hydrological basis for time series modeling. The systematic procedure of Box-Jenkins with noise modeling was used to delineate the final models for all monitoring points. The physical basis of mass balance and the continuity in inflow contribution, as well as statistical criteria, were used in the model selection procedure. Heuristic approaches provide the spatial distribution of selected models along the transect of a hillside. Comparative analysis for two different depths and seasons provide an understanding of the variation in soil moisture transfer processes at the hillslope scale. Differences in soil moisture models for both depths and seasons are associated with eco-hydrological processes. The relationships between distributed topographic features and modeling results were explored to configure dominant hydrological processes for each season. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN; TIME; FLOW; MODEL
AB We have presented analytical solutions for the capture zones of infinitely long horizontal wells in a homogeneous, confined aquifer with uniform flow. We find that the capture width enlarges and the bisector line of the capture zone moves toward the centerline of the aquifer when moving away from the well in the upstream direction for an arbitrary well location. The capture width and bisector line approach their ultimate width and position, respectively, after a distance of about 1.5 times the aquifer thickness. The ultimate capture width depends on the well discharge but not on the well location. We have plotted the ultimate bisector line position versus discharge for different well locations. Compared to the capture zone of a fully penetrating vertical well in an isotropic and laterally infinite aquifer, the ultimate capture width of a horizontal well is smaller than that of a vertical well given the same discharge rate per unit length. Furthermore, the relationship between the ultimate capture width and the well discharge rate is non-linear, in contrast to the linear behavior often observed in the vertical well capture zone.

AB The Yellow River subaqueous delta (YRSD), once the most rapid depo-center among river deltas worldwide, has been under the risks of subsidence and degradation due to the new regime of riverine delivery affected by human interventions. Utilizing hydrologic and bathymetric surveying datasets, we examined the latest regime of river input from the perspective of water-sediment relationship, and the responding morphological evolutionary processes of active YRSD over a period of 20 years between 1996 and 2016. Results show that the new discharge regime is strongly interfered by the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS), characterized by a more drastic decline of sediment load than that of water discharge; more harmonious relationship between water and sediment discharges in the lower reach of the river to the sea; coarser sediment delivery and low suspended sediment concentration (SSC). We identified inverse erosion-accretion trends in the subaqueous region: net accretion of 0.15 m/yr in the active Yellow River mouth (AYRM) and severe erosion of - 0.1 m/yr in the Gudong littoral zone (GDLZ). As the primary sink for sediment delivery, AYRM received approximately 68% of sediment delivery during the study period and sedimentation was mainly occurred in the shallower area where water depth was less than 10 m. In addition, recent morphological evolution of AYRM is found to have undergone through four stages, namely: moderate accretion (1996-2002), rapid accretion (2002-2007), reduced accretion (2007-2015) and rapid erosion (2015-2016). The new regime of riverine delivery presents multiple spatiotemporal scales in shaping deltaic morphology. Compared with the previous research, we present the morphological evolution of deltaic system over decadal timescale is strongly influenced by reduction of sediment supply derived from basin-scale human impacts, and the variability of subaqueous portion during the study period is closely related to inter-annual variability of river input. Besides, the building of AYRM is shaped by event-scale WSRS induced-floodwater, and decade-scale change of sediment pathway governed by frequent mouth channel migration. The results show, for the first time, that AYRM has experienced a significant erosion since the implementation of WSRS, with a decline of 99% sediment delivery in 2016 compared to the natural mode during 1950s. The results also indicate that to maintain the erosion-accretion balance of AYRM, an estimation of 41.4-62.3 Mt/yr sediment delivery should be kept. Due to the fluvial regime change from the natural to the highly human-regulated modes, the AYRM, as well as the whole YRSD, is expected to be transforming from the accretion to erosion states.

TI Does quantifying antecedent flow conditions improve stream phosphorus
   export estimation?

AB A reliable and economical method for the estimation of nutrient export (e.g. phosphorus) in stream flow from catchments is necessary to quantify the impact of land use or land use change upon aquatic systems. The transport of phosphorus (P) from soil to water is known to impact negatively on water quality. A key observation from studies is that most P export occurs during high stream flow. However, it is not yet clear how flood-antecedent conditions affect the P export during flood events. In this study, the P loss from soil to water as represented by soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in stream waters from three different catchments, varying in land use, scale and location in Ireland was monitored over 1 year. This study examined the role of antecedent stream flow conditions on SRP export and identifies a catchment-specific relationship between SRP flood event load (EL) and a flow ratio (FR). The FIR is defined as the ratio of the flood event volume (EV) to the pre-event volume (PEV). The latter is the cumulative flow volume for a number of days preceding the event. This PEV period was found to be longer (average 81 days) in the grassland catchments which were known to be saturated with soil P than in the forested catchments (average 21 days) with minimal soil P. This FR ratio is a measure of the antecedent hydrological state (wet or dry) of the catchment. For SRP for each catchment, a specific relationship between SRP EL and FIR was identified. The annual SRP export was estimated, using this ratio and compared with the concentration/discharge (C/Q) method. The new flow ratio method was used with data from 12 flood events during the year to estimate an annual export of SRP. For the two grassland catchments in the study, using the FIR method, we estimated an SRP export of 1.77 and 0.41 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Using the C/Q method, for the same sites, our estimate of SRP export was 1.70 and 0.50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively. The C/Q method used SRP concentrations covering 40% of the year while the FR method used only 12 flood events covering less than 2% of the year. This new method which takes account of the antecedent flow state of the river is an alternative to and may be more promising than the traditional C/Q method, particularly when short duration or flood sampling of water quality is carried out.

TI Assessing the use of standardized groundwater index for quantifying

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID PRECIPITATION INDEX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; AQUIFER; LEVEL
AB Groundwater drought is a drought phenomenon caused by the decrease in groundwater level or groundwater storage under natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., climate variability/change and groundwater abstraction). Due to the complexity of groundwater flow systems and the difficulty in obtaining direct observational data related to groundwater resources, it remains challenging to characterize groundwater drought quantitatively. To this end, standardized groundwater level index (SGI), which was modified from the standardized precipitation index (SPI), was used to quantify groundwater drought with the long-term groundwater level data (1981-2010) obtained from the Climate Response Network wells across the conterminous United States. The best fitting function of groundwater level distributions was lognormal which was selected from various distribution functions based on the Anderson-Darling (AD) test among 100 wells. Four monitoring wells located in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were selected as the main research objects. The trend of change in groundwater level was divided into two categories: the wells in Georgia and Oklahoma showed an initial decrease followed by an increase while the wells in Massachusetts and Washington showed a continuous decline. Groundwater drought varied significantly in different areas due to the complexity of geographical location, agricultural irrigation, population and other natural environment and human activities. Start and end time of drought conditions and the severity of drought and flooding at different time scales in the same area also varied, therefore it is necessary to describe different groundwater droughts at a reasonable time scale. In this paper, the difference between SGI and SPI at different time scales was so obvious that the cross-correlation analysis was used to find the law of lag time. The cross-correlation coefficients increased with the increasing time scales, and the average correlation values between SPI and SGI of wells in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were -0.568, -0.634, -0.667 and 0.496, respectively. With the time scale increased, the lag time in Georgia and Oklahoma also increased, but the lag time in Massachusetts and Washington region was almost unchanged, and there was almost no lag time in Massachusetts region. Through the study of the hydrogeological conditions such as vadose zone, lithology, soil and the influence of human activities, the hysteresis effect can be analysed, which can provide a new alternative to the conventional method and important information for future groundwater resource management.

AB Accurate and effective assessment of groundwater vulnerability is very important for ensuring a healthy groundwater ecosystem. We evaluate the vulnerability of shallow porous aquifers by modifying the DRASTIC model and verify the effectiveness of the variable weight model (VWM). Firstly, topography, aquifer media, and the impact of the vadose zone are replaced by land-use type, aquifer thickness, and the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone. Second, the weighting is optimized using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and variable weight theory (VWT). Thirdly, the original and the improved DRASTIC methods were used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability. Finally, three sets of samples hydrochemical parameters ( NO3-, Mg2+,COD) were used to verify the improved frameworks using the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) method. The improved model increases the dispersion degree of groundwater vulnerability. Compared with the original DRASTIC method, the correlation of the VWM is significantly improved in terms of the area under curve (AUC) for NO3- (0.786), COD (0.753), and Mg2+ (0.831). In short, it is necessary to optimize the parameters and weights of the model in order to realize reliable estimations of groundwater vulnerability. In particular, the use of VWM brings the results in line with the actual situation by changing the weights.

AB An alternative linearization of the nonlinear kinematic condition at the water table used in unconfined aquifer flow theory is proposed. It simulates the downward propagation of the water table, during water extraction via a pumping well, as a diffuse process controlled by a dimensionless linearization parameter, beta(D). The limiting value of beta(D) = 0 corresponds to the solution of Neuman (1972) whereas that of beta(D) -> infinity corresponds to the early-time Theis solution. Using the solution obtained with this linearization, data collected during a pumping test conducted at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site in Idaho, US, were analyzed. The estimates of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage obtained in this study compare well with those obtained with the other models. The most significant improvement is in the estimated value of specific yield, with the proposed model yielding values that are close to those expected from known porosity values (n similar to 0.25) at the site. The results show that meaningful estimates of specific yield can be obtained by treating the water table as a diffuse moving material boundary, without recourse to more complex models for water table decline or inclusion of unsaturated zone flow.

AB Concentrated rainfall usually results in serious soil erosion oil steep hillslopes Since the itinerary of the eroded sediment is complicated, estimating watershed erosion during storms IS Practically difficult A physically-based approach for sediment yield estimation during storms was proposed in this Study By using soil and watershed geomorphologic information, analytical Solutions for sediment travel time in different orders of overland areas and channels were derived to develop a geomorphologic instantaneous unit sedimentgraph (GIUS) which showed the temporal distribution of sediment discharge resulting from an instantaneous rainfall excess input The resultant GIUS was a function of the rainfall excess intensity and sediment delivery ratio The linearity restriction of the unit hydrograph theory was relaxed Sediment yields during storm events were calculated by convoluting rainfall intensities with the proposed GIUS, Which had been verified by using data from the Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed in Mississippi. the United States. The simulated and the measured sediment yields were in good agreement for the test Storms Sensitivity of the sedimentgraph to the model parameters was also investigated The proposed model was considered a promising application for sediment yield estimation in the field of water resources design.

AB The log Pearson type 3 distribution is a very important model in statistical hydrology, especially for modeling annual flood series. In this paper we compare the various methods based on moments for estimating quantiles of this distribution. Besides the methods of direct and mixed moments which were found most successful in previous studies and the well-known indirect method of moments, we develop generalized direct moments and generalized mixed moments methods and a new method of adaptive mixed moments. The last method chooses the orders of two moments for the original observations by utilizing information contained in the sample itself. The results of Monte Carlo experiments demonstrated the superiority of this method in estimating flood events of high return periods when a large sample is available and in estimating hood events of low return periods regardless of the sample size. In addition, a comparison of simulation and asymptotic results shows that the adaptive method may be used for the construction of meaningful confidence intervals for design events based on the asymptotic theory even with small samples. The simulation results also point to the specific members of the class of generalized moments estimates which maintain small values for bias and/or mean square error. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Local bridge scour, which is defined as the loss of soil particles/mass surrounding a pier foundation due to the flowing water-induced shear stresses, is a primary cause of bridge failure in the United States and worldwide. Current practice of bridge scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models. Work herein presents statistical models that extend five deterministic approaches reported in literature to predict the expected scour depth while quantifying inherent model bias and uncertainty in view of data scatter. Clear water scour database is used herein and the analyses quantify model scatter by comparatively assessing the computed scour depth versus measured data reported in the database. A relationship between probability of deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth and a modification factor (that is applied into the deterministic prediction) is devised. The modification factor allows for the use of the scour magnitude computed from the deterministic models while quantifying the probability of a computed scour depth being less than or more than a most likely value (per measurements reported in the database). The application of the proposed model is demonstrated with an example and the results are discussed.

ID STREAMFLOW
AB There is convincing evidence that land use/land cover (LULC) change has contributed to increasing discharge in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) but key details remain unresolved. In this study, we extend our previous work (Zhang and Schilling, 2006) to quantify how much of the increasing discharge was due to LULC change. We examined daily streamflow for the 1890-2003 period from the US Geological Survey stream gage at Keokuk, Iowa and compiled county agricultural statistics for soybean production in the watershed above the gage to quantify how much of the change in the relation of discharge to precipitation was due to increased soybean cultivation. By allowing the slope of the discharge precipitation relationship to be a function of the area of the UMRB planted in soybean, we determined that increasing soybean acreage increased the slope of q(t)-P-t by 32%. With row crop expansion anticipated from ethanol production, increasing agricultural production is expected to result in increased water yield and nutrient export. Results provide important benchmarks for assessing the significance of LULC change on the regional water and climate patterns in the UMRB. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID XIAOQING RIVER; POLLUTION; NETWORK; MODELS
AB Estuaries are principal sources of pollution in coastal areas. Estuarine water quality prediction models can provide early warnings to prevent major disasters in coastal ecosystems. In this study, several machine learning models-multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were developed to predict NH4+-N in the Xiaoqing River estuary, China. The results show that there is a strong nonlinear relationship between estuarine NH4+-N and NH4+-N of the upper reaches. The shapely additive explanations method was used to interpret the XGBoost model and discover the influence of the upper reaches of the river on the estuary. These explanations showed that two stations monitoring water quality in the upper reaches (Shicun and Sanchakou) had a critical impact on estuarine water quality. If NH4+-N concentration of the upper reaches is below 2 mg/L, estuarine NH4+-N would not be negatively influenced by the upper reaches. These results can support pollution warnings for improving estuarine water quality and the integrated environmental management of the river and costal area.

DT Article
DE Rainfall-runoff model; Jordan Rift Valley; ARX model; Linear
   programming; Fractional calculus; Transfer function
AB A new concept is developed to mathematically understand the dynamics of the rainfall-runoff events in a barren catchment of the Jordan Rift Valley. Time series data of rainfall and runoff have been acquired at an observation point in the catchment. Due to the extreme arid environment, water current as the runoff from the catchment is ephemeral, and the rainfall-runoff events are clearly distinguishable from each other. Firstly, a pair of linear autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX models) is identified to tightly bound each runoff time series using the simplex method of linear programming. The exogenous input part is compatible with the conventional unit hydrograph method, while the autoregressive part is regarded as a discretized differential operator of fractional orders. Then, a linear fractional differential equation is determined to approximate each linear ARX model, which restricts the perturbation of the actual causal relationship between rainfall intensity and runoff discharge. The resulting lower and upper bounding rainfall-runoff models with fractional derivatives are examined in the system-theoretic framework. Finally, a nominal model from which actual nonlinear and stochastic phenomena perturb is arranged to envelope the all upper bounding rainfall-runoff models in the frequency domain, leading to the formulation of a challenging fractional optimal control problem involving stochastic processes.

AB Observations of a small riverine plume (Grand River, ON) in the nearshore zones of Lake Erie were analyzed to describe its spatial variability and its thickness under different wind forcing conditions during late spring of 2012. Observational results reveal a well-marked frontal region in the vicinity of the river mouth, causing the plume to discharge into the lake in the surface layers (positive buoyant). Wind driven alongshore currents at the mid-depth had speeds of 2-9 cm/s, in comparison to those in the cross-shore 3-6 cm/s, which transported the plume along the shore during the measurement period. Series of laboratory experiments were conducted to obtain the propagation speed (U) of the buoyant plume in terms of buoyancy anomaly (Ba), Richardson number (Ri), dimensionless time (t'), and aspect ratio (A). Based on our experiments, we developed two non -dimensional relationships describing the speed of propagation (U) as UlBa(1/2) = 8 Ri(-1/2)t'(1/3)A and the plume thickness (h) as h/H= 0.8 Ri(-1/4),t'(1/2)A in the water depth (H), which are in agreement with field observations.

AB The Paraiba do Sul watershed is an important hydrological resource for southeastern Brazil, that has undergone extensive land use changes related to industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Over 11 years, between 1997 and 2007, a long-term study was conducted to evaluate hydrochemical variation in the basin outlet through estimations of annual fluxes and identification of their controlling factors. River water was classified as Na-HCO3, with TDS ranging from 32 to 132 mg L-1. Variation between seasons was found: cations, total alkalinity, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and chlorophyll "a" had increased values the during low discharge period, while concentrations of DOC, ammonium, nitrite, phosphate and SPM had increased values during the high discharge period. Chloride, sulfate, silica and pH showed no clear relationship with discharge. These patterns also were correlated with hydrological flow paths originating from different sources. Wavelet decomposition was used to characterize precipitation anomalies largely associated both with long-term climate factors (i.e. ENSO) and short-term climate responses from the two discharge periods that were studied. Distinct responses of fluvial hydrochemistry were observed including ENSO-induced fluctuation to be particularly strong for DOC, with annual flux varying approximately 60% around measured median value.

AB Geologic heterogeneity, which commonly exists in target reservoirs for CO2 sequestration, has a significant effect on CO2 trapping. In this study, we performed Darcy-scale multiphase flow experiments on a heterogeneous rock with in-situ imaging techniques to obtain X-ray images of CO2 saturation during both drainage and imbibition. Residual trapping was assessed using the initial-residual characteristic curve. The distribution of residual CO2 saturation widened as the initial saturation increased, implying that the capillary heterogeneity becomes increasingly important with higher initial CO2 saturation. During dissolution, we discovered new flow regimes in heterogeneous media and proposed a quantitative scaling relationship for their temporal evolution. The highporosity layers showed a descending slope of similar to 0.4 during the early stage of dissolution, whereas it decreased by an order of magnitude (slope similar to 0.04) during the later stage. The high-capillarity layers, however, showed a single descending trend during dissolution. The highly time-resolved images of CO2 saturation provide a detailed understanding of the dynamic processes of both residual and dissolution trapping in heterogeneous media, which contributes to a wide range of applications, including environmental remediation, CO2 sequestration, and the enhancement of energy resources from hydrocarbon reservoirs.

ID POINT RAINFALL; FREQUENCY; TRANSFORMATION; THRESHOLDS; DERIVATION
AB For the study and modeling of hydrological phenomena, both in urban and rural areas, a proper estimation of the areal reduction factor (ARF) is crucial. In this paper, we estimated the ARF from observed rainfall data as the ratio between the average rainfall occurring in a specific area and the point rainfall. Then, we compared the obtained ARF values with some of the most widespread empirical approaches in literature which are used when rainfall observations are not available. Results highlight that the literature formulations can lead to a substantial over- or underestimation of the ARF estimated from observed data. These findings can have severe consequences, especially in the design of hydraulic structures where empirical formulations are extensively applied. The aim of this paper is to present a new analytical relationship with an explicit dependence on the rainfall duration and area that can better represent the ARF-area trend over the area case of study. The analytical curve presented here can find an important application to estimate the ARF values for design purposes. The test study area is the Lazio Region (central Italy). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID ENTROPY; SYSTEMS
AB A river regime describes the average seasonal behaviour of flow. This seasonal pattern reflects climatic and physiographic conditions in the basin. An inherent characteristic of a flow regime is its stability, i.e. regularity or irregularity of the seasonal pattern. A temperature rise, as predicted by climatic models, might cause changes in the patterns and stability of river flow regimes. Sensitivity of the stability of flow regimes to small fluctuations in temperature (approximate to +/- 1 degrees C) is investigated with the help of historical temperature and flow series for Scandinavia. The concept of entropy is utilized for quantification of the stability of the flow regimes conditioned on temperature which also allows forecasting of possible changes in this stability due to changes in temperature. The study shows that the stability of now regime types with rain or mixed rain and snowmelt sources of flow formation is already sensitive to small changes in temperature, especially concerning flow minima.

ID OF-FIT TESTS; PARAMETER
AB The generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is a widely used frequency model for fitting extremes in hydrology, especially to fit exceedances over a threshold in the peaks-over-threshold (POT) modeling of floods or other extreme hydrological phenomena. A key goal in fitting frequency distributions to data is to allow the estimation of distribution quantiles, which in hydrology are often used as "design events". The maximum likelihood (ML) method is a recommended method for fitting the GPD to data. To provide a measure of the statistical error involved in the estimation of design events, confidence intervals for quantiles (CIQs) have to be calculated. Hydrologists have traditionally used large-sample theory to construct such CIQs, but it is shown in the present study that this leads to inaccurate results for quantiles in the right-tail of a GPD. An improvement is therefore proposed for these classically obtained CIQs under a GPD model fitted by ML. The conventional and proposed approaches are compared through Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and the resulting recommendations are put to use in a hydrological application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pores in the subsurface form during the Earth forming process, e.g., sedimentation and diagenesis which evolve over the geologic time scale. Pores serve as the needed 'room' for the storage of natural resources and for transporting various fluids. Therefore, quantifying the volume of pores, i.e., the pore volume, is central to many geophysical and engineering problems. However, an accurate determination of subsurface pore volume has remained a challenge, primarily related to the spatial heterogeneity found at multiple length scales. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the effective pore volume of a multiscale heterogeneous porous matrix and preferential fracture flow system by evaluating groundwater age or residence time of an inert tracer. The robustness of the proposed theoretical model is tested against numerical solutions from a typical fracture (network)-matrix flow system with heterogeneous pore space distribution. We find that, although there are some uncertainties for the application of theory by measuring groundwater age or solute breakthrough curves, our proposed theoretical model is overall robust and insensitive to the length scales with relative errors of less than 9% in estimated effective pore volume. In contrast, traditional methods remain either unrepresentative or lack resolution for determining subsurface pore volume in heterogeneous formations.

AB When dealing with groundwater flows, many difficulties arise in the characterization of an aquifer and in the identification of the solute trajectories, due to the natural heterogeneity of the porous formations.
   Transmissivity spatial variability is the main source of uncertainty in an aquifer system in the study of two-dimensional flows and as detailed knowledge of its values is not possible, the flow and transport phenomena are subject to uncertainty.
   This manuscript deals with the problem of the estimation of a solute trajectory and it presents the combined use of piezometric head, transmissivity and solute trajectory displacement data for the estimation of the solute path. The work is carried out in a stochastic framework and linear theory tools are used. The proposed methodology is a cokriging application and it has been tested by means of two Monte Carlo experiments carried out for two degrees of heterogeneity, one has been performed considering weakly heterogeneous aquifers, the other highly heterogeneous aquifers. A numerical application, based on a real transmissivity heterogeneous field, has been proposed. The results of the computation show the important impact of trajectory displacement data on the estimation of the solute path. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water has always been a driver of human mobility, migration, and displacement. But water is increasingly central to explaining environmental migration in the context of climate change. Most studies of the relationship between water and environmental migration are framed around punctuated, extreme weather events and disasters that either limit agricultural or livestock productivity or make a community physically unlivable. The chronic experiences of household water insecurity and poor water governance also shape migration decision-making through a variety of social, political, and economic factors, but these relationships have received considerably less attention. This article provides an overview of punctuated and chronic water-related triggers of environmental migration at the household level. We also offer a conceptual framework based on multiphasic response theory that highlights water's multiple roles in migration decision-making. We close by reflecting on key gaps in the climate-water-migration literature, identifying research questions that might help us better understand these relationships, and considering the implications for sustainable development policies that could potentially ease pressures on water-related displacement.

ID ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; FLUXES; TEMPERATURE; PROFILES; DRAG
AB The convective turbulence theory (CTT) [Stull, 1994] has several advantages over traditional bulk atmospheric boundary layer similarity formulations for the surface momentum and sensible heat fluxes under free convection. In particular, in CTT surface fluxes at scales of 10(1)-10(2) km are parameterized directly from surface and mixed layer measurements, without regard to the surface layer profiles or surface roughness. The equations of CTT are tested with the First International Satellite-Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) data set; the theory is extended so that geostrophic winds may be used in place of mixed layer winds; the formulation is applied to satellite-derived surface temperature data; and Stull's [1994] mixed convection interpolation formula is tested. The scatter on graphs of the mixed layer transfer coefficients for momentum and sensible heat is greater for the FIFE data than for the Boundary-Layer Experiment 1983 (BLX83) data used by Stull [1994], and the mean coefficient values are greater, probably because of the use of radiosonde data at FIFE and spatially averaged aircraft data at BLX83. Surface momentum and sensible heat flux estimated on the basis of CTT produced reasonable results but provided little or no improvement over a direct correlation between the reference fluxes and the mixed layer wind speed or the surface-to-mixed layer temperature difference. The geostrophic version of CTT provided results comparable to the original CTT. Remotely sensed surface temperatures used with geostrophic CTT allowed reasonable estimates of the surface sensible heat flux.

AB This study introduced a clustered polynomial chaos expansion (CPCE) model to reveal random propagation and dynamic sensitivity of uncertainty parameters in hydrologic prediction. In the CPCE model, the random characteristics of the streamflow simulations resulting from parameter uncertainties are characterized through the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) model based on the probabilistic collocation method. At the same time, a multivariate discrete non-functional relationship between PCE coefficients and hydrological model inputs is established based on stepwise cluster analysis. Therefore, compared with traditional PCE method, the developed CPCE model cannot only reflect uncertainty propagation in stochastic hydrological simulation, but also have the capability of random forecasting. Moreover, the dynamic sensitivities of model parameters are investigated through the multilevel factorial analyses. The developed approach was applied for streamflow forecasting for the Ruihe watershed, China. Results showed that with effective quantification for the random characteristics of hydrological processes, the CPCE model can directly predict runoff series and generate the associated probability distributions at different time periods. The dynamic sensitivity analysis indicates that the maximum soil moisture capacity within the catchment plays a key role in the accuracy of the low-flow forecasting, while the degree of spatial variability in soil moisture capacities has a remarkable impact on the accuracy of the high-flow forecasting in the studied watershed.

AB The importance of securing water supply necessitates that all options be explored. Research has indicated that demand on water catchments can be substantially decreased when a large proportion of households reuse greywater and/or install rainwater tanks. This paper reports on an internet survey completed by 354 households residing in the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding regions. Statistical analyses examined the relationship between socio-economic and psychological variables and the likelihood of the garden being irrigated with greywater and/or rainwater. The results show income, gender, age and education could not differentiate residents who were irrigating their garden with water from a tank from residents who were not. Residents who used tank water on their gardens had a higher self-reported understanding of a range of water supply options. Female participants and lower income residents were more likely to use greywater on their garden. Participants who irrigated the garden with greywater were more likely to judge various other water collection and recycling proposals as being appropriate. General concerns about water collection and reuse risks were not found to predict which households used tank water and/or greywater on their garden.

AB Catchment classification aids in the identification of homogeneous regions in which catchments have similar flood timing and corresponding climatic drivers. As a new classification scheme from complex network theory, the community detection method is introduced to classify 242 catchments in the United States based on flood seasonality. The robustness of this method is tested by calculating the Adjusted Rank Index between the classification results from different random subsets of the 242 catchments and different flood sampling methods. In addition, three network metrics (network density, centrality, and k-core nucleus) are used to further unravel the hydrological connections within each community of catchments. Catchments with similar flood seasonality cluster into six large communities, while catchments in sparsely gauged areas or with unique physiographic properties are isolated from large communities. High values of the Adjusted Rank Index show the robustness of the community detection method for catchment classification. The results indicate that the complex network is valid for use in classifying catchments based on flood seasonality. Moreover, for each community, the network metrics are potential descriptors of: (a) the degree of homogeneity, (b) the representativeness of any catchment, and (c) the spatial scale of synchronized floods. Therefore, the complex network is able to characterize the interconnections between catchments within the community.

AB Anthropogenic climate change has impacted almost all phases of the global water cycle. Growing consensus asserts that extreme precipitation events will only rise in the years to come. However, an increase in extreme precipitation events does not necessarily correspond to higher flood risk. Much onus lies on the antecedent conditions before the storm events. Despite the importance of Soil Moisture (SM) - Precipitation (P) dependence in runoff generation, relatively few studies have unraveled the SM - P dependence. Previous studies were constrained by the direct trivial relationship existing between SM and P, and hence there is a need to understand direction and dynamical interdependency. We employed Event Coincidence Analysis (ECA) to identify and quantify the preconditioning of P extremes by soil moisture (SM) anomalies. High precursor coincidence rate (greater than45%) was obtained for traditional flash flood-prone areas over India - Ganga river basin, West-flowing rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra including Luni, inland drainage of Rajasthan and Narmada river basin, indicating the robustness of the approach. The trigger coincidence rate reveals strong SM-P coupling over central India. Our results indicate the applicability of ECA in characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM-P dependence over India.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Blanket bog; Water quality; Base flow; Discharge
ID RESTORATION; CHEMISTRY
AB A two year hydrological characterisation programme of relatively intact blanket peat-covered catchments, underlain by geochemically distinct substrates, investigated the influence of sub-peat materials on the runoff regimes of the first order and second order streams draining them. Semi-continuous monitoring of flow and water quality revealed a strong inverse relationship between stream flow rates and specific electrical conductance (SEC), with runoff chemistries during storm flow proving comparable in all three catchments. By contrast, differences in water quality between catchments became more pronounced at lower flow, where increased ion concentrations in stream water reflected reactions with peat substrate materials. Water table monitoring in peat at all three sites revealed groundwater levels to vary by less than 0.6 m over the investigation period. Findings suggest runoff consists of near constant inputs of higher specific electrical conductance peat substrate discharge, mixing with variable proportions of less mineralised and more compositionally variable bog water. Although making up less than 5% to total runoff, the contribution of more mineralised waters plays an important role in maintaining stream flow, particularly during prolonged dry periods, and may help explain the aquatic biodiversity encountered in blanket peat covered areas.

AB The Hybrid approach introduced by the authors for at-site modeling of annual and periodic streamflows in earlier works is extended to simulate multi-site multi-season streamflows. It bears significance in integrated river basin planning studies. This hybrid model involves: (i) partial pre-whitening of standardized multi-season streamflows at each site using a parsimonious linear periodic model; (ii) contemporaneous resampling of the resulting residuals with an appropriate block size, using moving block bootstrap (non-parametric, NP) technique; and (iii) post-blackening the bootstrapped innovation series at each site, by adding the corresponding parametric model component for the site, to obtain generated streamflows at each of the sites. It gains significantly by effectively utilizing the merits of both parametric and NP models. It is able to reproduce various statistics, including the dependence relationships at both spatial and temporal levels without using any normalizing transformations and/or adjustment procedures. The potential of the hybrid model in reproducing a wide variety of statistics including the run characteristics, is demonstrated through an application for multi-site streamflow generation in the Upper Cauvery river basin, Southern India.

AB The contaminant transport process governed by the advection-diffusion equation plays an important role in modelling industrial and environmental flows. In this article, our aim is to accurately reduce the 2-D advection-diffusion equation governing the dispersion of a contaminant in a turbulent open channel flow to its 1-D approximation. The 1-D model helps to quickly estimate the horizontal size of contaminant clouds based on the values of the model coefficients. We derive these coefficients analytically and investigate numerically the model convergence. The derivation is based on the centre manifold theory to obtain successively more accurate approximations in a consistent manner. Two types of the average velocity profile are considered: the classical logarithmic profile and the power profile. We further develop the one-dimensional integrated radial basis function network method as a numerical approach to obtain the numerical solutions to both the original 2-D equation and the approximate 1-D equations. We compare the solutions of the original models with their centre-manifold approximations at very large Reynolds numbers. The numerical results obtained from the approximate 1-D models are in good agreement with those of the original 2-D model for both the logarithmic and power velocity profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW; MUSSEL FARM; AQUACULTURE
AB Large scale raft culture, a common aquaculture in coastal areas, has an important impact on the hydrodynamic and ecological environments of coastal waters due to its water blocking effect. The flow resistance of raft culture was formulated by a parameterized model (PM) to describe the loss of flow momentum. Based on the classical theory of flow around cylinders using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the proposed dimensionless PM took into account the effects of both spacing and submerged length of culture units. And the culture density was decomposed into two orthogonal directions along culture unit arrangement. The drag coefficient calculated by the PM agreed well with the CFD results. To verify the PM's effectiveness, the Delft3D model with the PM was applied to Shenzhen Bay of China, waters with large-scale oyster raft culture. Compared with the observation, the numerical results with the PM agreed better than those without the PM. And the results showed that in Shenzhen Bay, the annual average velocity decreased by 23.22% in the culture area, while in the nearby channel outside the culture area, the annual average velocity increased by 15.65%. The model provides a useful tool for scientific management and evaluation for coastal aquaculture and coastal waters.

ID WATER-LEVEL CHANGES; WAVE ATTENUATION; DEPOSITION; WELL; FLOW
AB It is well established that seismic waves traveling through porous media stimulate fluid flow and accelerate particle transport. However, the mechanism remains poorly understood. To quantify the coupling effect of hydrodynamic force, transportation distance, and ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport and fate in porous media, laboratory experiments were conducted using custom-built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment. Three column lengths (23 cm, 33 cm, and 43 cm) were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance. Transport experiments were performed with 0 W, 600 W, 1000 W, 1400 W, and 1800 W of applied ultrasound, and flow rates of 0.065 cm/s, 0.130 cm/s, and 0.195 cm/s, to establish the roles of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force. The laboratory results suggest that whilst ultrasonic stimulation does inhibit suspended-particle deposition and accelerate deposited-particle release, both hydrodynamic force and transportation distance are the principal controlling factors. The median particle diameter for the peak concentration was approximately 50% of that retained in the soil column. Simulated particle-breakthrough curves using extended traditional filtration theory effectively described the experimental curves, particularly the curves that exhibited a higher tailing concentration.

AB Contamination created by dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) is a serious threat to the quality of the groundwater supply; thus, delineating and removing the DNAPL source is an essential step in a successful remediation strategy. The goal of this work is to create an optimal search strategy that identifies a DNAPL source using the least number of water quality samples.
   The search strategy includes a Monte Carlo stochastic groundwater flow and transport model, a predetermined set of potential source locations and a Kalman filter that updates the simulated contaminant concentration field using contaminant concentration data. The updated plume is compared to the concentration fields that emanate from each individual potential source using a technique rooted in fuzzy set theory. The comparison provides weights that reflect the degree of truth regarding the location of the source at the selected potential source locations. The steps described above are repeated until the weights stabilize and the optimal source location is determined.
   This paper presents the various mathematical tools employed in the search algorithm and their modifications for incorporation into the proposed methodology. The algorithm's effectiveness in identifying a DNAPL source is shown using a synthetic example. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An O(sigma(nu)(N)) Eulerian stochastic theory [Cushman and Hu, 1997] for conservative transport is coupled with an O(sigma(f)(4)) Eulerian solution to the flow problem. The theory provides a self-consistent recursive solution to the closure problem associated with Eulerian methods. The stochastic concentration is given to arbitrary order in sigma(nu), the variance of fluctuating velocity. The balance law for mean concentration is not required in the analysis. Closed forms for mean concentration are given up td O(sigma(nu)(4)). The mean concentration is transformed to wave-vector and frequency domain via fast Fourier transform to calculate numerically the mean concentration as well as its spatial moments. The results show that the first-order solution in sigma(nu)(2) is equivalent to the nonlocal theory of Deng et al. [1993]. Second-order corrections to flow and transport equations slightly decrease the second longitudinal moment but significantly increase the second transverse moment, which is consistent with Hsu et al.'s [1996] results. The influence of second-order corrections to skewness is not clear. The second longitudinal moment obtained from the second-order correction agrees with the Monte Carlo result, but second-order results for the second transverse moment and skewness significantly differ from those given in Monte Carlo simulations. Coupling the transport correction models with the velocity covariance generated through Monte Carlo simulation gives second transverse spatial moments that are very close to Monte Carlo simulations, which suggests that the correction to flow is more important than the correction to transport. The results also bring into question the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations for flow.

AB Precipitation is a key part of hydrological circulation and is a sensitive indicator of climate change. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) datasets are widely used for global and regional precipitation investigations. However, their local application is limited by the relatively coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, in this paper, an attention mechanism based convolutional network (AMCN) is proposed to downscale GPM IMERG monthly precipitation data from 0.1 degrees to 0.01 degrees. The proposed method is an end-to-end network, which consists of a global cross-attention module, a multi-factor cross-attention module, and a residual convolutional module, comprehensively considering the potential relationships between precipitation and complicated surface characteristics. In addition, a degradation loss function based on low-resolution precipitation is designed to physically constrain the network training, to improve the robustness of the proposed network under different time and scale variations. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms three baseline methods. Compared with in-situ measurements, the normalized root-mean-square error is decreased by 0.011-0.045 in the real-data experiment. Finally, a geographic difference analysis method is introduced to further improve the downscaled results by incorporating in-situ measurements for high-quality and fine-scale precipitation estimation.

AB Groundwater extraction causes significant land subsidence in many parts of the world with compressible sediments. InSAR data have been used to estimate the magnitude of this subsidence, and derive hydrologic and geomechanical properties in these areas. In spite of recent advances in InSAR processing methods, several challenges remain in relating surface deformation to hydrologic systems. The relationship between deformation and groundwater levels is non-linear, and existing groundwater level data are often sparsely sampled, so that it is challenging to relate them to InSAR-derived deformation. In addition, historical InSAR datasets are sparsely sampled in time, leaving many gaps in existing deformation estimates. In this study, we present an approach to improve the temporal density of groundwater level and deformation estimates. The study area for this demonstration is Parowan Valley, Utah, a region dependent on groundwater for agricultural use that has seen significant declines in head over the past 70 years. In our approach, we use Theis curves to interpolate seasonal fluctuations in head, and a subsidence model to extend deformation estimates. We find that with this approach, we are able to closely match long-term and seasonal estimates of deformation, estimate seasonal fluctuations in head, and characterize the elastic and inelastic response to changes in head.

AB Hongjiannao Lake (HL), the largest desert freshwater lake in China, has been undergoing quickly evolution of lake area during the past 30 years. The causes and driving mechanism of such changes, however, are still not well understood. The evolution process can be divided into three phases: the stationary phase, the shrinking phase, and the rising phase, which were affected by climate change and human activities, such as unreasonable utili-zation and water diversion. Here, wavelet coherence was used to analyze the relationship between the groundwater level and the lake level, and the results shown that groundwater levels in the lakeshore region were positively correlated to lake level within a short lag period of approximately 30 days. Then a gradient boosting decision tree-based regression model was applied to analyze the relative importance of climatic factors (model 1) and both of climatic factors and groundwater level (model 2) to the lake level. In model 1, the most important factor was the evaporation to the HL level, while in model 2, it was the groundwater level and the evaporation, which also achieved better prediction performance. Finally, using the 2021 meteorological data and groundwater level, model 2 was utilized to dynamically predict the daily water level of the HL, showing that the lake level fluctuated upward.

AB It is clear that humans are impacting the water cycle. There is interest in both determining where and how aquatic systems are most impacted by human development, and in determining the types and locations of basin modifications that are having the most impact. Instead of complex physical models of individual basins, we propose the use of a statistical approach to look at the relationship between human basin modifications and the resulting impacts on streamflow. We develop a set of multiple linear regression models, using principal component analysis to guide independent variable selection, to estimate current, altered streamflow from a full range of both natural and anthropogenic basin characteristics. Natural streamflow is then estimated by simulating basins with no alterations, and the difference between the natural and altered streamflow are summarized by use of the ecochange percent metric. The model suggests that dam storage, water withdrawals and discharges, and land use all impact stream flow and non-point source land use modifications such as impervious cover are potentially increasing low flows. The approach provides an opportunity to increase our understanding of the relation between human basin modifications and changes in streamflow. The model developed could potentially be used to estimate streamflow alteration at ungaged sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is hypothesized that groundwater major ions chemistry can be employed to determine the interaction between groundwater (GW) and saline water/seawater (SW) in costal aquifers, and that there exists a relationship between total dissolved solids with chloride, sodium, magnesium and sulphate concentrations of groundwater This hypothesis was tested on a watershed located along the southeastern coast of India. From empirical data collected twice during pre- and post-monsoon seasons, it was found that in both seasons, out of 99.9% of the electrical conductivity (EC) variability due to the combined effect of Na+, Ca2+ + Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3- and NO3-, 54.0% was due to Cl- alone in pre-monsoon, and 43.1% in post-monsoon. Results of factor analysis highlighted the multi-scale control of the fluid exchange and the influence of mixing zones between groundwater and saline water. Hydrochemical processes that accompany the intrusion of seawater were identified using ionic changes. It was observed during the sampling periods that the mixing due to seawater intrusion varied from 4 82% to 7 86% throughout the watershed. Negative values of ionic change (e(change)) for Na+ and K+ decreased with the increasing fraction of seawater (C) 2010 Elsevier B V. All rights reserved.

AB The study presented here utilized long-term streamflow records (over 500 years) to investigate the influence of interannual/interdecadal climate variability on the Colorado River basin. 19 unimpaired water year streamflow stations were reconstructed utilizing partial least square regression using standard tree ring chronologies. The spatial and temporal variability of drought was evaluated for all the stations for the different centuries in the record. Finally, the relationship between individual impact of ENSO, PDO, and AMO and its combined effect on streamflow was determined using the non parametric Rank Sum test for different lag years (0, +1, +2, and +3) of streamflow. This research also determined the change in streamflow volume with respect to the long-term mean volume of the basin due to individual and coupled effect of oceanic climate influences. Results indicate that there is an increase in streamflow during El Nino and decreased streamflow during La Nina in the basin. Similarly, PDO warm/cold resulted in increased/decreased streamflow. There were few stations related to the AMO in the basin. Finally, the differences in the Upper and Lower basin were noted in the magnitude of changes in streamflow (in terms of percentage) under different individual and coupled influences of ENSO, PDO, and AMO.

AB Tracer studies, using Gran alkalinity and 6180, in nested sub-basins of the 230 km(2) Feshie catchment in the Cairngorm mountains, Scotland, were used to characterise hydrology in terms of groundwater contributions to annual runoff and mean residence times. Relationships between these fundamental hydrological descriptors and catchment characteristics were explored with the use of a GIS. Catchment soil distribution-mapped by the UK's Hydrology Of Soil Type (HOST) digital data base-exerted the strongest influence on flow path partitioning and mean residence times. Smallest groundwater contributions (similar to 30-40%) and shortest residence times (similar to 2-5 months) were observed in catchments dominated by peat and/or shallow alpine soils and bedrock. Longer residence times (similar to 12-15 months) and greater groundwater contributions (similar to 45-55%) were observed in catchments dominated by more freely draining podzolic, sub-alpine and alluvial soils. These different subcatchment responses were integrated to give intermediate residence times (similar to 6 months) at the catchment outfall. The influence of catchment topography and scale appeared to be largely mediated by their influence on soil cover and distribution. The study illustrates the potential utility of integrating digital landscape analysis with tracer studies to understand the hydrological functioning of mesoscale catchments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The assessment of the efficiency of a storm water storage facility devoted to the sewer overflow control in urban areas strictly depends on the ability to model the main features of the rainfall-runoff routing process and the related wet weather pollution delivery. In this paper the possibility of applying the analytical probabilistic approach for developing a tank design method, whose potentials are similar to the continuous simulations, is proved. In the model derivation the quality issues of such devices were implemented. The formulation is based on a Weibull probabilistic model of the main characteristics of the rainfall process and on a power law describing the relationship between the dimensionless storm water cumulative runoff volume and the dimensionless cumulative pollutograph. Following this approach, efficiency indexes were established. The proposed model was verified by comparing its results to those obtained by continuous simulations; satisfactory agreement is shown for the proposed efficiency indexes.

AB This paper discusses the attempts to derive surface soil moisture information for two catchments under different climates in Europe based on active microwave remote sensing techniques and conceptual hydrological modelling. The two catchments were selected as test sites during the MAC-EUROPE'91 campaign. The first catchment, Slapton Wood, is situated in south-west England. The second catchment, Virginiolo, is situated in Tuscany, Italy. For both sites, multitemporal full polarimetric AIRSAR (C-, L- and P-band) data are available for the summer of 1991. Based on ground-truth data collected during the flights, simple SAR-soil moisture relationships are established, This allows the estimation of the spatial variation of surface soil moisture at the field scale. From hydrological and meteorological data acquired during the experiment, a conceptual water and energy balance model was calibrated. Simulation results for soil moisture are then compared with SAR-based soil moisture estimates. The comparison between sampled, modelled and SAR-derived soil moisture at the transect scale is acceptable, but the spatial patterns of soil moisture predicted by the conceptual model and the SAR images are different owing to the influence of vegetation. The results are also useful in pointing out some of the major problems encountered in the application of SAR data at the catchment scale.

AB A new drought index is introduced that explicitly considers both water supply and demand. It can be applied to aggregate demand over a geographical region, or for disaggregated demand related to a specific crop or use. Consequently, it is more directly related than existing indices, to potential drought impacts on different segments of society, and is also suitable to use as an index for drought insurance programs targeted at farmers growing specific crops. An application of the index is presented for the drought characterization at the county level for the aggregate demand of eight major field crops in the conterminous United States. Two resiliency metrics are developed and applied with the drought index time series. In addition, a clustering algorithm is applied to the onset times and severity of the worst historical droughts in each county, to identify the spatial structure of drought, relative to the cropping patterns in each county. The geographic relationship of drought severity, drought recovery relative to duration, and resilience to drought is identified, and related to attributes of precipitation and also cropping intensity, thus distinguishing the relative importance of water supply and demand in determining potential drought outcomes.

AB Hydrological processes in river systems have been changing under the impacts of both climate variability and human activities. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall statistic was used to identify change trends and points in the annual streamflow in the Hun-Tai River basin in northeast China. The identifications were based on streamflow records from six hydrological stations during 1961-2006, and the purpose was to analyze the change characteristics of the hydrological processes. The results indicated that all hydrological stations presented downward trends in annual streamflows. Abrupt changes in the annual streamflow occurred around 1978 in the Hun River basin, and around 1998 in the Taizi River basin. The impact of climate variability on the mean annual streamflow was also analyzed based on the relationships among streamflow, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation and meteorological data from 22 rainfall stations and 10 weather stations within the basin were employed in the analysis. Daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Climate variability was estimated to account for 43% of the reduction in the annual streamflow, and human activities accounted for about 57%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Naturally occurring stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were used to determine the seasonal water sources of Juniperus ashei and its relationship with soil water content on the Edwards Plateau of central Texas, Honey Creek State Natural Area. The patchy nature of juniper stands rooting in the thin soils over karstified carbonate bedrock imparts large spatial heterogeneity in soil water content and isotopic composition largely by differential shading, but also by canopy interception. There is a seasonal decrease in the oxygen isotope composition of juniper xylem water by similar to 2%. during the transition from hot, dry summer conditions to the cool, moist winter. Prior to this shift, the xylem water isotope composition is similar to local springs, presumed to represent local groundwater; after this shift, the xylem water composition is similar to soil water below 10 cm. These results suggest a change in juniper water use from a dominantly deep water source during the summer to a dominantly soil source during the winter over the study period, but the timing of this transition will likely vary from year to year.

AB Water repellency (hydrophobicity) is known to be temporally variable. Most studies indicate that soils are most repellent when dry and least repellent or non-repellent (hydrophilic) when moist. In several studies, attempts have been made to establish a critical soil moisture threshold, demarcating water-repellent and non-repellent conditions. The reported thresholds vary widely and the exact relationship between hydrophobicity and soil moisture remains far from being understood. Using field and laboratory measurements, this study explores the effect of soil moisture on water repellency for Portuguese sandy loam and loamy sand forest soils. The results indicate that for these soils, repellency is absent when soil moisture exceeds 28%, but show that after wetting, repellency is not necessarily re-established when soils become dry again. It is thought that short-term and seasonal changes in soil water repellency are not simply a function of variations in soil moisture as indicated in the literature. It is suggested that, after wetting, re-establishment of repellency may also require a fresh input of water-repellent substances. The mechanisms of wetting and drying in water-repellent soils are discussed and associated hydrological implications are explored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Revegetation of degraded ecosystems provides opportunities for improving ecosystem production, mitigating climate change, and improving carbon sequestration. Revegetation tends to reduce streamflow (Q) caused by enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) or increase the water yield (W) due to increasing soil water infiltration with the steady state assumption, while under multiple steady states, its effects on the hydrological state remain controversial. Here, the assumptions that ET is calculated from water balance (ETwb) and using evaporation theory (ETc) are independent. Assessment of the hydrological states can be provided following this assumption in a water-limited region, such as the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that: (i) revegetation dramatically improved the leaf area index (LAI) over the Loess Plateau, and abrupt LAI changes were detected in 2002; (ii) enhanced ET (ETwb and ETc) with revegetation was observed, and the elevated fraction of precipitation (P) partitioned into ETwb led to decreases in W (P-ETc); and (iii) as inferred by our assumption, most catchments tended to be wetter (11 among 17 catchments), which indicates that soil water storage (SWS) also increased combined with increased ET and decreased Q. Our results provide new insight into revegetation playing a new role in partitioning P into ET, Q and SWS. Higher ratios of P tend to be intercepted in SWS to maintain higher ET and even induce a reduction in Q in most regions of the Loess Plateau, China.

AB Iran faces a serious and worsening water crisis, and water conservation by its farmers is rightly seen as crucial to any resolution. Whilst many farmers are profligate in their use of water, some are parsimonious: behavioural strategies vary and these strategies, we hypothesise, are accompanied by differing perceptions. These perceptions, we further hypothesise, are generated by the four different ways of organising - individualism, hierarchy, egalitarianism and fatalism - that are predicted by the theory of plural rationality. Informal guided interviews with 330 farmers in Boushehr Province support these hypotheses and show that both perceptions of and behaviour in relation to water are closely tied to the farmers' ways of organising which, in turn, are influenced by the socio-technological origin of their water: wells, irrigation canals, qanats. "Egalitarian" farmers are already behaving in the desired way; they are most prevalent among those who rely on wells. "Individualist" and "fatalist" farmers are profligate in their water use; they are most prevalent among those who rely on irrigation canals. The modern technology, we suggest, could be re-cast, in part, along the lines of the traditional qanat socio-technological system, so that water, at times and in places, is delivered as a common-pool good (egalitarianism) and not just in the current public good (hierarchy) or private good (individualism) modes.

AB We present new analytical solutions for examining the influence, during a pumping test in a well, of an infinite linear and anisotropic strip-aquifer that drains shallow aquifers of different diffusivity and thickness. The whole system is confined and the aquifer geometry can be represented by a 'T', an aquifer geometry resembling a sub-vertical fault or a sub-vertical vein cross-cutting shallower aquifers. The proposed solutions are based upon an unconventional application of well-image theory, without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three domains. Solutions for drawdown were developed for the three domains, i.e. the strip-aquifer and the two shallow compartments, and flow signatures are discussed in detail and compared to numerical modelling. The proposed solutions are not shown to be exact solutions to the appropriate partial differential equation, but very good and useful approximations. The solutions were applied to a 63-day pumping test in a steep fault zone in crystalline aquifer rock of Brittany, France. After that, the flow contributions of the fault zone and of the shallow aquifers deduced from groundwater dating were compared to analytical solutions. The solutions and theoretical type-curve examples can help in understanding flow processes from tests conducted in settings that are similar to such a conceptual model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the regional hydrogeochemical spatialization and controls of the Serra Geral Aquifer System (SGAS), a transboundary fractured aquifer, across the southern region of Brazil. An extensive dataset of 1564 groundwater wells represented by 16 attributes was analyzed to identify spatial patterns and groups with similar hydrogeochemical facies. An unsupervised machine learning approach, self-organizing maps (SOM), was used in combination with k-means clustering to carry out the analysis. SOM produces two-dimensional representations, allowing visual interpretation of nonlinear relationships between the attributes. The stochastic Davies-Bouldin index pointed out to an optimal number of four clusters, highlighting significant differences in geochemistry. Cluster 1 is the most abundant and widespread, corresponding to meteoric recharge; cluster 2 is influenced by the weathering of basaltic rocks, being widely distributed, but with a higher density at the southeastern region; cluster 3 is recognized as a mixing between all the other groups, with a sparse distribution, mostly in the extreme north of the area; cluster 4 is dominated by ascending flow from the underlying sedimentary aquifers, occurring in restricted areas. This study shows that SOM can identify large-scale spatial hydrogeochemical patterns of the SGAS driven by structural and stratigraphic elements.

AB In this study, a low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) apparatus with the ability to adjust sample temperatures was used to measure the unfrozen water content of frozen soils sampled from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Based on low-field NMR theory, two cutoff values were proposed to quantitatively identify three types of unfrozen water (bulk, capillary, and bound water) in the frozen soils. The influences of soil properties (the clay content, particle size distribution, and clay mineral content) on these three different types of unfrozen water during the soil freezing process were analyzed. The results showed that the soil-freezing characteristic curve of unfrozen water could be divided into three stages, namely, the unfrozen, the rapid-drop, and the residual stages. In the rapid-drop stage, the unfrozen bound water content increases gradually with the increasing clay or clay mineral content, and at a certain temperature, the unfrozen capillary water content increases as the sand and silt content increases. A published power function model is then used to fit the measured data in this study. We found that the single parameter related to soil properties in this model could not sufficiently reflect the influence of clay mineral content or clay content on unfrozen water content.

AB Natural streams are characterized by variation in cross-section geometry, bed-slope, bed roughness, hydraulic slope, etc., along their channels resulting from several interacting features of the riverine system including the effects of discharge changes, geologic context, sediment load, etc. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of river flow dynamics requires sufficient knowledge of hydraulics and these geophysical variables. Average flow condition theory expressed as "At-A-Station" hydraulic geometry (AHG) relations are site-specific power-functions, relating the mean stream channel forms (i.e. water depth, top width, flow velocity, and flow area) to discharge, have been studied since 50s. Establishing robust AHG relations requires pre-assessment of data quality by means of uncertainty analysis. Our paper introduces a recursive data filtering procedure to find both random and systematic errors in streamflow and river survey data that can be used to produce robust and informative AHG relations. The method is first verified on synthetic data and then by experiments over: (1) real discharge-stage ratings provided by daily streamflow records of U.S. Geological Survey/National Water Information System dataset (USGS/NWIS), and (2) field river survey measurement data from USGS/NWIS. This produces robust AHG relations at 4472 monitoring stations across the U.S. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well documented that land use and land cover changes (LUCC) have profoundly affected global water cycles. However, the unclear relationship between hydrological effects and various LUCC characteristics and lack of observed continuous land cover data limit the accurate quantification of LUCC on global evapotranspiration (ET). Here, LUCC-induced ET changes were derived from continuously observed land cover maps during 1982-2016 using a Budyko type method (Zhang-curve), which suggests that woodland cover change is the key and most sensitive property of LUCC affecting water yield. A woodland reclassification scheme was proposed for applying the Zhang-curve. Separated global woodland coverage agreed well with observed data at the country level around the world. The Zhang-curve estimated global mean annual land ET as 540.8 mm.yr(-1) (excluding Antarctica). We show that global LUCC increased ET 0.052 mm.yr(-2) during the study period, contributing approximately 11.1% to the global ET increase estimated by Brutsaert (2017) about 0.47 mm.yr(-2). The results suggest that human-induced increase in global woodland coverage during the past three decades has led to a notable positive increase in global land ET, which is contrary to previous findings based on potential land cover maps.

AB Water resources in East Asia are considered particularly vulnerable to climate variability and extremes due to strong hydrologic variability inherent in the monsoon climate and rising water demand resulting from rapid economic growth. To obtain a better understanding of the current status and climate-induced risks concerning surface water quality in East Asia, seasonal and spatial variations in surface water quality were compared among 11 watersheds in eight countries during typical dry and wet periods from 2006 to 2008. While concentrations of dissolved ions tended to be higher during dry periods, concentrations of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter were significantly higher during wet periods at most sampling locations. Metals with low solubility showed higher total concentrations during wet periods and had strong positive relationships with suspended sediment concentrations. Metals with high partitioning into the dissolved phase exhibited higher concentrations during dry periods at many sites. Seasonal and spatial patterns were distinct along the Lower Mekong River, including much higher monsoonal concentrations of sediment-associated metals and relatively high dry-season concentrations of dissolved As along upper reaches. The results suggest that rainfall variability is crucial in understanding seasonality and climate-induced risks concerning surface water quality in East Asia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present an analysis of nonlinear correlation patterns and symmetries within `measured' rain fields. Various methods borrowed from Information Theory and their skills in untangling the mechanisms underlying the wild space-time variability of the rainfall process are reviewed. The second order information cumulant, namely mutual information, is used to describe the global (linear and non-linear) correlation features of observed rainfall fields and its performances are compared with more traditional correlation measures. In particular, we focus on the scaling properties of information exchanges, based on the analysis of a broad data-set of rainfall measurements performed at fine resolution in time, at about 100 meteorological stations in North-West Italy, during a period of 2 years. We further discuss the influence of the finite-size effect on inferring information statistics from relatively `short' hydrological time series and the problem of robustness in estimating their scaling properties under these conditions. The results of this study indicate the key role of estimation techniques in unravelling global correlation features and their dependence on aggregation scales in space and time. Interesting results are also achieved by performing global correlation analysis on the binary signal (rain/no-rain) extracted from rain records, since the high resolution binary structure of rainfall seems to incorporate the core correlation features of the process.

AB This paper presents a new methodology for optimizing Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) networks of reservoirs and lakes using the concept of the value of information (VOI) and utilizing results of a calibrated numerical water quality simulation model. With reference to the value of information theory, water quality of every checkpoint with a specific prior probability differs in time. After analyzing water quality samples taken from potential monitoring points, the posterior probabilities are updated using the Baye's theorem, and VOI of the samples is calculated. In the next step, the stations with maximum VOI is selected as optimal stations. This process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network locations for each interval. The results of the proposed VOl-based methodology is compared with those obtained using an entropy theoretic approach. As the results of the two methodologies would be partially different, in the next step, the results are combined using a weighting method. Finally, the optimal sampling interval and location of WQM stations are chosen using the Evidential Reasoning (ER) decision making method. The efficiency and applicability of the methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data of the Karkheh Reservoir in the southwestern part of Iran. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; ACTIVE VOLCANO; CIRCULATION
AB Over the past 30 years, numerous studies have been carried out into groundwater behavior in volcanic areas, with particular attention being paid to unsaturated volcanic tuffs.
   The volcanic formations of the Chaine des Puys (Massif Central, France) have tong been regarded as valuable sources of fresh water and many aquifers associated with volcanic flows have been tapped for domestic water supply or as sources of bottled mineral water. It has often been postulated that these volcanic flows are recharged by groundwater from the volcanic cones located upstream, although no efforts have been made to validate this theory. We tested the physical basis of this hypothesis by characterizing the unsaturated hydrodynamic properties of the packed lapilli and scoria that form the most important constituents of the Strombolian cones in this area. The mode(derived from the results of the characterization experiments was compared with data obtained from a field site. The unsaturated properties of this site (Puy de Louchadiere Strombolian cone) are discussed qualitatively and in terms of "memory effect".
   Further investigations are now needed to determine the exact behavior of the Strombolian cone and to produce complete models of the saturated and unsaturated zones of the aquifer system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All. rights reserved.

AB Bivariate wavelet coherency is a measure of correlation between two variables in the location-scale (spatial data) or time-frequency (time series) domain It is particularly suited to geoscience, where relationships between multiple variables differ with locations (times) and/or scales (frequencies) because of the various processes involved. However, it is well-known that bivariate relationships can be misleading when both variables are dependent on other variables. Partial wavelet coherency (PWC) has been proposed to detect scale-specific and localized bivariate relationships by excluding the effects of other variables but is limited to one excluding variable and provides no phase information. We aim to develop a new PWC method that can deal with multiple excluding variables and provide phase information. Both stationary and non-stationary artificial datasets with the response variable being the sum of five cosine waves at 256 locations are used to test the method. The new method was also applied to a free water evaporation dataset. Our results verified the advantages of the new method in capturing phase information and dealing with multiple excluding variables. Where there is one excluding variable, the new PWC implementation produces higher and more accurate PWC values than the previously published PWC implementation that mistakenly considered bivariate real coherence rather than bivariate complex coherence. We suggest the PWC method is used to untangle scale-specific and localized bivariate relationships after removing the effects of other variables in geosciences.

AB The LOMOS-mini is a new experimental system monitoring transient water and heat fluxes in the hyporheic zone at a sub-daily resolution. Given the coupling of high-frequency hydraulic head gradient and temperature measurements, its innovation when compared to currently available monitoring systems is to operate under transient conditions and to allow the quantification of coupled water and heat exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution, such as the rainfall event time scale. The LOMOS-mini is low-cost, easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy of several months in the field. Its robust implementation protocol makes it suitable for a wide variety of geological environments, from soft loamy, sandy, clayey streambeds to compact colluvial environments. Hydraulic head gradients are measured using the pressure sensor technology presented in Greswell et al. (2009). The sensibility of pressure estimates to ambient temperature is demonstrated; the measurement error is evaluated to decrease by up to one order of magnitude when accounting for temperature in the calibration relationship. Coupled with a physically-based hydrothermal model, the LOMOS-mini provides transient estimates of vertically distributed Darcy fluxes, conductive and advective heat fluxes. The methodology is illustrated on a colluvial streambed case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI STEADY GROUNDWATER-FLOW AS A DYNAMICAL SYSTEM
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Dynamical systems describe the time evolution of moving spatial points under the influence of a smooth, bounded vector field. The theory of these systems is focused on the global properties of their flow paths, not on their integration, and so gives general, qualitative information that does not depend on the details of the spatial variability of the vector field. This approach was applied to describe the global consequences of the Darcy law for steady groundwater flows in isotropic, heterogeneous aquifers. No particular model of the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity (K) was assumed. Vorticity in the flow paths was shown to exist wherever isoconductivity and equipotential surfaces intersect transversely, and the importance of the Lamb vector (the vector product of vorticity and specific discharge) for the geometry of flow paths was established. Because steady groundwater flows governed by the Darcy law have zero helicity, they cannot exhibit tangled vorticity lines or become chaotic. The absence of chaos is related closely to the impossibility of closed flow paths, the asymptotic stability of isolated minima of the hydraulic head (H), and the existence of a function H(K, H) on whose level surfaces all flow paths are confined. This last function also permits groundwater flows to be represented by moving points in the K, H plane, with motion there generated by a form of Hamilton's equations. The results obtained are not related to any stochastic approach to aquifer spatial variability, but instead may be applied to constrain stochastic models on purely dynamical grounds.

AB Current modeling approaches in hydrology often rely on either physics-based or data-science methods, including Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. While physics-based models tend to have rigid structures resulting in unrealistic parameter values in certain instances, ML algorithms establish the input-output relationship while ignoring the constraints imposed by well-known physical processes. While there is a notion that the physics-based model enables better process understanding and ML algorithms exhibit better predictive skills, scientific knowledge that does not add to predictive ability may be deceptive. Hence, there is a need for a hybrid modeling approach to couple ML algorithms and physics-based models in a synergistic manner. Here we develop the Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) model that combines the process understanding of conceptual hydrological model with predictive abilities of state-of-the-art ML models. We apply the proposed model to predict the monthly time series of the target (streamflow) and intermediate variables (actual evapotranspiration) in ten different subcatchments in peninsular India. Our results show the capability of the PIML model to outperform a purely conceptual model (abcd model) and ML algorithms while ensuring the physical consistency in outputs validated through water balance analysis. The systematic approach for combining conceptual model structure with ML algorithms could be used to improve the predictive accuracy of crucial hydrological processes important for flood risk assessment.

AB Water quality is an important factor that affects aquaculture. Water quality parameters have the characteristics of a time series, and display instability and nonlinearity, and are coupled by complex relationships. Therefore, accurate prediction of water quality parameters is challenging. This paper constructs a water quality parameter prediction model combining the Discrete Hidden Markov model (DHMM) and K-means clustering methods.The model was used to predict the dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity of six marine ranches in the Bohai Rim. Based on the analysis of the correlations between the water quality parameters, the hidden state of the DHMM that affects the target water quality parameters is determined, and the adaptability of the model has been improved. The number of hidden states is determined by K-means clustering, and a water quality parameter prediction model based on DHMM is established to realize the prediction of dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity. The model is of low complexity and has strong explanatory power. Experimental results show that compared with other water quality parameter prediction algorithms,under the same conditions, there are fewer training parameters proposed in the article in regard to the water quality parameter prediction method, and better prediction performance is shown. The results of this study can provide references for predicting water quality parameters of marine pastures and sustainable management of aquaculture ecosystems.

AB To estimate flood quantiles and other statistics at ungauged sites, many organizations employ an iterative generalized least squares (GLS) regression procedure to estimate the parameters of a model of the statistic of interest as a function of basin characteristics. The GLS regression procedure accounts for differences in available record lengths and spatial correlation in concurrent events by using an estimator of the sampling covariance matrix of available flood quantiles. Previous studies by the US Geological Survey using the LP3 distribution have neglected the impact of uncertainty in the weighted skew on quantile precision. The needed relationship is developed here and its use is illustrated in a regional flood study with 162 sites from South Carolina. The performance of a pooled regression model is compared to separate models for each hydrologic region: statistical tests recommend an interesting hybrid of the two which is both surprising and hydrologically reasonable. The statistical analysis is augmented with new diagnostic metrics including a condition number to check for multicollinearity, a new pseudo-(R) over bar (2) appropriate for use with GLS regression, and two error variance ratios. GLS regression for the standard deviation demonstrates that again a hybrid model is attractive, and that GLS rather than an OLS or WLS analysis is appropriate for the development of regional, standard deviation models.

AB The StreamPro Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) is a favorite solution for making discharge measurements of medium and small streams in practical situations. This paper investigates the implementation of a rigorous uncertainty analysis protocol to measurements conducted with StreamPro ADCP operated with the stationary method (a.k.a. section-by-section). The assessment of individual uncertainty components is based on the best available information and the results of customized experiments. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) estimating StreamPro ADCP discharge measurement uncertainty by a rigorous, standardized approach; and (b) the assessment of some uncertainty sources in the functional relationship of the discharge measurement process. Uncertainties were estimated through a practical end-to-end approach, whereby the effect of the targeted uncertainty was isolated and subsequently estimated based on direct measurements, rather than analytically deriving them via uncertainty propagation equations. The implementation example illustrates that the standardized uncertainty analysis framework can be successfully applied for hydrometric measurements. Elements and framework of the uncertainty analysis presented in this paper can be applied to other instruments that estimate stream discharge using a section-by-section method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyze the subsidence affecting the Vega Media of the Segura River Basin, using a Persistent Scatterers Interferometry technique (PSI) named Stable Point Network (SPN). This technique is capable of estimating mean deformation velocity maps of the ground surface and displacement time series from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. A dataset acquired between January 2004 and December 2008 from ERS-2 and ENVISAT sensors has been processed measuring maximum subsidence and uplift rates of -25.6 and 7.54 mm/year respectively for the whole area. These data have been validated against ground subsidence measurements and compared with subsidence triggering and conditioning factors by means of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The spatial analysis shows a good relationship between subsidence and piezometric level evolution, pumping wells location, river distance, geology, the Arab wall, previously proposed subsidence predictive model and soil thickness. As a consequence, the paper shows the usefulness and the potential of combining Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) and spatial analysis techniques in order to improve the knowledge of this kind of phenomenon.

AB In various hydrological processes, surface soil moisture is very sensitive to the surface roughness. The surface roughness effect has been incorporated into the calculation of surface reflectivity by modifying the Fresnel reflectivity. The objective of this study is to estimate the small-scale roughness based on the difference of polarization between the rough and specular reflectivities over land at microwave frequencies. A unique approach is presented to estimate the small-scale roughness from the surface reflectivity with the microwave satellite observation. Using an approximate relationship between vertically and horizontally-polarized reflectivities, and rough reflectivity based on the radiative transfer equation and satellite observation, the small-scale roughness is retrieved globally over land surfaces. A realistic forward model to simulate the rough reflectivity is considered for the sensitivity test. Consequently, the small-scale roughness is retrieved within the reasonable range of previous works. This research proposes a unique technique to understand and estimate the roughness parameter over land surface by using the polarization characteristics at microwave frequencies; this research provides information that is extremely relevant to hydrological studies, especially for the global soil moisture retrieval in the SMOS, SMAP, and GPM missions.

AB Urban pluvial flood are attracting growing public concern due to rising intense precipitation and increasing consequences. Accurate risk assessment is critical to an efficient urban pluvial flood management, particularly in transportation sector. This paper describes an integrated methodology, which initially makes use of high resolution 2D inundation modeling and flood depth-dependent measure to evaluate the potential impact and risk of pluvial flash flood on road network in the city center of Shanghai, China. Intensity-Duration-Frequency relationships of Shanghai rainstorm and Chicago Design Storm are combined to generate ensemble rainfall scenarios. A hydrodynamic model (FloodMap-HydroInundation2D) is used to simulate overland flow and flood inundation for each scenario. Furthermore, road impact and risk assessment are respectively conducted by a new proposed algorithm and proxy. Results suggest that the flood response is a function of spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and local characteristics (i.e. drainage and topography), and pluvial flash flood is found to lead to proportionate but nonlinear impact on intra-urban road inundation risk. The approach tested here would provide more detailed flood information for smart management of urban street network and may be applied to other big cities where road flood risk is evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

AB We used a 54-year (1950-2003) ice scar chronology constructed from damaged trees to investigate relationships between large scale hydro-climatic conditions and mechanical breakup magnitude in the Necopastic River watershed (James Bay, northern Quebec). Our objectives were: (1) to identify hydrologic and climatic variables that explain variations in mechanical breakup magnitude at the watershed scale, (2) to organize these variables in terms of importance and (3) to construct a predictive model for ice-floods in the Necopastic watershed. We used parametric correlation analysis to measure the degree of linear association between variables and classification trees (CT) coupled with a cross-validation approach to construct the predictive model and to organize variables according to their importance. In the Necopastic watershed, the type and magnitude of breakups are determined by an interaction between forces that maintain the ice cover in place and forces that tend to dislodge it. In contrast with lakes, early and rapidly rising floods, rather than abnormally high flood discharge, create conditions that favour intense mechanical breakups. Moreover, cold and snowy spring conditions during high positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices delay the thermal degradation of the ice cover and preserve its mechanical properties over longer time periods.

AB The fate of the contaminant transport process within wetland flows considering contaminant depletion via a floating vegetation island (FVI) is the focus of this work. To identify the feature of contaminant cloud expansion under an FVI, multiscale theory is extended to obtain a two-dimensional spatial concentration distribution analytical solution. The characteristics of two-dimensional concentration distributions under upper FVI absorption and damping factor within wetland flows are illustrated. The performance of the contaminant depletion process via an FVI is also examined in this work, with discussions on removal efficiency, the absorption ratio, and the nonuniformity of contaminant mass. As FVI removal intensity changes along the stream direction, the analytical solution of removal efficiency is obtained to illustrate the longitudinal variation in the FVI removal intensity. Furthermore, the effects of removal intensity and damping factor on FVI removal efficiency are expressed separately. In addition, the removal intensity variance in the vertical direction is discussed using the defined absorption ratio. Moreover, as residual mass is a fatal issue in the contaminant removal process, temporal residual mass is discussed, and the residual mass proportion within different layers is depicted. Finally, the difference of the mass proportion between layers is employed to explain the transformation of the contaminant cloud.

AB Problems with water resources restrict the sustainable development of a city with water shortages. Based on system dynamics (SD) theory, a model of sustainable utilization of water resources using the STELLA software has been established. This model consists of four subsystems: population system, economic system, water supply system and water demand system. The boundaries of the four subsystems are vague, but they are closely related and interdependent. The model is applied to Zhengzhou City, China, which has a serious water shortage. The difference between the water supply and demand is very prominent in Zhengzhou City. The model was verified with data from 2009 to 2013. The results show that water demand of Zhengzhou City will reach 2.57 billion m(3) in 2020. A water resources optimization model is developed based on interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming. The objective of the model is to allocate water resources to each water sector and make the lowest cost under the minimum water demand. Using the simulation results, decision makers can easily weigh the costs of the system, the water allocation objectives, and the system risk. The hybrid system dynamics method and optimization model is a rational try to support water resources management in many cities, particularly for cities with potential water shortage and it is solidly supported with previous studies and collected data.

AB Decision-support tools (DSTs) are a type of innovation that can facilitate science-based decision-making, including nonpoint source pollution management in agricultural watersheds. However, organizational readiness for adopting innovations is a topic that has received limited attention in the literature. With the goal of filling this knowledge gap, we draw upon the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory and literature around use of science by agency staff to assess United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Services' (USDANRCS) readiness towards using the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) - a type of DST. To that end, we conducted 23 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 27 NRCS staff holding leadership positions to explore how they perceive and use the ACPF, and their perceptions of organizational and structural elements that could enable or hinder NRCS' readiness to adopt the ACPF. Results suggest that NRCS' readiness was an outcome of both organizational- and individual-level factors. Factors such as perceived scientific credibility and the influential role of leaders positively influenced NRCS' readiness; however, factors such as low levels of ACPF knowledge and perceived complexity negatively influenced NRCS' readiness. Overall, our findings suggest that NRCS is in the initial stages of getting ready to adopt the ACPF, and that there is a need for the agency to pilot ACPF in different watersheds and measure social and bio-physical outcomes.

AB Clearly, water conservancy projects are advantageous for human beings; however, they significantly change the streamflow variability of rivers. This change is a result of the complex and non-linear interactions between natural processes and human activities. Thus far, our understanding of these interactions is still inadequate. In this study, these interactions were evaluated for a large river basin (i.e. the Pearl River basin) with numerous reservoirs to identify reservoir operation scenarios for mitigating drought and flood impacts. To this end, first, the flow variability pattern was derived based on the concept of the admissible range of flow variability. Second, the moving average over shifting horizon method was used to evaluate the effects of the reservoirs on the streamflow variability. Finally, the network theory and data mining technology were applied to establish the streamflow relations between the upstream and downstream reservoirs. The results show that the cascade reservoirs reshape the streamflow variability patterns of the Pearl River in time and space and have a cumulative effect on the downstream runoff. The constructed networks and the identified operation scenarios present that this effect is mainly influenced by the upstream critical reservoirs having different inflows and storage capacities. This suggests the varied roles of the reservoirs for drought mitigation and flood control limiting the formulation and application of integrated operating strategies for the multi-reservoir system.

AB In this work, an empirical mathematical model representing the relationship between global temperature, forest cover and seasonal rainfalls is constructed and validated using global temperature data for the years 1973-2010, Northern Thailand's forest area data for 1973-2008, and seasonal rainfall data for 1973-2011. The coefficient correlations of the model and the corresponding data are 0.8902, 0.9739 and 0.9751 respectively. Although there are some approximations and assumptions made throughout the analyses, statistical tests confirm that the proposed model can be used to predict the amount of rainfalls in the region. A case study on how government reforestation policy affects seasonal rainfalls is analyzed using the model modified to a solvable form. Three possible scenarios are created to predict possible outcomes of said policy. The results obtained show that under all scenarios, rainfalls increase in all seasons. Moreover, forest cover increase leads to more rainfall in the summer yet results in less rainfall in the other two seasons. The model can be modified and applied to predict rainfalls in other regions with similar topography and the climate after some statistical tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In aquatic ecosystems, particularly rivers, hydrology plays a key role in structuring and maintaining habitats and flow regimes that influence ecological sustainability. Flow regime assessment in Taiwan has been facilitated recently by the Taiwan Eco-hydrologic Indicator System (TEIS). In this study, the self-organizing feature map (SOM) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network are combined to produce a self-organizing radial basis network (SORBN) that takes the advantages of both methods for strengthening the power of presentation and reliability of estimation. The SORBN is proposed to estimate the diversity of fish communities based on the TEIS and historic fish community composition at 36 locations in Taiwan. The discharge data are available for a minimum of 20 years. Data analysis applying a moving average method to the TEIS statistics is used to reflect the effects of antecedent flow conditions on fish diversity. Results indicate the hybrid SORBN not only effectively categorizes stream flow data but also reasonably identifies relationships between flow regime and fish community diversity. Results are encouraging so that it is possible to better relate flow and ecosystem conditions, and the proposed method can be used to quantify how flow influences river ecosystems.

AB Wavelet coherence is a method that is commonly used in hydrology to extract scale-dependent, nonstationary relationships between time series. However, we show that the method cannot always determine why the time-domain correlation between two time series changes in time. We show that, even for stationary coherence, the time-domain correlation between two time series weakens if at least one of the time series has changing skewness. To overcome this drawback, a nonlinear coherence method is proposed to quantify the cross-correlation between nonlinear modes embedded in the time series. It is shown that nonlinear coherence and auto-bicoherence spectra can provide additional insight into changing time-domain correlations. The new method is applied to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and allIndia rainfall (AIR), which is intricately linked to hydrological processes across the Indian subcontinent. The nonlinear coherence analysis showed that the skewness of AIR is weakly correlated with that of two ENSO time series after the 1970s, indicating that increases in ENSO skewness after the 1970s at least partially contributed to the weakening ENSO-AIR relationship in recent decades. The implication of this result is that the intensity of skewed El Nino events is likely to overestimate India's drought severity, which was the case in the 1997 monsoon season, a time point when the nonlinear wavelet coherence between AIR and ENSO reached its lowest value in the 1871-2016 period. We determined that the association between the weakening ENSO-AIR relationship and ENSO nonlinearity could reflect the contribution of different nonlinear ENSO modes to ENSO diversity.

AB Pollutant first flush (FF) is a critical phenomenon in urban regions driven by multiple factors. Therefore, having a robust mathematical FF definition and modeling tool along with thorough knowledge of its main influencing variables, is essential. Machine-learning techniques have been widely exploited in the water-quality field; however , their use to predict FF occurrence and pollutant load is limited. This study developed a generic machine-learning framework based on the two most commonly adopted FF definitions (30/80 and M(V) curve) and implemented for three of the most detected pollutants in urban areas (TSS, TN, and TP). This framework is able to accurately predict if a rainfall event generates FF and, in case it does, the correspondent pollutant load ("very good" model performance). It can also quantify and rank the most influencing factors using a non-model-biased method based on game theory (Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)), showing that the rainfall variables are the most significant predictors of sediment and nutrient FF occurrence in urban regions. The findings proved that the machine-learning framework developed in this study can be a valuable modeling tool for improving the accuracy and reliability of pollutant load prediction during FF events in urban areas. Furthermore, they represent one of the first steps towards a robust mathematical FF definition, which is still a topic under debate.

AB An analytical investigation is here presented for dynamic analysis of a half-space containing saturated porous transversely isotropic material under surface tractions. The solid displacement-pore fluid pressure formulation of Biot's theory known as u-p formulation is accepted as the governing equations for the whole half-space, which is the domain of the problem. The free surface of the half-space is considered completely permeable. Two scalar potential functions are for the first time introduced to uncouple the governing system of partial differential equations. The potential functions are introduced in such a way that the governing operators for the potential functions to be physically meaningful. By applying Fourier and Hankel integral transforms, the potential functions are determined by solving two ordinary differential equations. Then, the displacements, stresses and pore fluid pressure are presented as the solutions for the boundary value problem involved in this paper in terms of some line integrals that are evaluated numerically. These responses are derived for general patch load, and presented for horizontal and vertical circular loads, vertical ring load and vertical point load as well as special cases. In addition, the degeneration of the proposed solution to thermoelastodynamics is shown. Selected numerical results for a half-space subjected to uniform horizontal load applied on a circular disc are illustrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since Professor Paul G. Jarvis proposed a scheme in 1976 that relates stomatal conductance with environmental variables, there have been numerous studies exploring the relationships for estimating transpiration (E-c). Vapor pressure deficit (D) and solar radiation (R) are dominant environmental factors influencing E-c, whilst air temperature (T) is deemed important but often neglected in model applications since D and T are exponentially correlated. Thus, it is uncertain whether to construct the Jarvis-type E, models with both T and D included will improve model performance. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that most Jarvis-type models cannot simulate nocturnal sap flow which has been observed across a wide range of species and climates. Therefore, this study was firstly aimed at developing a generalized temperature stress function and testing its role in the Jarvis-type model, and further improving the model by modifying a widely used radiation function for nocturnal sap flow simulations. The results show that inclusion of a T-stress function for hourly sap flow simulations can avoid overestimation of daily peaks, and the modified Jarvis-type model was able to capture the nocturnal sap flow. These improvements revive the model for ecohydrological applications in a future climate where enhanced temperature effects and increasing nocturnal transpiration resulting from rising nighttime vapor pressure deficits are likely.

AB In order to resolve contradictions in addressing a soil moisture-precipitation feedback mechanism over West Africa and to clarify the impact of antecedent soil moisture on subsequent rainfall evolution, we first validated various data sets (SMOS satellite soil moisture observations, NOAH land surface model, TRMM rainfall, CMORPH rainfall and HadGEM climate models) with the Analyses Multidisciplinaires de la Mousson Africaine (AMMA) field campaign data. Based on this analysis, it was suggested that biases of data sets might cause contradictions in studying mechanisms. Thus, by taking into account uncertainties in data, it was found that the approach of consecutive dry days (i.e. a relative comparison of time-series) showed consistency across various data sets, while the direct comparison approach for soil moisture state and rainfall did not. Thus, it was discussed that it may be difficult to directly relate rain with soil moisture as the absolute value, however, it may be reasonable to compare a temporal progress of the variables. Based upon the results consistently showing a positive relationship between the consecutive dry days and rainfall, this study supports a negative feedback often neglected by climate model structure. This approach is less sensitive to interpretation errors arising from systematic errors in data sets, as this measures a temporal gradient of soil moisture state. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The spatial distribution of climatological variables such as rainfall and temperature is needed whenever hydrological modelling is undertaken at the watershed scale. These models can be used to simulate hydrological processes at a daily or hourly time step and the interpolation of climatological variables (in particular precipitation) at this time scale poses a particular problem due to its large spatial variation. This work analyzes the temporal variation of both minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall, its correlation with elevation and whether or not this relationship should be used when daily data are interpolated. In order to achieve this, the monthly distribution of these variables is derived from daily interpolations, which is compared to their monthly accumulated value for each climatological station. The interpolation methods used to undertake the analysis were Ordinary Kriging (OK), Kriging with External Drift (KED), Block Kriging with External Drift (BKED), Ordinary Kriging in a local neighborhood (OKl) and Kriging with External Drift in a local neighborhood (KEDl). This analysis used daily climatological data from approximately 200 stations located in the Basin of Mexico for June 1978 and June 1985, from which accumulated monthly data were derived. The results of this analysis show that the interpolation of daily events is improved by the use of elevation as a secondary variable even when these variables show a low correlation.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB In this paper, effective reservoir inflow forecasting models based on the support vector machine (SVM), which is a novel kind of neural networks (NNs). are proposed. Based on statistical learning theory, the SVMs have three advantages over back-propagation networks (BPNs), which are the most frequently used convectional NNs. Firstly, SVMs have better generalization ability. Secondly, the architectures and the weights of the SVMs are guaranteed to be unique and globally optimal. Finally, SVMs are trained much more rapidly. An application is conducted to clearly demonstrate these three advantages. The results indicate that the proposed SVM-based models are more well-performed, robust and efficient than the existing BPN-based models. In addition to using SVMs instead of BPNs, typhoon characteristics, which are seldom regarded as key input for inflow forecasting, are added to the proposed models to further improve the long lead-time forecasting during typhoon-warning periods. A comparison between models with and without typhoon characteristics is also presented to confirm that the addition of typhoon characteristics significantly improves the forecasting performance for long lead-time forecasting. In conclusion, the typhoon characteristics should be used as input to the reservoir inflow forecasting. The proposed SVM-based models are recommended as an alternative to the existing models because of their accuracy, robustness and efficiency. The proposed modeling technique is expected to be useful to improve the reservoir inflow forecasting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As part of the C111 spreader canal project, structural and operational modifications involving incremental raises in canal stage are planned along one of the major canals (i.e., C111) separating Everglades National Park and agricultural production areas to the east of the park. This study used Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) as an alternative tool to physically based models to explore the relationship between different hydrologic variables and the effect of proposed changes in surface water management on soil and bedrock water contents in south Florida. To achieve the goal, objectives were to: (1) use DFA to identify the most important factors affecting temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents, (2) develop a simplified DFA based regression model for predicting soil and bedrock water contents as a function of canal stage and (3) assess the effect of the proposed incremental raises in canal stage on soil and bedrock water contents. DFA revealed that five common trends were the minimum required to describe unexplained variation in the 11 time series studied. Introducing canal stage, water table evaporation and net recharge resulted in lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) and higher Nash-Sutcliffe (C-eff) values. Results indicated that canal stage significantly (t>2) drives temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents, which was represented as scaled frequency while net surface recharge was significant in seven out of the 11 time series analyzed. The effect of water table evaporation was not significant at all sites. Results also indicated that the most important factor influencing temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents in terms of regression coefficient magnitude was canal stage. Based on DFA results, a simple regression model was developed to predict soil and bedrock water contents at various elevations as a function of canal stage and net recharge. The performance of the simple model ranged from good (C-eff ranging from 0.56 to 0.74) to poor (C-eff ranging from 0.10 to 0.15), performance was better at sites with smaller depths to water table (<1 m) highlighting the effect of micro-topography on soil and bedrock water content dynamics. Assessment of the effect of 6, 9 and 12 cm increases in canal stage using the simple regression model indicated that changes in temporal variation in soil and bedrock water contents were negligible (average < 1.0% average change) at 500-2000 m from C111 (or low elevations) which may be attributed to the near saturation conditions already occurring at these sites. This study used DFA to explore the relationship between soil and bedrock water dynamics and surface water stage in shallow water table environments. This approach can be applied to any system in which detailed physical modeling would be limited by inadequate information on parameters or processes governing the physical system.

TI Flood depth-damage and fragility functions derived with structured

ID PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Depth-damage relationships of residential typologies have an important bearing on the reliability of flood risk assessments. Yet, the information for creating adequate functions is frequently missing in places where they are needed the most: developing countries where floods inflict severe losses. To overcome the lack of site-specific functions, modelers usually adopt functions from foreign typologies, extrapolate from limited flood damage data, and conduct expert-elicitation surveys. The latter, although not exempt from challenges, are a helpful resource in situations in which there are sufficient experts available. The classical model is a structured expert judgment technique which is one of the most used because it minimizes the number of subjective elements in the ranking of experts' experience and its results can be compared with similar studies. This paper presents depth-damage and fragility functions developed with the classical model conducted with experts with extensive knowledge in the flood damage mechanism of typologies in northeast Argentina-a region under a severe flood hazard. The depth-damage functions were partially validated with damage data and exhibited good agreement, also they are consistent with the fragility functions. Hence, these functions can be helpful for probabilistic flood risk assessments, provided that the underlying assumptions are deemed acceptable.

AB In this paper, a unified method has been proposed for the percentage shear force carried by floodplains using fewer non-dimensional parameters such as the floodplain's percentage area, the ratio of Manning's roughness and the depth ratio. This new data-driven dynamic model for percentage shear force is obtained using a genetic algorithm (GA) program, a well-documented machine-learning software, which can examine the existing rela-tionship among the variables and explore the influencing factors. GA facilitated a unified relationship between apparent shear force and the chosen parameters. The new proposed model is simple and accurate compared to the previous models, which were either complex or distinct for different configurations. The efficiency of the new model shows that the most predicted test case results are under the 5% error cap. The cohesive expression derived for smooth and roughened compound channels is the most significant advantage of the GA-based data -driven model, providing a simple and easy-use formula for engineers to apply for broad applications. Compared with the other available approaches, the model proposed provides the most accurate discharge prediction for various unique datasets.

AB Electrical conductivity can be used as a surrogate to study the spatial and temporal variabilities of a number of soil properties, e.g., porosity, salinity, clay content and soil moisture. In this study, we develop a general form of Archie's model that describes the relationship between soil electrical conductivity (sigma) and volumetric water content (theta). The input parameters include theta, sigma values at dry and saturated conditions (sigma(dry) and sigma(sat)), soil porosity (phi) and sand, silt and clay contents. A value of 2 was given to the water phase exponent (w) based on model calibration with sigma and theta datasets obtained from 15 soils. The general form of Archie's model was evaluated by comparing soil sigma estimates to measured sigma values from an additional 6 soils. The new model performed well by providing estimates with root mean square errors in the range of 0.008-0.399 dS m(-1) and relative errors ranging from 0.7% to 29.8%. The new model is simple, easy to use and ready for further evaluation on a wide range of soil conditions.

AB Correlations describing the rate of interface mass transfer from single-component nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pools in saturated subsurface formations are developed. A three-dimensional contaminant transport model is employed to obtain overall mass transfer coefficients computed from concentration gradients at the NAPL-water interface. The model assumes that the porous medium is homogeneous, the interstitial fluid velocity is steady, and the dissolved solute may sorb under local equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, it is assumed that the dissolved concentration along the NAPL-water interface is equal to the solubility concentration. Power law correlations relate the overall Sherwood number to the appropriate overall Peclet numbers. Both rectangular and elliptic/circular source geometries are considered. The proposed relationships are fitted to numerically determined mass transfer coefficients, and the correlation coefficients are determined by nonlinear least squares regression. Good agreement between predicted and available experimentally determined overall mass transfer coefficients is observed.

AB For hydraulic fractured well, how to evaluate the properties of fracture and formation are always tough jobs and it is very complex to use the conventional method to do that, especially for partially penetrating fractured well. Although the source function is a very powerful tool to analyze the transient pressure for complex structure well, the corresponding reports on gas reservoir are rare. In this paper, the continuous point source functions in anisotropic reservoirs are derived on the basis of source function theory, Laplace transform method and Duhamel principle. Application of construction method, the continuous point source functions in bi-zonal gas reservoir with closed upper and lower boundaries are obtained. Sequentially, the physical models and transient pressure solutions are developed for fully and partially penetrating fractured vertical wells in this reservoir. Type curves of dimensionless pseudo-pressure and its derivative as function of dimensionless time are plotted as well by numerical inversion algorithm, and the flow periods and sensitive factors are also analyzed. The source functions and solutions of fractured well have both theoretical and practical application in well test interpretation for such gas reservoirs, especial for the well with stimulated reservoir volume around the well in unconventional gas reservoir by massive hydraulic fracturing which always can be described with the composite model.

AB This paper presents an investigation on the effect of dam operation on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) performance in a distributed hydrological model based on kinematic wave theory. For this purpose, two flood events in a mountainous catchment in Japan are selected, and the model error parameters for the EnKF implementation are first determined through a series of experiments by varying the input error magnitude, state variable perturbation, and its correlation length. Then, through the assimilation of dam outflow observations, it is shown that special treatment of such measurements is critical in ensuring the success of the filter when flood control operation significantly changes the flow hydrograph and when the covariances between distant grids are high. Localization methods based on Euclidean distance, flow accumulation values, and river distance are all able to limit the deleterious updates to model states at distant grids and improve filter efficacy. However, no single localization approach is found to be consistently optimal for varying noise configurations, number (and type) of assimilated stations, or flood events. Separate localization of dam outflows from streamflow measurements by assuming the dam grids to be only related to their downstream grids shows potential in improving prediction at locations near the dams themselves while minimizing disruptions at long distances.

AB In this paper, the numerical simulation based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and experimental studies are conducted to investigate the permeability of porous media with sphere packing. The accuracy of LBM is verified through the comparison of theoretical solutions and the numerical result of flat channel flows. The resolution and the size of representative element volume used for simulation are evaluated. Then, the effects of porosity and particle size on the permeability of porous media are studied through the combination of LBM and discrete element method, and the factors that affect the fluid flow in porous media are explored. It is found that there are very high linear correlations between n(3)/(1 -n)(2) and permeability. Meanwhile, the relationship between the particle size, d, and permeability is also established. The physical constant, C-k, is found closely related to the porosity, n, based on which, the modification of the Kozeny-Carman (K-C) equation is proposed. After that, the constant head test is conducted for the glass beads with different porosity and particle size distribution, and the proposed equation is validated. The experimental results show that the modified K-C equation presents a higher accuracy than the classical K-C equation for the porous media from sphere packing.

AB Most of the world's lakes are fed through water conveyance, namely, lakes that continuously receive and discharge water. However, the complex hydrological processes of such lakes make it difficult to determine their specific biogeochemical carbon (C) cycles. Poyang Lake was selected for this study, whose capacity to receive and discharge through water conveyance is the largest in China. We used both main and trace elements in the lake as stable isotopes of surface water and its tributaries to trace C sources and to reveal the C-water coupling relationship. Poyang Lake has a high river-lake connectivity, and results show that it undergoes rapid water renewal. The effect of this is that a large amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) cannot be converted and deposited into sediment, resulting in an annual DIC input and output of 1.3 x 10(9) kg year(-1). The main DIC sources in Poyang Lake are atmospheric deposition (27%), carbonate weathering (27%) and silicate weathering (26%). Furthermore, the coupling characteristics of C and water in the Poyang Lake Basin change continuously under such conditions. Results from this study provide a reference for the investigation of such water conveyance-type lakes and the coupling effects associated with C and water.

DE Flood forecasting; River confluences; Real-time; Lateral inflow;

ID DISCHARGE; STAGE
AB Accurate forecast stages at river sections is of paramount importance to properly address Flood Forecasting and Warning Systems (FFWSs) operating in real-time. The forecast values can be provided by flood wave routing models to be implemented when gauged sections are operative along the channel. Different models have been proposed in the literature and the forecast can be approached by neglecting or involving the contribution of lateral inflows. Among the latter, recently STAFOM-RCM (STAge FOrecasting Model-Rating Curve Model) has been proposed assuming a lateral contribution uniformly distributed along the reach. Therefore, the model application is not suitable for future stage prediction at hydrometric sections located just downstream river confluences. To overcome this issue, we propose a methodology that exploits the probabilistic forecast estimated at a gauged site on a tributary through a Bayesian approach and the probabilistic relationship between the stages recorded here and the ones at a downstream site located along the main channel, where the forecasted stage estimate is of interest.
   The Paglia River basin, in central Italy, is selected as case study. The results indicate that the procedure can be useful to address real-time hydraulic risk management even at river sections located downstream important confluences, provided that gauged sites are operative along the tributary.

AB This study has carried out an assessment of Phien generalised storage yield probability (S-Y-P) models using recorded runoff data of six global rivers that were carefully selected such that they satisfy the criteria specified for the models. Using stochastic hydrology, 2000 replicates of the historic records were generated and used to drive the sequent peak algorithm (SPA) for estimating capacity of hypothetical reservoirs at the respective sites. The resulting ensembles of reservoir capacity estimates were then analysed to determine the mean, standard deviation and quantiles, which were then compared with corresponding estimates produced by the Phien models. The results showed that Phien models produced a mix of significant under- and over-predictions of the mean and standard deviation of capacity, with the under-prediction situations occurring as the level of development reduces. On the other hand, consistent over-prediction was obtained for full regulation for all the rivers analysed. The biases in the reservoir capacity quantiles were equally high, implying that the limitations of the Phien models affect the entire distribution function of reservoir capacity. Due to very high values of these errors, it is recommended that the Phien relationships should be avoided for reservoir planning. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A pluviometrical data analysis was carried out for 292 Italian weather stations in order to identify an index able to classify the climatic aggressiveness with respect to some instability phenomena (quick flows, soil erosion and shallow landslides). Several climatic variables were calculated such as the average annual rainfall, the two-year return time maximum rainfall amount for 6-, 24-h, 1-, 5-day and monthly durations, the occurrence probabilities of potentially erosive phenomena, Canuti's precipitation coefficient relative to landslide triggering and the Fournier index calculated either in the original form or with the modification proposed by Arnoldus. The latter was elaborated from the mean monthly rainfalls over the whole observation period (MFI) and as average of the individual indices calculated from the monthly dataset of each year (MFIavg). The study of the relationships among the analyzed quantities outlined the high versatility of Fournier index, particularly the modified form, which appeared closely related to all the investigated variables; therefore it may be used as a suitable synthetic way to describe different features of the pluviometric regime of a given location. A classification framework based on two threshold values of MFIavg and of the corresponding MFI is also proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater contaminant plumes often display a curvilinear anisotropy which conventional kriging and geostatistical simulation approaches generally fail to reproduce. In this paper, we use a physically relevant coordinate transformation in order to improve the kriging of contaminant plumes in 2D. The proposed coordinate transformation maps the Cartesian grid into the natural coordinates of flow: the hydraulic head and the stream function. This simplifies the specification of a nonlinear anisotropy by modifying the spatial relationships between grid points. The computation of the natural coordinates, however, requires the availability of a flow model, which often needs to be defined using limited data. For this reason, a data integration procedure is included in the methodology to support the use of the natural coordinate transformation in real cases. The performance of the approach is tested on two synthetic test cases where it produces concentration maps that are more accurate than those obtained with Cartesian coordinates kriging. These test cases also highlight some limitations of the approach. Whereas the transformation enables kriging to account for advection, results show the need to consider dispersion as well. Further work is also required to generalize the approach to 3D cases and to groundwater flow including wells and sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the results of Lettau's evapoclimatonomy model at daily time scales as applied to the Central East and Southern supersites of the HAPEX-Sahel region in Niger, West Africa. A revised version of the evapoclimatonomy model has been applied to the millet and bush fallow (Guiera senegalensis) fields at both supersites during the intensive observation period (IOP; 20 August-12 October, 1992), using daily means of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the HAPEX-Sahel observations, as well as vegetation and soil parameters for the region. Soil moisture and immediate and delayed evapotranspiration and runoff are predicted, It has been found that the model predicts the soil moisture at the Central Eastern supersite quite well. However, it overestimates soil moisture at the Southern supersite even though its variability is captured by the model, Model results also indicate that soil moisture estimates are very sensitive to the NDVI-evaporivity relationship, which is robust at monthly scales but needs more revision for application at the daily scale. Overall the model performance when applied to the IOP observations is sufficiently good to indicate the suitability of the climatonomy for water balance studies on daily time scales.

AB To determine the processes and factors responsible for the chemical composition of mountainous stream waters, correlations among solute concentrations in streams were examined in 13 forested watersheds from Japan, Jiulianshan (southern China) and Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), which had different soil parent materials and climatic conditions. The Na+ concentration in stream water was significantly correlated with both Cl- and Si concentrations in the regions near the sea (Kagawa and Shibecha), but was correlated with the Si concentration in the regions far from the sea (Mt. Hiei, Takayama, Jiulianshan and Chiang Mai). In some watersheds in Kagawa, the Si concentration was correlated with Cl-, probably reflecting the relatively dry climate conditions. In Kagawa and Mt. Hiei, SO42- concentrations in stream water were inversely correlated with NO3- concentrations, suggesting that nitrification inhibited SO42- discharge, and denitrification and root NO3- uptake enhanced it. The alkalinity was mainly carried by HCO3- and organic acid anions. According to the theory of ion exchange equilibrium, high alkalinity was closely related to divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) more than to Na+. In the streams where concentrations of SO42- and divalent cations were low (Chiang Mai), alkalinity was closely related to Na+ reflecting production by weathering. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Pumping stations (PSs) are common regulation facilities in a water distribution system, with complex hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic parameters. In this study, a data assimilation-based approach was proposed for the correction of PS parameters, in which a 1D hydrodynamic model with PS inner boundary was established, and then the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework was used to correct PS parameters. In EnKF framework, the combination of the PS parameters was considered as the state vector, and water levels and discharge as observation vectors. The 1D hydrodynamic model was taken as the observation operator that constructs the mapping relationship between the state and the observation vector. The method's reliability was demonstrated through the case of Niantou PS in the middle route of South-North Water Transfer Project. Verification results show that the proposed method can accurately inverse PS parameters. Compared with the simulation results using PS parameters based on physical model experiments, the PS parameters corrected by the data assimilation method can greatly improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic simulation. This data assimilation-based method can be used for parameter inversion of other complex hydraulic structures.

AB The presented paper describes spatial and temporal variations in extended stable isotope datasets of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in the Sava River water that were used to estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of stream water using an exponential flow model. The re-examining MRT was < 2 years in the Slovenian part of the Sava River and was in a good agreement with previous estimates and with the MRT estimated in the Sava River at Ostrulnica near Belgrade, Serbia. A MRT > 2.2 years was observed in the Danube River at Vina also near Belgrade. The spatial distribution of delta O-18 in precipitation over the Sava River Basin (SRB) was mapped based on the long-term weighted mean annual delta O-18 values and established relationship with various geographical controls (latitude, longitude and altitude). The modelled delta O-18 values in precipitation agree with the measured values in the surface river water at different locations indicating that the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation is the dominant factor controlling surface water isotope ratios over the SRB.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of filtration through porous media is relevant in many engineering applications ranging from waste water treatment and aquifer contamination in environmental engineering to estimating the permeability reduction in near wellbore region during drilling or water re-injection in petroleum engineering. In this paper we present a pore-scale approach that models straining through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from the first principles, enabling the examination of current macroscopic models. While continuum models are widely used for fast prediction of the retention profiles and permeability of the host porous medium, they require a number of phenomenological parameters which are derived from matching experimental results. One of these parameters is the rate of entrapment, which is the sink term in the advection-diffusion equation. Here we find the constitutive relationship for the rate of entrapment as a product of the filtration coefficient, velocity, and concentration and validate it by comparing with core flood experiments. Results show that the pore-scale simulation gives close approximations of filtration coefficient when pore bridging and straining are the main particle capture mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep Submarine Groundwater Discharge (DSGD) is a ubiquitous and highly significant phenomenon, yet it remains poorly understood. This work proposes a simple theoretical basis for steady-state DSGD from a confined aquifer. The simple theory is tested against numerical modeling (FEFLOW) of a case study of DSGD offshore northern Israel (eastern Mediterranean Sea). Modeling further investigates the hydrogeological setting that enables DSGD and the parameters that affect it - conductivity of the confining unit, head on land, seawater salinity and seawater temperature. The main findings are thus: steady-state DSGD eminates far offshore from a confined aquifer exposed by a submarine canyon, even under moderate heads. It is driven by a thermohaline circulation cell that forms around an intrinsic transition zone between salty, cold seawater and fresh, warm terrestrial groundwater. The circulation is driven by tilted isopycnals and consists of seawater entering the confined aquifer at the exposed section offshore, mixing with terrestrial groundwater within the aquifer, and seeping back out to the sea as saline warm water. The circulation mode and the character of the DSGD depend on the conductivity of the confining unit and on the hydraulic head. The seepage velocity is linearly related to the temperature and salinity gradients that develop in the confined aquifer during the thermohaline circulation. These new insights have potentially important implications for coastal hydrology, seawater chemistry, biogeochemistry, and submarine slope instability.

   BEHAVIOR
AB A single fracture is the basic unit of fracture medium, and the roughness of the fracture surface is an important factor influencing hydraulic characteristics of the flow in bedrock fracture. However, effects of the shape and density of roughness elements (various bulges/pits on rough fracture wall surfaces) on water flow in a single fracture have not been thoroughly understood. Thus the water flow in a single fracture with different shapes and densities of roughness elements was simulated by using Fluent software in this study. The results showed that the existence of roughness elements could enhance the flow resistance and cause nonlinear flow. The shape difference of roughness elements, i.e. the value variation of the included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness element and the streamline direction, could change their influence degree on the flow regime. Increasing the density of roughness elements could bring more violent turbulent, reduce the relative aperture of fracture, and decrease the discharge per unit width correspondingly. With the increase of flow velocity, Forchheimer equation could fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient better than Izbash equation. In addition, the variation of flow regime in rough fracture from laminar flow to turbulent flow was a process of the gradual dominance of inertial force.

AB The phenomenon of evaporation affects the distribution of water in the hydrological cycle and plays a key role in agriculture and water resource management. We propose a self-organizing map neural network (SOMN) to assess the variability of daily evaporation based on meteorological variables. The daily meteorological data sets from a climate gauge were collected as inputs to the SOMN and then were classified into a topology map based on their similarities to investigate their multi-collinear relationships to assess their effort in the evaporation. To accurately estimate the daily evaporation based on the input pattern, the weights that connect the clustered centers in a hidden layer with the output were trained by using the least square regression method. In addition, we compared the results with those of back propagation neural network (BPNN), modified Penman and Penman Monteith formulas. The results demonstrated that the topological structures of SOMN could give a meaningful map to present the clusters of meteorological variables and the networks could well estimate the daily evaporation. By comparing the performances of these models in estimating daily and long-term (monthly or yearly) cumulative evaporation, the SOMN provides the best performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Storm water management and other engineering design applications are primarily based on rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves and the existing IDF curves are based on the concept of stationary Extreme Value Theory (EVT). However, during the last few decades, global climate change is intensifying the extreme precipitation events and creating a non-stationary component in the extreme rainfall time series. Subsequently, in recent years, advancements in the EVT helped the researchers to propose a method for developing non-stationary rainfall IDF curve by modelling trend present in the observed extreme rainfall series using covariate. But, is it capable of encompassing future rainfall changes? Towards answering this question, the Hyderabad city, India non-stationary rainfall IDF curves are compared with the IDF curves of two future time periods (2015-2056 and 2057-2098). Using 24 Global Climate Models' (GCMs') simulations and 'K' Nearest Neighbor (KNN) weather generator based downscaling method, the IDF curves are developed for two future time periods and they are compared with covariate based non-stationary rainfall IDF curves of the Hyderabad city. The results of this study indicate that the return of period of an extreme rainfall of the Hyderabad city is reducing. In addition, it is noted that the non-stationary IDF curve developed by modelling trend in the observed extreme rainfall with covariate is an appropriate choice for designing the Hyderabad city infrastructure under climate change.

AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the complex relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediment load using a flexible statistical model, i.e. a Gaussian Mixture Model. The theoretical principles of this model and its related Expectation- Maximization (E-M) algorithm are briefly analyzed, and subsequently applied to hydrologic data of four medium-sized mountainous rivers of the southern Balkan peninsula (i.e., Acheloos, Arachthos, Aoos and Aliakmon), whose data distribution of the aforementioned variables shows the existence of two sub-populations. A Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) is fitted to the sample points for each river and then its parameters are tuned by comparing different information criteria, in order to determine the optimum parameter settings. These parameters (latent variables) are associated with the generation mechanism of the bivariate distribution, which alternates between two components (regimes), related to the seasonality of the hydrological variables; the latter being characteristic of the Mediterranean environment, comprising of a wet and dry intraannual variability of water discharge and suspended sediment load. The transitions between the two regimes can be approximated by a Markov chain (switching regression model), which can be used for the estimation of monthly suspended sediment fluxes when the corresponding water discharge is known.

AB Landscape characteristics are widely accepted as strongly influencing stream water quality in heterogeneous watersheds. Understanding the relationships between landscape and specific water contaminant can greatly improve the predictability of potential contamination and the assessment of contaminant export. In this work, we examined the combined effects of watershed complexity, in terms of land use and physiography, on specific water contaminant across watersheds close to the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The land use composition, land use pattern, morphometric variables and soil properties were calculated at the watershed scale and considered potential factors of influence. Due to high co-dependence of these watershed characteristics, partial least squares regression was used to elucidate the linkages between some specific water contaminants and the 16 selected watershed characteristic variables. Water contaminant maps revealed spatial and seasonal heterogeneity. The dissolved oxygen values in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season, whereas the other contaminant concentrations displayed the opposite trend. The studied watersheds which are influenced strongly by urbanization, showed higher levels of ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, potassium permanganate index and petroleum, and lower levels of dissolved oxygen. The urban land use, largest patch index and the hypsometric integral were the dominant factors affecting specific water contaminant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Mekong River Basin in South East Asia has experienced in recent decades large inter-annual variations between large floods and severe droughts. The general perception is that climate variability has increased in the region. In this paper our aim was to examine the role of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on these recent climate variations. To achieve our aim, we analysed the influence of ENSO on precipitation (over period 1981-2005) and discharge (1910-2008) by using spatial GIS analyses and statistical methods, such as linear correlations, spectral analysis and stochastic regression models. We found that the Mekong's hydrology was significantly influenced by ENSO, particularly in the decay year of ENSO events. The influence was strongest in the southern parts of the basin. The precipitation and discharge decreased (increased) during El Nino (La Nina) and the annual flood period was shorter (longer) during El Nino (La Nina). We found also decadal variations in the ENSO-discharge relationship. Our findings indicate high potential for developing prediction methods for ENSO induced hydrological anomalies. These findings may significantly improve the possibility of preparing for extreme hydrological events, either drought or exceptional floods, and thus potentially improve water resources management in the basin.

AB This article describes measurements made at each sits and for each vegetation cover as part of the soils program for the HAPEX-Sahel regional scale experiment. The measurements were based on an initial sampling scheme and included profile soil water content, surface soil water content, soil water potential. infiltration rates. additional measurements on core samples, and grain size analysis. The measurements were used to categorize the state of the surface and profile soil water regimes during the experiment and to derive functional relationships for the soil water characteristic curve, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function, and infiltration function. Sample results for different supersites and different vegetation covers are presented showing soil water profiles and total soil water storage on days corresponding to the experimental 'Golden Days'. Sample results are also presented for spatial and temporal distribution of surface moisture content and infiltration tests. The results demonstrate that the major experimental objective of monitoring the supersites during the most rapid vegetative growth stage with the largest change of the surface energy balance following the rainy season was very nearly achieved. Separation of the effects of probable root activity and drainage of the soil profile is possible. The potential for localized advection between the bare soil and vegetation strips of the tiger bush sites is demonstrated.

AB Precipitation data collected at sub-hourly resolution represents specific challenges for missing data recovery by being largely stochastic in nature and highly unbalanced in the duration of rain vs non-rain. Here we present a two-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into (a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in the UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for recovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the integration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain gauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning models by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at sub-hourly resolutions. Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and deployed for highly automated and near instantaneous imputation of missing values in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.

AB Changes in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) are not only influenced by local climate conditions but also by teleconnection factors. To date, how teleconnection factors including sunspot activities could affect TWSA has been under-examined. In this study, we investigate the TWSA dynamics in the Yunnan Province (YP), China, and assess their relationships with teleconnection factors at multiple timescales. Results show that: (1) GRACE data is able to reflect TWSA dynamics in the study region, as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture, precipitation, and groundwater anomalies; (2) GRACE-based TWSA shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly, seasonal, annual and multi-year scales, with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months; (3) precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of TWSA, and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation-concentration degree (PCD) than precipitation magnitude; (4) the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in TWSA, and the correlations between TWSA with Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were 0.88 (a = 0.01) and -0.58 (a = 0.01). This study sheds new insights into how teleconnection factors could TWSA dynamics in a changing environment.

AB Predictions in ungauged basins have been a major challenge in hydrologic sciences, and there is still much work needed to achieve robust and reliable predictions for such basins. Here, we propose and test a novel approach for predicting runoff from poorly gauged basins using a minimum complex model calibrated with isotope data alone (i.e., without observed discharge data). The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable.

AB Planning of regional and urban water resources, and in particular with Integrated Urban Water Management approaches, often considers inter-relationships between human uses of water, the health of the natural environment as well as the cost of various management strategies. Decision makers hence typically need to consider a combination of social, environmental and economic goals. The types of strategies employed can include water efficiency measures, water sensitive urban design, stormwater management, or catchment management. Therefore, decision makers need to choose between different scenarios and to evaluate them against a number of criteria. This type of problem has a discipline devoted to it, i.e. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, which has often been applied in water management contexts. This paper describes the application of Subjective Logic in a basic Bayesian Network to a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis problem. By doing this, it outlines a novel methodology that explicitly incorporates uncertainty and information reliability. The application of the methodology to a known case study context allows for exploration. By making uncertainty and reliability of assessments explicit, it allows for assessing risks of various options, and this may help in alleviating cognitive biases and move towards a well formulated risk management policy.

AB Accurately modeling rainfall-runoff (R-R) transform remains a challenging task despite that a wide range of modeling techniques, either knowledge-driven or data-driven, have been developed in the past several decades. Amongst data-driven models, artificial neural network (ANN)-based R-R models have received great attentions in hydrology community owing to their capability to reproduce the highly nonlinear nature of the relationship between hydrological variables. However, a lagged prediction effect often appears in the ANN modeling process. This paper attempts to eliminate the lag effect from two aspects: modular artificial neural network (MANN) and data preprocessing by singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Two watersheds from China are explored with daily collected data. Results show that MANN does not exhibit significant advantages over ANN. However, it is demonstrated that SSA can considerably improve the performance of prediction model and eliminate the lag effect. Moreover, ANN or MANN with antecedent runoff only as model input is also developed and compared with the ANN (or MANN) R-R model. At all three prediction horizons, the latter outperforms the former regardless of being coupled with/without SSA. It is recommended from the present study that the ANN R-R model coupled with SSA is more promisings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimations of hydrological descriptors are required for studying links between river flow and ecological processes at different scales, from local scale at which biological and/or water quality data are usually available, to larger scale for sustainable development purposes. The study of regional hydrology has seen significant advances in recent years due to new developments in statistics, environmental database access, and calculating capabilities. Nevertheless, theoretical difficulties for mapping and for estimating river regime characteristics at ungauged locations remain because of the nature of the variable under study: river flows are related to a specific area, i.e. the drainage basin, and are hierarchically organized in space through the river network with upstream-downstream dependencies. This presentation aims at describing a method for producing choropleth maps of average runoff and computing mean discharge along the main river network. The approach applied to mean annual runoff is based on geostatistical interpolation procedures coupled with empirical relationships and is illustrated by an application to assess water resource in France. The performance of the developed approach is tested against two other geostatistical methods (ordinary kriging and residual kriging). This study concludes that the classical approaches for interpolation can be improved by explicitly introducing hydrological properties of the mapped variable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Being able to predict the duration of the critical period (CP) and hence the precise mode of behaviour of a reservoir system prior to analysis is advantageous because then the input data interval can be selected to match the requirement. In this sense, purely over-year systems (CP >> 12 months) can be adequately analysed using annual time-series data, whereas for purely within-year systems (CP << 12 months), only the "critical" 12 months in the data record need be considered. These are the two extremes; in reality most reservoirs exhibit a mixture of both behaviours and to capture these, time series data at monthly (or shorter) time scale are required. In this paper, we present results of Monte Carlo simulation experiments investigating the CP of within-year and over-year reservoir systems and its relationship with the currently used test for discriminating between the two patterns of reservoir behaviour. Based on data from two different climatic regions, the results show that the current test is incomplete without incorporating other characteristics of the reservoir storage-yield-reliability problem. A procedure for incorporating these other characteristics is demonstrated and suggestions are offered as to how the study could be extended. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In lieu of process-based models, evolutionary artificial intelligence techniques can yield accurate expressions describing complex phenomena. In the current study, closed-form expressions are developed to predict solute transport in a fracture-matrix system as a function of the parameters that describe relevant physical and chemical processes. The study adopts a multi-gene genetic programming approach to approximate a solution of the classical advection-dispersion equation for reactive transport in single, parallel-plate fractures. The approach is employed to obtain an accurate relationship between the hydraulic, geological, and chemical parameters of the fracture-matrix system as inputs and an ensemble of breakthrough curves as outputs. Solutions generated by the developed model showed good agreement with those of corresponding analytical and numerical models. Computationally, the developed approach is highly efficient, particularly when compared with the analytical solution, which typically requires relatively fine discretization to calculate the long-tailed breakthrough curves. Therefore, future work could extend the developed model to simulate field-scale networks and include additional and more complex transport phenomena. This approach advances solute transport behavior predictions through being simpler and computationally more efficient than currently adopted techniques, which is important as the scale of simulation increases from that of a single fracture to a network.

AB Dewatering using a combination of waterproof curtain and pumping wells is commonly adopted to ensure the stability of foundation pits in multi-aquifer strata. However, dewatering is likely to result in environmental problems. This paper investigates the impact on surroundings owing to the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells by numerical simulation. The depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer (D) and the filter length of pumping wells (L) are varied in the simulation. The relationship between approximate hydraulic gradient (Delta i) or ground settlement outside the foundation pit (S) with curtain depth ratio R-D (D over the thickness of the dewatering confined aquifer H-a) or filter length ratio R-L (L/H-a) can be divided into three change parts, namely initial gradual, middle sharp and final gentle part. Three values of R-D and R-L, namely effective, suggested and control value, are proposed. R-D and R-L should vary between the effective and control value. The suggested value of R-D and R-L, is recommended in actual engineering by comprehensive consideration. The effective, suggested and control value of R-D can be calculated by a linear equation according to the value of R-L.

AB The proportionality hypothesis, originating from the curve number method at the event scale, is extended for modeling runoff in the water-limited and energy-limited seasons, respectively. The proposed seasonal runoff model includes three parameters for two separate seasons, which are wetting capacity, initial wetting and initial evaporation. The parameters for 203 watersheds from the United States are estimated, and the empirical relationships between the parameters and watershed properties, which include duration of the season, duration, intensity and frequency of rainfall events, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil saturated hydraulic properties, are obtained for applications in ungauged watersheds. These empirical equations present physical controls on runoff at the seasonal scale besides climate seasonality. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient of the seasonal runoff simulation for total runoff is higher than 0.5 in 86% (77%) of the study watersheds; while the surface runoff is 38% (46%) and the base flow is 92% (78%) in the energy-limited seasons (water-limited seasons). This paper shows the potential application of the proportionality hypothesis for estimating seasonal runoff, which is valuable for water resources planning and management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents an energy balance modelling approach to predict the nightly water yield and the surface temperature (T-f) of two passive radiative dew condensers (RDCs) tilted 30 from horizontal. One was fitted with a white hydrophilic polyethylene foil recommended for dew harvest and the other with a black polyethylene foil widely used in horticulture. The model was validated in south-eastern Spain by comparing the simulation outputs with field measurements of T-f and dew yield. The results indicate that the model is robust and accurate in reproducing the behaviour of the two RDCs, especially in what refers to T-f, whose estimates were very close to the observations. The results were somewhat less precise for dew yield, with a larger scatter around the 1:1 relationship. A sensitivity analysis showed that the simulated dew yield was highly sensitive to changes in relative humidity and downward longwave radiation. The proposed approach provides a useful tool to water managers for quantifying the amount of dew that could be harvested as a valuable water resource in arid, semiarid and water stressed regions.

AB Urban pluvial flooding is a global challenge that is frequently caused by the lack of available infiltration, retention and drainage capacity in cities. This paper presents RUFIDAM, an urban pluvial flood model, developed using GIS technology with the intention of rapidly estimating flood extent, depth and its associated damage. RUFIDAM integrates a 1D hydraulic drainage network model (SWMM or MOUSE) with an adapted version of rapid flood inundation models. One-metre resolution topographic data was used to identify depressions in an urban catchment. Volume-elevation relationships and minimum elevation between adjacent depressions were determined. Mass balance considerations were then used to simulate movement of water between depressions. Surcharge volumes from the 1D drainage network model were fed statically into the rapid inundation model. The model was tested on three urban catchments located in southeast Melbourne. Results of flood depth, extent and damage costs were compared to those produced using MIKE FLOOD; a well-known 1D-2D hydrodynamic model. Results showed that RUFIDAM can predict flood extent and accumulated damage cost with acceptable accuracy. Although some variations in the simulated location of flooding were observed, simulation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to MIKE FLOOD. As such, RUFIDAM is suitable for large-scale flood studies and risk-based approaches that rely on a large number of simulations.

AB To better understand the groundwater flow and chemistry in argillaceous formations, the dependency of transport parameters such as permeability, diffusion coefficient, and chemical osmotic efficiency on each of the chemical species dominant in groundwater must also be understood. Despite its importance, however, little is known about the dependence of transport parameters on different types of groundwater. Thus, we investigated transport parameters of Wakkanai mudstones using three different types of electrolyte solutions. Here, we report the relationship among the solution salt type, solute concentration, transport parameters, and pore structure characteristics. Wide ranges in osmotic efficiency and intrinsic permeability, 0.0035-0.14 and 1.19 x 10(-19) to 4.75 x 10(-18) m(2), respectively, reflect the difference in the solution composition based on the salt type, difference in solute concentration, and variation in the pore size distributions of Wakkanai mudstones. The effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effects, at 2.98 x 10(-11) to 5.92 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1), vary depending on salt type, but remain invariant among samples, indicating no difference in fluid flow path associated with small values of osmotic efficiency. In contrast, the osmotic efficiencies are related to differences in salt concentrations. Our findings indicate that salt concentration and pore structure characteristics determine not only the semipermeability of the Wakkanai mudstones but also the diffusivity and permeability.

AB Few studies have quantified nitrate-nitrogen reductions in rivers flowing through large flood control reservoirs despite their potential role in helping to meet nitrate-N load reduction targets. In this study, we evaluated a 26-year record of nitrate-N monitoring in Saylorville Lake reservoir that impounds the Des Moines River in central Iowa to estimate the annual mass of nitrate-N removed and evaluate controls on inter-annual patterns of nitrate-N removal rates. Results from mass balance calculations indicate a nitrate mass loss of 4.9% over the 26 year period from 1986 through 2011. The annual percent nitrate mass removed is related to hydraulic loading rate with low flow years having longer retention times removing a significantly greater percentage of nitrate than is removed during high flow years with low retention times. Average annual residence times varied from 3.5 to 74 days with a 26 year average of 9.7 days. Nitrate removal results for Saylorville Lake agree well with published work for several other reservoirs which together encompass a broad range of nitrate removal rates. Combining data from Saylorville Lake with other published studies, a relationship between nitrate-N removal rate and hydraulic loading rate was developed resulting in a predictive equation with a model R-2 = 0.92.

AB The onset date of positive water temperature in the annual thermal cycle of North-American streams is modeled using parametric (regression) and non-parametric (artificial neural networks) approaches. Physiographic, land cover and weather-related variables are used to predict the date of positive temperature onset for 191 station-years at 48 locations in Canada and in Northern US. Preliminary correlation analysis is performed in order to test the relationships between the physiographic/land cover/weather variables and the date of positive temperature onset. Moreover, several different subsets of variables are tested as inputs to each model type. Artificial neural networks can predict the date of positive temperature onset for a given station-year. given its longitude, lake coverage of its drainage basin, and two January-February daily temperature indices, with a split-sample validation root mean square error (RMSE) similar to 8.8 days. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression models allow to predict the onset date with RMSE similar to 9.5 days, given the station's latitude, longitude, lake coverage and one January-February daily temperature index. OLS regression models adjusted on canonical variates combining 13 physiographic/land cover and weather variables achieve prediction performance similar to 9.1 days. The precipitation does not impact much on the onset date prediction for all tested models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological models generally contain parameters that cannot be measured directly, but can only be meaningfully inferred by calibration against a historical record of input-output data. While considerable progress has been made in the development and application of automatic procedures for model calibration, such methods have received criticism for their lack of rigor in treating uncertainty in the parameter estimates. In this paper, we apply the recently developed Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA) to stochastic calibration of the parameters in the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA) model using historical data from the Leaf River in Mississippi. The SCEM-UA algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler that provides an estimate of the most likely parameter set and underlying posterior distribution within a single optimization run. In particular, we explore the relationship between the length and variability of the streamflow data and the Bayesian uncertainty associated with the SAC-SMA model parameters and compare SCEM-UA derived parameter values with those obtained using deterministic SCE-UA calibrations. Most significantly, for the Leaf River catchments under study our results demonstrate that most of the 13 SAC-SMA parameters are well identified by calibration to daily streamflow data suggesting that this data contains more information than has previously been reported in the literature.

AB Underground coal mining suffers from groundwater intrusion from the aquifers overlying coal seams. Therefore, developing methods for the accurate prediction of roof water inflow is urgently needed to design a safe drainage system. In this study, we developed a novel upscaling framework to predict roof water inflow by integrating the multiscale hydrogeological properties of roof aquifers. In this framework, we imaged rock samples via scanning electron microscopy and performed pore-scale analysis based on fractal theory. A fractal model of permeability was introduced to calculate the seepage capacity of the pore structure in the samples. The effect of fractures was further evaluated via core-scale pneumatic experiments. Subsequently, we derived an upscaling formula of hydraulic conductivity used for predicting roof water inflow at the field scale. The proposed upscaling approach was demonstrated using data from a coal mine in Northern China. The results indicate that the actual water inflow (21 m3/h) is within the predicted range of our upscaling framework (9.32-92.78 m3/h), and the initial line fracture rate dx is distributed between 0.02 % and 0.03 %. Therefore, these findings can guide the development of methods for considering micropores and fractures simultaneously and scaling them up to the field scale for effective prediction of water inflow from roof aquifers.

AB Specific yield is one of the most important hydrogeological parameters, and is a key factor connecting flow processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones. In this study, an innovative expression for the dynamic (or time-dependent) specific yield is proposed considering the coupled unsaturated-saturated flow process. The new specific yield equation includes parameters such as saturated water content, residual water content, pore characteristic parameter, initial depth of water table, time-dependent depth of water table, initial pressure head, and time. The involving parameters in this new specific yield equation reflect the impacts of lithology, initial water table depth and other factors. This new equation approaches an asymptotic (steady-state) value which is the same as reported previously for a shallow water table condition. Both advective and diffusive unsaturated flow processes are taken into consideration, which is in contrast to a previous study that ignored the diffusive unsaturated flow process. The model established in this study reveals the complete dynamic process of variation of water content and water head in the unsaturated zone. The newly developed specific yield equation can be incorporated into groundwater flow theory considering a dynamic water table reflective of a physically based unsaturated-saturated flow process.

AB Hysteresis is a widely reported phenomenon in natural and engineered systems across different temporal and spatial scales. Its definition is non-unique and rather context-dependent, while systems with hysteretic behavior, including hydrological systems, are commonly referred to as path-dependent systems or systems with memory. Despite widespread existence of hysteretic processes, the current generation of hydrologic models do not directly account for hysteresis. In this paper, we review the fundamentals, theories, and general properties of hysteresis in the broad scientific literature and then focus on its representations in hydrological sciences. Through illustrative examples, we show how an incomplete understanding or representation of the underlying processes in a system can lead to considering the system as being path-dependent. We argue that, in most cases, hysteresis is a manifestation of our dimensionality-reducing approach to process understanding and representation. We further explain that modelling hysteresis in an ideal world requires a full-dimensional process representation, based on a perfect understanding of the processes, their heterogeneity, and their spatio-temporal scale dependency. We discuss, however, that the missing dimensions/physics in a hydrologic model may be compensated to some extent by enabling the model with formal hysteretic components. Moreover, we show that the conventional model structure and parameterization may be designed in a way to partially reproduce a desired hysteretic behavior.

AB Identifying floods and producing flood susceptibility maps are crucial steps for decision-makers to prevent and manage disasters. Plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps. Nevertheless, most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods. In this study, we propose a local spatial sequential long short-term memory neural network (LSS-LSTM) for flood susceptibility prediction in Shangyou County, China. The three main contributions of this study are summarized below. First of all, it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of LSTM for flood susceptibility prediction. Second, we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with LSTM to predict flood susceptibility. Third, we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method. The LSS-LSTM method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data, but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSS-LSTM method achieves satisfactory prediction performance (93.75% and 0.965) in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

AB Relating stream dynamics to catchment properties is essential to anticipate the influence of changing environmental conditions and to predict flows of ungauged rivers. Although the importance of subsurface processes in catchment hydrology is widely acknowledged, geological characteristics are rarely explicitly included in studies assessing physiographic controls on catchment dynamics. In this investigation of 22 catchments of the Swiss Plateau and Prealpes, we use a simple linear regression approach to analyze the relationship between streamflow indicators and various geological and hydrogeological properties of the bedrock and quaternary deposits, along with meteorological, soil, land use and topographical characteristics. We use long-term discharge percentiles, as well as dimensionless flow duration curves (FDC, standardized by long-term mean discharge) that allow to evaluate the catchment response to climate forcing. While climate conditions dominate the high to medium discharge percentiles (Q5-Q50), the capacity of the catchments to buffer the meteorological forcing can only be attributed to geological characteristics. The sandstone proportion in the catchments explains 54% of the variance of both extremities of the dimensionless FDC (Q5/Qmean and Q95/Qmean) and productive quaternary deposits are responsible of 55% resp. 58% of the variance of the two ratios. Examining the hydrogeological characteristics of both bedrock and quatemary lithologies considerably improves the understanding of catchment dynamics.

ID ERS SCATTEROMETER; RAINFALL; PATTERNS; MODEL; CATCHMENT; DYNAMICS;

AB The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the importance of the initial soil moisture state for flash flood magnitudes. Four extreme events that occurred in different case study regions were analysed, one winter and one autumn flash flood in the Glofiros and Almirida catchments in Crete, and two summer floods in the Rastenberg catchment in Austria. The hydrological processes were simulated by the spatially distributed flash flood model Kampus. For the Crete cases Kampus model was calibrated against remotely sensed soil moisture while for the Austrian case the model was calibrated against observed runoff. Kampus model was then used to estimate the sensitivity of the stream flow peak to initial soil moisture. The largest of the events analysed (in terms of specific peak discharge) was found to have a sensitivity of less than 0.2% flood peak change per % soil moisture change while the smallest event had a sensitivity of more than 3% flood peak change per % soil moisture change. This suggests that initial soil moisture effects on the flash flood response probably depend on event magnitude rather than on the climate or region. Moreover, the Austrian catchment was found to exhibit a more nonlinear relationship between antecedent soil moisture and the peak discharge than the Cretan catchments which was explained by differences in the soil type.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER; BASIN
AB Agriculture and ecosystems are increasingly competing for water. We propose an approach to assess the economic compensation standard required to release water from agricultural use to ecosystems while taking into account seasonal variability in river flow. First, we defined agricultural water shortage as the difference in water volume between agricultural demands and actual supply after maintaining environmental flows for ecosystems. Second, we developed a production loss model to establish the relationship between production losses and agricultural water shortages in view of seasonal variation in river discharge. Finally, we estimated the appropriate economic compensation for different irrigation stake-holders based on crop prices and production losses. A case study in the Yellow River Estuary, China, demonstrated that relatively stable economic compensation for irrigation processes can be defined based on the developed model, taking into account seasonal variations in river discharge and different levels of environmental flow. Annual economic compensation is not directly related to annual water shortage because of the temporal variability in river flow rate and environmental flow. Crops that have stable planting areas to guarantee food security should be selected as indicator crops in economic compensation assessments in the important grain production zone. Economic compensation may be implemented by creating funds to update water-saving measures in agricultural facilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) data measured using micrometeorological equipment were obtained from three separate studies conducted in and and semi-arid shallow groundwater environments in California, New Mexico and Colorado. These locations have great diversity in (1) climate expression: monsoon versus Mediterranean annual precipitation patterns and comparatively long versus short growing seasons; and in (2) vegetation cover: alkali scrub, shallow groundwater meadows, and monocultures of saltcedar and cottonwood. Actual ET (ETA measured from 24 site- and year-combinations was paired with NDVI*, a derivation of normalized difference vegetation index. NDVI* was extracted from corresponding locations in nine mid-summer Landsat TM5 and TM7 scenes during 1999-2002, with single mid-summer scenes used for estimation of annual total ETa. NDVI* was a competent estimator of a derivation of ET, ET*, calculated by subtracting annualized precipitation and normalizing by an annualized reference ET, (ET0). This relationship was used to estimate annual total ETa, derived solely from remote sensing and weather data. Residual error decreased as ETa increased with well-balanced data scatter indicating lack of systematic error. These results demonstrate a simple and robust method that can be used to map annual ET as a first-order approximation from a single mid-summer satelite scene for any and or semi-arid shallow groundwater environment where sufficient weather data exist for calculating annual precipitation and reference ET.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the key technologies for reducing CO2 emissions, but it has suffered from the high costs for the purification of captured CO2 streams. Storing CO2 with two major impurities (i.e., N-2 and O-2) in geological formations would be more economical; however, the cost savings might be offset by the reduced CO2 storage efficiency. To understand the relationships between the reduced CO2 storage efficiency and the CO2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers, the effects of impurities N-2 and O-2 on the CO2 storage efficiency and CO2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers are evaluated. We established a 2D model by developing a new module incorporated into TOUGH2, to simulate the migration and dissolution of CO2-N-2-O-2 mixtures in aquifers based on the hydrogeological conditions of the Shenhua CCS site in China. It is found that the partitioning between CO2 and the impurities during migration can reduce CO2 storage efficiency by raising impurity concentrations in gas phase. But higher pressure and temperature in reservoirs can alleviate the reduction of CO2 storage efficiency, while retaining the benefit of the impurities on the CO2 dissolution efficiency. With 10 mol% N-2, the CO2 storage efficiency is decreased by at least 32%, while the CO2 storage cost in saline aquifers is increased less than 0.01 US $/t CO2.

AB Chemical and isotopic evolution of groundwater in an evaporite karst plateau (including wetland areas and saline to hyper-saline springs) located at S Spain was studied. Physicochemical parameters, major ions and stable isotopes were analyzed in rain, brine spring, wetland and leakage water samples, from which the most common mineral saturation indexes were computed and geochemical and isotopic modelling were performed. Results show an apparent relationship between the elevation of brine springs and their water mineralization, indicating that drainage at higher altitude may be associated to gravity-driven flows, since brackish groundwater is isotopically fractionated due to evaporation. On the other hand, the lower altitude springs could drain deeper flows with longer residence time, resulting in highly mineralized and warmer (briny) groundwater. The dissolution of halite and gypsum has proved to be the main geochemical processes, which are favored by the great ionic strength of groundwater. Calcite precipitation occurs in brackish waters draining wetlands, being boosted by common ion effect (when CaSO4 waters are present) and solute concentration caused by evaporation. Modelling results strongly support the hypothesis that most of the selected springs geochemically evolve in a common (S-N) flowpath. The methods used in this research contribute to a better understanding of the hydrogeological processes occurring in the studied evaporitic system, but also in equivalent hydrological environments worldwide.

TI Pruning of support vector networks on flood forecasting

AB Support vector machine (SVM), which is analytically solved to reach its optimal structural formula, can be represented as a network architecture resembling artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptrons) that have been pruned to obtain model parsimony or improve generalization. This study presents two methods of pruning the support vector networks, and applies them to a case study of real-time flood stage forecasting. One method prunes the input variables by the cross-correlation method, while the other prunes the support vectors according to the derived relationship among SVM parameters. These pruning methods do not revise the SVM algorithm, and the pruned models therefore still have! the optimal architecture. The real-time forecasting performance pertaining to the original and the pruned SVM models are compared, and comparison results indicate that the pruning reduces the network complexity but does not degrade the forecasting ability. Moreover, the deletion of support vectors and the change in their weights during the pruning process are identified, revealing that the support vectors with small weight (and hence less significant) tend to be pruned off, while the support vectors that are more informative to characterize the floods are preserved after the pruning. Finally, this study suggests that the proposed support vector pruning method be a potential data mining technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrometeorological data are needed for obtaining point and areal mean, quantifying the spatial variability of hydrometeorological variables, and calibration and verification of hydrometeorological models. Hydrometeorological networks are utilized to collect such data. Since data collection is expensive, it is essential to design an optimal network based on the minimal number of hydrometeorological stations in order to reduce costs. This study proposes a two-phase copula entropy-based multiobjective optimization approach that includes: (1) copula entropy-based directional information transfer (CDIT) for clustering the potential hydrometeorological gauges into several groups, and (2) multiobjective method for selecting the optimal combination of gauges for regionalized groups. Although entropy theory has been employed for network design before, the joint histogram method used for mutual information estimation has several limitations. The copula entropy-based mutual information (MI) estimation method is shown to be more effective for quantifying the uncertainty of redundant information than the joint histogram OH) method. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by applying to one type of hydrometeorological gauge network, with the use of three model evaluation measures, including Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC), arithmetic mean of the negative copula entropy (MNCE), and MNCE/NSC. Results indicate that the two-phase copula entropy-based multiobjective technique is capable of evaluating the performance of regional hydrometeorological networks and can enable decision makers to develop strategies for water resources management.

AB The thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) is used to formulate a modeling framework for mechanistic models of species transport in multiphase porous medium systems containing two fluid phases and a solid phase. Primary restrictions guide the selection of entities and the set of conservation and balance equations needed to formulate an augmented entropy inequality (EI). Classical irreversible thermodynamics is upscaled from the microscale to the macroscale and used to provide a connection among material derivatives that arise from the conservation and balance equations under near-equilibrium conditions. An essentially exact constrained EI (CEI) is derived to approach the force-flux form of the EI that is desired. A set of approximations is applied to the CEI to produce a non-unique simplified EI (SEI), which is in the strict force-flux form needed to guide the formulation of closure relations.
   Sets of secondary restrictions are applied to the general SEI to form simpler subsets of the general SEI that apply for the local thermal equilibrium and isothermal cases. The SEI is then used to constrain the permissible form of the closure relations and to formulate a set of low-order closure relations. A specific model instance is formulated in closed form by specifying a complete set of conservation equations and closure relations. Many other model instances can be derived from the general modeling framework presented, and these potential extensions are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The most distinguished characteristic of pervious concrete is its connected porosity that allows water to percolate. And the permeable capacity will decrease rapidly once the pervious concrete is clogged by the sediments. Despite the relationship between permeability and clogging is extensively researched, there is limited information about pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements. The aim of this paper is using the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method (CFD-DEM) model to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development taking into account of the porosity of pervious pavements, sediments size distribution, the horizontal runoff velocity, and the seepage velocity. Pore clogging is determined by the DA/D, ratio the equivalent diameter of aggregate particles (191) to equivalent diameter of sediments (D,). A fitted curve is utilized to depict the tendency of clogging. Sediments secondary movement is revealed. Results show that the well-graded sands is able to percolate into the depth of 30 mm in pervious pavements; coarse sands will settle on the shallow surface within depth of 20 mm in pervious pavements; and fine sands will percolate into the depth of 60-100 mm in pervious pavements. As the increase of porosity, horizontal runoff velocity, and seepage velocity, the sediments will transport into pervious pavements deeply. The cycle simulation of raining and draining shows it has limited influence to clogging.

AB This study applied support vector machines (SVMs) and data assimilation (DA) methods to investigate the performance of in-situ and remotely sensed products (i.e., leaf area index (LAI), AMSR-E and SMAP soil moisture retrievals) for near-real time agricultural drought forecasting for in-situ stations located in continental United States (CONUS), The agricultural drought was quantified using soil water deficit index (SWDI) derived based on available soil moisture and basic soil water parameters. It is observed that SVMs or SVM-DA with limited meteorological variables as inputs able to forecast SWDI at most of the in situ stations up to 1-2-week lead time. Addition of remotely sensed products (i.e., LAI, AMSR-E, SMAP) either individually or simultaneously as inputs to SVMs can able to improve SWDI forecast at most of the stations where the strong relationship exists between LAI (and/or AMSR-E, SMAP) with SWDI. Such improvement can persist up to 2-4-week lead time at some of the stations. But the efficiency tends to decrease with the increase in lead time. The addition of both LAI and SMAP (AMSR-E) performs better than the independent addition of LAI or SMAP (AMSR-E). Typically, the performance of drought prediction varies at local scales; therefore it is difficult to generalize our findings at regional scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hillslope hydrological response to precipitation is extremely complex and poorly modeled. One possible approach for reducing the complexity of hillslope response and its mathematical parameterization is to look for macroscale hydrological behavior. Hillslope threshold response to storm precipitation is one such macroscale behavior observed at field sites across the globe. Nevertheless, the relative controls on the precipitation-discharge threshold poorly known. This paper presents a combined model development, calibration and testing experiment study to investigate the primary controls on the observed precipitation-discharge threshold relationship. We focus on the dominant hydrological processes revealed in part one of this two-part paper and with our new numerical model, replicate the threshold response seen in the discharge record and other hydrometric and tracer data available at the site. We then present a series of virtual experiments designed to probe the controls on the threshold response. We show that the threshold behavior is due to a combination of environmental (storm spacing and potential evapotranspiration) and geologic (bedrock permeability and bedrock topography) factors. The predicted precipitationdischarge threshold subsumes the complexity of plot-scale soil water response. We then demonstrate its use for prediction of whole-catchment storm discharge at other first order catchments at Maimai and the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the largest dry forest of the continent, the South American Chaco covers a broad latitudinal gradient (18 degrees-33 degrees S) with extremely flat topography, homogeneous vegetation structure and similar summer-rain regime. Despite high deforestation rates, Chaco is still dominated by native forests, offering a unique opportunity to explore the role of biophysical controls dictated by latitudinal gradients on its hydrological functioning. In this study, we used GRACE-derived satellite data, climatic information and river flow records to analyse the seasonality of total water storage and its relationship with climatic factors and plant activity across the whole latitudinal gradient of the Chaco region. Our results showed a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards the southern and more temperate portion in despite similar rainfall seasonality. Mean seasonal fluctuation of water storage was three times higher (119.1 +/- 46.0 vs. 38.6 +/- 12.4 mm year(-1)) for the northern (< 26 degrees S) than for the southern Chaco portion (> 26 degrees S), a pattern that matched the river flow seasonality of the main rivers of the region. A higher temporal coupling of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration towards the south appears to drive the observed latitudinal hydrological shift, high-lighting the importance of atmospheric water demand and plant activity regulating the water cycle at Chaco regional scale.

AB The geochemical evolution of groundwater of the Puebla aquifer was investigated using chemistry and isotopic data with special emphasis on the geochemistry of Boron to decipher the natural and anthropogenic sources. This study measured 70 groundwater samples that are potentially impacted by the urban and rural anthropic, volcanic and glaciation activities. Based on the distribution of anions and cations water samples were classified into three groups using Piper Diagram. Group1 showed to have high HCO3 than SO4, Group 3 high SO4 than HCO3 and Group 2 revealed intermediate composition. Radiometric studies show the presence of Pleistocene groundwater; however, there was no definite relationship between the radiometric dates to the groups except that enrichment in delta D and delta C-13 values were noted with respect to age. Average Boron concentrations in some wells were observed to be higher (> 5000 mu g/L) than that of the permissible limit for human consumption. Results also indicated that the sources of Boron were more natural than anthropogenic that comprised the local geological conditions, volcanic activity and hydrothermal processes. The study also validated that the groundwater wells from the southwestern part of the study area are suitable for extraction of groundwater, considering its quality and residence time; whereas, in the wells located in the central-eastern zone of the metropolitan area, it is recommended that groundwater exploitation must be gradually reduced.

   INDEX
AB The construction of dams and sluices (DSs) is conducive to human development, but affects river water quality (WQ) and water ecology (WE) seriously. While many studies have explored the DS-induced impact on hydrology, water quality and water ecology, the difference in DS regulations for different objectives and interests (such as flood control, power generation and ecological protection) are not taken into the account although their impacts on WQ and WE are different. Discharge is the key factor to measure different DS regulation and its variation directly affects the long-term WQ and WE in rivers. Thus, studying short-term multi-scenario DS regulation with different discharge is very important for providing insights to their long-term irregular management. Furthermore, the relationships between discharges and the change of WQ indicators are different in the upstream and downstream of DSs and at different distance to DSs in the downstream. However, it is not well understood how the WQ and WE indicators at upstream and downstream sites of DSs change under different regulation scenarios in long-term and short-term. Using the monitored WQ and WE indicators at twelve sampling sites (SPs) of six DSs in the Huai River Basin (HRB), this study investigates the impact of long-term irregular DS regulation on changes in WQ and WE indicators, i.e., the long-term regulation experiment (LTRE), and then the relationship between the alteration of DS discharge flow and changes in WQ indicators, i.e., the short-term regulation experiment (STRE) under four scenarios with different flow magnitudes at one of sluices (Huaidian Sluice). The results of long-term regulations show that the WQ at downstream sites of most DSs was worse than their corresponding upstream sites. The similarity of WE indicators at upstream and downstream sites of DSs was low, meaning the great impact of DS long-term regulation on WE. The results of short-term regulations show that small flow magnitude (20 m(3)/s in this study) helps release and reduce upstream pollution of DSs as it does not disturb downstream riverbed pollutions, resulting in an increase of downstream river pollution. Further increasing flow magnitude (40 m(3)/s in this study) helps reduce and release upstream pollution, but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed, which may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time. A flow magnitude about 60 m(3)/s can help release and rapidly dilute and degrade sediment pollutions in downstream riverbed. However, a larger flow magnitude may also be inappropriate due to the strong downstream riverbed erosion except for special regulation requirements. This study can provide more insights for water resources management to develop long-term ecological DS regulation schemes for in HRB and other similar DS dominated basins.

AB The study presents a new hybrid method for the simulation of flood events in small catchments. It combines a physically-based two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and the hydrological unit hydrograph theory. Unit hydrographs are derived using the FLOW-R2D model which is based on the full form of two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations, solved by a modified McCormack numerical scheme. The method is tested at a small catchment in a suburb of Athens-Greece for a storm event which occurred in February 2013. The catchment is divided into three friction zones and unit hydrographs of 15 and 30 min are produced. The infiltration process is simulated by the empirical Kostiakov equation and the Green-Ampt model. The results from the implementation of the proposed hybrid method are compared with recorded data at the hydrometric station at the outlet of the catchment and the results derived from the fully hydrodynamic model FLOW-R2D. It is concluded that for the case studied, the proposed hybrid method produces results close to those of the fully hydrodynamic simulation at substantially shorter computational time. This finding, if further verified in a variety of case studies, can be useful in devising effective hybrid tools for the two-dimensional flood simulations, which are lead to accurate and considerably faster results than those achieved by the fully hydrodynamic simulations.

AB In this study, we investigate the directional influence of storm movement on catchment flood peak response using the synthetic circular basin. Due to the complexity in defining storm movements that require meteorological modeling, we adopt a novel approach of combining the basin rotation method (BRM) with a circular basin construct. A systematic basin rotation approach provides a proxy for the storm direction relative to the river network topology to study its hydrologic response. Using Stage-IV rainfall with 4-km by 1-hour resolution for 16 years period from 2003 to 2018 in Iowa, U.S., we systematically analyze consequent flood peak response due to storm directions (basin rotations) using a distributed hydrologic model called the Hillslope-Link Model (HLM). HLM has demonstrated the ability to reproduce observed streamflow for real river basins studied in Iowa. The hydrologic simulation results show that the BRM can quantify the relationship between the rainstorm direction and catchment hydrologic response. Also, the maximum flood peak response is strongly dependent on the interaction of the peak of the rainstorm with the peak of the width function. The results indicate significant differences in runoff volume and runoff peak and their interannual variability due to rainstorm direction. The study has important implications for flood frequency predictions and developing flood resilience and watershed management strategies, particularly due to changing storm tracks under a warming climate.

AB This study presents novel models for prediction of flow Duration Curves (FDCs) at ungauged basins using artificial neural networks (ANN) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) trained and tested using historical flow records from 171 unregulated and 89 regulated basins across North America. For the 89 regulated basins, FDCs were generated for both before and after flow regulation. Topographic, climatic, and land use characteristics are used to develop relationships between these basin characteristics and FDC statistical distribution parameters: mean (m) and variance (v). The two main hypotheses that flow regulation has negligible effect on the mean (m) while it the variance (v) were confirmed. The novel GEP model that predicts the mean (GEP-m) performed very well with high R-2 (0.9) and D (0.95) values and low RAE value of 0.25. The simple regression model that predicts the variance (REG-v) was developed as a function of the mean (m) and a flow regulation index (R). The measured performance and uncertainty analysis indicated that the ANN-m was the best performing model with R-2 (0.97), RAE (0.21), D (0.93) and the lowest 95% confidence prediction error interval (+0.22 to +3.49). Both GEP and ANN models were most sensitive to drainage area followed by mean annual precipitation, apportionment entropy disorder index, and shape factor. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper tests the predictive power of 10 bed load formulae against bed load rates obtained for a large regulated river (River Ebro) the armor layer of which is subject to repeated cycles of break-up and reestablishment. The theoretical principles of two of the 10 formulae explicitly include the effects of river bed armoring. The results obtained showed substantial differences in equation performance but no evident relationship between predictive power and theoretical approach (e.g., discharge, stream power and probability) was found. Overall, the predictive power of the tested formulae was relatively low. The average percentages of predicted bed load discharge that did not exceed factors of 2 (0.5 < r < 2) and 10 (0.1 < r < 10) in relation to the observed discharge were 19% and 57%, respectively (where r is the discrepancy ratio between the predicted and observed values). In particular, the formulae of Yang (1984) and Parker et al. (1982) presented the better levels of agreement with the observed bed load discharges. The bed load rating curve for the lower Ebro showed a similar degree of agreement to the best-performing formulae. However, its predictive power was limited because only flow discharge acts as an independent variable and river bed dynamics, such as armoring cycles, are not contemplated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recession flows in a basin are controlled by the temporal evolution of its active drainage network (ADN). The geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) assumes that both the rate of flow generation per unit ADN length (q) and the speed at which ADN heads move downstream (c) remain constant during a recession event. Thereby, it connects the power law exponent of -dQ/dt versus Q (discharge at the outlet at time t) curve, , with the structure of the drainage network, a fixed entity. In this study, we first reformulate the GRFM for Horton-Strahler networks and show that the geomorphic ((g)) is equal to D/(D-1), where D is the fractal dimension of the drainage network. We then propose a more general recession flow model by expressing both q and c as functions of Horton-Strahler stream order. We show that it is possible to have = (g) for a recession event even when q and c do not remain constant. The modified GRFM suggests that is controlled by the spatial distribution of subsurface storage within the basin. By analyzing streamflow data from 39 U.S. Geological Survey basins, we show that is having a power law relationship with recession curve peak, which indicates that the spatial distribution of subsurface storage varies across recession events.
   Key Points <list list-type="bulleted"> The GRFM is reformulated for Horton-Strahler networks. The GRFM is modified by allowing its parameters to vary along streams. Sub-surface storage distribution controls recession flow characteristics.

AB Hysteresis is a rate-independent non-linearity that is expressed through thresholds, switches, and branches. Exceedance of a threshold, or the occurrence of a turning point in the input, switches the output onto a particular output branch. Rate-independent branching on a very large set of switches with non-local memory is the central concept in the new definition of hysteresis. Hysteretic loops are a special case. A self-consistent mathematical description of hydrological systems with hysteresis demands a new non-linear systems theory of adequate generality. The goal of this paper is to establish this and to show how this may be done. Two results are presented: a conceptual model for the hysteretic soil-moisture characteristic at the pedon scale and a hysteretic linear reservoir at the catchment scale. Both are based on the Preisach model. A result of particular significance is the demonstration that the independent domain model of the soil moisture characteristic due to Childs, Poulavassilis, Mualem and others, is equivalent to the Preisach hysteresis model of non-linear systems theory, a result reminiscent of the reduction of the theory of the unit hydrograph to linear systems theory in the 1950s. A significant reduction in the number of model parameters is also achieved. The new theory implies a change in modelling paradigm.

TI Transfer function approach for artificial tracer test interpretation in

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Artificial tracer tests; Karstic system; Transfer function
ID TRANSPORT; WAVELET; MODEL; RESERVOIR; AQUIFER
AB A karstic formation consists in a three-dimensional hydrological system which involves horizontal and vertical, diphasic or saturated water transfers characterised by a large range of velocity. These subsurface flow processes correspond to various water pathways through fractured, fissured, and underground streams or conduits leading to a nonlinear global behaviour of the system.
   An efficient way of investigating of a karstic system behaviour consists in the injection of artificial tracer tests at loss points and in careful analysis of the recovery tracer fluxes at one or several outlets of the systems. These injections are also an efficient way of providing hypotheses on characteristic time of contaminant transfer in these type of aquifers.
   Here, we propose a Laplace-transform transfer function of the Residence Time Distribution function that allows to discriminate between a quick-flow advection-dominated component and a slow-flow advection-dispersion/dominated component in the artificial tracer transfer in the system. We apply this transfer function on five high resolution sampling rate artificial tracer tests operated on the Baget system in the Pyrenees (France) in order to illustrate the advantages and limitations of this approach. We provide then an interpretation of the relationship between tracer test recovery shape and karstic system organisation between inlet and outlet site. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable and skillful precipitation ensemble forecasts are necessary to produce reliable and skilful hydrologic ensemble forecasts. It is well known that, in general, raw precipitation ensemble forecasts from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are not very reliable and that, for short-range prediction, human forecasters add significant skill to the NWP-generated single-valued quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF). In this paper, we describe and evaluate a statistical procedure for producing precipitation ensemble forecasts from single-valued QPFs. The procedure is based on the bivariate probability distribution between the observed precipitation and the single-valued QPF. The distribution is modeled as a mixed-type in which the relationship between the positive observed precipitation and positive forecast precipitation is assumed to be bivariate meta-Gaussian. We also describe and comparatively evaluate a generalized meta-Gaussian model in which the model parameter is optimized by minimizing the mean Continuous Ranked Probability Score. The performance of these procedures is assessed through dependent and cross validation using data for selected river basins in the service areas of the Arkansas-Red Basin, California-Nevada and Middle-Atlantic River Forecast Centers of the National Weather Service. The validation results show that, overall, the precipitation ensembles generated by the proposed procedures are reliable and capture the skill in the conditioning single-valued forecasts very well.

AB Previous studies have shown that the predictive ability of artificial neural networks can be improved by combining multiple models. This study presents a jittering-based neural network ensemble approach to obtain improved regional low flow estimates at ungauged sites. The fundamental idea of the jittered ensemble is to add noises to the explanatory variables and thereby augments the training data sets to develop the network models based on different but associated training data. To evaluate the performance of the jittered ensemble, this study employs two different neural network architectures, a single-output neural network model and a multi-output neural network model. In addition, a jittered ensemble approach is coupled with the variable importance measuring algorithm to infer the relationship between basin characteristics and predicted low flow quantiles. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using selected basins in the northeastern United States. Results suggest that the jittering-based ensemble model is able to consistently outperform a single modeling approach. Also, improvement is achieved even using small sizes of ensembles although a sufficient sample size offers more reliable predictions. Finally, this study recognizes that the effects of the basin characteristics varied or remained constant based on the low flow quantiles considered.

AB ( )Proper soil hydraulic functions of the water retention curve (the WRC) and relative hydraulic conductivity (the RHC) are essential for studies of unsaturated groundwater flow in soils. Various mathematical expressions of these functions have been proposed, including the widely used van Genuchten-Mualem model combining the van Genuchten formula for the WRC and the Mualem formula for the RHC. Here we validate a model based on the van Genuchten function for the both WRC and RHC (termed the MVG model), against published experimental data covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam. The results show that the MVG model is more accurate and flexible than existing soil hydraulic functions, especially for predicting the RHC. The fitting of the model to the data also reveals a relationship of model parameters between the MVG-WRC and MVG-RHC functions. Both functions can be integrated and differentiated to attain simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow, for example, the wetting front pressure psi(f) used in the Green and Ampt model for ponded infiltration analysis and the characteristic length L-c as a key factor in determining various flow processes (e.g., drainage or evaporation) in unsaturated soils.

AB Flow regime is the key driver of the riverine ecology. This study proposes a novel hybrid methodology based on artificial intelligence (Al) techniques for quantifying riverine ecosystems requirements and delivering suitable flow regimes that sustain river and floodplain ecology through optimizing reservoir operation. This approach addresses issues to better fit riverine ecosystem requirements with existing human demands. We first explored and characterized the relationship between flow regimes and fish communities through a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN). Then the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was established for river flow management over the Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan. The ecosystem requirement took the form of maximizing fish diversity, which could be estimated by the hybrid ANN. The human requirement was to provide a higher satisfaction degree of water supply. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology could offer a number of diversified alternative strategies for reservoir operation and improve reservoir operational strategies producing downstream flows that could meet both human and ecosystem needs. Applications that make this methodology attractive to water resources managers benefit from the wide spread of Pareto-front (optimal) solutions allowing decision makers to easily determine the best compromise through the trade-off between reservoir operational strategies for human and ecosystem needs.

AB To clarify changes of residual air saturation under special (dynamic, nonequilibrium) conditions, the saturation-capillary pressure (S-p) relationship including the residual air saturation under consecutive drainage-imbibition cycles, generated by scheduled water level fluctuations, in an air-water two-phase sandy column was investigated. Water saturation and capillary pressure were measured online and recorded using TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) probes, T5 tensiometers and a datalogger. The results show that under dynamic flow conditions the residual air saturation changed suddenly from an unstable to a stable state with changes in initial air saturation during the series of imbibition cycles, and stable nonzero residual air saturation only occurred when the initial air saturation of the imbibition process exceeded 0.49, ca. double the value of the main imbibition process. Once stable residual air saturation was obtained, all the subsequent residual air saturations remained stable and constant in the following imbibition cycles. Before this threshold point, the residual air saturation gradually fell given sufficient imbibition time. The results also indicate that the unstable and stable residual air saturations were mainly due to discrete pore-scale air globules trapped in the interiors of pores and pore-network scale globules located in interconnected pores, respectively.

AB Drought is a severe and chronic natural hazard that deeply affects production and livelihoods. Its characteristics and propagation have been extensively discussed, but the effects of temperature, evapotranspiration, and runoff on drought under different carbon emission conditions are still worth considering. Combining with the release of the Sixth International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), datasets of multiple patterns were compared with observational datasets. The most available data were screened to verify the accuracy of CMIP6 and were used to determine global Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) to analyze global drought properties, such as frequency, duration, and spatial extent. According to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios, drought properties in the future were compared with those in the past and results were as follows: First, more accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data were provided by the CanEMS5, and more accurate soil moisture data were provided by the BCC-CSM2-MR. Second, in the 21st century, the frequency, duration and spatial extent of global drought in most areas would increase. Finally, the key influencing factor of drought would the evapotranspiration. The relationship among rainfall, runoff, and temperature was mutually binding. Overall, global droughts, in particular exceptional droughts, showed a progressive worsening of conditions and a marked increase in the future. This study provides a reference for exploring global drought changes under climate change and provides a basis for the application of the CMIP6.

TI An analytical framework for quantifying aquifer response time scales

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Groundwater surface-water interaction; Response time; Steady-state
ID DIFFUSIVITY; GROUNDWATER
AB A major challenge in studying coupled groundwater and surface-water interactions arises from the considerable difference in the response time scales of groundwater and surface-water systems affected by external forcings. Although coupled models representing the interaction of groundwater and surface-water systems have been studied for over a century, most have focused on groundwater quantity or quality issues rather than response time. In this study, we present an analytical framework, based on the concept of mean action time (MAT), to estimate the time scale required for groundwater systems to respond to changes in surface-water conditions. MAT can be used to estimate the transient response time scale by analyzing the governing mathematical model. This framework does not require any form of transient solution (either numerical or analytical) to the governing equation, yet it provides a closed form mathematical relationship for the response time as a function of the aquifer geometry, boundary conditions, and flow parameters. Our analysis indicates that aquifer systems have three fundamental time scales: (i) a time scale that depends on the intrinsic properties of the aquifer, (ii) a time scale that depends on the intrinsic properties of the boundary condition, and (iii) a time scale that depends on the properties of the entire system. We discuss two practical scenarios where MAT estimates provide useful insights and we test the MAT predictions using new laboratory-scale experimental data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Integration of models using shared state variables: Implementation in
   the regional hydrologic modelling system SIMGRO
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Integrated hydrologic modelling; Coupling method; SIMGRO
ID FLOW; GROUNDWATER; ZONE
AB SIMGRO is an integration hub that connects to diverse hydrologic models. Its coupling method aims to describe the hydrologic feedbacks adequately at an acceptable cost of the increased computational load. The achieved balance between accuracy and efficiency is investigated in the paper. The coupling method centres around a shared state variable of two connecting subsystems. A prime example of such a variable is the elevation of the phreatic surface that forms the natural demarcation between the saturated groundwater flow and the unsaturated flow in the soil. In our scheme the shared variable is alternately updated by the connecting submodels, with both models using the same combined storage relationship. This method has also been implemented for the linkage between the ponding water of column models and surface water models. Using a basin-scale model, the scheme was subjected to a time-step sensitivity analysis. Results were compared to a benchmark, for which we took the same scheme, but with a short time step of 0.125 d. Increasing the time step to 1 d caused a numerical error of less than 5% in the simulated regional design discharge. Errors in the simulated 95th percentile of highest groundwater levels are less than 0.05 m. The coupling method presented here is a key element of the Netherlands Hydrological Modelling Instrument. The current version involves half a million spatial units of 250 x 250 m. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, previous interpretations of the density-dependent flow and transport processes induced by pumping freshwater above denser saltwater in four laboratory sand-tank experiments are extended using numerical modelling. The numerical model captured the transition in dispersiveness of up-coning plumes observed in the laboratory (i.e. highly dispersive at early times tending to sharp-interfaces after saltwater reaches the well). This demonstrates the applicability of the velocity-dependent dispersion of the modelling code. In all four experiments, head-dependent flux boundary conditions were used to simulate the sand-tank side boundary conditions. The experimentally derived boundary conductance values indicate non-linear variations in the resistance to flow through side inflow ports between the different experiments. Nonetheless, linear boundary head-inflow relationships adequately reproduced laboratory up-coning. The numerical model was able to reproduce the laboratory results within a reasonable level of accuracy and with minimal calibration of model parameters for three of the four experiments. This serves to validate those particular laboratory observations. The "double-peak" up-coning observed late in the fourth laboratory experiment was not reproduced by the model. Further analysis considering adsorption of the Rhodamine tracer is suggested to explore the cause of this effect. Numerical modelling results were compared to an existing sharp-interface analytical solution, which corresponded well with the numerical modelling results for early stages of the four up-coning experiments, despite the dominant influence of dispersion at early times.

AB In order to bring some understanding on the mountain stream dynamics, we report measurements of flow and sediment transport leveled in a proglacial gravel-bed river, the "torrent de St Pierre" in the French Alps. The river exhibits a modest discharge (< 5 m(3)/s) during most of the glacier melting season. A braiding plain developed thanks to the occurrence of a massive landslide, providing a small and simplified study area quite similar to recent experimental studies. A mass balance was established at the outlet of the braiding plain. Our measurements indicate that, in the range of flows measured, the dominating transport mode is suspension. Though less important, bed load transport is far from being negligible. Dissolved load eventually appears to be very small compared to solid transport. Analysis of velocity profile measurements shows that in this highly turbulent and shallow stream, the use of a logarithmic form fails to recover the velocity profile and to estimate the shear velocity of the flow. A uniform Chezy-Like relationship is shown to be valid for the velocity with friction a coefficient considered as constant over the range of our measurements. Accordingly, the only relevant velocity for transport description is the average velocity. Coupled measurements of bed load and velocity show that bed load transport is related to the average velocity through a power taw. Eventually, a correlation between bed load transport and suspended load transport is evidenced and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the variability and predominant drivers of water level fluctuations in large water bodies is critical for the development of proactive mitigation plans in the nearshore zone. Here, for the first time, we reconstructed the individual and collective influence of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, region 3.4 of El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation on Lake Huron-Michigan's water budget components, including water levels, over-lake precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and river flow rates over a 115-year period. Conducting wavelet spectral analysis on the reconstructed impact of large-scale climate oscillations revealed the emergence of quasi-periodic and non-stationary fluctuations along with frequency shifts in hydrological variables, highlighting their increasingly stronger signature on water levels after 1980. After removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects, the residual hydrological time series provided evidence of gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation, reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities on the regional water cycle over the past decades. Considering the uncertainty pertaining to the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric teleconnections in a changing climate, the findings of our study can offer a new perspective in our understanding of the drivers of water level variability along the shoreline and/or the navigability of shallow waters in the Great Lakes.

However, the response of hydrological processes to vegetation greening at different catchments remains unclear. This study identified the impact of vegetation changes on runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (ET), and soil water storage (SW), as well as their relationships and sensitivities based on a coupled SWAT-PML model for 23 catchments from 2000 to 2018 in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Results show that leaf area index (LAI) was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in 72.2% of the YRB area. Vegetation greening decreased SW and Q, but increased ET in all catchments. The effects of vegetation greening on Q and ET were contrasting with axisymmetric fluctuation distribution. The changes in SW, ET, and Q were strongly correlated with the changes in LAI. Sensitivity of the changes in ET and Q to LAI changes increased when the climate becomes drier. Our study suggests that the vegetation greening followed by the afforestation policy implementation has caused gradually increasing impacts on Q and ET. However, such effects are spatially heterogeneous due to different degrees of increase in LAI and aridity conditions. Given the water crisis problem in the YRB, afforestation activity should be taken into consideration of the increasing water demand and the negative effects of vegetation greening on water resources in the future.

AB Microalgal abundance and community composition are important aspects impacting carbon sequestration in aquatic karst ecosystems. At present the relationship between Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations and microalgal communities specifically in aquatic karst environments is not well understood. In this study, the microalgal and bacterial community structures were investigated in the aquatic karst environments with different Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations in a watershed of the Huixian karst wetland, Guilin, China. Community analysis was based on the use of Illumina sequencing of 23S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes, respectively. The results showed that eukaryotic microalgae were dominant at sites with high concentrations of HCO3- and Ca2+, while cyanobacteria were the major microalgae at sites with low concentrations of HCO3- and Ca2+. Cyanobium was the most dominant Cyanobacterial genus with a relatively high abundance in karst water samples. The microalgal community was affected by the concentrations of Ca2+ and HCO3-, nitrogen sources (concentrations of ammonium and nitrate especially), and bacterial diversity and community composition. Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria were the major bacterial classes associated with microalgae. The water carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of Chlorella, which was the dominant genus in the microalgal community. The data suggest that Chlorella may play a leading role in CA activity and carbon stabilization capacity of microalgal communities in this aquatic karst ecosystem.

AB No attempts have been found on dealing with a set of non-competitive (or leader-follower-interactive) objectives when performing optimal groundwater remediation management. This study presents a multi-level nonlinear simulation-optimization (ML-NSO) model for groundwater remediation management when objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels. This model is formulated by integrating health-risk assessment (at the residential concern level), energy assessment (at the energy concern level) and contamination forecasting (at the environmental concern level) within a general framework. The capabilities and effectiveness of the developed model are illustrated through a real-world case located at Cantuar, Saskatchewan in Canada. Results facilitate (a) generating non-compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction, (b) displaying the distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks for human health, and estimating the corresponding energy consumption, (c) resolving of conflicts and interactions among residential, energy, and environmental requirements. Moreover, the performance of ML-NSO model is enhanced by comparing with the single-level and multi-objective (SL-NSO and MO-NSO) models. Results show that ML-NSO model would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost The ML-NSO model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies with considering the leader-follower relationship within system.

ID TRACK 2; WATER; CONFLICT
AB Hydro-diplomacy conversations have up till now been generally state- and basin-centric, focused on formal international relations and transboundary rivers. This paper applies the notion of water diplomacy to a project in rural Southwest Morocco in order to interrogate the scalar potential of water-based environmental peace-building.
   In the Ait Baamrane region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, a local non-profit oversees the world's largest operational fog-harvesting system, piping potable water collected from the mountains' extensive fog cover to 13 Amazigh villages. Dar Si Hmad's related Ethnographic Field School leverages the fog project's uniqueness to attract scholars to an underrepresented region, where research programming questions mainstream narratives of Morocco and sustainable development while exploring how traditional knowledges can be integrated in scientific innovation.
   This paper argues that, by intentionally using fog to facilitate collaborative exchange, Dar Si Hmad is engaging in a form of hydro-diplomacy. Drawing from ethnographic data and building on international relations theories of Track Diplomacy, this paper demonstrates how fog water is being used to lay the groundwork for durable peace, intercultural understanding, and symbiotic growth. Such local iterations of hydro-diplomacy should be better understood and integrated with the emerging literature on state-to-state water cooperation in order to develop holistic expertise, share best practices, and promote positive policy interventions.

AB A new technique for gauge-only precipitation analysis for improved estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation is described and evaluated. The technique is based on a novel extension of classical optimal linear estimation theory in which, in addition to error variance, Type-II conditional bias (CB) is explicitly minimized. When cast in the form of well-known kriging, the methodology yields a new kriging estimator, referred to as CB-penalized kriging (CBPK). CBPK, however, tends to yield negative estimates in areas of no or light precipitation. To address this, an extension of CBPK, referred to herein as extended conditional bias penalized kriging (ECBPK), has been developed which combines the CBPK estimate with a trivial estimate of zero precipitation. To evaluate ECBPK, we carried out real-world and synthetic experiments in which ECBPK and the gauge-only precipitation analysis procedure used in the NWS's Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) were compared for estimation of point precipitation and mean areal precipitation (MAP), respectively. The results indicate that ECBPK improves hourly gauge-only estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation significantly. The improvement is particularly large for estimation of MAP for a range of combinations of basin size and rain gauge network density. This paper describes the technique, summarizes the results and shares ideas for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID 3 GORGES DAM; EVOLUTION; DISCHARGE; CHANNELS; REACH
AB River networks of deltas are complex systems, responsible for the transport of water, sediment and nutrients between land and sea. Topological complexity, dynamic complexity and flux vulnerability are three characteristics to describe the material transport within a deltaic river network, and they reflect the channel number and connectivity, flux distribution, and sensitivity of flux to external disturbances, respectively. Here, graph theory was applied to estimate the three characteristics of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 1977 and 2008, when the human-induced uneven riverbed downcutting occurred on a large scale. By identifying the channels through which water flows from the apex to each outlet, the eight subnetworks corresponding to the eight outlets were distinguished. Although the topological complexity changes little during this period, the dynamic complexity and vulnerability have great adjustments. The dynamic complexity greatly decreases in the subnetworks that have larger riverbed downcutting comparing to their adjacent subnetworks. We further reveal the positive relation between the decrease in dynamic complexity and human-induced riverbed downcutting under the same topological complexity. Moreover, the local vulnerabilities of channels with relatively high riverbed downcutting increase, leading to the emergence of "high vulnerability channels ". These findings suggest that the human induced uneven riverbed downcutting is the main reason for the adjustments of dynamic complexity and vulnerability. The results obtained from this study may provide scientific guidance for the further development and utilization in the PRD and other deltaic river systems worldwide subject to intensive human intervention.

AB Instream plants, which act as biological processors, have emerged as potentially advantageous eco-morphologic tools to be used in river management and restoration. Most of the study on the geomorphic role of vegetation as it interacts with flow and sediment has focused on local patch-scale dynamics. In this study, we present flume experiments aimed at improving our understanding of how vegetation patches link together to impact reach scale hydraulics and suspended sediment transport and disposition. On the hydraulics side, we investigate a) the relationship between the imposed instream vegetation configuration and water surface slopes, b) the secondary flow patterns which arise because of the imposed vegetative obstructions, and c) the role of vegetative resistance on residence time within reach. We also examine how different vegetation arrangements determine the patterns, quantity, and caliber of suspended sediment deposited in the flume. A key result of vegetation within the channel is the overall non-uniformity in flow conditions it imposes upstream, within, and downstream of the vegetated reach. At steady-state, vegetated patches locally increase the resistance, leading to a backwater condition upstream of the patch and high water-surface slopes within the patch. In general, this leads to enhanced deposition of suspended sediment upstream of the patch and reduced deposition within the patch relative to a case with no vegetation at all.

AB Estimates of CO2 flux from rivers are uncertain due to limited measurements at high-resolution. In addition, precipitation may impact diurnal variation of riverine CO2 flux but the processes controlling those impacts are unknown. Here, we examine the diurnal characteristics of some physicochemical parameters, meteorological parameters, water level, delta C-13(DIC) values, and the CO2 emission flux at two transects (DM and PY) of a typical karst river (Lijiang River, LJR), southwest China, during May 13-16, 2017. Our results show significant correlations between CO2 flux, DO, pCO(2), and delta C-13(DIC) and reflect control of CO2 flux diel pattern (decreasing during daytime and increasing at night) by metabolic processes of aquatic plants. The amplitude of CO2 flux diel pattern is weakened at DM. In contrast, diurnal pattern are interrupted at PY by the precipitation, and afterwards controlled by water level due to the significant positive correlation between water level and CO2 flux. Certainly, this amplitude will return to prestorm values as the water level recovered. We suggest that effects of precipitation on regional CO2 efflux estimate require scaling water level and CO2 flux with a linear relationship, and converting hourly flux to daily flux (alpha values) to improve the estimate of CO2 flux diel cycle. These methods will optimize sampling monitoring strategies and provide more reliable estimates of regional riverine CO2 emissions.

AB The past century has seen significant research comparing snow accumulation and ablation in forested and open sites. In this review we compile and standardize the results of previous empirical studies to generate statistical relations between changes in forest cover and the associated changes in snow accumulation and ablation rate. The analysis drew upon 33 articles documenting these relationships at 65 individual sites in North America and Europe from the 1930s to present. Changes in forest cover explained 57% and 72% of the variance of relative changes in snow accumulation and ablation, respectively. The incorporation of geographic and average historic climatic information did not significantly improve the ability to predict changes in snow processes, mainly because most of the studies did not provide enough information on site characteristics such as slope and aspect or meteorological conditions taking place during the experiments. Two simple linear models using forest cover as the sole predictor of changes in snow accumulation and ablation are provided, as well as a review of the main sources of variation that prevent the elaboration of more accurate multiple regression models. Further studies should provide detailed information regarding the main sources of variation influencing snow processes including the effect of year-to-year changes in weather variables during the monitoring period.

AB Stable isotopes of water, oxygen-18 and deuterium, were measured at biweekly to monthly intervals during the open-water season in a small, headwater lake (Pocket Lake, 4.8 ha) near Yellowknife Northwest Territories, and concurrently in a nearby string-of-lakes watershed (Baker Creek, 137 km(2)) situated in the subarctic Precambrian Shield region. As measured in water samples collected over a 12 year period (1997-2008), the levels of evaporative isotopic enrichment in both lake and watershed outflow were differentially offset, and seasonal variations were found in both to be driven by variations in open-water evaporation. Systematic differences measured in the magnitude of the offset between the lake and watershed outflow are interpreted as being caused by changes in the effective drainage area contributing to runoff. Based on the observed and extremely consistent relationship between isotopic compositions of lake water and watershed outflow (r(2) = 0.849, p < 0.001) we extend the analysis of open-water evaporation losses and effective drainage areas back to 1991 when less-frequent water sampling at the sites commenced. This 18-year record serves to demonstrate for the first time the expected variability in the evaporation and transpiration partitioning, upper limits on the effective drainage area, and isotopic signals transferred downstream in a typical shield drainage system within the Mackenzie Basin.

AB A reliable estimation of hydrological extremes with potentially severe socio-economic impacts is of crucial importance for efficient planning and design of hydraulic structures. Extreme value theory provides a firm theoretical foundation for the statistical modelling of extreme hydrological events. The dilemma in the modelling is on whether to use block maxima (BM) or peak-over-threshold (POT) method, each with its own cons and pros. It remains unexplored to what extent future projected changes in extreme hydrological events are influenced by the method choice, especially when some simplifications are made to lessen the computational burden for largescale studies. This study addresses this research question by a comparative analysis between the BM and POT methods on future climate change impact on global flood and extreme precipitation. The extreme precipitation analysis is performed using 24 CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs), while the flood analysis is based on a multi-model ensemble of 20 members including five global impact models forced by four CMIP5 GCMs. The results reveal that the BM and POT methods agree on the sign of changes in flood and extreme precipitation intensities, but disagree on the magnitude. The discrepancy between the BM and POT results increases with event extremity. The difference also varies with season, where the difference in the global land area with increasing signals peaks in winter at the rates of 11% for extreme precipitation and in summer at the rates of 3.5% for flood.

AB Quantification of uncertainty of hydrological models has attracted much attention in hydrologic research in recent years. Many methods for quantification of uncertainty have been reported in the literature, of which GLUE and formal Bayesian method are the two most popular methods. There have been many discussions in the literature concerning differences between these two methods in theory (mathematics) and results, and this paper focuses on the computational efficiency and differences in their results, but not on philosophies and mathematical rigor that both methods rely on. By assessing parameter and modeling uncertainty of a simple conceptual water balance model (WASMOD) with the use of GLUE and formal Bayesian method, the paper evaluates differences in the results of the two methods and discusses the reasons for these differences. The main findings of the study are that: (1) the parameter posterior distributions generated by the Bayesian method are slightly less scattered than those by the GLUE method; (2) using a higher threshold value (>0.8) GLUE results in very similar estimates of parameter and model uncertainty as does the Bayesian method; and (3) GLUE is sensitive to the threshold value used to select behavioral parameter sets and lower threshold values resulting in a wider uncertainty interval of the posterior distribution of parameters, and a wider confidence interval of model uncertainty. More study is needed to generalize the findings of the present study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heterogeneous water flow and solute transport in soils are an important phenomenon and difficult to be characterized. The objectives of this study were to investigate the heterogeneity of solute transport related to heterogeneous soil water flow using dye infiltration experiments, and to characterize heterogeneous water flow and solute transport in soils using the information theory. Field experiments of dye infiltration were performed in four plots. Various information measures were applied to characterize information content and complexity of water flow and solute transport in soils. Information contents and complexities of the maximum and apparent infiltration depths, and the mean and standard deviation of concentrations in the vertical direction of the plots were calculated. More heterogeneous processes of soil water flow and transport result in higher information/complexity values. The probability distributions of mean concentration were similar to those of the corresponding apparent infiltration depths for the plots, indicating that heterogeneity of dye concentrations was closely related to that of soil water flow. However, the range of information entropy and complexity of the water flow sequences was much narrower than that of the sequences of the concentrations. The results suggested that the transport processes were more heterogeneous than the water flow processes. Compared with the probability distributions of flow parameters, the information measures appeared to be a more versatile tool to describe flow and transport heterogeneities in soils.

AB In this study, a MCMC-based maximum entropy copula (abbreviated as MCMC-MEC) method is developed for assessing drought risk under uncertainty. MCMC-MEC has advantages in analyzing the bivariate drought risk (i.e. duration and severity) through runs-theory, improving the fitting processes of drought variables based on maximum entropy, and reflecting the uncertainties in bivariate drought risk assessment through MCMC. Then, MCMC-MEC is applied to the Amu Darya River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid basin in Central Asia. Results disclose that, during 1935-2015, the study basin experienced about 42 drought events, average duration of each drought was 5 months (severity 4.38), and the most severe drought event lasted for 25.3 months (severity 27.9). Results also reveal that uncertainty in parameter of copula has effects on drought risk, and duration and severity would increase with confidence level of univariate drought probability. At confidence level of 0.9, the bivariate drought risk would be 4%-6% (duration >= 7.0 months and severity >= 5.8); at confidence level of 0.95, the drought risk would be 1%-2% (duration >= 10.0 months and severity >= 10.6). During 2005-2015, drought risk for the study basin was increased due to the decreasing precipitation and runoff, and their contribution rates to the drought risk were 55.8% and 44.2%, respectively. The findings are helpful for providing decision support of drought management and disaster prevention.

AB The prerequisites for groundwater pollution remediation include providing accurate identification of hydraulic parameters of the contaminated site and retrospecting pollution source release history from sparse and discrete observation data. However, expensive time running and high nonlinearity of groundwater solute transport simulation model hinder precise and fast identification. To overcome expensive running cost, a deep regularization neural network (DRNN) was introduced to emulate the highly nonlinear simulation model. A hybrid heuristic algorithm, integrating a particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a differential evolution markov chain (DEMC) method was employed to provide reliable identification results of pollution source characteristics and hydraulic parameters. In particular, DEMC conducted a global search and PSO performed a local search. To evaluate transferability for various groundwater pollution cases, the proposed method was utilized to provide an identification for a point source pollution case and a non-point source pollution case. The results indicated that DRNN was capable of emulating input-output relationship of a highly nonlinear and high time expense simulation model of two cases with a R-2 of 0.997 and 0.984, respectively, accelerating identification process. Furthermore, when the PSO was combined with DEMC, the optimization was accelerated while escaping from the local optimum, substantially improving the efficiency and accuracy of the identification task.

AB Agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries that are facing challenges of low efficiency of water resources utilization and of shrinking water supply. This study develops an optimization model for the allocation of agricultural irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), considering uncertainties of fluctuating water supply. Then, it assesses the impact of efficient water allocation on the sustainability and water scarcity under different levels of water supply. This study can help answer questions as to how to optimal allocate limited water supplies to different crops and different subareas under uncertainty to improve IWUE, how water shortage affects economic, social, and environmental aspects, and what the relationship between system sustainability and water shortage is. To demonstrate its feasibility, the proposed models are applied to an irrigation district in northeastern China. These models can also be applied to other regions that suffer from water scarcity. Results of application are found to be satisfactory for explaining the impact of agricultural irrigation water allocation on net economic benefit, water resources allocation equity, total greenhouse gas emissions, and water scarcity footprint under different water supply conditions. This study provides insights into tradeoffs amongst resources, economy, society, and environment in irrigated agricultural systems under uncertainty.

AB The multi-dimensional relationships that Indigenous peoples have with water are only recently gaining recognition in water policy and management activities. Although Australian water policy stipulates that the native title interests of Indigenous peoples and their social, cultural and spiritual objectives be included in water plans, improved rates of Indigenous access to water have been slow to eventuate, particularly in those regions where the water resource is fully developed or allocated. Experimentation in techniques and approaches to both identify and determine Indigenous water requirements will be needed if environmental assessment processes and water sharing plans are to explicitly account for Indigenous water values. Drawing on two multidisciplinary case studies conducted in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, we engage Indigenous communities to (i) understand their values and explore the application of methods to derive water requirements to meet those values; (ii) assess the impact of alternative water planning scenarios designed to address over-allocation to irrigation; and (iii) define additional volumes of water and potential works needed to meet identified Indigenous requirements. We provide a framework where Indigenous values can be identified and certain water needs quantified and advance a methodology to integrate Indigenous social, cultural and environmental objectives into environmental flow assessments.

AB The hydraulic conductivity (K) of the streambed is an important variable influencing water and solute exchange between streams and surrounding groundwater systems. However, there are few detailed data on spatial variability in streambed K and almost none on temporal variability. The spatial and temporal variability of streambed K in a North Carolina stream were investigated with 487 field measurements of K over a 1-year period. Measurements were made bimonthly from December 2005 to December 2006 at 46 measurement locations in a 262.5 m reach (the "large reach"). To give a more detailed picture of spatial variability, closely-spaced one-time measurements were made in two 62.5 m reaches (the "small reaches", one investigated in July 2006 and the other in August 2006) that were part of the large reach. Arithmetic mean K for the large reach was similar to 16 m/day (range was 0.01 to 66 m/day). Neither K nor InK was normally distributed, and K distributions appeared somewhat bimodal. There was significant spatial variability over horizontal length scales of a few m. Perhaps the clearest feature within this variability was the generally higher K in the center of the channel. This feature may be an important control on water and chemical fluxes through the streambed (e.g., other measurements show generally higher water seepage velocity, but lower porewater nitrate concentration, in the center of the streambed). Grain size analysis of streambed cores showed that layers of elevated fines (silt + clay) content were less common in the center of the channel (overall, the streambed was about 94% sand). Results also suggest a modest but discernable difference in average streambed K upstream and downstream of a small beaver dam: K was about 23% lower upstream, when the dam was present during the first few months of the study. This upstream/downstream difference in K disappeared after the dam collapsed, perhaps in response to re-mobilization of fine sediments or leaf matter that had accumulated in quiet waters ponded on the upstream side of the dam. Temporal variability was significant and followed a variety of different patterns at the 46 measurement locations in the large reach. Temperature data show that variation in streambed and groundwater temperature was not an important cause of the observed temporal variability in K. Measurements of changes in the elevation of the streambed surface suggest erosion and deposition played an important rote in causing the observed temporal variability in streambed K (of which the change described above following collapse of the beaver dam was a special case), though other potentially time-varying factors (e.g., gas content, bio-turbation, or biofilms in the streambed) were not explicitly addressed and cannot be ruled out as contributors to the temporal variability in streambed K. Temporal variability in streambed K merits additional study as a potentially important control on temporal variability in the magnitudes and spatial patterns of water and solute fluxes between groundwater and surface water. From the data available it seems appropriate to view streambed K as a dynamic attribute, variable in both space and time. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB River managers strive to use the best available science to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function. To achieve this goal requires consideration of processes at different scales. Metacommunity theory describes how multiple species from different communities potentially interact with local-scale environmental drivers to influence population dynamics and community structure. However, this body of knowledge has only rarely been used to inform management practices for river ecosystems. In this article, we present a conceptual model outlining how the metacommunity processes of local niche sorting and dispersal can influence the outcomes of management interventions and provide a series of specific recommendations for applying these ideas as well as research needs. In all cases, we identify situations where traditional approaches to riverine management could be enhanced by incorporating an understanding of metacommunity dynamics. A common theme is developing guidelines for assessing the metacommunity context of a site or region, evaluating how that context may affect the desired outcome, and incorporating that understanding into the planning process and methods used. To maximize the effectiveness of management activities, scientists, and resource managers should update the toolbox of approaches to riverine management to reflect theoretical advances in metacommunity ecology.

AB Understanding the mechanism of the interactions between vegetation dynamics and the water cycle is rather important for determining global and regional water and carbon budgets. In this paper, a physically-based model integrating land-surface hydrological and biogeochemical processes by coupling a hydrological model and a biogeochemical model is developed to simulate the water, energy and carbon fluxes. The model is validated against observed biometric, eddy-covariance flux, soil moisture and temperature data over two different ecosystems. Results show that the model could simulate the vegetation physiological and hydrological processes satisfactorily including net radiation, latent heat, gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture and temperature. Sensitivity analysis illustrates that evapotranspiration, GPP, net ecosystem production are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate, quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter. Moreover, results show that a close relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration. Water use efficiency shows a U-bend curve at different time steps and it also indicates a higher value in forest ecosystem than that of grass ecosystem. In the forest ecosystem, evapotranspiration is higher and the surface runoff is lower. Meanwhile it is almost carbon sink during the whole year, while in the grass ecosystem, it shows a carbon source during May to September. This study could provide an effective model for the simulation of water-carbon cycles.

AB The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health and composition of aquatic ecosystems, and together with flow, is recognised as one of the most influential abiotic drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution. Changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on-going human-induced climate change, hydrological, regional and structural factors. Here, we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of South Africa. We identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold-water adapted species' tolerance to thermal changes. More than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally, with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area. Thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher. Blephariceridae and Notonemouridae, the most thermophobic families, are likely to become locally threatened or extinct, in the absence of connectivity. The quantification of stream connectivity and vulnerability of organisms to thermal changes in river systems are important decision making tools for effective adaptive and holistic conservation planning strategies.

AB This study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real (historical) and counterfactual (natural) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Phase 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). A cluster analysis is implemented to select independent GCMs and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling. A two-step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine-scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations. Using the downscaled distribution parameters, the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2, 10, 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model for a case study in Antwerp city, Belgium. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding. The results show that the GEV parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation, providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes. A disagreement is found between the GCMs on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding, some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts, and some a lower one. It can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in Antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts.

AB This study presents a new concept that integrates the index-overlay method and a physical-based numerical model for predicting groundwater sustainability under various climate conditions and anthropogenic activities. The index-overlay DRASTIC method was modified with an analytical hierarchy process theory and employed to create groundwater vulnerability maps for the Pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern Taiwan. The physical-based MODFLOW model was used for predicting the dynamics of a basin-scale groundwater system. Solutions and calibrated hydrogeological parameters in the MODFLOW model provide feedback to the factors in the modified DRASTIC method which enables predicting groundwater vulnerability. In this study, different climate conditions were considered in the numerical model to obtain the changes in depth of water and net recharge for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and for evaluating the current state of the sustainability indicators. Results show that the depth of water and net recharge obtained from the groundwater model improve the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability prediction. The variations of future climate conditions have less influence on the variations of groundwater vulnerability because of the dense river network that controls the shallow groundwater levels in the Pingtung plain groundwater basin. Therefore, the influence of climate conditions on the risk of groundwater contamination is also relatively low. Based on the analysis of the sustainability indicators, we found that the groundwater resource system in the Pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition of high vulnerability.

AB Interactions between surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) have been identified as a major contributing factor to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff relationships. However, because existing rainfall-runoff models do not realistically account for these SW-GW interactions, they fail to robustly simulate runoff during multi-year droughts, especially in arid and semi-arid catchments that are relatively flat. Therefore, this study introduces a linked SW-GW modelling approach and tests it under different climatic conditions (Average, Dry and Wet periods) in two heterogeneous, semi-arid catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The linked SW-GW modelling approach includes a fully-distributed SW (i.e. rainfall-runoff) model (SWATgrid) and a three-dimensional finite-difference GW model (MODFLOW). The results show that the linked SW-GW modelling approach produces highly improved runoff simulations for the study catchments, especially during dry conditions. These findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for SW-GW interactions when conducting rainfall-runoff modelling and highlights that failing to do so will result in overestimation of runoff during droughts - this is salient given projections for hotter and drier futures in many semi-arid regions. Although the study is focused on SEA, the insights gained are highly applicable for water managers in any region that experience high hydroclimatic variability or change.

AB In an operational context, efficient decision-making is usually the ultimate objective of hydrometeorological forecasts. Because of the uncertainties that lay within the forecasting process, decisions are subject to uncertainty. A better quantification of uncertainties should provide better decisions, which often translate into optimal use and economic value of the forecasts. Six Early Warning Systems (EWS) based on contrasted forecasting systems are constructed to investigate how the quantification of uncertainties affects the quality of a decision. These systems differ by the location of the sources of uncertainty, and the total amount of uncertainty they take into account in the forecasting process. They are assessed with the Relative Economic Value (REV), which is a flexible measure to quantify the potential economic benefits of an EWS. The results show that all systems provide a gain over the case where no EWS is used. The most complex systems, i.e. those that consider more sources of uncertainty in the forecasting process, are those that showed the most reduced expected damages. Systems with better accuracy and reliability are generally the ones with higher REV, even though our analysis did not show a clear-cut relationship between overall forecast quality and REV in the context investigated.

AB Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global changes have largely altered the magnitude and distribution of evapotranspiration (ET), which in turn significantly impacts regional water availability and water partitioning, particularly in semi-arid areas, such as the Agricultural-Pastoral Ecotone in Northwest China (APENC). In this study, the Budyko framework was revised and applied at a finer spatio-temporal scale for the simulation and attribution of monthly ET variability in dry regions. As a holistic approach for modeling water partitioning, the revised Budyko framework (RBF) is expected to achieve parsimony of data input and model parameters. Application of the Budyko-based framework in the APENC showed an accurate ET simulation (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 3.45 mm/mon, NSE = 0.95), which is a better performance compared with two classical models, FAO crop coefficient model and Complimentary Relationship (CR) model with in situ observations. For the attribution of monthly ET variability, vegetation has the highest sensitivity coefficient, while the precipitation shows the largest actual contribution because of its larger variability. Subsequently, the RBF was assessed with two different groups of in situ observations in semi-arid areas with different environment and vegetation conditions, and showed credible results on ET simulation. This shows that the RBF with parsimony of model parameters is highly applicable in data lacking dry regions.

AB Data-driven models can achieve high accuracy and low computational cost without a priori knowledge of hydrological system, which have been successfully applied in streamflow forecasting for decades. However, it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models, especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes. In this paper, a new integrated framework for daily streamflow forecasting based on different flow regimes is developed. The framework integrates a Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering for streamflow regime identification, a partial mutual information (PMI) for input selection, Deep Belief Networks (DBN) for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes, and a rigorous validation process considering structure validity to interpret the physical processes simulated using the DBN models. The framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in USA, and the results show that the framework has significantly improved modelling performance (approximately 12%) compared to single data-driven models. The integration of data-driven models and physical process classification also leads to improved integration of physical understanding of the complex characteristic of different flow regimes into the modelling process, leading to overall improved confidence in the developed daily streamflow forecasting models.

AB Evaporation is one of the most important processes in the hydrologic cycle and is considered as one of the lead factors governing climate in terrestrial environments, particularly in arid areas. In natural open systems, evaporation should be considered as a time dependent function and a cumulative process. We applied and compared Craig-Gordon isotopic model with the Penman-Monteith physical evaporation model, after a biannual hydrologic cycle characterization in a natural semi-arid environment to determine annually reliable balance budgets and estimations. Our results show that isotopic evaporation rates reflect a sinusoidal behavior during isotopic fractioning rather than a lineal and constant evaporation rate. This sinusoidal behavior exhibits the influence of solar radiation and other meteorological variables that have not yet been considered in the C-G isotopic mass balance model. The estimation of isotopic evaporation in natural environments are reliable during the dry season while estimations of isotopic loss fraction (f) in the wet season behave as an isotopic mixing model of evaporated water-precipitation-runoff. Physical and isotopic methodologies are difficult to relate due to basic fundamentals and development conceptualizations: accordingly, further work is required to enhance the Craig-Gordon and Gonfiantini evaporation model and its relationship with physical methodologies in order to improve the estimation of evaporation in natural semiarid environments.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) at the ecosystem level is an important ecophysiological index reflecting the coupling relationship between water and carbon cycles. CO2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance method during the period 2006-2010 over a warm-temperate mixed plantation in the North China. The seasonal and interannual variations of gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and ecosystem WUE were analyzed, and the impacts of climatic variables and soil moisture on GPP, ET and WUE were discussed. At the monthly scale, GPP and ET had similar relations with solar radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation. It is suggested that photosynthesis and evapotranspiration were driven by climatic variables at the approximately equal strength. During the growing season, VVUE decreased significantly with the increase of VPD and solar radiation. Cloudiness can improve photosynthesis and enhance VVUE. GPP was 9-39% greater but ET was 8-26% lower under cloudy sky conditions than that under sunny sky conditions. Therefore, WUE was 29-72% higher under cloudy skies in comparison with that under sunny skies. Annual average VVUE ranged from 1.76 to 2.41 g C kg(-1) H2O. The major driver of interannual variability in WUE was soil water content in May. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate Impact Response Functions (CIRFs) can be useful for exploring potential risks of system failure under climate change. The performance of a water resource system can be synthesized through a CIRF that relates climate conditions to system behavior in terms of a specified threshold of deliveries to demands or environmental flow requirements. However, in highly regulated water resource systems this relationship may be quite complex, depending on storage capacity and system operation. In this paper we define a CIRF for these types of systems through a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model where a binary variable (system response) is explained by two continuous variables or predictors (precipitation and temperature). The approach involves generating multivariate synthetic inflow time series and relating them to specific climate conditions. Next, these inflows are used as inputs in a water management model, and the outcome is coded as a binary variable (failure or its absence) depending on selected vulnerability criteria. To identify the time span before the failure event in which climate variables are relevant, we characterized drought development stages through relative standardized indices. Mean values of precipitation and temperature for the selected time span are computed and used as explanatory variables through a LR model, which is validated using data from several climate models and scenarios. Results show that the predictive capacity of LR models is acceptable, so that they could be used as screening tools to detect challenging climate conditions for the system which would require adaption actions.

AB Budyko's treatment of the long-term water balance of watersheds was based on the competition between water availability and energy supply. It assumes, in the long-term, that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible. For arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables, however, groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation. In this study, we present a new Budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by Aver'yanov's equation and abed model, respectively. The use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption. For the application of the Budyko equation in unsteady state areas, equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of precipitation as water availability. With the newly defined water availability, the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index was described successfully by Budyko curves, otherwise the points exceeded Budyko domain with only precipitation and irrigation considered. Furthermore, for agricultural irrigation areas, the variation of seasonal to is supposed to be affected by vegetation coverage (denoted by NDVI). Overall, it is possible to estimate regional actual seasonal and annual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas with shallow groundwater using the extended Budyko models. This new method can play significant role in water management in arid and semiarid agricultural regions.

AB Long term skillful prediction of prolonged hydrologic anomalies is essential for proper planning to reduce the societal risk of extreme hydrological anomalies such as drought. Climate indices estimated from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of the Pacific and Indian Oceans are often used to predict monthly and seasonal rainfall in Australia and many other places around the world. This study investigates the merit of distorting the time aggregation of such indices before casting them in a predictive model. Aggregated climate indices are used to predict sustained drought and wet anomalies characterised here using a drought index (i.e. Standardize Precipitation Index, SPI) as response and the Australia as the study region of interest. The aim is to enhance the strength of relationships of drought index and climate indices (predictors) by tuning the frequency of climate predictors using an aggregation technique. Result shows that aggregated climate indices provide significant improvement in prediction of SPI over raw climate indices across Australia. As strong spatial variations in optimum aggregation window lengths are evident across Australia suggesting multiple candidate predictive models with similar accuracies, a model combination approach is also adopted. Model combination is found useful in reducing structural uncertainty and further improving the prediction efficiency. Given that the improved predictive accuracy for SSTA the current generation of climate models exhibit, the methodology developed in this study has significant implications for skillful prediction and projection of long term droughts.

   variation; Watershed memory

AB We introduce a new approach for improving estimates of water balance components, applicable to a multi-period water balance series for a lake, watershed, or other area of any size. It consists of making use of statistical relationships between a component series estimate and the residual errors of the water mass balance series. Through this approach, two novel specific techniques are developed. The first, 'pre cipitation-decorrelation', entails implementing a criterion of decorrelation of residual errors from precipitation estimates. The second, 'residual-redistribution', consists of redistributing each residual error over initial water balance component estimates, in accord with an error minimization criterion for each component series. Efficacy is tested using series of annual water balances for the Tahoe Basin. Upon implementation of precipitation-decorrelation, a tightly bounded statistical estimate of mean annual Lake Tahoe evaporation is obtained, which closely matches independent measurement-based estimates. Residual-redistribution yields revised estimates of annual series of Tahoe areal precipitation and watershed runoff, which are each shown to have substantially reduced random error variance. Highly precise revised estimates of inter-annual variations in Tahoe precipitation have enabled resolution of the watershed multi-year 'memory' of precipitation, and more reliable separation of inter-annual changes in watershed storage from inter-annual variations in atmospheric loss.

AB The travel-time distribution between rivers and groundwater observation points and the mixing of freshly infiltrated river water with groundwater of other origin is of high relevance in riverbank filtration. These characteristics usually are inferred from the analysis of natural-tracer time series, typically relying on a stationary input-output relationship. However, non-stationarity is a significant feature of the riparian zone causing time-varying river-to-groundwater transfer functions. We present a non-stationary extension of nonparametric deconvolution by performing stationary deconvolution with windowed time series, enforcing smoothness of the determined transfer function in time and travel time. The nonparametric approach facilitates the identification of unconventional features in travel-time distributions, such as broad peaks, and the sliding-window approach is an easy way to accommodate the method to dynamic changes of the system under consideration. By this, we obtain time-varying signal-recovery rates and travel-time distributions, from which we derive the mean travel time and the spread of the distribution as function of time. We apply our method to electric-conductivity data collected at River Thur, Switzerland, and adjacent piezometers. The non-stationary approach reproduces the groundwater observations significantly better than the stationary one, both in terms of overall metrics and in matching individual peaks. We compare characteristics of the transient transfer function to base flow which indicates shorter travel times at higher river stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater drawdown and strata settlements induced by dewatering in confined aquifers can be relieved by artificial recharge. In this study, numerical simulations of a field multi-well pumping recharge test in a deep confined aquifer are conducted to analyze the responses of groundwater and strata to pumping and recharge. A three-dimensional numerical model is developed in a finite difference software, which considers the fluid-mechanical interaction using the Biot consolidation theory. The predicted groundwater drawdown and ground settlements are compared to the measured data to confirm the validation of the numerical analysis of the pumping and recharge. Both numerical results and measured data indicate that the effect of recharge on controlling the groundwater drawdown and strata settlements correlates with the injection rate and well arrangements. Since the groundwater draw down induced by pumping can be controlled by artificial recharge, soil compression can be relieved by reducing the changes of effective stress of the soils. Consequently, strata settlement induced by pumping can be relieved by artificial recharge and ground settlements can be eliminated if an appropriate injection rate and well arrangement are being determined. Moreover, the changes of the pore pressure and seepage force induced by pumping and recharge will also result in significant horizontal deformations in the strata near the recharge wells.

ID SORPTIVITY
AB A single-ring permeameter is suitable for measurement of soil hydraulic conductivity at a large-field scale because of its simple structure, easy operation, portability, small amount of recharging water and particularly because of its variable radius. The authors established a simple single-ring permeameter which consists of a hollow cylinder that is simply inserted into the top soil. Based on the theories of the Philip and Nestingen methods for single-ring permeameter tests, this paper presents new equations for describing 1-D infiltration within the inserted depth of the single-ring infiltrometer and 3-D flow beyond the depth under both gravity and soil suction forces. The soil hydraulic parameters of hydraulic conductivity and soil suction were optimized based on the declines of the ponded water depth within the single-ring cylinder. The new method was validated using numerical simulations of the declines of the water column within the cylinder through the variably saturated flow MODFLOW (VSF-MODFLOW). The new method was then successfully applied in laboratory troughs and on a hillslope in Huanjiang County, northwest Guangxi in southwest China. The results demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity determined by the new method is more accurate than those from the 1-D Green-Ampt method and the 3-D Nestingen method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

DE Sandy loess; Permeability; Collapsibility; Water dissipation
ID DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS; COLLAPSE
AB To explore the permeability and collapsibility characteristics of sandy loess in northern Loess Plateau of China, the in-situ tests were carried out by monitoring information of moisture content and collapse deformation in the soil layers. The laws in conditions of simulated rainfall infiltration and saturated infiltration were compared and analyzed. The main results are as follows. (1) The water infiltrates with funnel-shaped. The moisture content decreases with the increase of depth under simulated rainfall infiltration. All sandy loess layers can be nearly saturated under saturated infiltration. (2) The water infiltrating in sandy loess site is fast. The infiltration rate decreases with depth as a power function. (3) The proportion of water lateral migration in sandy loess site is small. For simulated rainfall infiltration, the development of cracks experienced three stages of appearing, expanding and keeping. For saturated infiltration, the development of cracks experienced the process of appearing, expanding, local small cracks cutting the main cracks and the later cracks developing makes the early cracks have trend of bending and closing. (4) The differential collapse deformation is most obvious near the test pit boundary and the maximum collapse deformation occurs in the test pit center. The collapse deformation caused by rainfall infiltration is only 11.6% of saturated infiltration. (5) Two conditions must be satisfied at the same time to fully activate the collapsibility of sandy loess. Firstly, the moisture content variation reaches the initial collapse threshold of moisture content increment. Secondly, the moisture state reaching the initial collapse moisture content increment must be kept for enough time. (6) The evaluation of site collapsibility type and the calculation of ground collapsibility value can be carried out according to the formula Delta(s) = Sigma(n)(i=1)alpha beta delta(si)h(i), parameter beta and alpha is selected according to the evaluation type, application condition and depth. (7) The seepage force drives the silt components moving and changes the original structure of sandy loess, which makes the water holding capacity in infiltration stage and water loss capacity in dissipation stage shows in layered distribution along the depth. (8) The water dissipation of sandy loess site is accompanied by settlement and lasts for a long time. The water dissipation rate decreased exponentially with time. In practical application, the adverse effect of water dissipation on ground deformation and pile bearing capacity cannot be ignored. The research finally provides a new understanding for the mechanism of water physical action and deformation response of sandy loess. It is of great significance for correcting and adding the evaluation method of site collapsibility type and ground collapsibility value in sandy loess areas.

AB Determining the maximum pumping rate (i.e., the maximum allowable pumping rate that does not cause seawater intrusion into the well under the steady-state condition) of a well is the key for sustainable management of coastal aquifers, as overexploitation of coastal aquifers could lead to the widespread occurrence of aquifer salinization (i.e., seawater intrusion). In this study, we develop steady-state analytical solutions to describe seawater intrusion and the maximum pumping rate of a well located in unconfined coastal aquifers bounded by L-shaped coastlines. Rectangular coastal aquifers bounded by two orthogonal constant-head boundaries (i.e., two coastlines) and two orthogonal no-flow inland boundaries are assumed in conceptual models, where replen-ishment of aquifers is via surface recharge. Analytical solutions are derived by the potential theory and the conformal mapping method, and validated by variable-density flow numerical simulations. It is found that analytical solutions based on the sharp-interface approximation overestimate seawater intrusion and underes-timate the maximum pumping rate. An acceptable, conservative maximum pumping rate is obtained by using the correction factor proposed by Lu and Werner (2013). Moreover, the sensitivity of the well location on the maximum pumping rate is investigated, showing that an optimal well location exists. Analytical solutions developed in the current study provide a convenient tool for assessing pumping effects in coastal aquifers bounded by L-shaped coastlines, servicing to various management objectives.

AB Data assimilation plays an essential role in real-time forecasting but demands repetitive model evaluations given ensembles. To address this computational challenge, a novel, robust and efficient approach to surrogate data assimilation is presented. It replaces the internal processes of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) theory. Eight types of surrogate filters, which can be characterized according to their different surrogate structures, building systems, and assimilating targets, are proposed and validated. To compensate for the potential shortcomings of the existing sequential experimental design (SED), an advanced optimization scheme, named sequential experimental design-polynomial degree (SED-PD), is also advised. Its dual optimization system resolves the issue of SED by which the value of the polynomial degree had to be selected ad-hoc or by trial and error; its multiple stopping criteria ensure convergence even when an accuracy metric does not monotonically decrease over iterations. A comprehensive investigation into how to configure a surrogate filter indicates that the new partial (replacing part of original filters) and invariant (valid for entire time periods) approaches are preferred in terms of accuracy and efficiency, which helps directly reduce the number of dimensions and bridge the gap between hindcasting and real-time forecasting. Of the eight filters, the Dual Invariant Partial filter performs best, with equivalent accuracy to Dual EnKF and about 500 times greater computational efficiency. Ultimately, this proposed surrogate filter will be a promising alternative tool for performing computationally-intensive data assimilation in high-dimensional problems.

AB In this work, the influence of non-equilibrium effects on solute transport in a weakly heterogeneous medium is discussed. Three macro-scale models (upscaled via the volume averaging technique) are investigated: (i) the two-equation non-equilibrium model, (ii) the one-equation asymptotic model and (iii) the one-equation local equilibrium model. The relevance of each of these models to the experimental system conditions (duration of the pulse injection, dispersivity values ... ) is analyzed. The numerical results predicted by these macroscale models are compared directly with the experimental data (breakthrough curves). Our results suggest that the preasymptotic zone (for which a non-Fickian model is required) increases as the solute input pulse time decreases. Beyond this limit, the asymptotic regime is recovered. A comparison with the results issued from the stochastic theory for this regime is performed. Results predicted by both approaches (volume averaging method and stochastic analysis) are found to be consistent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall-runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones (TCs) for probabilistic risk analysis. Due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high-fidelity ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall-runoff, a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind- and pressure-field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models. This builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge, and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from TCs. The utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic TC flood risk products, which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account TC associated rainfall-runoff. Results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge as compared to the Federal Emergency Management Association's (FEMAs) current practices.

AB Accurate estimation of groundwater recharge in regions with limited water and thick unsaturated zones is challenging because of the limited water flux. This study aims to employ multiple tracers and methods to investigate the mechanism of groundwater recharge in the thick loess deposits of China. We collected soil samples under different vegetation, unconfined groundwater, and precipitation to determine the water isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18, and H-3), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-). Then, these tracers were employed to estimate recharge rates with methods considering the differences in shallow- and deep-rooted vegetation, as well as those in unsaturated and saturated zones. Results indicated that local precipitation predominantly recharges groundwater through matrix flow at a velocity of 14.5 cm year(-1) with the residence time of > 200 years. The recharge rates range from 0 to 37 mm year(-1) equivalent to 0-7% of annual average precipitation. However, the deep-rooted vegetation greatly reduced deep drainage compared with shallow-rooted vegetation, which will perturb the current hydraulic connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones. The multiple tracers and methods can complement each other to enhance the understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms. The indicated relationship between recharge form and land use suggests the urgency in developing strategies to balance the agroforestry system and water resource sustainability.

AB Hydrodynamic models have been increasingly applied to urban flood simulations, but still encounter challenges because of complicated urban landscapes, buildings and structures, as well as insufficient sewer data. In order to improve the applicability in real-life urban environments, a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood risk assessment (DHMUrban) is developed in this study. It is based on the two-dimensional shallow water flow equations simplified by neglecting the convection terms in the momentum equations. The sharp variation of ground surface often happening in urban areas is specially treated with the broad-crested weir flow equation. The rainfall, infiltration and sewer drainage are considered at each overland cell. Two connection approaches between the overland model and the sewer model are proposed depending on the availability of sewer data. The overland cells and the sewer nodes are connected physically in areas with complete sewer data, and connected conceptually through a drainage relationship in areas where sewer data are insufficient or unavailable. The present model has been evaluated in five cases, showing comparable reliability and stability. It has been applied to a real-life urban catchment in Shenzhen City, and demonstrated to be capable of presenting well the ground surface flooding, adapting adequately to the real-life urban areas with different data availability and providing practical and reliable solutions for urban storm flood risk assessments.

AB A region of influence approach in which statistical depth functions are used to select gauged catchments having similar flood generation behaviour to a given ungauged basin coupled with nonparametric regression on catchment characteristics is employed to estimate mean annual and a quantile flood of 100 year return period in New Zealand basins. This approach may be applied internationally. Relative and root mean square errors assessed by jack-knife resampling are too large to be useful for detailed design in ungauged catchments but are much smaller than those resulting from a conventional multiple nonlinear regression approach. The distribution of errors for samples of sites indicates that large error values result from contributions from a relatively small number of statistical outliers Although these are all natural catchments, the outlier basins have particular physical characteristics such as moraines, karst features and pumice sediments which affect their flood generation processes. Relative errors in estimates for an ungauged basin may be predicted using a relationship involving differences in area, rainfall and statistical depth between the ungauged catchment and gauged similar catchments. Improved analytical techniques and selection and measurement of catchment characteristics should reduce error magnitude but not perhaps sufficiently for use in detailed design. Parallel development based on rainfall-runoff models is desirable but the present lack of requisite information largely concerning rainfalls means that attainment of desired accuracy is a distant prospect.

AB Spectral induced polarization (SIP) is considered as a promising tool in environmental investigations. However, few works have done regarding the electrical signature of oil contamination of clayey soils upon induced polarization. Laboratory column experiments plus one sandbox experiment are conducted in this study to investigate the performances of the SIP method in oil-contaminated soils. First, a total of 12 soils are investigated to reveal the influences of water and soil properties on the saturation dependence of the complex conductivity below 100 Hz. Results show that the magnitude of the complex conductivity consistently decreases with decreasing water saturation for all soils samples. The saturation n and quadrature conductivity p exponents tend to increase slightly with increasing water salinity when using a linear conductivity model. The saturation exponent increases marginally with the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the specific surface area (S-sp) while the quadrature conductivity exponent exhibits a relatively stronger dependence on both CEC and S-sp. For the low CEC soil samples (normally <= 10 meq/100 g), the quadrature conductivity exponent p correlates well with the saturation exponent n using the relationship p = n- 1. SIP method is further applied in a sandbox experiment to estimate the saturation distribution and total volume of the oil. Results demonstrate that the SIP method has a great potential for mapping the organic contaminant plume and quantifying the oil volume.

AB In this research, an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi-level multi-objective programming (EC-IFBLMOP) model was developed through integrating export coefficient model (ECM), interval parameter programming (IPP) and fuzzy parameter programming (FPP) within a bi-level multi-objective programming framework. The proposed EC-IFBLMOP model can effectively deal with the multiple uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions. Also, the complexities in agricultural systems, such as the cooperation and gaming relationship between the decision makers at different levels, can be fully considered in the model. The developed model was then applied to identify the optimal land use patterns and BMP implementing levels for agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution management in a subcatchment in the upper stream watershed of the Miyun Reservoir in north China. The results of the model showed that the desired optimal land use patterns and implementing levels of best management of practices (BMPs) would be obtained. It is the gaming result between the upper- and lower-level decision makers, when the allowable discharge amounts of NPS pollutants were limited. Moreover, results corresponding to different decision scenarios could provide a set of decision alternatives for the upper- and lower-level decision makers to identify the most appropriate management strategy. The model has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural NPS pollution management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sorption/desorption kinetics of phenanthrene from two carbonaceous samples (lignite and high-volatile bituminous coal (HC)) at different temperatures was monitored using an on-line column method. Pulverized samples (<30 mu m) were equilibrated in the column for 2 months before desorption began. The desorption rates declined initially fast, followed by an extended tailing part, which could be described very well by a single parameter spherical diffusion model accounting for non-linear sorption. Desorption was carried out at stepwise increased temperatures (20-90 degrees C), and the apparent activation energies were calculated based on the Arrhenius relationship for each of totally three temperature steps. The apparent activation energies were in an order of 58-66 kJ mol(-1) and 70-71 kJ mol(-1) for lignite and HC, respectively and they did not increase significantly during the leaching procedure. At the end of the experiments desorption was almost complete and only 0.2% (lignite) and 6% (HC) of the initially sorbed phenanthrene was present after the last temperature step. Fitted diffusion coefficients as well as the comparison between the apparent activation energies and sorption/desorption enthalpies obtained for the same samples from equilibrium isotherms imply that the diffusion occurred in organic matter of the lignite and in micropores of the high-volatile bituminous coal, where higher apparent activation energies are expected.

AB Plant transpiration accounts for > 60% of evapotranspiration and is affected by drought in various ways. Seasonal droughts are frequent in humid region, and co-occur with increasing atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and decreasing soil moisture. Independent effects of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply on transpiration are still unclear. In this study, plant transpiration and environmental factors were monitored from April 2012 through December 2017 in a subtropical coniferous plantation, where low precipitation and high temperature occurred in summer and autumn. Our results confirmed the nonlinear relationship between atmospheric VPD and soil moisture and transpiration. A multiplicative model of atmospheric VPD and soil moisture on plant transpiration was developed to quantify their relative contributions to plant transpiration. The response of plant transpiration to atmospheric VPD or soil moisture followed an exponential function when they neither factor was limiting. Throughout the study period, atmospheric VPD and soil moisture explained on average 90.8% and 9.2% of the limitation on plant transpiration, respectively. While seasonal drought occurred during July to October, monthly mean contribution of soil moisture limitation to plant transpiration was 17.8 +/- 6.7% with a maximum daily contribution of 86.8%. Our results showed that transpiration in this subtropical coniferous plantation would be further limited by soil moisture in conditions of future climate change.

AB Understanding how much water should be left in rivers is a hot topic around the world. Here, we proposed a decision-making framework for ecological base flow of rivers considering the total economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of rivers system. This framework mainly includes three key steps. Firstly, we analyzed the ecological services functions of rivers system (Le., water used for the ecological base flow of rivers) and economic service functions (Le., water used for economic sectors) and explained their relationship. Secondly, we calculate the economic values of economic service functions and ecological services functions of rivers system, respectively. Finally, we determined the recommended ecological base flow of rivers by reaching the maximum value in the change process of the total economic value of the ecological and economic services functions of rivers system. We applied this framework to determine the river ecological base flow in the Baoji Section of Weihe River, which is the largest tributary of the Yellow River, Northwest China. The calculations results revealed that the recommended ecological base flow of rivers is 35.02% of the natural runoff in Baoji section of Weihe River. This work can provide a valuable reference for decision-making the ecological base flow of river in the water shortage area of Northwest China.

AB The impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on U.S. Southwest precipitation and drought is assessed based on observational data and coupled global climate model simulations. The co-variability between 67-year (1948-2014) Southwest winter precipitation and Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is analyzed using the singular value decomposition method. Results indicate strong associations between Southwest drought and La Nina during 1948-1977 and between Southwest pluvial and El Nino during 1978-1999. The relationship between Southwest precipitation and tropical Pacific SST is relatively weak after 1999. A comparison between two 480-year model simulations with and without ENSO variability suggests that ENSO can alter the characteristics of precipitation, and thus droughts over the Southwest in terms of frequency and intensity. In the presence of ENSO, the variability of Southwest precipitation is enhanced, and further, shifts toward lower frequencies. In addition, the chance for the ENSO-related precipitation pattern to persist over 3-4 years in the Southwest is higher in the simulation with ENSO than that without ENSO. The modeling study also demonstrates a sensitivity of the Southwest precipitation-related teleconnection to both the phase and intensity of ENSO, which helps understand the observed decadal changes in the strength of the link between Southwest precipitation and ENSO.

AB Since the topographical data obtained from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) measurements is superior in resolution and accuracy as compared to conventional geospatial data, over the last decade aerial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has been widely used for obtaining geospatial information. However, digital terrain models made from LiDAR data retain some degree of uncertainty as a result of the measurement principles and the operational limitations of LiDAR surveying. LiDAR cannot precisely measure topographical elements such as ground undulation covered by vegetation, curbstones, etc. Such instrumental and physical uncertainties may impact an estimated result in an inundation flow simulation. Meanwhile, how much and how these topographical uncertainties affect calculated results is not understood. To evaluate the effect of topographical uncertainty on the calculated inundation flow, three representative terrains were prepared that included errors in elevation. Here, the topographical uncertainty that was introduced was generated using a fractal algorithm in order to represent the spatial structure of the elevation uncertainty. Then, inundation flows over model terrains were calculated with an unstructured finite volume flow model that solved shallow water equations. The sensitivity of the elevation uncertainty on the calculated inundated propagation, especially the local flow velocity, was evaluated. The predictability of inundation flow over complex topography is discussed, as well as its relationship to topographical features. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work we analyse the temporal trend of water supplies to a network of basins, representative of the Mediterranean climate and plant cover, and its relationship with the evolution of temperatures, precipitation, and the changes that have occurred in the plant cover with time. The results point to an important decrease in water supply, with a high degree of dependence on precipitation (r = 0.85; p-value < 0.001). Important changes are also seen in the monthly distribution of water discharges due to modifications that have occurred in the intra-annual distribution of precipitation and an increase in temperatures in spring and summer. The rivers studied are losing their snow regime, with very important reductions in the winter and spring discharges. The results show that to date the changes detected in the forest have not affected the water discharges of the rivers. This absence of effect is probably because the changes observed in the plant cover are currently below the threshold after which it is possible to detect the effect of the forest on water discharges and because the interannual variability in rainfall and discharge in Mediterranean environments is so high that it masks other time-dependent changes. The planning and management of water resources should take these changes into consideration with respect to the functioning of hydroclimatic systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be useful tools for modeling many aspects of the hydrological cycle, the fact that they do not provide any means of exploiting fundamental knowledge of the system means that they are still viewed with some skepticism. In this paper, an approach is presented for incorporating information about relative input contributions in the development of an ANN during the calibration and validation stages. Two case studies are presented which highlight the uncertainty associated with calibrating and validating an ANN based on predictive error alone and demonstrates the necessity of constraining the calibration of an ANN to ensure physical plausibility. The proposed technique was used in the comparison of three training algorithms in terms of their ability to find a globally optimal solution and it was identified that neither in-sample nor out-of-sample performance measures are very informative about the solutions obtained, nor do they necessarily indicate that a reasonable approximation of the underlying relationship has been achieved. It was shown that by applying constraints to the objective function, an ANN could be developed with physically plausible input contributions and comparable predictive performance to that of an unconstrained model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to verify the proposed methodology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A conditional copula function based downscaling model in a fully Bayesian framework is developed in this study to evaluate future changes in intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curves in South Korea. The model incorporates a quantile mapping approach for bias correction while integrated Bayesian inference allows accounting for parameter uncertainties. The proposed approach is used to temporally downscale expected changes in daily rainfall, inferred from multiple CORDEX-RCMs based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, into sub-daily temporal scales. Among the CORDEX-RCMs, a noticeable increase in rainfall intensity is observed in the HadGem3-RA (9%), RegCM (28%), and SNU_WRF (13%) on average, whereas no noticeable changes are observed in the GRIMs (-2%) for the period 2020-2050. More specifically, a 5-30% increase in rainfall intensity is expected in all of the CORDEX-RCMs for 50-year return values under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Uncertainty in simulated rainfall intensity gradually decreases toward the longer durations, which is largely associated with the enhanced strength of the relationship with the 24-h annual maximum rainfalls (AMRs). A primary advantage of the proposed model is that projected changes in future rainfall intensities are well preserved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID UNIT-HYDROGRAPH; HYDROLOGY; TIME
AB Analysis of climate change scenarios indicates an increased probability of high rainfalls and related flooding. Climate change may also lead to an increase in rainfall variability and the increased probability of otherwise extreme events. This forces researchers to focus on both high and tow flow models. In addition, changes in soil management and an increase in water demand due to growing industrial and domestic requirements are adding to water scarcity. Sustainable water management is not possible without a better understanding of water balance in the catchment and better modelling tools for low flows. Moreover, application to climate change requires the development of a simulation model. This paper aims to present a Data Based Mechanistic approach to flow modelling, with special emphasis on low flows. The model applies a Stochastic Transfer Function approach to tog-transformed flow. In this respect, the new model has certain interesting similarities with TOPMODEL which assumes an exponential relationship between soil moisture storage and flow. The paper explores these similarities, gives a physical explanation of the model structure and estimates model predictive uncertainty. A physical interpretation of the model allows the ranges of its applicability to be stated. The approach is tested on two catchments in the UK. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID SOIL-MOISTURE; RAINFALL ESTIMATION; EMISSION; FIELDS
AB Airborne microwave radiometric measurements in the framework of the HAPEX-Sahel Experiment were performed by the Push Broom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR) and the PORTOS radiometer. The flights of both radiometers produced an original set of data covering the 1.4-90 GHz range of frequency. The East and West Central Super Sites were the areas most intensively observed by the microwave radiometers. Over those sites, several brightness temperature (T-B) maps are available at seven dates distributed over a 1 month period in the middle of the rainy season. A comparison of the two radiometers demonstrates their radiometric quality and the precision of the localization of the microwave observations. At 1.4 GHz, the vegetation had very little effect on the soil microwave emission. Maps of soil moisture were developed using a single linear relationship between T-B and the surface soil moisture. There is an important spatial heterogeneity in the soil moisture distribution, which is explained by both the soil moisture hydrodynamic properties and the localization of the precipitation fields. At 5.05 GHz, the vegetation must be accounted for to infer soil moisture from the microwave observations. A method based on a simple radiative transfer model and on microwave data has shown encouraging results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Topographic data and geomorphological characteristics are recognized as significant factors that affect the hydrological response of a river basin. There have been a variety of lumped or semi-distributed hydrological models developed based on the use of geomorphological parameters. However, the possibility of applying geomorphological factors to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of hydraulic variables in a watershed is still questioned. This study focuses on thoroughly exploring the relationship between watershed topography and two variables, the water depth and discharge. Machine learning (ML) techniques are utilized to predict the spatial distribution of the two hydraulic variables based on geomorphological factors. To enhance the overall predicted accuracy, the structure and unique distribution of the stream network exiting a river basin are investigated for use in modifying the training procedure of the ML model. A novel method of data classification according to the stream network structure and cluster analysis is established to reinforce the capability of predicting hydraulic variables. Application results of two river basins in Taiwan island show that the performance of water depth and discharge predictions are satisfactory as long as the data classification is conducted for model training. Therefore, the ML-based model developed in this study is a promising way to replace the fully distributed numerical model in order to improve executing efficiency and bypass any problem of instability.

AB The use of the Walk on Grid (WOG) approach for the reliable evaluation of the Green's function associated with groundwater flow scenarios in heterogeneous geologic media is explored. The study rests on the observation that, while the Green's function method (GFM) is one of the most significant and convenient approaches to tackle groundwater flow, Green's function evaluation is fraught with remarkable difficulties in the presence of realistic groundwater settings taking place in complex heterogeneous geologic formations. Here WOG approach is used to simulate pressure dissipation by lattice random walk and establish a quantitative relationship between space-time distribution of random walkers and the Green's function associated with the underlying flow problem. WOG-based Green's function method is tested (a) in three scenarios where analytical formulations are available for the Green's function and (b) in two groundwater flow systems with increased level of complexity. Our results show that WOG can (a) accurately evaluate the Green's function, being highly efficient when the latter can be analytically expressed in terms of infinite series; and (b) accurately and efficiently evaluate temporal evolutions of hydraulic heads at target locations in the heterogeneous systems. As such, a WOG-based approach can be employed as an efficient surrogate model in scenarios involving groundwater flow in complex heterogeneous domains.

AB This paper presents an assessment of the effects of climate change on river flow regimes in representative English catchments, using the UKCP09 climate projections. These comprise a set of 10,000 coherent climate scenarios, used here (i) to evaluate the distribution of potential changes in hydrological behaviour and (ii) to construct relationships between indicators of climate change and hydrological change. The study uses six catchments, and focuses on change in average flow, high flow (Q5) and low flow (Q95). There is a large range in hydrological change in each catchment between the plausible UKCP09 climate projections, with differences between catchments largely due to differences in catchment geology and baseline water balance. The range in change between the UKCP09 projections is in most catchments smaller than the range between changes with scenarios based on the CMIP3 ensemble of climate models (although the shape of the distribution of changes is different), and earlier UK scenarios produce changes that tend towards the lower (drier) end of the UKCP09 range. The difference between emissions scenarios is small compared to the range across the 10,000 scenarios. Changes in high flows are largely driven by changes in winter precipitation, whilst changes in low flows are determined by changes in summer precipitation and temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Croplands can significantly influence the hydrologic response of catchments to climate change in a region but such influence has not been well investigated and quantified. In this study, we firstly use the conceptual hydrological model to investigate the annual water balance for croplands-altered catchments, and the "natural" state without croplands of the catchment can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands in the calibrated model. The model results are then applied to a hydrologic sensitivity framework with the Budyko-type relationship between hydrologic ratios (i.e. evapotranspiration ratio and water storage change ratio) and the aridity index (Ep/P) to yield the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients for the croplands-altered and "natural" catchments. The method is applied to investigate three catchments that are rarely affected by inter-basin groundwater flow in Illinois. The results show that croplands significantly increase the actual evapotranspiration (E) and decrease the runoff (Q), while changes in water storage (C) are rarely affected by croplands at the annual time scale. The actual evapotranspiration at the annual timescale is much more sensitive to potential evapotranspiration when the croplands exist. Croplands in Illinois significantly increase the sensitivity of streamflow on the climate change, to at least twice of the sensitivity in the "natural" state. The effectiveness of inter-annual hydrologic sensitivity framework is also demonstrated by hydrological model. This study provides a new simple insight to quantify the inter-annual stability with varying climate and land use at the catchment scale.

AB Precipitation extremes are recognized as one of the main factors that influence annual runoff and sediment yield in specific watersheds. However, it is not clear whether precipitation extremes account accurately for the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different karst watersheds, especially in climate-sensitive areas, such as the karst critical zone of southwest China. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative importance of the 11 precipitation extremes variables that explain the total variance in annual runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree (BRT) model for 40 typical karst watersheds in southwest China. Results indicated that the most important precipitation extremes for annual runoff and sediment yield were heavy precipitation amount, consecutive dry days, heavy precipitation days, consecutive wet days, and rainstorm amount. The BRT model accounted for 76% of the variation in runoff, which demonstrated that precipitation extremes were crucial factors for generating runoff. Although precipitation extremes had significant effects on sediment yield, the BRT model only explained 32% of the variability in sediment yield. Hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in these karst watersheds may be responsible for the difference in total variance explained by the BRT model between annual runoff and sediment yield. Because of the inherent nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems, the BRT model provided a robust capability to generate data-driven, objective, insight into complex relationships. We recommend this model for the application of non-stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes.

AB The dynamic capillary effect in capillary pressure plays a significant role during the non-equilibrium flow in porous media for various chemical, environmental and petroleum processes. A unified model is developed in this work to estimate the dynamic capillary effect in matrix during the non-equilibrium flow in tight porous media. Multiple influential parameters (especially fluid viscosity, surfactant and fracture with inconsistent effects) and the interplays between them are comprehensively considered. Firstly, a databank of the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the main controlling parameters is established through non-equilibrium flow experiments on the fractured and intact tight core samples. Secondly, the previously unclear correlations between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the influential parameters are determined individually, which are then incorporated into an overall model based on the Buckingham's p-theorem. The proposed model is further validated and simplified, showing accurate matches with the R-2 approximate to 0.95. At last, the sensitivity analysis of five different non-equilibrium flow conditions is conducted, through which effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect are investigated. The proposed model can reasonably explain the porous media properties, the easiness and uniformity of the fluid flow, and the effect of viscous force for the non-equilibrium flow in tight porous media. The findings of this study can help for a better understanding of multiphase flow in tight porous media.

AB The effective hydraulic behaviour of heterogeneous sand was experimentally investigated at two scales under transient flow upper boundary conditions. At the monoliths-scale, one-dimensional inverse modelling was performed from a transient infiltration experiment by implementing in the objective function the outflow and pressure head time series at four depths. Notwithstanding the important heterogeneity of the subsoil, principally due to the presence of discontinuous clay and a stone layer, we observed that the effective behaviour was surprisingly well reproduced. It was also observed that the structural features mainly induced a kind of hysteresis between the saturation and drainage cycles of the outflow time series. Subsequently, 104 Kopecky cores (100 cm(3)) were sub-sampled throughout the monolith, mainly in the sandy matrix. The variability of local hydraulic parameters was investigated by optimising the local hydraulic parameters from mufti-step outflow experiments and measured retention points. The comparison between 1-D optimised, measured and Kopecky-averaged retention curves showed relatively similar shape near saturation. In contrast to this, important discrepancies existed between averaged local scale hydraulic conductivity and effective hydraulic conductivity close to saturation. Different experimental designs at different scales may explain the observed discrepancies. It is further suggested that the monolith-scale effective hydraulic functions are more representative for wet soil conditions. This case study illustrates the complexity of finding validated scaling relationships for the hydraulic properties of heterogeneous soils at scales larger than the usual small column scale.

AB The peaks-over-threshold (POT) method is a usual statistical model for hydrologists working on extreme quantiles estimation. From a theoretical point of view, the model assumes, under some general hypotheses of independence and homogeneity, that the excesses over a sufficiently high threshold are distributed as a particular family of parametric laws called generalized Pareto distributions, of which the exponential distribution is a particular case. In practice, the exponential law is often imposed while the homogeneity is assumed. As shown in the paper, such model assumptions are of real importance for applications. A set of 127 years of daily rainfalls at Marseille is used to illustrate how to apply these assumptions in practice. Usual descriptive analysis shows the heterogeneity of the data. Assuming homogeneity leads to an underestimation of high quantiles, which could induce dramatic consequences in practice. Taking into account the data heterogeneity leads to a considerable increase of the estimated values. The uncertainty attached to these values, analysed in the paper, allows one then to reach some of the historical floods recorded in the Mediterranean region. A particular result is the following: the extreme daily rainfalls at Marseille are not in the Gumbel law domain.

AB Fifteen years of cumulative research in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed in southwest Idaho, USA, has revealed relationships between catchment form and function that would not have been possible through independent short-term projects alone. The impacts of aspect and elevation on incident energy and water, coupled with climate seasonality, have produced tightly connected landform properties and hydrologic processes. North-facing hillslopes have steeper slope angles, thicker soil mantles, finer soil texture, and higher water holding capacities than their south-facing counterparts. This trend is modulated by elevation and vegetation; higher elevation sites, where aspect differences in vegetation are less evident, exhibit less distinct hydrologic properties. The storage of water first as snow, then as soil moisture determines how upland ecosystems survive the seasonal and persistent water stress that happens each year, and sustains streamflow throughout the year. The cumulative body of local knowledge has improved general understanding of catchment science, serves as a resource for conceptual and numerical evaluation of process-based models, and for data-driven hydrologic education.

AB The relationship between magnitude and frequency of daily streamflows over a number of years for a given basin is often termed long-term flow-duration curve (FDC). This analysis addresses the problem of predicting FDCs in ungauged basins by means of a three-dimensional (3D) kriging interpolation of empirical FDCs. A three-dimensional xyz space is defined to perform the interpolation, where x and y are functions of physiographic and climatic catchment descriptors, while z represents the streamflow duration in terms of standard-normal variate. The 3D interpolation technique is applied to several catchments located in two broad geographical regions of Northern (Alpine catchments) and Central (Apenninic catchments) Italy, for which several geomorphological and climatic descriptors are available. An extensive cross-validation procedure is used to quantify the accuracy of the proposed technique in both case studies, and to compare it to traditional regionalization procedures. The cross-validation points out that 3D kriging is a reliable and robust approach, which performs as well as or better than traditional regional models. In particular the approach significantly outperforms conventional approaches for the prediction of low-flows (i.e. streamflows associated with high durations) in ungauged basins.

AB In developing a method for establishing reliable flow estimates from monthly current metered discharge measurements and continuous stage records at a site subject to seasonal aquatic weed growth, a 25 year series of estimates of the resistance of the channel to flow was generated. Analysis of this data set produced estimated relationships between flow resistance, discharge and stage which support the models developed from shorter term research investigations. In addition, the annual cycle in flow resistance at the section studied was found to range from a minimum resistance in January to a maximum in August and September.

AB In this study, the spatial-temporal variability of hydrological drought in Meric Basin, Turkey, has been examined, and its relationship with global climate oscillations has been explored. Prior to drought analysis, streamflow data gaps were filled, and series homogeneity was examined. The standardized streamflow index (SSFI) was used to detect drought periods from monthly streamflow data of nine stations well spread over the study area. The hydrological drought intensity, magnitude, and duration were investigated using the SSFI time series. The drought variability was assessed by performing trend analysis and wavelet transforms. Trend analysis showed an increase in drought events in the Northern region and a decrease in the Southern region of the basin. Wavelet analysis reveals that the 4-10 year scales explicate the drought series pattern. The identification of climate patterns that are most associated with drought variability is performed via correlation analysis. The investigation showed that distinct climate patterns simultaneously influence drought events. Significantly, the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is notable. The analysis demonstrated a remarkable correlation between ENSO and SSFI series at the interannual scale (2-8 years). The obtained phase difference suggests that the maximum dry (wet) conditions coincide with La Nina (El Nino) events. In addition, positive NAO phases and negative AMO phases lead to drought occurrence.

ID RETURN PERIOD; MODEL
AB The design of flood protection measures requires in many cases not only the estimation of the peak discharges, but also of the volume of the floods and its time distribution. A typical solution to this kind of problems is the formulation of Synthetic Design Hydrographs (SDHs). In this paper a methodology to derive SDHs is proposed on the basis of the estimation of the Flow Duration Frequency (FDF) reduction curve and of a Peak-Duration (PD) relationship furnishing respectively the quantiles of the maximum average discharge and the average peak position in each duration. The methodology is intended to synthesize the main features of the historical floods in a unique SDH for each return period. The shape of the SDH is not selected a priori but is a result of the behaviour of FDF and PD curves, allowing to account in a very convenient way for the variability of the shapes of the observed hydrographs at local time scale. The validation of the methodology is performed with reference to flood routing problems in reservoirs, lakes and rivers. The results obtained demonstrate the capability of the SDHs to describe the effects of different hydraulic systems on the statistical regime of floods, even in presence of strong modifications induced on the probability distribution of peak flows.

AB Occurrence of halonitromethanes (HNMs) in drinking water has been a public concern due to the potential risks to human health. Though quite a lot of work has been carried out to understand the formation of HNMs, the relationship between HNMs formation and the nitrite remains unclear. In this study, the effects of nitrite on the formation of HNMs during chlorination of organic matter from different origin were assessed. Organic matter (OM) derived from phoenix tree (fallen leaves: FLOM; green leaves: GLOM) and Microcystis aeruginosa (intracellular organic matter: IOM) were used to mimic the allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter in surface water, respectively. Results showed that HNMs yields were significantly enhanced with the addition of nitrite, and the highest enhancement was observed for FLOM, successively followed by GLOM and IOM, suggesting that the contribution of nitrite to HNMs formation was positively related with SUVA (an indicator for aromaticity) of OM. Therefore, the nitrite contamination should be strictly controlled for the source water dominated by allochthonous OM, which may significantly reduce the formation of HNMs during chlorination. Moreover, given a certain nitrite level, the higher pH resulted in higher stimulation of HNM formation, yet the chlorine dose (always added in excess resulting in residual reactive chlorine), reaction time and temperature did not show obvious influence.

AB Despite the importance of urban flooding, there are surprisingly few experimental studies of observed flood events from high-resolution hydrological data in urban systems to inform model development and parameterisation. The aim of this study was to understand how the interaction between rainfall and the layout of the built environment influences rainfall-runoff behaviour. A 2-year field campaign was undertaken to monitor rainfall runoff behaviour of two small (<1 ha) catchments representing different types of residential developments in southern England. Statistical analysis of 34 events captured in both catchments was undertaken to investigate the link between key event characteristics (peak flow and percentage runoff) and event drivers (event causing rainfall and antecedent soil moisture). The results show that peak flow is most sensitive to 10 min rainfall intensity while antecedent soil moisture is less important. The sensitivity to rainfall is strongest on the most densely urban catchment. In contrast, no relationship between percentage runoff and neither rainfall nor antecedent soil moisture could be detected in the densely urban catchment, while both factors were found to be significant in the less urbanised catchment. These results reported here demonstrate that the layout of the build environment exerts a strong influence on the hydrological characteristics at the local scale of relevance in urban hydrology and further model development of important when planning flood mitigation measures in urban areas.

AB Multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels; most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex behaviors of such reservoirs. This paper proposes an improved operation-based reservoir scheme to simulate the storage and outflow variations for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs at a daily time step. In this improved reservoir scheme, the new parametric functions to represent the weights of the outflow through considering various operation purposes (e.g., hydropower generation, flood control, and water supply) are introduced. Then, the improved reservoir scheme is integrated into a macroscale hydrological model, i.e., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. In this study, the performance of the proposed reservoir scheme is evaluated with the observed storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir (Xinfengjiang Reservoir) in South China and compared to two other reservoir schemes (i.e., a multilinear regression reservoir scheme and an operation-based reservoir scheme). In addition, through uncertainty analysis, this study shows that the time-varying operation-based parameters can reflect the changes of reservoir storage but not reservoir outflow, indicating that the parameters for establishing functional relationships need further exploration. Results reveal that the proposed reservoir scheme has a wide applicability for reservoir storage and outflow simulation, especially for the reservoirs with limited reservoir management data.

AB Shallow aquifers have an important role in reducing greenhouse gases through helping manage the temperature of urban environments. Nevertheless, the uncontrolled rapid use of shallow groundwater resources to heat or cool urban environments can cause thermal pollution that will limit the long term sustainability of the resource. Therefore, there is a need for appropriate mitigation/remediation strategies capable of recovering energetically overexploited aquifers. In this work, a novel remediation strategy based on surface water recharge into aquifers is presented. To evaluate the capabilities of such measures for effective remediation, this strategy is optimized for a management problem raised in the overheated "Urban Alluvial Aquifer of Zaragoza" (Spain). The application of a transient groundwater flow and heat transport model under 512 different mitigation scenarios has enabled to quantify and discuss the magnitude of the remediation effect as a respond to injection rates of surface water, seasonal schedule of the injection and location of injection. The quantification of the relationship between these variables together with the evaluation of the amount of surface water injected per year in each scenario proposed have provided a better understanding of the system processes and an optimal management alternative. This work also makes awareness of the magnitude of the remediation procedure which is in an order of magnitude of tenths of years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; RAINFALL; DISTANCE; MODELS; RECORDS
AB Euclidean distance-based spatial interpolation methods that are conceptually simple are commonly used for the imputation of missing precipitation and other hydroclimatic variable datasets. Improved variants of these methods are essential as Euclidean distance will not always serve as an appropriate surrogate that can quantify the inter-gauge relationships in all hydroclimatic and topographical settings. Probability space-based error measure (linear error in probability space (LEPS)) and three distribution similarity hypothesis test statistic values are proposed as surrogates for distances in weighting methods to address this limitation. A k-fold cross-validation exercise of the imputation of precipitation data at 22 rain gauges in a temperate climatic region is used for the evaluation of methods. Improved imputation of missing data was noted from proposed methods compared to that from a distance-based method and is confirmed with statistical inference testing of multiple error and performance measures. Also, the LEPS-based method provided performance measures that are as good as those from a nonlinear optimization method. A local spatial interpolation approach that uses LEPS and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test results quantified as binary outcomes for objective selection of rain gauges are also evaluated. Better estimates of missing data are obtained using this approach compared to those from a Euclidean distance-based global interpolation method. The proposed new probability space-based distances are conceptually superior alternatives to Euclidean distances when used in weighting methods for spatial interpolation.

ID SOIL-WATER RETENTION; CONDUCTIVITY; MEDIA
AB When modeling soil hydraulic properties at field scale it is desirable to approximate the variability in a given area by means of some scaling transformations which relate spatially variable local hydraulic properties to global reference characteristics. Seventy soil cores were sampled within a drip irrigated banana plantation greenhouse on a 14 X 5 array of 2.5 in X 5 in rectangles at 15 cm depth, to represent the field scale variability of flow related properties. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics were measured in these 70 soil cores. van Genuchten water retention curves (WRC) with optimized in (m not equal 1 - 1/n) were fitted to the WR data and a general Mualem-van Genuchten model was used to predict hydraulic conductivity functions for each soil core. A scaling law, of the form v(i) = alpha(i)v(i)*, was fitted to soil hydraulic data, such that the original hydraulic parameters vi were scaled down to a reference curve with parameters v(i)*. An analytical expression, in terms of Beta functions, for the average suction value, h(c), necessary to apply the above scaling method, was obtained. A robust optimization procedure with fast convergence to the global minimum is used to find the optimum hc, such that dispersion is minimized in the scaled data set. Via the Box-Cox transformation P(tau) = (alpha(tau)(i) - 1)IT, Box-Cox normality plots showed that scaling factors for the suction (alpha(h)) and hydraulic conductivity (alpha(k)) were approximately log-normally distributed (i.e. tau = 0), as it would be expected for such dynamic properties involving flow. By contrast static soil related properties as alpha(theta) were found closely Gaussian, although a power tau = 3/4 was best for approaching normality. Application of four different normality tests (Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi(2) goodness-of-fit tests) rendered some contradictory results among them, thus suggesting that this widely extended practice is not recommended for providing a suitable probability density function for the scaling parameters, alpha(i). Some indications for the origin of these disagreements, in terms of population size and test constraints, are pointed out. Visual inspection of normal probability plots can also lead to erroneous results. The scaling parameters alpha(theta) and alpha(K) show a sinusoidal spatial variation coincident with the underlying alignment of banana plants on the field. Such anisotropic distribution is explained in terms of porosity variations due to processes promoting soil degradation as surface desiccation and soil compaction, induced by tillage and localized irrigation of banana plants, and it is quantified by means of cross-correlograms.

AB The limited area of influence in highly permeable aquifers hampers hydraulic tomography (HT) surveys with traditional pumping tests. Few have suggested that flow data under natural stimuli could complement HT. Verifying this conjecture in controlled laboratory sandbox experiments does not exist. Similarly, many have employed independent pumping events to validate inverse modeling results, but few have explored the validation uncertainty. This study first conducted sandbox experiments to investigate the effectiveness of head data from HT, natural gradient (NG), and precipitation/infiltration (PI) events for estimating hydraulic conductivity (K) field. Conditional Monte Carlo simulation of independent pumping tests then addresses the uncertainty of validating these estimated K fields. The effectiveness of the estimates from NG and PI as prior information for HT was investigated next. Cross-correlation analysis, exploring the relationship between the observed heads and K heterogeneity under different stimuli, then assesses the usefulness of flow data under different stimuli and their possibility for complementing HT as prior information. Estimates from NG and PI events as the mean of the prior probability distribution for HT then corroborate the cross-correlation analysis. Conditional Monte Carlo simulation of twelve independent pumping tests further confirms that a decent NG's K estimate as the mean for the prior probability distribution for HT inversion yields the highest resolution of K estimates.

AB Evaluation of the engrossment of watershed surface characteristics on partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration is key to inspect the availability of water at watershed scale. It is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds. The present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques (ANN: Artificial Neural Network and RVM: Relevance Vector Machine) over 793 (25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across India) to estimate the watershed parameter 'omega' (in Fu's Budyko based equation) that represents intrinsic watershed attributes. In addition, seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra-annual variability in vegetation across India. The models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance. It is seen that the ANN and RVM models have performed better in estimating omega, than the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models. In addition, NDVI has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra-annual low NDVI period compared to high NDVI period. We have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed Budyko based methods in predicting omega. The newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of Budyko framework in estimation of water availability, which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of India.

AB The flow duration curve (FDC) can provide information about the integral catchment response to rainfall events that span from low volume events to events of flood magnitude, and the FDC is particularly useful for low flow regime characterization. The focus of this study was to introduce a statistical, parsimonious approach with a conceptually based parameterization that can lead to simple and practical tools for FDC predictions that can be applied to contexts, such as the Mediterranean climate, that involve scarce data and regional geological and hydro-geological features that strongly affect low-flow hydrological regimes. At-site, dimensionless, empirical FDCs were represented with three-parameter log normal distributions, the variations in the corresponding parameters versus the base flow index (BFI) were explored, and the conceptual relationship of these parameters is further discussed. In cases of ungauged catchments for which the BFI is not known, a priori estimates of such indices can be derived from permeability indices, as BFIs are strongly related to permeability indices in the studied region (Longobardi and Villani, 2008). For moderate to large permeability catchments, which represent the largest fraction of the investigated catchments, prediction errors associated with the proposed regional method of FDC assessment, which is particularly suited for regions for which only scarce or poor data are available, averaged approximately 18%.

AB The main objective of this study is to provide a realistic simulation of river stage in regional river networks in order to improve stream-aquifer interactions and better assess stream discharge and hydraulic head in aquifer units.
   The study focuses on the Oise basin (a 17,000 km(2) sub-basin of the Seine River basin, in Northern France). An upscaling method is proposed to benefit from high resolution hydraulic modeling at local scale to improve the simulation of river stages at regional scale. The methodology is based on simulation of the main rivers with a 1D Saint-Venant approach, from which functional stage-discharge relationships, are derived and projected onto each grid-cell of the regional model.
   At regional scale, the rating curves are used as boundary conditions and allow to calculate river stage, which is then used to calculate the exchanges between aquifer units and river. The approach is efficient to better simulate water pathways and stream-aquifer interactions at regional scale with low computing cost.
   The model was used to quantify stream to aquifer exchanges, that are in average 39 mm yr(-1) for aquifer to stream fluxes and 2 mm yr(-1) for stream to aquifer fluxes, mainly due to storage in aquifer units during storm events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A growing interest in extreme precipitation has spread through the scientific community due to the effects of global climate change on the hydrological cycle, and their threat to natural systems' higher than average climatic values. Understanding the variability of precipitation indices and their association to atmospheric processes could help to project the frequency and severity of extremes. This paper evaluates the trend of three precipitation extremes: the number of consecutive dry/wet days (CDD/CWD) and the quotient of the precipitation in days where daily precipitation exceeds the 95th percentile of the reference period and the total amount of precipitation (or contribution of very wet days, R95pTOT). The aim of this study is twofold. First, extreme indicators are compared against accumulated precipitation (RR) over Europe in terms of trends using non-parametric approaches. Second, we analyse the geographically opposite trends found over different parts of Europe by considering their relationships with large-scale processes, using different teleconnection patterns. The study is accomplished for the four seasons using the gridded E-OBS data set developed within the EU ENSEMBLES project. Different patterns of variability were found for CWD and CDD in winter and summer, with north-south and east-west configurations, respectively. We consider physical factors in order to understand the extremes' variability by linking large-scale processes and precipitation extremes. Opposite associations with the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter and summer, and the relationships with the Scandinavian and East Atlantic patterns as well as El Nino/Southern Oscillation events in spring and autumn gave insight into the trend differences. Significant relationships were found between the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and R95pTOT during the whole year. The largest extreme anomalies were analysed by composite maps using atmospheric variables and sea surface temperature. The association of extreme precipitation indices and large-scale variables found in this work could pave the way for new possibilities regarding the projection of extremes in downscaling techniques.

TI Scale-dependent parameterization of groundwater-surface water
   interactions in a regional hydrogeological model

AB In regional hydrogeological models groundwater-surface water interaction is generally represented with a Cauchy boundary condition, in which a conductance parameter governs the exchange flux rate. In some models, the conductance is controlled by the streambed properties, since it has generally a lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer. However, depending on the specific system and the spatial discretization of the hydrogeological model, aquifer conductance can be a limiting factor for groundwater-surface water interactions. The present study introduces a new expression to represent the aquifer conductance as a function of aquifer properties, surface water network density and model discretization. This expression is based on the Dupuit-Forcheimer theory, the Ernst equation and vertical 2D numerical experiments at the field scale. The main assumptions used to derive our formulation are the presence of a no-flow boundary at the bottom of the hydrogeological model and the homogeneity of the aquifer. The expression is evaluated using simulations with 3D hydrogeological models at different spatial resolutions and compared against previously published parameterization approaches. The results show that the new expression outperforms the other approaches by capturing accurately both the grid-size and the surface water network density dependency of the conductance, which is caused by pressure head losses due to flow within the aquifer grid cell to the surface water, without any additional numerical calculation. Moreover, the proposed expression can be implemented directly in hydrogeological models thereby improving current approaches to represent groundwater-surface water interactions in regional hydrogeological models.

TI Bias correction in hydrologic GPD based extreme value analysis by means
   of a slowly varying function

AB Exponential distributions (EXP) and generalized Pareto distributions (GPD) are frequently applied in hydrologic extreme value analysis. They are calibrated to peak-over-threshold (POT) or partial duration series (PDS) extremes extracted from time series of hydrologic variables above specific threshold levels. Based on the extreme value theory, extremes converge only asymptotically (towards infinitely high threshold levels) to the EXP or GPD distribution. Calibration of the distribution for limited thresholds considered in practical cases will. therefore lead to a bias in the asymptotic properties of the calibrated extreme value distribution.
   The paper aims to bring this problem of bias to the attention of the statistical hydrotogist and proposes a method for bias correction. The method is based on the calibration of a so-called slowly varying function, and is demonstrated for six rainfall-runoff or river flow series in four countries. Extremes are selected from the series on the basis of hydrologic independence criteria. Discrimination between EXP (normal tail) and GPD (heavy tail) and optimal threshold selection are based on regression in Q-Q plots (QQR method). It is found based on these methods that the bias and the slowly varying function strongly depend on the number of selected extremes or the independence level considered in the selection criteria. It is also shown that different independence levels can be considered and combined to decrease the variance in the calibration. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping and immediate forecasting of soil water content (theta) and its movement can be challenging. Although inversion of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by electromagnetic induction to calculate depth-specific electrical conductivity (sigma) has been used, it is difficult to apply it across a field. In this paper we use a calibration established along a transect, across a 3.94-ha field with varying soil texture, using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to monitor and nowcast the 3-dimensional theta dynamics on 16 separate days over a period of 38 days. The EnKF combined a physical model fitted with theta measured by soil moisture sensors and an Artificial Neural Network model comprising sigma generated by quasi-3d inversions of DUALEM-421S ECa data. Results showed that the distribution of theta was controlled by soil texture, topography, and vegetation. Soil water dried fastest at the beginning after the initial irrigation event and decreased with time and soil depth, which was consistent with classical soil drying theory and experiments. It was also found that the soil dried fastest in the loamy and duplex soils present in the field, which was attributable to deep drainage and preferential flow. It was concluded that the EnKF approach can be used to improve the irrigation efficiency by applying variable irrigation rates across the field. In addition, soil water status can be nowcasted across large spatial extents using this method with weather forecast information, which will provide guidance to farmers for real-time irrigation management.

AB Bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were observed at two mountainous subtropical forests in East Asia. To investigate the various boundary conditions and that cause these bidirectional droplet fluxes, we set up identical eddy covariance systems including a droplet spectrometer (FM100 Fog monitor) at two study sites in the Ailaoshan (SW China) and Xitou (central Taiwan) areas for several weeks in winter 2015/2016 and spring 2017, respectively. Normally, fog droplets are expected to have a downward flux toward the surface for all sizes due to impaction at the vegetation's surface. However, we also observed temporally positive fluxes, for fog droplets up to a diameter of 10 mu m. Two different cases of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were identified in our experiments: At Xitou, the positive droplet number fluxes for smaller droplets occurred together with a positive sensible heat flux in combination with large critical diameters according to the Kohler theory. At Ailaoshan, similar fluxes occurred yet together with negative sensible heat fluxes in combination with small critical diameters. We analyze the occurrence of these bidirectional droplet number fluxes in conjunction with the boundary layer conditions and the activation state of the droplets with diameters up to 10 mu m. Plausible reasons for the identical flux directions at the two sites under very different microphysical fog conditions are presented.

ID AMPT INFILTRATION; HILLSLOPE; SOILS; GREEN
AB The coal of this paper is to develop and test a semi-analytical model for event-based transient flow to a subsurface tile drain. A sharp-front theory was used to describe redistribution of infiltrated water in the vadose zone. New approximate analytical solutions in terms of Fourier series were sought for the Boussinesq equation describing subsurface saturated flow subject to time-dependent recharge. Both one and two-term solutions of the series approximation were compared with observed tile hydrograph data from the Purdue Water Quality Field Station (WQFS) in West Lafayette, Indiana. In general, the models were able to capture the peaks of the tile-drain hydrographs, as well as the times-to-peak and the times-of-initial-response to rainfall events. The models performed particularly well for rainfall events with single-burst hyetographs, and in the prediction of the first hydrograph peak from multiple-burst hyetographs, though subsequent peaks could not be captured as well. A further comparison of results from the one-term model with those from HYDRUS 2D suggested that the one-term model is adequate for estimating transient flow to a tile drain. The solution developed here holds promise for extension to larger watersheds where the hydrology is governed by tile drains. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Model selection and model averaging have become popular tools to address conceptual uncertainty in hydro (geo)logical modeling. Within the last two decades, many different flavors of approaches and implementations have emerged which complicate an easy access to and a thorough understanding of the underlying principles. With the many approaches and applications, a variety of terms has been defined, which easily leads to misunderstandings and confusion among the community. Here, we review Bayesian model selection (BMS) and averaging (BMA) as a rigorous statistical framework for model choice under uncertainty. We aim to clarify the theoretical foundations of both methods, their relationship to one another and to alternative approaches, and implications of implementation choices. We further build a bridge to Bayesian model combination (BMC) which turns out to be Bayesian averaging or selection of combined models (BCMA/BCMS). Concluding from our theoretical review, we argue that the goal and the philosophical perspective of modeling should be main drivers when choosing to use the B(C)MS/A toolbox, and we offer guidance to identify the suitable approach for specific modeling goals. With this review, we hope to further strengthen the utility of Bayesian methods in the face of conceptual uncertainty by directing their use into the right channels.

AB Low-frequency, high-magnitude daily rainfall amounts recorded at several sites in central and southern England were related to the prevailing Lamb Weather Types (LWTs), daily weather front and airflow data. Three statistically distinct weather-type clusters were indentified and used to construct a simplified frontal model of daily precipitation occurrence/amount. The model was calibrated against station data for the period 1970-1990 and used to reconstruct observed daily precipitation between 1875 and 1969 given the historic sequence of LWTs. Although the model reproduced the incidence of low-frequency, high-magnitude events, it failed to capture variations in mean wet day probabilities and wet/dry spell persistence. This inability was attributed to the general limitations of the weather classification methodology, which did not capture all aspects of the precipitation regime with equal levels of proficiency. Therefore, the prospects for downscaling high-resolution precipitation series directly from indices of mean sea-lever pressure rather than via weather patterns was discussed. Preliminary results indicate that relationships can be established between mean daily precipitation occurrence and airflow indices such as vorticity and strength of air how. However, further research is required to establish the value of such indices for modelling low-frequency, high-magnitude precipitation events. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Reservoirs perform both flood control and integrated water resources development, in which the flood limited water level (FLWL) is the most significant parameter of tradeoff between flood control and conservation. This study was aimed at developing the varied seasonal FLWL to obtain more economic benefits without decreasing the original flood prevention standards. The Copula function was used to build the joint distribution of seasonal floods, which clarified the relationship between the frequencies of the seasonal flood quantiles and those of the annual maximum. A constraint was then established to meet the requirement that the total flood risk of the seasonal FLWL should be less than that of the original FLWL. The seasonal FLWL can optimally be determined because numerous schemes of seasonal design floods are able to satisfy a given flood prevention standard. As a result, a simulation-based optimization model was proposed to maximize multiple benefits, such as flood control, hydropower generation and navigation. Using the case study of the China's Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the proposed method was demonstrated to provide an effective design for the seasonal FLWL, which decreases a slight FLWL for the main flood season to largely increase the FLWL of the pre-flood and post-flood seasons. The optimal designed seasonal FLWL scheme involves tradeoffs among flood control, hydropower generation and navigation, and enhancement of the economic benefits without increasing the flood risk.

AB The growth of speleothem under cave drip sites is closely related to local climate events and provides an increasingly important means of deciphering past climate change. Since calcite precipitation rates depend on the water discharge at the drip site, the drip rate and mass of water drops detaching from stalactites are fundamental controls on speleothem growth and we have investigated factors that control the volume of water drops in this environment. The classical investigations on the volume of failing water drops are reviewed but there have been no measurements of the volume of drops detaching from curved surfaces equivalent to tips of stalactites. In this study we have used an acoustic drop counting method to measure the variation of the mass of water drops detaching from tubes (representing 'soda straw' stalactites) and artificial stalactites with spherical terminations (representing massive stalactites) as a function of tube radius or surface curvature and the drip rate. The experimental method corroborates classical measurements of drop mass detaching from tubes and, for massive stalactites, we derive a simple empirical relationship between drop mass and radius of curvature of a spherical surface, based on 100,000 drop counts from artificial stalactites with 19 different radii ranging from 3.6 mm to 500 mm. The results of this study allow discharge to be calculated from drip interval measurements and provide a quantitative basis for theoretical modelling of speleothem growth from drip sites.

AB Hydrological storm events are a primary driver for transporting water quality constituents such as suspended sediments and nutrients. Analyzing the concentration (C) of these water quality constituents in response to river discharge (Q), particularly when monitored at high temporal resolution during a hydrological event, helps to characterize the dynamics and flux of such constituents. A conventional approach to storm event analysis is to reduce C-Q time series to two-dimensional (2-D) hysteresis loops and analyze these 2-D patterns. While informative, this hysteresis loop approach has limitations because projecting the C-Q time series onto a 2-D plane obscures detail (e.g., temporal variation) associated with the C-Q relationships. In this paper, we address this limitation using a multivariate event time series (METS) clustering approach that is validated using synthetically generated event times series. The METS clustering is then applied to river discharge and suspended sediment data (acquired through turbidity-based monitoring) from six watersheds in the Lake Champlain Basin located in the northeastern United States, and results in identifying four common types of hydrological water quality events. Statistical analysis on the events partitioned by both methods (METS clustering and 2-D hysteresis classification) helped identify hydrometeorlogical features of common event types. In addition, the METS and hysteresis analysis were simultaneously applied to a regional Vermont dataset to highlight the complimentary nature of using them in tandem for hydrological event analysis.

AB It is commonly accepted that forest plays role to modify the water cycle at the watershed scale. However, the impact of forest on aquifer recharge is still discussed: some studies indicate that infiltration is facilitated under forest while other studies suggest a decrease of recharge. This paper presents an estimate of recharge rates to groundwater in a humid forested watershed of India. Recharge estimates are based on the joint use of several methods: chloride mass balance, water table fluctuation, geophysics, groundwater chemistry and flow analysis. Two components of the recharge (direct and indirect) are estimated over 3 years of monitoring (2003-2006). The direct and localized recharges resulting from rainfall over the entire watershed surface area is estimated to 45 mm/yr while the indirect recharge occurring from the stream during flood events is estimated to 30 mm/yr for a 2 km-long stream. Calculated recharge rates, rainfall and runoff measurements are then combined in a water budget to estimate yearly evapotranspiration which ranges from 80% to 90% of the rainfall, i.e. 1050 mm/y as an average. This unexpected high value for a deciduous forest is nevertheless in agreement with the forest worldwide relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration. The large evapotranspiration from the forest cover contributes to decrease the recharge rate which leads to a lowering of the water table. This is the reason why the stream is highly ephemeral.

AB Although several meteorological radars are operated routinely in Southeast Asian countries, their observation frequencies are sometimes only one or two times per hour. To examine the usability of such poorly sampled observation data, this study investigated the relationship between the observation interval and the estimation error of radar rainfall intensity. The data sets analysed were the radar reflectivity data obtained from the Om Koi S-band radar located in northern Thailand, which operates at approximately 5-min intervals, and the surface rainfall data of rain gauges installed in the Mae Chaem Watershed, which has a catchment area of 3853km2. Through the calibration of parameters in a relationship equation between the rainfall intensity and the reflectivity, hourly rainfall intensities were estimated successfully with high accuracy. The reflectivity data with a poor temporal resolution were constructed by resampling the original 5-min-interval data. The comparison of hourly rainfall intensities estimated from the resampled data with those from the original data reveals that the root mean square error can be expressed as a function of the observation interval and grid size of the radar rainfall intensity product. We conclude that even 30-min intervals of reflectivity data are useful for estimating the average hourly rainfall intensity over the Mae Chaem Watershed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB It is critical important to accurately evaluate hydrological drought evolutions based on a composite index for the sustainable development of water resources. In this study, a Nonlinear Joint Hydrological Drought Index (NJHDI) is constructed by combining surface water and groundwater to better reflect the multivariate phenomenon in characterizing hydrological drought. The bi-dimensional copula function is applied to describe the complicated and nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater due to its dependence structure and flexibility. To reflect the changes in underlying surface, the time-varying parameters are applied in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the surface water and groundwater more accurately. Based on the NJHDI, the spatio-temporal hydrological drought evolutions as well as their potential influencing factors are analyzed in a case study of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Results indicate that 1) compared to the single hydrological index, the NJHDI is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts; 2) hydrological droughts became increasingly serious during the last few decades, especially in parts of the basin located in the Loess Plateau areas where the ecosystem is extremely fragile; 3) climate and LULC changes have both contributed to the changes in hydrological droughts but their contributions vary significantly spatially. In general, the NJHDI-based hydrological drought evolution can provide more reliable information in hydrological drought decision-making owing to considering changes in underlying land surface, and combining the surface water and groundwater with nonlinear combination method.

AB For the last several decades, great efforts have been put into converting point precipitation into mean areal precipitation in the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures. The ratio between point and areal precipitation, called the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF), has been identified to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, with some factors remaining to be undiscovered. In this paper, we highlight the influence of internal spatial variability of storms on the ARF value. For this, we employ a storm identification algorithm on the radar composite data to identify a total of 54,758 elliptically-shaped extreme storms over the six-year study period. Then, we investigate the relationship between the various storm characteristics to their ARF value. Our findings are as follow: First, we confirm a widely-accepted notion that ARF generally increases with the duration, and it is inversely related to the storm area. Second, we discover that spatial variability within storm, e.g., the coefficient of variation of radar image pixel rainfall values, is a very strong predictor of the ARF value along with area and duration. Last, the difference of ARF values between storms that have elliptical shapes and those that are circular over the same area is about 20% on average. These findings inform that the current design framework of areal rainfall estimation will be improved by incorporating the information on the rainfall spatial variability and storm shape.

AB Coupling surface and subsurface water flow in fully integrated hydrological codes is becoming common in hydrological research; however, the coupling of surface-subsurface solute transport has received much less attention. Previous studies on fully integrated solute transport focus on small scales, simple geometric domains, and have not utilised many different field data sources. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the inclusion of both flow and solute transport in a 3D, fully integrated catchment model, utilising high resolution observations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from a wetland complex during a rainfall event. A sensitivity analysis is performed to span a range of transport conditions for the surface-subsurface boundary (e.g. advective exchange only, advection plus diffusion, advection plus full mechanical dispersion) and subsurface dispersivities. The catchment model captures some aspects of observed catchment behaviour (e.g. solute discharge at the catchment outlet, increasing discharge from wetlands with increased stream discharge, and counter-clockwise concentration-discharge relationships), although other known behaviours are not well represented in the model (e.g. slope of concentration-discharge plots). Including surface-subsurface solute transport aids in evaluating internal model processes, however there are challenges related to the influence of dispersion across the surface-subsurface interface, and non-uniqueness of the solute transport solution. This highlights that obtaining solute field data is especially important for constraining integrated models of solute transport. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the origin and migration pathways of geofluids in an active seismic area is of paramount importance in terms of societal challenges such as mitigation of seismic hazards. This study investigates the relationship between the stable isotope ratio C-13/C-12 of deep CO2 and geothermometry in selected groundwater samples located close to extensional faults in central Italy. The temperature range is inferred from an equation based on the Na/Li ratio and chemical geothermal modelling: 113-130 degrees C. Globally, the calculated temperature range agrees with that resulting from deep boreholes in the Northern Apennines. An alternative method is also included to better evaluate the difference in isotopic composition between the aqueous and gaseous delta C-13(CO2) at deep condition. A review of previously published data shows that monitoring of the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in springs fed by meteoric origin located in seismically active areas must take into account mass and isotopic balance to correctly evaluate the component, and the role, of deep fluid during seismic events. In particular, the coupled (and corrected) isotope and geothermometrical monitoring of the springs could help to distinguish between deep gas or deep fluid contributions to shallow aquifers. The results of this study indicate that faults play a crucial role in controlling the migration of crustal fluids. In addition, they reveal that possible evaluation of potential seismic precursors mandatorily requires a long period of monthly monitoring.

AB This study introduces a class of stochastic multisite monthly rainfall generators devised for application in water resources management problems, such as the sensitivity analysis of droughts and extreme rainfall scenarios under external climatic and non-climatic forcing mechanisms. The modelling framework relies on three elements: (1) a classical deseasonalisation scheme based on log-transformed observations, (2) the nonparametric bootstrap resampling approach and (3) parametric Generalized Additive Models for Location. Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). As the bootstrap and GAMLSS modules are alternative techniques for simulating each month, the free choice between them makes the structure of the model modular and flexible, so that it can be easily adapted to different climatic conditions, and can be customized based on the specific water resource problem. The model was set up and calibrated to simulate monthly rainfall from six locations in England and Wales to produce a suitable input for drought analysis. The results of the case study point out that the model can capture several characteristics of the rainfall series. In particular, it enables the simulation of low and high rainfall scenarios more extreme than those observed as well as the reproduction of the distribution of the annual accumulated rainfall, and of the relationship between the rainfall and circulation indices such as North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST), thus making the framework well-suited for sensitivity analysis under alternative climate scenarios and additional forcing variables.

AB Over the last decade there has been a significant shift in global agricultural practice. Because the rapid increase of human population poses unprecedented challenges to production of an adequate and economically feasible food supply for undernourished populations, soilless greenhouse production systems are regaining increased worldwide attention. The optimal control of water availability and aeration is an essential prerequisite to successfully operate plant growth systems with soilless substrates such as aggregated foamed glass, perlite, rockwool, coconut coir, or mixtures thereof. While there are considerable empirical and theoretical efforts devoted to characterize water retention and aeration substrate properties, a holistic, physically-based approach considering water retention and aeration concurrently is lacking. In this study, the previously developed concept of integral water storage and energy was expanded to dual-porosity substrates and an analog integral oxygen diffusivity parameter was introduced to simultaneously characterize aeration properties of four common soilless greenhouse growth media. Integral parameters were derived for greenhouse crops in general, as well as for tomatoes. The integral approach provided important insights for irrigation management and for potential optimization of substrate properties. Furthermore, an observed relationship between the integral parameters for water availability and oxygen diffusivity can be potentially applied for the design of advanced irrigation and management strategies to ensure stress-free growth conditions, while conserving water resources.

AB Mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze/thaw are distributed worldwide, and the impact of freeze/ thaw processes on the groundwater cycle is substantial. For these mountainous areas, the rational division of two key parameters, namely, the groundwater resource quantity calculation unit (GCU) and groundwater resource quantity calculation period (GCP), is a prerequisite for the scientific evaluation of groundwater resource quantity. This is especially important for the Changbai Mountains in Jilin Province, China, which have a distinct geology formed by volcanic processes and have experienced soil seasonal freeze/thaw cycle, implying drastic impacts on the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resources. Based on the groundwater flow system theory and considering the influences of freeze/thaw cycles on the groundwater resource quantity, we propose a new strategy to deal with the division of GCUs and GCPs. Three first-level GCUs, eight second-level GCUs, and fifty third-level GCUs were delineated within the Changbai Mountains. Five GCPs were then determined, and the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity was calculated for the different GCUs and GCPs. The groundwater resource quantity in the five GCPs (no freezing, unstable freezing, stable freezing, unstable melting, and stable melting periods) accounted for 62.25%, 11.51%, 11.58%, 5.05%, and 9.61% of the total, respectively. The results provide a scientific basis for the exploitation of groundwater resource in different re-gions and periods of the study area, and the proposed method offers a new reference strategy for the evaluation of groundwater resource in similar regions.

AB To ensure regional grain security, the grain is transferred from grain surplus provinces to grain deficient provinces in China, then water embedded in grain (virtual water) flows accordingly, which promotes the spatial redistribution of water resources. To explore the influencing factors of virtual water flow, this study first obtained the inter-provincial virtual water flow pattern, and then constructed a virtual water flow trade gravity model based on socio-hydrology theory and estimated the model with multiple regression methods. And the impulse response function was used to analyze the response trajectory of virtual water flow under the shock of other endogenous variable fluctuation. The results show that from 1997 to 2014, the quantity of inter-provincial grain virtual water flow increased from 73 billion m3to 124.64 billion m3. The positive driving effect of the population and per capita GDP in virtual water inflow areas is significant, and the negative suppression effect of the grain output per unit in inflow-areas and the population in outflow-areas is significant. Heilongjiang is the province with the largest outflow of virtual water, and the outflow is more sensitive to the shock of local per capita water resources fluctuation. Guangdong is the province with the largest inflow, and the inflow is more sensitive to the local per capita GDP fluctuation. Chinese Mainland's grain virtual water flow pattern and trend will continue to exist in the future. In addition to the endowment of water resources, social and economic factors also need to be considered during the process of water resources management.

AB The hydrodynamics of a system where there is a coupled flow above and below a sediment-water interface (SWI) are not completely understood. We numerically simulate mean two-dimensional, unidirectional, steady, viscous flow in these systems using a sequentially coupled formulation. Simulations were conducted to determine fundamental relationships between bedform geometry, Reynolds number for the water-column flow (Re), interfacial exchange zone depth (d(2)) in the sediments, and flux through the SWI (q(int)); the latter two parameters play a significant role in biogeochemical and aquatic-life processes across the SWI. d(z) and Re are functionally related through an asymptotic growth-curve model while q(int) and Re follow a power function. These relationships are dynamically explained by the manner in which pressure gradients along the SWI develop due to current-bedform interactions at different Res and by Darcy's Law. We found that the coupling between water column and exchange zone flow is controlled by the behavior of the water-column eddy. The eddy detaches at or near the point of minimum pressure along the interface, and reattaches near the point of maximum pressure. These two critical points determine the pressure gradient along the bed surface that controls the exchange zone flow field. Moreover, the reattachment point corresponds to flow divides within the sediments. Lastly, pore-water velocities drop with depth below the SWI, and are larger below the bedform crests than below the troughs. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis (HFA) has been a commonly used approach for design flood estimation under nonstationary conditions, which underlies deep uncertainty. Most of the previous studies focus on the influence of model parameter (MP) uncertainty on design flood, little is known about quantitative assessment on the commonly-used precipitation projection (PP) uncertainty impact on it. To address this concern, this study proposed an analysis framework to quantify the design flood estimation uncertainty in light of MP uncertainty, PP uncertainty and both of them. Firstly, the equidistant cumulative distribution function method was used to correct the PP provided by twenty-eight GCMs to improve their quality; secondly, the optimal nonstationary distribution model, coupling with the Equivalent Reliability method, was applied to estimate the design flood; then the uncertainty analysis framework composed of Bayesian theory and poor-man ensemble strategy was employed to analyze the impact of the MP uncertainty, PP uncertainty and both of them on the design flood estimation. Moreover, the investigation on which one between MP and PP uncertainty was dominated in the total uncertainty on design flood estimation was conducted based on a case study. Results showed that MP and PP uncertainty has noticeable impacts on the design flood uncertainty. The MP uncertainty impact on the design flood was greater than the PP uncertainty.

AB Characteristics of the water distribution and film thickness within pores control CO2 transport and determine the effectiveness of geologic storage. Although studies of adsorbed water films on solid surfaces are abundant, reports about the dependence of CO2 transport behavior on film thickness under geologic CO2 storage conditions are still lacking. In this study, the water film thickness was estimated through water adsorption equilibrium experiments on four tight sandstone samples at varying relative humidities. The calculated results reveal that the adsorbed water exerts a greater influence on smaller pores, as micro- and mesopores are first filled with condensed water, while macropores only contain absorbed water films, and that the measured critical brine film thicknesses are strongly controlled by the clay mineral content. The influence of water film thickness on CO2 transport was evaluated based on the DLVO theory for cylindrical pores. Considering the mobility difference of water films in different pores, the effective disjoining pressure measured by the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the preliminary basis for the selection of reservoir or caprock and evaluation of the sealing performance of rock. Increasing the water film thickness results in a smaller effective pore radius and flowable pore space, and the movement of water in pore channel causes an electroviscous effect. Both conditions have a negative effect on CO2 movement and eventually decrease the CO2 effective permeability.

AB In this study, the climate variability and associated atmospheric water cycle changes in the Xinjiang (China) over the past five decades (1961-2010) are investigated. The Brubaker model and the Schar model were used to estimate the regional precipitation recycling on the climate scale while evaporation and transpiration (ET) in the area were estimated via the Budyko theory. Meanwhile, we proposed a conceptual framework that delineates the climatic variability and associated atmospheric water cycle changes in Xinjiang. Most of the climatic indicators in Xinjiang experienced a dramatic change in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Rapid warming, increased precipitation and water vapor as well as wind strengthening, have all been observed over the last two decades. All these changes have enhanced the potential evapotranspiration (PET) and the surface actual ET. The warming and moistening of the atmosphere reinforced the local moisture cycle and increased precipitation recycling. The average values of the Precipitation Recycling Ratio (PRR) were 6.48% and 7.79%, for the two models, respectively. The PRR increased remarkably, with a strong upward trend from the early 1980s to the early 21st century. It implied that the local precipitation recycling had been accelerating over the last three decades. The PRR changes were dominated by the moisture variables, e.g., actual ET, precipitation amount and water vapor conditions.

AB Theoretical explanations for vegetation pattern dynamic emphasized on banded pattern-forming systems on the dynamics of the spot pattern. In this context, we explore the patch pattern forming and development in the desertification land. We hypothesized that spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and soil properties with different patch sizes would determine vegetation pattern dynamics theory. The spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and soil properties with different patch sizes were studied. Differences between the inside and outside of the canopy of soil carbon content and soil total nitrogen content were significantly increasing with patches sizes. Sampling location across vegetation patch was the main factor controlling soil properties. Soil nutrient content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were the largest, while bulk density and the coarse sand content were the lowest at the sampling location of half-way between taproot and downslope edge of the canopy. The height of the mound relative to the adjacent soil interspace between shrubs increased as patches diameter increased at the upslope of the taproot. Hydrological and aeolian processes resulted in spatial distributions of soil moisture, nutrition properties, which lead to patch migrated to downslope rather than upslope. A conceptual model was integrated hydrological and nutrient facilitation and competition effects among the plant-soil in mosaic-pattern patch formation and succession process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The interactive water-energy relationship is a major restriction on food production in agricultural irrigation systems. Applying water-saving irrigation systems can further intensify the interrelationship between water and electricity and trigger a water-energy joint risk. Currently, there are no approaches capable of effectively assessing the various uncertainties and water-energy joint risks in irrigation districts. In this study, a novel mathematical programming method termed copula-based interval two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (CITSMIP) is proposed. CITSMIP quantifies water-energy joint risks in food production and provides an optimal resource allocation plan and water-saving irrigation application schemes under different joint risk levels. CITSMIP was applied to solve an irrigation resource management problem in northwest China. The results show that under a certain water-energy joint risk, planting sunflowers would be the first choice for water-saving irrigation applications. As water-saving applications have become increasingly common over time, the watersaving volume is expected to increase to [74.65, 84.46] x 107 m3 by 2035. Moreover, under a certain joint risk, compared with the water risk, fluctuations in energy risk would have a greater impact on the total benefit of the system and the total consumption of resources. Compared with single water risk or energy risk management, the joint risk management results would have a lower degree of uncertainty and higher lower-bound benefits. Establishing CITSMIP can provide valuable insights into informing stakeholders to allocate resources and maximize benefits under water-energy joint risk.

AB In this study, the trap efficiency (T-E) of detention dams was investigated using a laboratory study. To express the mathematical relationship between dependent and independent parameters, nonlinear regression and soft computing techniques including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), gene expression programming (GEP) and group method of data handling (GMDH) were utilized. To find out the most effective parameters on TE, analyzing the Gamma Test (GT) and reviewing the structures of GMDH, MARS and GEP were performed. The accuracy of empirical formula derived based on the nonlinear regression with (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE - 15.17) was inappropriate. Evaluating the performances of GMDH, GP and MARS with regarding calculation of standard error indices such as (R-2 and RMSE) indicated that all of them with minimum value of R-2 = 0.95 and maximum value of RMSE = 5.79 have suitable accuracy for modeling and predicting the TE. However, the MARS model is a bit more accurate than the others. Results of GT and reviewing the structure of prepared models (GMDH, MARS and GP) declared that ratio of volume of flood to volume of sediments (V-F/V-S), ratio of mean diameter of sediment size to the volume of flood (D-50/(3)root V-F) and specific gravity (G(s) = gamma(s)/gamma(w)) are the most effective parameters on T-E.

AB Sources of pollution in river basins are increasing due to rapid changes in land uses and excessive nutrient application to crops which lead to degraded instream water quality. In this connection, the Mun River basin, one of the important and largest river basins in Thailand, has been studied. Comparative figures of nutrients in the Mun's water over a decade showed an increased total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) ratio in the Lower Mun region (TN:TP > 14). Laboratory analysis of weekly water samples showed a realistic nutrient response when daily rainfall was compared to the seasonal water quality data collected by the Pollution Control Department (PCD). The Hydrologic Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) was calibrated and used to assess the effects of different land uses on river water quality. Model parameters related to hydrology and sediment were calibrated and validated using relevant measurements by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). With a reasonable and acceptable model performance (r(2) = 0.62), the highest simulated runoff was observed in urban areas. The trend of agricultural land (as a percentage of total area) - total nitrogen showed a linear relationship of a good correlation (i.e. r(2) = 0.85). Based on the findings, it can be concluded that this model is expected to provide vital information for developing suitable land management policies and strategies to improve river water quality.

AB Partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff is controlled by climate and catchment characteristics. The degree of control exerted by these factors varies with the spatial and temporal scales of processes modeled. The Budyko framework or the "Limits" concept was used to model water balance at four temporal scales (mean annual, annual, monthly and daily). The method represents a top-down approach to hydrologic modeling and is expected to achieve parsimony of model parameters. Daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow from 265 catchments in Australia were used. On a mean annual basis, the index of dryness defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation was confirmed to be a dominant factor in determining the water balance with one model parameter. Analysis of the data, however, suggested increased model complexity is necessary on finer time scale such as monthly. In response, the Budyko framework for mean annual water balance was extended to include additional factors and this resulted in a parsimonious lumped conceptual model on shorter-time scale. The model was calibrated and tested against measured streamflow at variable time scales and showed promising results. The strengths of the model are consistent water balance relationships across different time scales, and model parsimony and robustness. As result, the model. has the potential to be used to predict streamflow for ungauged catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The soil moisture in the surface layer (1 or 2 m) interacts with the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and influences land-atmosphere interactions, impacts rainfall-runoff processes, regulates net ecosystem exchange, and constrains food security. Thus, the accurate measurement with high depth resolution of surface soil moisture is of great significance to hydrology, meteorology, and agriculture. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology has the ability to study hydrogen-containing fluid dynamics in porous media and is expected to achieve in situ detection for soil moisture. In this paper, we propose a new design of a small diameter NMR logging probe based on compensating magnets, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and have high depth resolution (1 cm). The uniform design method is adopted to obtain the optimal compensation magnet parameters. Compared with the probe without compensation magnets, the SNR of the new probe can be increased by 5.2 times in theory. Then a soil moisture experiment of three group samples is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new probe. The experiment results show that the new probe can obtain accurate results of soil moisture, and can also give the proportion of free water and bound water, which has been verified with the results of the Lab-NMR experiments. Finally, the factors that have an important influence on the measurement effect, such as the uniformity of the excitation magnetic field, the radial depth of investigation, and the echo time have been fully discussed.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in fields of agriculture, hydrology, and meteorology, including the irrigation water allocation, water resources management, drought monitoring and climate change studies. However, because of contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daily ET from thermal infrared remote sensing data under cloudy sky bristles with difficulties. In this paper, we proposed a physical and practical method for daily ET reconstruction under cloudy sky that was constrained by soil water budget balance with investigation of the soil water stress relationship between available water fraction and potential ET ratio. This method was tested on both totally field data from 2001 to 2015 at 10 AmeriFlux sites and MODIS remote sensing data from 2009 to 2010 at the Yucheng site in China. Results showed that the reconstructed daily ET under cloudy sky agreed well with the in-situ eddy covariance measurements, with the mean average error (MAE) ranging from -12.20 W/m(2) to 16.77 W/m(2), the mot mean square error (RMSE) varying from 9.47 W/m(2) to 28.97 W/m(2) at the 10 AmeriFlux sites, the MAE of 2.62 W/m(2), and the RMSE of 35.21 W/m(2) at the Yucheng site. Overall, the proposed method is promising in reconstructing daily ET under cloudy sky and can be a good alternative to the conventional interpolating/extrapolating methods. Future work may focus on the further investigation of the proposed method over a wider range of atmospheric, soil and vegetation conditions.

AB The nonlinear relationship between runoff and time is a major challenge in hydrological forecasting. It is important to improve the prediction accuracy of models for disaster mitigation, thus allowing decision makers to make decisions in advance. This paper proposes a method called joint error correction. First, we cluster the initial prediction errors. Then, the moving average method is used to smooth the classified error series. Finally, we establish a 4D copula function model for errors in different forecasting periods. After a sampling test, we compared the errors before and after the correction. We found the system corrected the initial error of the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM). The overestimation of flood in LS-SVM model is reduced. Taking the runoff data from the Fu Yu hydrological station from 2004 to 2018 as an example, the following conclusions were drawn: 1) The correction effect of errors after pretreatment is better than that without pretreatment. Compared with the initial error, the NSE values of the revised models in four different forecasting periods increased by 8%, 5%, 5% and 16%, and the decreases in the RMSE values were 39.37%, 12.25%, 10.38% and 32.6%. 2) After the initial error was corrected, the errors in omega(t,-) were correlated with each other, and the variables in omega(-,h) were independent of each other. After preprocessing the initial values, the joint error improvement value groups omega(t,-) and omega(-,h) displayed independent characteristics. 3) The revised forecast was unbiased. Therefore, the overestimated actual runoff predicted was corrected to some extent.

AB It is important to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change on crop yield especially there have been limited relevant studies conducted in the cold regions such as Northeast China. This study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts on different growth stages of maize over Northeast China during 1960-2016 and the effects of droughts on the climate-induced yield of maize separated by the logistic regression model using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), trend analysis methods, rotated empirical orthogonal function, wavelet method, and Hurst exponent. The results indicated that 1) the spatiotemporal patterns of drought were identified at different growth stages and the changes in dryness/wetness condition presented significant periodic oscillation on different time scales. 2) The patterns of dryness/wetness conditions and the changing characteristics of each sub-region at the early growth (EG) and middle growth (MG) stages were similar. 3) The future drought trends in most stations would be consistent with the past trends. In addition to the wetting trend in the eastern and southern parts at the EG stage, the whole study area would show a drying trend in future at other growth stages. 4) The cross wavelet transform (XWT) was used to develop the changing relationships between climate-induced yield of maize and the dryness/wetness condition at different growth stages with obvious inter-annual periodicities. 5) For Northeast China, climatic factors that can affect the climate-induced yield of maize are firstly temperature, next precipitation, and thirdly dryness/wetness conditions.

AB Investigation of contaminant sources is indispensable for developing effective countermeasures against nitrate (NO3-) pollution in groundwater. Known major nitrogen (N) sources are chemical fertilizers, livestock waste, and domestic wastewater. In general, scatter diagrams of delta O-18 and delta N-15 from NO3- can be used to identify these pollution sources. However, this method can be difficult to use for chemical fertilizers and livestock waste sources due to the overlap of delta O-18 and delta N-15 ranges. In this study, we propose to use coprostanol as an indicator for the source of pollution. Coprostanol can be used as a fecal contamination indicator because it is a major fecal sterol formed by the conversion of cholesterol by intestinal bacteria in the gut of higher animals. The proposed method was applied to investigate NO3- pollution sources for groundwater in Shimabara, Nagasaki, Japan. Groundwater samples were collected at 33 locations from March 2013 to November 2015. These data were used to quantify relationships between NO3- N, delta N-18-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, and coprostanol. The results show that coprostanol has a potential for source identification of nitrate pollution. For lower coprostanol concentrations (<30 ng L-1) in the nitrate polluted group, fertilizer is likely to be the predominant source of NO3-. However, higher concentration coprostanol samples in the nitrate-polluted group can be related to pollution from livestock waste. Thus, when conventional diagrams of isotopic ratios cannot distinguish pollution sources, coprostanol may be a useful tool. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Global performance ranking of temperature-based approaches for

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   Temperature-based models; Koppen climate classification
ID POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; LATENT EVAPORATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable for hydrologic, climatic and agricultural studies. ET cannot be measured in many situations and its estimation is only possible through the application of mathematical models. ET is commonly calculated relying on reference evapotranspiration (ETo) or potential evapotranspiration (PET). In particular, temperature-based models (TET) are interesting, because temperature is a widely available climatic variable and it might explain a significant fraction of ETo and PET variability. Nevertheless, most studies about TET models usually provide a local assessment of the studied model performance, usually at regional or national scale.
   This paper presents the assessment of 11 representative TET methods for estimating ETo and PET considering a very wide climatic spectrum, specifically 4362 climatological stations worldwide. Therefore, the applicability of the different TET approaches was evaluated in relationship to the Koppen climate classification of the stations, considering a monthly timescale and FAO56 Penman Monteith benchmarks (PM56).
   The encountered correlation indexes confirm the importance of air temperature for modeling ET. In general, the Hargreaves-Samani equation provided the most accurate global average performance in arid, semiarid, temperate, cold and polar climates. The Thornthwaite and McCloud approaches provide the worst average estimates in all climate classes. TET approaches yield high errors and a low average correlation to PM56 in tropical climates. Although a similar comparative analysis might provide other trends at local scale, the presented results might allow for a general selection of suitable TET methods for each climate Koppen class.

AB The Budyko-type equations have begun to be widely adopted to separate the contributions of climate change and human activities to the variation of runoff over long-term periods by using the multi-year averages of hydrological variables. In this study, a two-step framework based on four single-parameter Budyko-type equations is proposed to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff. First, the relationship of the parameter w in each Budyko-type equation with climatic and human factors is built to reveal the time-variation process of w by using an 11-year moving window. Second, the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff are separated by using both the decomposition method and the sensitivity method. This separating framework is applied to analyze the variation of the runoff during 1960-2009 in the Weihe River. It is found that the parameter w in each Budyko-type equation is significantly related to both factors of climate and human activities. The results from both the decomposition method and the sensitivity method show that climate change is the main driving factor to the decline in runoff of the Weihe River, while human activities are another important factor. In general, climate change affects runoff not only by changing the hydrological inputs (precipitation and potential evaporation) but also by altering the watershed characteristics as represented by the parameter w; while the impacts of human activities on runoff are exerted mainly through the alteration of the watershed characteristics.

AB Salinization in coastal areas of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, is a controlling factor of water quality, and limits its exploitation for human uses and local ecological values. Coastal plains such as the one in the southern part of Samborombon Bay have a tidal morphology consisting of fine sediment deposits, tidal channels, and aeolian sand sheets, each of them playing a hydrological role. In this paper, we describe the hydrological processes in the Samborombon Bay coastal plain using hydrochemical and isotopical data to provide evidence of salinization processes. Specific ionic relationships for surface and ground water samples from each formation are differ from those of sea water. Isotopic data also reveal infrequent participation of sea water in the coastal area water samples, showing an evaporation trend in both surface and ground water. We conclude that salinization has its origin in the occurrence of gypsum and halite, as well as other chlorides, from the coastal plain deposits. Rainfall recharge, continental water inputs, evaporation and long residence times define the hydrochemical and isotopical features of ground water, which shows no signs of present sea water contribution. Sand sheets constitute local aquifers with lower salinity content. Continental surface waters, as well as rainfall drainage via tidal channels, have a dominant effect on surface water hydrochemistry notwithstanding tidal oscillations. Exploitation of water resources is thus limited to regionally extended aeolian sand sheet formations and to surface waters, specifically those related to contributions of freshwater discharge from inland areas.

ID INTERCEPTED SNOW; SUBLIMATION
AB Precipitable water vapour estimates derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) zenith wet delay measurements were used in conjunction with a basic snow evaporation model to verify observations of snow evaporation in an open urban area. A field study conducted at the University of Calgary campus on urban snow processes monitored snow evaporation for three different varieties of snow in varying stages of ripening between February and April of 2001. Evaporation rates for natural fresh snow, natural ripened snow, and mechanically displaced snow were then compared to the rates derived using the SuomiNet GPS. Relationships between simulated and observed evaporation rates for natural ripened and mechanically displaced snow were in very good agreement, with coefficients of determination of 76 and 85%, respectively. The preciptable water vapour component accounted for 38 and 47%, respectively, of the linear variation between the observations and the model. The wind accounted for the remainder of the linear variation. The analysis for natural fresh snow produced a coefficient of determination of only 48%, which was only significant at the 10% level. However, the wind component of the model accounted for 100% of the linear variation explained by the model. In general, mechanically displaced snow experienced three times less evaporation than natural snow. Model coefficients reflected the aerodynamic properties of the snow as well as the path length of precipitable water vapour measurement. The coefficients ranged from approximately 0.0107 +/- 0.0028 km(-1) for natural snow and 0.0034 0.0008 km(-1) for mechanically displaced snow. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monthly hydrological models are very useful tools for modeling of catchment hydrology. In this study, a two-stage partitioning monthly water balance model (TSPM) with three parameters is developed based on a generalized proportionality hypothesis. A total of four model scenarios are conducted to investigate the effects of calculation procedures of the soil water content on model performances by incorporating the hyperbolic tangent function used in the two-parameter monthly water balance model (TWBM) by Xiong and Guo (1999). The developed monthly models are then tested in 205 Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) basins across the United States. Application results demonstrate that the three-parameter model TSPM1 performs well and has better performance than the modified two-parameter model TSPM4 using the equations of soil moisture and runoff from the TWBM. Five monthly models with different structures and model parameter numbers are compared to the two developed TSPM models. Results show that the TSPM1 and TSPM4 models have a median performance among these models. They show an excellent performance in high flow, but a relatively weak performance in low flow, especially for the TSPM4 model. The relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics is explored and results demonstrate that the climate and vegetation conditions of catchment (e.g., aridity index and forest fraction) exert very significant effects on model performances, including entire goodness-of-fit, low and high flows in runoff simulations.

AB With the boom of hydropower industry, it has never been more important than now to re-assess approaches to a sustainable hydropower projects management. We evaluated the environmental and economic costs and benefits (namely environmental and economic effects) of implementing different hydrology-based environmental flow restrictions (i.e., environmental flows scenarios) at nine run-of-river power plants involving flow diversions, located at pluvial, nival and stable river reaches in Spain. For each scenario, economic effects were inferred from energy production figures, whereas environmental effects along the bypassed river reach came from the deviations of the ecologically meaningful flow attributes from the unaltered flow regime. We found a linear inverse relationship between both effects, which were the lowest for the pluvial type reaches. Imposing significantly low constant flows resulted into the highest energy production but at the highest environmental costs, whereas the opposite happened when using more complex environmental flow methodologies which also imposed flow fluctuations and annual floods, and restricted ramping rates. The ecologically meaningful flow attributes were not similarly affected in all tested environmental flows scenarios. We present a simple approach to define the environmental flow standards at run-of-river-diversion schemes that guarantee the right balance between rivers conservation and energy production, and which are valid for all rivers sharing similar flow regime patterns. In such definition it is possible to address specific ecological goals by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes.

AB The contributions indigenous ecological knowledge can make to better inform water management decisions are currently undervalued leading to an underrepresentation of indigenous values in water planning and policy. This paper outlines a novel approach in which indigenous ecological knowledge informs cause and effect relationships between species and aquatic habitats to promote broader ecosystem understanding. A Bayesian Network was developed to synthesise the seasonal aquatic knowledge of a group of Gooniyandi Aboriginal language speakers, including fish species' availability, condition and required habitat, and integrate it with hydrogeological understanding obtained from research undertaken in a stretch of the Fitzroy River, Western Australia. This river system, like most in northern Australia, is highly seasonal and entirely dependent upon groundwater for maintaining flow during prolonged dry seasons. We found that potential changes in river flow rates caused by future water resource development, such as groundwater extraction and surface water diversion, may have detrimental effects on the ability to catch the high value aquatic food species such as Barramundi and Sawfish, but also that species such as Black Bream may benefit. These findings result from changes in availability of habitats at times when Gooniyandi understanding shows they are important for providing aquatic resources in good condition. This study raises awareness of the potential outcomes of future water management and stimulates communication between indigenous people, the scientific community and water managers by developing a model of indigenous understanding from which to predict eco-hydrological change.

AB The influence of climate variation on the availability of water resources was analyzed in the headwaters of the Tagus River basin using two drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). This basin is highly regulated and strategic, and contains two hyperannual reservoirs that are the origin of the water supply system for Mediterranean areas of southeast Spain. The indices confirmed that drought conditions have prevailed in the headwaters of the Tagus River since the 1970s. The responses in river discharge and reservoir storage were slightly higher when based on the SPEI rather than the SPI, which indicates that although precipitation had a major role in explaining temporal variability in the analyzed parameters, the influence of temperature was not negligible. Moreover, the greatest response in hydrological variables was evident over longer timescales of the climatic drought indices. Although the effect of climate variability on water resources was substantial during the analyzed period, we also showed a major change in hydrological-climatic relationships in regulated systems including reservoir storage and outflow. These were closely related to changes in external demand following commencement of the water transfer system to the jucar and Segura basins after the 1980s. The marked reduction in water availability in the basin, which is related to more frequent droughts, contrasts with the amount of water transferred, which shows a clear upward trend associated with increasing water demand in the Mediterranean basin.

TI The rotating movement of three immiscible fluids - a benchmark problem
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article

ID INTERFACE; FLOW
AB A benchmark problem involving the rotating movement of three immiscible fluids is proposed for verifying the density-dependent flow component of groundwater flow codes. The problem consists of a two-dimensional strip in the vertical plane filled with three fluids of different densities separated by interfaces. Initially, the interfaces between the fluids make a 45degrees angle with the horizontal. Over time, the fluids rotate to the stable position whereby the interfaces are horizontal; all flow is caused by density differences. Two cases of the problem are presented, one resulting in a symmetric flow field and one resulting in an asymmetric, flow field. An exact analytical solution for the initial flow field is presented by application of the vortex theory and complex variables. Numerical results are obtained using three variable-density groundwater flow codes (SWI, MOCDENS3D, and SEAWAT). Initial horizontal velocities of the interfaces, as simulated by the three codes, compare well with the exact solution. The three codes are used to simulate the positions of the interfaces at two times; the three codes produce nearly identical results. The agreement between the results is evidence that the specific rotational behavior predicted by the models is correct. It also shows that the proposed problem may be used to benchmark variable-density codes. It is concluded that the three models can be used to model accurately the movement of interfaces between immiscible fluids, and have little or no numerical dispersion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB The study of reservoir deterministic optimal operation can improve the utilization rate of water resource and help the hydropower stations develop more reasonable power generation schedules. However, imprecise forecasting inflow may lead to output error and hinder implementation of power generation schedules. In this paper, output error generated by the uncertainty of the forecasting inflow was regarded as a variable to develop a short-term reservoir optimal operation model for reducing operation risk. To accomplish this, the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) was first applied to present the maximum possible loss of power generation schedules, and then an extreme value theory-genetic algorithm (EVT-GA) was proposed to solve the model. The cascade reservoirs of Yalong River Basin in China were selected as a case study to verify the model, according to the results, different assurance rates of schedules can be derived by the model which can present more flexible options for decision makers, and the highest assurance rate can reach 99%, which is much higher than that without considering output error, 48%. In addition, the model can greatly improve the power generation compared with the original reservoir operation scheme under the same confidence level and risk attitude. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper can significantly improve the effectiveness of power generation schedules and provide a more scientific reference for decision makers.

AB In this paper the applicability of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) over heterogeneous terrain below the blending height is investigated. This is tested using two large aperture scintillometers (LAS), in conjunction with aggregation schemes to infer area-averaged refractive index structure parameters. The two LAS were operated simultaneously over the oliveyard of Agdal, located near Marrakech (Morocco). The Agdal olive yard is made up of two contrasted fields, or patches. The two sites are relatively homogeneous, but differ strongly in characteristics (mainly soil moisture status, and, to a lesser extent, vegetation cover). The higher soil moisture in the northern site creates heterogeneity at the scale of the entire olive yard (i.e. at grid scale). At patch scale, despite the complexity of the surface (tall, sparse trees), a good agreement was found between the sensible heat fluxes obtained from eddy-covariance systems and those estimated from the LAS. At grid scale, the aggregated structure parameter of the refractive index, simulated using the proposed aggregation model, behaves according to MOST. This aggregated structure parameter of the refractive index is obtained from measurements made below the grid scale blending height, and shows that MOST applies here. Consequently, scintillometers can be used at levels below the blending height. This is of interest, since strictly respecting the height requirements poses tremendous practical problems, especially if one is aiming to derive surface fluxes over large areas.

AB The effects of energy dissipation on channel properties of a river network are explored. On the basis of a local-and global hypothesis of optimality in energy expenditure, we investigate the relationships between channel hydraulic geometry, flow velocity, channel bed slope, and streamflow conditions in optimal river networks. Expressions for the rate of energy dissipation per unit channel area P-a are derived as functions of cumulative drainage area and river network parameters. Optimal channel characteristics are dec-eloped that satisfy the hypothesis of local optimality, and provide Constant P-a throughout the river network. We show that these optimal Channel characteristics are remarkably similar to those of many natural river systems in their downstream hydraulic geometry exponents, channel bed slope scaling, spatial distribution of average flow velocity, boundary shear, resistance to flow, etc. Optimal combinations of channel downstream hydraulic geometry and basin topography were analyzed on data from Goodwin Creek. We found ranges of optimality for the combination of the downstream hydraulic geometry exponent for width of Leopold and Maddock [1953] (0.32 < b < 0.74), and the channel bed slope scaling exponent (-0.65 < z < -0.29), and argue that river networks develop average channel properties within these ranges in order to attain constant P-a throughout the network. We propose that the hypothesis of local optimality is a central principle that explains the average behavior and adjustment of channel characteristics in natural river systems.

AB This study attempted to develop a point-surface collaborative inversion (PSCI) method for the estimation of regional surface soil moisture (SSM) using a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) trained on sparse ground-based measurements. Specifically, GRNN was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between ground-based measurements from sparse network stations (SNSs) and passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in the continental U.S. for April 2015 to March 2018. More importantly, the extended triple collocation (ETC) technique was applied to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of ground-based measurements, whereby individual SNSs' reliability at the SMAP coarse footprint scale could be determined before fed into GRNN. The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the GRNN model trained on reliable SNSs obtained a satisfactory performance-the cross-validated R and unbiased RMSE values were 0.88 and 0.050 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively, which outperformed the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and the other GRNN model trained on all SNSs. Furthermore, temporal and spatial comparisons between the PSCI-based SSM retrievals and other SSM datasets indicated the former agreed the best with ground measurements both in time and space, suggesting the proposed PSCI method had shown great potential in estimating reliable regional SSM climate records.

AB Floods are one of the most serious forms of natural hazards in terms of the damages they cause. In 2012 alone, flood damages exceeded $19 billion. A large proportion of the damages from several recent major flood disasters, such as those in South India and South Carolina (2015), England and Wales (2014), the Mississippi (2012), Thailand (2011), Queensland (Australia) (2010-2011), and Pakistan (2010), were related to the long duration of those flood events. However, most flood risk studies to date do not account for flood duration. In this paper, we provide the first global modelling exercise to assess the link between interannual climate variability and flood duration and frequency. Specifically, we examine relationships between simulated flood events and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our results show that the duration of flooding appears to be more sensitive to ENSO than is the case for flood frequency. At the globally aggregated scale, we found floods to be significantly longer during both El Nino and La Nino years, compared to neutral years. At the scale of individual river basins, we found strong correlations between ENSO and both flood frequency and duration for a large number of basins, with generally stronger correlations for flood duration than for flood frequency. Future research on flood impacts should attempt to incorporate more information on flood durations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We aim to simulate time series of daily precipitation amounts within a season over many years in the upper Waitaki catchment New Zealand and find its relationship with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Such simulations are highly desirable in hydroclimatic research for New Zealand, particularly in predicting the potential capacity of hydroelectricity generation two to three decades in the future. A rainfall generator, based on a mixture model for precipitation that is conditioned on a low frequency climate state, is proposed. The daily rainfall amounts at three rain stations in the upper Waitaki catchment and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation Index during 1950-2000 austral summer are fitted to a stochastic rainfall generator by an EM algorithm to derive the parameters of the model.
   The proposed rainfall generator together with a time series of the Interdecadal. Pacific Oscillation Index are then used to simulate the daily rainfall amounts for summer. We find the simulated interannual variability, given by the mean and variance of seasonal precipitation totals and the correlation between seasonal precipitation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation Index, are close to the observed values. The simulated intraseasonal variability, given by distributions of dry and wet-day durations, and the means and tails of the distribution of daily precipitation, are also close to that observed in the data.

AB Real-time correction is the key to reducing hydrological forecasting errors. Methods of real-time correction can be classified into terminal error correction (TEC) and process error correction (PEC) methods. A state-of-the-art PEC method is the dynamic system response curve (DSRC) method which has been developed to improve flood forecasting, but its underlying assumption of error source limits the correction accuracy. This study developed a multi-source error DSRC method (MSE-DSRC) to partition the total error of forecast discharge into input-caused error and model-caused error. Based on the known quantitative relationship between rain gauge density and error division ratio, two different sources of error are corrected simultaneously. A synthetic case study was done to evaluate the ability of the MSE-DSRC method to correct the variables and parameters of the hydrological model (XAJ model). The MSE-DSRC method was found to overcome the limitations of the traditional DSRC method and have a high accuracy indexed with the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency increasing above 0.9. Then, real case studies in three basins of the Huaihe River (China) demonstrated that the MSE-DSRC method achieved higher accuracy and stability than did the traditional DSRC method and can be easily applied in practice, with the average improvement of NS above 50%. Overall, the error division of the MSE-DSRC method opens the possibility for multi-variable updating and multi-source error correction, which may further improve the accuracy of flood forecasting.

AB Droughts in India affect food production, gross domestic product (GDP), livelihood, and socio-economic condition of a large population associated with agriculture. Recent drought (2015-2018) caused groundwater depletion and affected about one-fourth of the Indian population. However, it remains unclear if the drought of 2015-2018 was among the most severe droughts that occurred in India. Here we use a long-term (1870-2018) data to identify the top five ("deadly") meteorological/hydrological droughts based on overall severity score in the last century and half period. Out of a total of 18 meteorological droughts, the deadly droughts occurred in 1899, 1876, 2000, 1918, and 1965. Similarly, the deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899, 2000, 1876, 1965, and 1918 during 1870-2018. All the five deadly droughts were associated with the positive phase of El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Results show that the relationship between ENSO and monsoon (June to September) precipitation in India has weakened while the role of Indian and Atlantic Oceans have strengthened during the recent decades. Notwithstanding the longest (41 months) duration, the 2015-2018 drought did not feature among the deadly droughts. The 2015-2018 drought affected surface (reservoir storage) and groundwater availability in both southern and northern parts of India and was linked to El-Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole. Droughts and rapidly declining groundwater together can pose serious challenges to water security in India.

AB The areal reduction factor (ARF) is a concept used in many hydrologic designs to transform a point precipitation frequency estimate of a given duration and frequency to a corresponding areal estimate. Various methods have been proposed in the literature to calculate ARFs. Proposed ARFs could vary significantly, and it is unclear if discrepancies are primarily due to differences in methodologies, the dissimilar datasets used to calculate ARFs, or if they originate from regional uniqueness.
   Our goal in this study is to analyze differences among ARFs derived from different types of fixed-area ARF methods, which are suitable for use with precipitation frequency estimates. For this intercomparison, all the ARFs were computed using the same, high-quality rainfall-radar merged dataset for a common geographic region. The selected ARFs methods represent four commonly used approaches: empirical methods, methods that are based on the spatial correlation structure of rainfall, methods that rely on the scaling properties of rainfall in space and time, and methods that utilize extreme value theory. The state of Oklahoma was selected as the study area, as it has a good quality radar data and a dense network of rain gauges. Results indicate significant uncertainties in the ARF estimates, regardless of the method used. Even when calculated from the same dataset and for the same geographic area, the ARF estimates from the selected methods differ. The differences are more pronounced for the shorter durations and larger areas. Results also indicate some ARF dependence on the average recurrence intervals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DE Mediterranean hydrology; Ecohydrological models; FDC; Dry seasons;
   ModABa
ID CATCHMENTS; MODEL
AB Flow duration curve (FDC) represents a comprehensive signature of temporal runoff variability often used to synthesize catchment rainfall-runoff responses. A new model, the ModABa (MODel for Annual flow duration curves assessment in ephemeral small BAsins), is here introduced. It can be thought as a wide mosaic whose tesserae are frameworks, models or conceptual schemes separately developed in different studies and harmoniously interconnected with the final aim of reproducing the annual FDC in intermittent small catchments. Two separated seasons within the hydrological year are distinguished: a dry season, characterized by absence of streamflow, and a non-zero season. Streamflow is disaggregated into a subsurface component and a surface component that, in turn, is considered formed by two different contributions: impervious runoff and surface runoff from permeable areas induced by heavy rains. The FDCs of the two streamflow components are first separately and differently computed, and then combined to obtain the non-zero FDC. This last, together with the estimated probability of null streamflow, allows the annual FDC assessment through the theory of total probability. The ModABa is here tested on a small Italian catchment and the results show how the model, once calibrated, is able to accurately reproduce the empirical FDC for the analyzed case, starting from easily derivable parameters and commonly available climatic data. In this sense, the model reveals itself as a valid tool, potentially suitable for predictions at ungauged basins in a regionalization framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Torrential flows like debris flows or debris floods are fast movements formed by a mix of water and different amounts of unsorted solid material. They generally occur in steep torrents and pose high risk in mountainous areas. Rainfall is their most common triggering factor and the analysis of the critical rainfall conditions is a fundamental research task. Due to their wide use in warning systems, rainfall thresholds for the triggering of torrential flows are an important outcome of such analysis and are empirically derived using data from past events.
   In 2009, a monitoring system was installed in the Rebaixader catchment, Central Pyrenees (Spain). Since then, rainfall data of 25 torrential flows ("TRIG rainfalls") were recorded, with a 5-min sampling frequency. Other 142 rainfalls that did not trigger torrential flows ("NonTRIG rainfalls") were also collected and analyzed. The goal of this work was threefold: (i) characterize rainfall episodes in the Rebaixader catchment and compare rainfall data that triggered torrential flows and others that did not; (ii) define and test Intensity-Duration (ID) thresholds using rainfall data measured inside the catchment by with different techniques; (iii) analyze how the criterion used for defining the rainfall duration and the spatial variability of rainfall influences the value obtained for the thresholds.
   The statistical analysis of the rainfall characteristics showed that the parameters that discriminate better the TRIG and NonTRIG rainfalls are the rainfall intensities, the mean rainfall and the total rainfall amount. The antecedent rainfall was not significantly different between TRIG and NonTRIG rainfalls, as it can be expected when the source material is very pervious (a sandy glacial soil in the study site). Thresholds were derived from data collected at one rain gauge located inside the catchment. Two different methods were applied to calculate the duration and intensity of rainfall: (i) using total duration, D-tot, and mean intensity, I-mean, of the rainfall event, and (ii) using floating durations, D, and intensities, I-fl, based on the maximum values over floating periods of different duration. The resulting thresholds are considerably different (I-mean = 6.20 D-tat(-36) and I-fl_(90%) = 5.49 D-0.75, respectively) showing a strong dependence on the applied methodology.
   On the other hand, the definition of the thresholds is affected by several types of uncertainties. Data from both rain gauges and weather radar were used to analyze the uncertainty associated with the spatial variability of the triggering rainfalls. The analysis indicates that the precipitation recorded by the nearby rain gauges can introduce major uncertainties, especially for convective summer storms. Thus, incorporating radar rainfall can significantly improve the accuracy of the measured triggering rainfall.
   Finally, thresholds were also derived according to three different criteria for the definition of the duration of the triggering rainfall: (i) the duration until the peak intensity, (ii) the duration until the end of the rainfall; and, (iii) the duration until the trigger of the torrential flow. An important contribution of this work is the assessment of the threshold relationships obtained using the third definition of duration. Moreover, important differences are observed in the obtained thresholds, showing that ID relationships are significantly dependent on the applied methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In general, most of the foundations of structures in the cold regions rest on frozen soils which are often under unsaturated state and subject to mechanical and thermal loads. The thermal loads will induce water migration and water-ice phase change, as a result, the dynamic phase transition between unfrozen water and ice occurs and degree of saturation in frozen soils is affected. These complicate the understanding of the strength and deformation characteristics of frozen soils under mechanical and thermal loads. Furthermore, it leads to a necessity to develop a coupling thermo-hydro-mechanical model for practical permafrost engineering. Up to date, there are limited studies to quantify this complicated problem by a framework with proper stress and strain variables for unsaturated frozen soils. This study derives the expression of input work rate for unsaturated frozen soils based on the multiphase porous media theory. Work conjugate stress and strain variables have been determined based on the expression of input work rate. This set of variables not only can smoothly transit from unsaturated frozen state to unsaturated unfrozen state when temperature is above freezing point, but also can smoothly transit from unsaturated state to saturate state. The proposed framework can be consistently applied to multiphase soils with unsaturated frozen soils, unsaturated soils and saturated soils. Moreover, the application of the framework can be further extended to other porous mediums. Additionally, the selected variables in this framework are validated against published experimental results. This framework can subsequently be used to establish the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical models for unsaturated and saturated frozen soils.

AB This investigation proposes the wavelet-based efficient modeling of non-linear rainfall-runoff processes and its application to flood forecasting in a river basin. Inspired by the theory of wavelet transforms and Kalman filters, based on the excellent capacity of the Volterra model, a time-varying nonlinear hydrological model is presented to approximate arbitrary nonlinear rainfall-runoff processes. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose and compress the Volterra kernels, generating smooth reparametrizations of the Volterra kernels, reducing the number of coefficients to be estimated. Kalman fitters were then utilized to online estimate compressed wavelet coefficients of the Volterra kernels and thus model the time-varying nonlinear rainfall-runoff processes. Kalman fitters and the Volterra model that had been used over recent decades in the nonlinear modeling of rainfall-runoff processes, typhoon or storm events over Wu-Tu and Li-Ling watersheds are chosen as case studies were used herein to verify the suitability of a combination of wavelet transforms. The validation results indicated that the proposed approach is effective because of the multi-resolution capacity of the wavelet transform, the adaptation of the time-varying Kalman fitters and the characteristics of the Volterra model. Validation results also reveal that the resulting method improves the accuracy of the estimate of runoff for small watersheds in Taiwan. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analyzing river basins as coupled human and hydrological systems is important to advance our understanding of hydrological processes, and to provide insights into policy design for water resources management. However, assessing spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic characteristics of human-hydrological interactions remains a challenge, and relevant research has been limited by the lack of computationally tractable models that can integrate water management policies, human activities, and hydrological conditions with sufficient temporal and spatial details. In this study, we propose a modeling framework that tightly couples (1) an agent-based model for farmers' decision-making on water use influenced by collective water management policies, and (2) a distributed hydrological model for simulating integrated groundwater-surface water processes with high spatial and temporal resolutions. We apply the modeling framework to the Heihe River Basin, a large semi-arid river basin with intensive agriculture in China. Through various policy portfolio analyses, the model has identified several unique spatial-temporal characteristics of human-hydrological interactions. These include (1) nonlinear relationships between water policies, farmers' decisions on water use, and hydrological conditions, (2) spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policies on farmers' conjunctive groundwater and surface water use, and (3) location-dependent temporal patterns regarding water policies' influences on hydrological processes. It is found that regional hydrogeological conditions (e.g., depth to water table, distance to rivers) are key factors to influence human-hydrological interactions. The modeling results could advance our understanding of the role of human activities in hydrological cycles, and yield insights into the design of location-based policies for river basin management.

AB Data of open water evaporation (E-ow), such as evaporation of lake and reservoir, have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects, and water resources planning and management in agriculture, forestry and ecology. Because of the low-cost and maneuverability, measuring the evaporation of a pan has been widely regarded as a reliable approach to estimate E-ow through multiplying an appropriate pan coefficient (K-p). K-p is affected by geometry and materials of a pan, and complex surrounding environment variables. However, the relationship between K-p and different environment variables is unknown. Thus, this study chose China D20 pan as an example, used meteorological observations from 767 stations and introduced the latest PenPan model to analyze the sensitivity of K-p to different environment variables. The results show that, the distribution of annual K-p had a strong spatial gradient. For all the stations, annual K-p ranged from 0.31 to 0.89, and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The sensitivity analysis shows that for China as a whole, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity, followed by air temperature, wind speed and sunshine duration. For 767 stations in China, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations. For stations north of Yellow River, wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables; while for stations south of Yellow River, air temperature was the next sensitive variable. The method introduced in this study could benefit estimating and predicting K-p under future changing environment.

AB The time step used in the operation of eco-friendly reservoirs has decreased from monthly to daily, and even sub-daily. The shorter time step is considered a better choice for satisfying downstream environmental requirements because it more closely resembles the natural flow regime. However, little consideration has been given to the influence of different time steps on the ability to simultaneously meet human and environmental flow requirements. To analyze this influence, we used an optimization model to explore the relationships among the time step, environmental flow (e-flow) requirements, and human water needs for a wide range of time steps and e-flow scenarios. We used the degree of hydrologic alteration to evaluate the regime's ability to satisfy the e-flow requirements of riverine ecosystems, and used water supply reliability to evaluate the ability to satisfy human needs. We then applied the model to a case study of China's Tanghe Reservoir. We found four efficient time steps (2, 3, 4, and 5 days), with a remarkably high water supply reliability (around 80%) and a low alteration of the flow regime (<35%). Our analysis of the hydrologic alteration revealed the smallest alteration at time steps ranging from 1 to 7 days. However, longer time steps led to higher water supply reliability to meet human needs under several e-flow scenarios. Our results show that adjusting the time step is a simple way to improve reservoir operation performance to balance human and e-flow needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research investigates the interannual variability of soil moisture as related to large-scale climate variability and also evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of modeled deep layer (40-140 cm) soil moisture in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). A three layers hydrological model VIC-3L (Variable Infiltration Capacity Model - 3 layers) was used to generate soil moisture in the UCRB over a 50-year period. By using wavelet analysis, deep layer soil moisture was compared to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), precipitation, and streamflow to determine whether deep soil moisture is an indicator of climate extremes. Wavelet and coherency analysis for the UCRB indicated a strong relationship between the PDSI, climate variability and the deep soil moisture. The spatial variability of soil moisture during drought, normal, and wet years was analyzed by using map analysis. Distinct regions showing higher vulnerability to drought and wet conditions were identified in the spatial analysis. The temporal variation in soil moisture was performed by utilizing map analysis in pre-drought, drought, and post-drought years for four drought events, 1953-1956, 1959-1964, 1974-1977, and 1988-1992. Less than 50% of the basin had dry conditions (soil moisture anomaly below -10 mm) for the pre-drought years. Soil moisture anomalies were lower than -10 mm for more than 50% of the basin in 15 out of 19 drought years. Generally, droughts did not end until the average soil moisture anomalies increased to positive values for two consecutive years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest wetland catchments are widely distributed in middle-high latitude and their hydrological and biogeochemical processes are sensitive to climate change. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE), meteorological forcing, and hydrological data in the Shuidong forest wetland catchment (SFWC) were continuously measured by eddy covariance (EC) tower and water monitoring instruments from 2019 to 2020. During rainy season, large carbon dioxide emission was detected with mean NEE value of 1.85 g C m(-2) d(-1) from local footprint area. Significant positive correlation was observed between daily NEE and air temperature (T-air), relative humidity (RH). We further found that the NEE was mainly controlled by ecosystem respiration (RE) instead of gross primary production (GPP), which might be caused by local high Q(10) value. In addition, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic (DON) concentrations near the stream outlet also had significant positive relationship with NEE, indicating the hydrological transport from upland forests may trigger the soil priming effect and result in higher CO2 emission within the local footprint area. Soil CO2 flux measurements from different land uses suggested that wetland may be the primary CO2 emission source during rainy season. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, the CO2 emission hotspot was expected to occur in this forest wetland catchment due to more frequent rainfall events predicted in this region.

AB Tunnelling activities may significantly alter the groundwater balance in a karst aquifer, but assessment of this effect remains challenging due to the complex flow geometries and strong hydrogeological heterogeneity. In this study, based on extensive site characterization of an independent hydrogeological unit (HU) in which a deepburied tunnel is under construction, we present a modified lumped model to evaluate the impact of tunnel construction on the discharge from the aquifer system. The lumped model consists of four interacting flow compartments and the associated water balance equations. A series of simplified models is then developed, by merging or removing some of the flow components that represent different mechanisms and relationships between recharge and discharge. The dominant hydrological processes in the HU are identified by comparing the performance of the models of different structures and by screening analysis of parameter sensitivities. It is found that the tunnel excavation captured a mean portion of 19% discharge from the aquifer system into the tunnel, which is comparable to the result predicted by 3D numerical simulations. This study evidences that as a first and simple approximation, the lumped models provide a useful tool for characterizing the dominant factors that govern the groundwater response and for evaluating the groundwater budget changes induced by anthropogenic activities such as tunnelling and underground mining in karst regions.

AB Specific storage, which represents the aquifer's capacity to release water from or take into storage when water level changes, is an important aquifer property required for transient groundwater modeling and water resources management. This review synthesizes the published literature on using different methods to estimate field specific storage of aquifers. The field methods include pumping tests, slug tests, and analyses of sea tides, atmospheric loading and earth tides, and seismic waves. The present state of knowledge concerning the analytical and numerical models and parameter estimating procedures are presented and applications of these models are discussed. Specific storage values from 182 different field sites are collected, covering a wide range of aquifer materials, including unconsolidated deposits and rocks. The geometric mean of specific storage for unconsolidated deposits mainly range from 10(-5) to 10(-4) m(-1). The geometric mean of specific storage for different types of rocks mainly range from 10(-7) to 10(-6 )m(-1). The corresponding hydraulic conductivity shows a wider range of variation than the specific storage. There is not a clear relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity for all the data but a positive correlation can be found for some types of aquifer materials. Specific storage is positively correlated with porosity of the aquifer. A comparison of the different field methods is presented and future research directions are recommended.

AB The availability of Quebec (Canada) river temperature data has improved significantly in recent years, with increased monitoring effort and sharing of existing data. Although it is now recognized that this variable is of central interest in a variety of instream habitat issues, the actual interpretation and use of the data by managers and researchers can be challenging, due to the spatial sparsity of the measurement sites and to the unevenness of the length of the temperature time series. In this paper, we propose a model for all Quebec rivers thermal regimes, as a means to interpret and exploit the available river temperature data. The model, based on fitting a Gaussian function to time series of interannual mean daily temperatures, was used to characterize the thermal regime at more than 400 locations in Quebec rivers. The three parameters of the model (annual maximum, date of annual maximum and length of the warm season) allowed to produce a first map of Quebec river thermal regimes. A method to quantify the uncertainty on the parameters estimation, taking into account the length of the time series and the interannual variability of the river temperature, is presented. Finally, stepwise regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the basins upstream of the measurement sites.

AB Uncertainty is inherent in streamflow forecasts and is an important determinant of the utility of forecasts for water resources management. However, predictions by deterministic models provide only single values without uncertainty attached. This study presents a method for using a Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model to post-process deterministic streamflow forecasts by quantifying predictive uncertainty. The BJP model is comprised of a log-sinh transformation that normalises hydrological data, and a bi-variate Gaussian distribution that characterises the dependence relationship. The parameters of the transformation and the distribution are estimated through Bayesian inference with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) algorithm. The BJP model produces, from a raw deterministic forecast, an ensemble of values to represent forecast uncertainty. The model is applied to raw deterministic forecasts of inflows to the Three Gorges Reservoir in China as a case study. The heteroscedasticity and non-Gaussianity of forecast uncertainty are effectively addressed. The ensemble spread accounts for the forecast uncertainty and leads to considerable improvement in terms of the continuous ranked probability score. The forecasts become less accurate as lead time increases, and the ensemble spread provides reliable information on the forecast uncertainty. We conclude that the BJP model is a useful tool to quantify predictive uncertainty in post-processing deterministic streamflow forecasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has proved useful for obtaining information on flood extent, which, when intersected with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the floodplain, provides water level observations that can be assimilated into a hydrodynamic model to decrease forecast uncertainty. With an increasing number of operational satellites with SAR capability, information on the relationship between satellite first visit and revisit time and forecast performance is required to optimise the operational scheduling of satellite imagery. By using an Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) and a synthetic analysis with the 2D hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP based on a real flooding case affecting an urban area (summer 2007, Tewkesbury, Southwest UK), we evaluate the sensitivity of the forecast performance to visit parameters. We emulate a generic hydrologic-hydrodynamic modelling cascade by imposing a bias and spatiotemporal correlations to the inflow error ensemble into the hydrodynamic domain. First, in agreement with previous research, estimation and correction for this bias leads to a clear improvement in keeping the forecast on track. Second, imagery obtained early in the flood is shown to have a large influence on forecast statistics. Revisit interval is most influential for early observations. The results are promising for the future of remote sensing-based water level observations for real-time flood forecasting in complex scenarios. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Studies of the hydrology of native eucalypt forests in south-east Australia have focused on ash-type eucalypt species that are largely confined to Victoria and Tasmania. Mixed species foothill forests comprise the largest proportion of the forest estate in south-east Australia, yet are poorly known hydrologically. The ability to predict forest transpiration, both with reasonable accuracy and in response to changes in the environment, is essential for catchment management.
   A soil-plant-atmosphere model (SPA) was validated for 222 days in a mature, mixed species forest of north-east Victoria using measurements of overstorey transpiration (Eucalyptus radiata and Eucalyptus goniocalyx) and site-specific climate and vegetation parameters. There was a stronger relationship between average daily transpiration (0.71 mm day(-1)) and daily minimum relative humidity (R-2 = 0.71), than between average daily transpiration and daily maximum temperature (R-2 = 0.65). Stand water use could be predicted best from vapour pressure deficit (R-2 = 0.89).
   SPA successfully predicted stand transpiration (R-2 = 0.85) over a range of soil water and climatic conditions. A sensitivity analysis suggests that among the various required inputs, leaf area index (LAI) was the most important, and accurate estimates of LAI could significantly improve estimation of stand transpiration.

AB The significance of flow in the matrix of the Chalk unsaturated zone, in comparison with flow in fractures, has been the subject of much debate. In this article, important elements of the literature are discussed in detail and several simple modelling analyses based on steady-state flow are presented. A study of the sensitivity of solute spreading to fracture spacing in models that ignore matrix flow shows that this latter assumption is generally incompatible with observed solute profiles, unless unrealistically small fracture spacings are assumed. The effect of air phase continuities (e.g. bedding planes) on matrix flow has also been examined. These discontinuities are frequently interrupted by points of connectivity between matrix blocks. An issue therefore is the relationship between connectivity and its effect on inter-block conductance. A simple analysis of the Laplace equation shows that just 1% connectivity represents an effective pathway equivalent to 18% of the local rock hydraulic conductivity. Obviously, when there is no fracture flow, solute spreading is significantly reduced. However, dual permeability model simulations show that matrix flow reduces solute spreading in the presence of persistent fracture flow. All of the above studies suggest that flow in the matrix of the Chalk unsaturated zone is significant and that ignoring it may result in a serious misunderstanding of the system.

AB Optical remote sensing images are a common data sources for surface water monitoring, while they are easily contaminated by clouds, cloud shadows, terrain shadows, etc., resulting in spatial gaps in surface water images. This paper proposes a surface water gap-filling method based on Naive Bayes classification. It uses the historical cloud-free binary (water, non-water) surface water images as prior data and the uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated ternary (water, non-water, contaminated pixels) surface water image as evidence to identify the category of gap pixels to achieve the purpose of gap-filling. This method considers the relationship between disconnected water bodies and does not depend on terrain data. When the image is heavily covered by clouds, this method can also reconstruct the complete water extent accurately. Five study areas with different scenarios including rivers, lakes or reservoirs, are selected to evaluate the method. Results show that the average gap-filling accuracy in all five study areas is over 90 %. After gap-filling, the time series of surface water area presents a good correlation with the time series of water level (e.g., the coefficient of determinationR2 = 0.95 in the Dartmouth reservoir). The proposed method is proved effective in filling gaps caused by clouds, cloud shadows and terrain shadows in surface water image, and it would be suitable for high-frequency surface water monitoring and near real-time surface water mapping.

AB The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) lacks the assessment mechanism for the coupling relationship between the magnitudes of the precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (ETP), and water deficit, making it hard to predict the drought precisely. This paper selected the marginal and joint cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of P and-ETP to present their magnitudes and water deficit, respectively. We formatted the Frank copula-based SPEI (SPEIC) to combine the marginal CDFs at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month scales. It indicated that the two-parameter Gamma distribution was the best-fitted marginal CDFs of the P (CDFP) and-ETP (CDF-ETP). The CDFP exerted a slightly more significant marginal effect on the joint CDF than the CDF-ETP at 6 to 12-month scales, indicated by the steeper slope of the CDFP's marginal curves vs joint CDF. The verified more significant marginal effect denied the implied assumption of the same marginal effects of the P and-ETP using SPEI. The new-constructed SPEIC temporally fluctuated highly consistent with the SPEI in the whole, energy-and water-limited regions of China, indicated by the higher 3 to 12-month-averaged Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coef-ficient >= 0.63 and determination coefficient >= 0.75. The SPEIC had a more sensitive detectivity of the drought frequency, indicated by more events detected. Besides, it had a minor sensitive detectivity of the drought severity, indicated by the larger SPEIC under the same specified frequencies of the P and-ETP.

AB Expected increases in intensity and frequency of rainfall extremes due to climate change, and increased paving and loss of water storage space in urban areas is making cities more vulnerable to pluvial flooding. It is a crucial step towards risk mitigation and adaptation planning to evaluate and predict flood disaster risk. In this study, a model coupling ontology and Bayesian Network that can capture the potential relationships between different factors influencing flood disaster and has capable of quantifying uncertainty and utilizing both data and observations was proposed. Based on the proposed model, the flood disaster risk in Zhengzhou City was assessed, which was validated by comparing with actual historical flood records. And the sensitivity analysis was carried out based on this model to determine that which factors would affect the disaster most. The results show that 72.3% of the study area was characterized by very-high to moderate flood disaster risk, which was mainly located in the central and eastern regions. The sensitivity analysis show that the rainfall duration is the most impactful factor, and the factors related to disaster-formative environment have low effect. The results revealed quite good agreement between the predicted flood disaster risk with actual flood records, which can be useful to assist flood mitigation and management. The model proposed in this study offers the Zhengzhou City and flood researches around the world, an effective way for evaluating flood disaster risk to manage uncertainty in water availability under climate change.

AB Predictions of hydrological regimes at ungauged sites are required for various purposes such as setting environmental flows, assessing availability of water resources or predicting the probability of floods or droughts. Four contrasting methods for estimating mean flow, proportion of flow in February, 7-day mean annual low flow, mean annual high flow, the all-time flow duration curve and the February flow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model (TopNet); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the TopNet estimates using flow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in TopNet model performance could be made when TopNet time-series were corrected using flow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in TopNet performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the TopNet model. The Random Forests method provided the best estimates of the flow duration curves and all hydrological indices except mean flow. Mean flow was best estimated using the already published Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we investigated the influence of the construction of Sobradinho dam on daily streamflow of Sao Francisco river, Brazil, using permutation entropy method. We analyzed a long daily streamflow time series recorded during the period 1929-2010 encompassing the construction of Sobradinho dam between 1973 and 1979. We found that the original and deseasonalized streamflow time series are characterized by clear different complexity and entropy patterns before the construction of the dam; while, after it, their degree of randomness and complexity are nearly identical. Furthermore, investigating the oscillatory behavior of the entropy and complexity time variation, the periodicity of 3.67 years was identified, identical to one of the main periodicities revealed in the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI). Such finding confirms the close relationship between streamflow dynamics and ENSO phenomenon. After the construction of the dam, the time variation of entropy and complexity changes almost abruptly toward stochastic regime characterized by higher entropy and lower complexity. Although the dam operations could be considered responsible for such abrupt dynamical change in the streamflow, we cannot exclude the presence of a co-induced ENSO effect; in fact, the analysis of MEI shows a strikingly similar and concomitant change in the long-term trend, identified by using the singular spectrum analysis.

AB Water problems have long been among the most urgent issues affecting China's lower Yellow River. In recent decades, the regime of the streamflow flowing into the lower Yellow River has been significantly altered by large reservoirs and dams. In this work, we investigate the "valve function" of Xiaolangdi Dam on the water discharge for multiple scales. Xiaolangdi Dam exhibits little impact on the total streamflow in the long run, although it dramatically changes the seasonal distribution. The ratio of average daily discharge during non-flood seasons to average daily discharge during flood seasons at Xiaolangdi station increased progressively from 39.8% during 1971-1989 to 93.2% during 1997-2016. Based on a linear relationship determined from historical data, the theoretical daily discharge at Huayuankou station in the absence of Xiaolangdi Dam was reconstructed. Through comparative analysis of the observed and reconstructed daily discharge series, we estimate that 78% of the potential flood events that could have happened during 1997-2007 were mitigated due to the construction and operation of Xiaolangdi Dam. Meanwhile, the peak discharge at Huayuankou station was also reduced from > 6000 m(3)/s to < 4500 m(3)/s. The redistribution of seasonal discharge by Xiaolangdi Dam not only is beneficial for meeting water demand but also effectively extirpates the river drying-up phenomenon.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine applicability of the iodine-starch method to visualize heterogenous soil water flow and to investigate relationships between soil water heterogeneity and macropore structure vs. measurement scale as well as hydraulic boundaries. The food-grade dye pigment Brilliant Blue FCF dye and iodine-starch staining patterns were used to visualize soil macropore and soil water flow patterns, respectively. Totally 10 infiltration experiments were performed in the field, among which three were used to examine the iodine-starch method and seven were for various boundary conditions (i.e., the different initial ponding depths on the soil surface) and measurement scales (i.e., the soil surface areas covered initially by the tracer solutions). The cluster analysis method was used to distinguish preferential flow regions, while information measures were applied to quantify heterogeneity information content and complexity of macropores and flow systems. Results showed that the iodine-starch method was applicable to visualize soil water flow. Heterogeneous soil water flow contained more heterogeneity information than soil macropores. With a low infiltration amount, flow patterns were similar to the macropore patterns and controlled mainly by the macropores. As the infiltration amount increased, flow patterns were influenced by both macropores and boundary conditions. As the measurement scales increased, the preferential regions were more developed.

AB Chloride (Cl)-based tracing methods are popular for deep drainage (or potential groundwater recharge) estimation in the unsaturated zone, but uncertainties in various such methods have rarely been investigated. We collected 1827 samples from 24 soil profiles under plants with shallow or deep root systems in the thick unsaturated loess deposits of China, and measured soil water, Cl, and tritium contents. With the drainage estimated with the tritium peak method as reference, we evaluated the applicability of several Cl-based approaches for drainage estimation under shallow- and deep-rooted plants, including the chloride mass balance method (CMB), chloride storage method (CS), chloride peak method (CP) and chloride-water mass balance method (CWMB). The estimated deep drainages varied with methods, and the uncertainties were large with a coefficient of variation of 0.71. Compared to the drainage obtained from tritium-based methods (33.6 +/- 11.2 and 9.6 +/- 14.5 mm year-1 under shallow- and deep-rooted plants, respectively), CMB and CS (38.0 +/- 16.6 and 36.7 +/- 17.6 mm year-1) performed better than CP (23.2 +/- 17.8 mm year-1) under shallow-rooted plants, while CWMB (7.6 +/- 13.9 mm year-1) performed better under deep-rooted plants. The large discrepancy in estimated drainage originates from methodological theory such as the time scales of representation and sensitivity to exogenous Cl inputs. The root water uptake-induced soil water depletion can enrich soil Cl concentration and greatly influence CMB and CP. Our findings provide insights for how to estimate deep drainage through appropriate methods.

AB Accurate prediction of groundwater level (GWL) over a period of time is of great importance for groundwater resources management. Machine learning techniques due to their great performance have recently been used for this problem. Previous methods, however, did not consider the spatial relationships between wells due to the difficulty to handle unstructured well location data. In this paper, a graph neural network (GNN) is used to forecast groundwater dynamics where it can represent each well as a node in the graph. The spatial information is, thus, extracted from an interconnected network using graph convolution layers with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix. The temporal features of the sequence are obtained by gated temporal convolutional networks. The model was applied and evaluated for wells in the southwest area of British Colombia in Canada using data about 11 years (2010-2020). The proposed model performs better in terms of all the defined evaluation metrics, when compared with two baseline models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). More-over, when the spatial dependencies are completely unknown, the model can still learn them from the data and obtain comparable performance. Furthermore, the proposed model has a high efficiency since it can simulta-neously model GWL change for all monitoring wells in the system. We also demonstrated that the spatial de-pendencies between each well could be intuitively interpreted from the learned adjacency matrix.

AB We propose a stochastic approach for simulation of realistic continuous snow depth time series using a snow depth estimation model and a stochastic weather generation model. The snow depth estimation model consists of three steps: defining the precipitation type, estimating the snow ratio, and estimating the decreased snow depth. First, air temperature and relative humidity are used as indices to determine the type of precipitation when precipitation occurs. When the type is identified as snow, the snow ratio is estimated, converting the precipi-tation depth into depth of fresh snow. Here, the snow ratio is estimated through sigmoidal relationship with the air temperature. Lastly, the amount of decreased snow depth was estimated using a novel temperature index snowmelt equation that can consider depth-dependent melting of snowpack. The model was applied to four meteorological stations of Korea and yielded high Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values which ranged between 0.745 and 0.875 for calibration, and ranged between 0.432 and 0.753 for validation. This calibrated snow depth estimation model was then applied to synthetic weather data (precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) that was generated by stochastic weather generation model to simulate continuous snow depth time series. The simulated snow depth data accurately reproduced standard and extreme value statistics of the observed data, the latter of which were consistent with the current Korean Building Code. This model can be widely used not only in the field of snow related risk analysis, but also in data simulation for ungauged areas and future trend study using the climate projection.

DE Tritium; Precipitation; Surface water; Residence time
ID MODIFIED GLOBAL-MODEL; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; RESIDENCE TIMES; AGE
AB The tritium concentration in the surface hydrosphere throughout California was characterized to examine the reasons for spatial variability and to enhance the applicability of tritium in hydrological investigations. Eighteen precipitation samples were analyzed and 148 samples were collected from surface waters across California in the Summer and Fall of 2013, with repeat samples from some locations collected in Winter and Spring of 2014 to examine seasonal variation. The concentration of tritium in present day precipitation varied from 4.0 pCi/L near the California coast to 17.8 pCi/L in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Concentrations in precipitation increase in spring due to the 'Spring Leak' phenomenon. The average coastal concentration (6.3 +/- 1.2 pCi/L) in precipitation matches estimated pre-nuclear levels. Surface water samples show a trend of increasing tritium with inland distance. Superimposed on that trend, elevated tritium concentrations are found in the San Francisco Bay area compared to other coastal areas, resulting from municipal water imported from inland mountain sources and local anthropogenic sources. Tritium concentrations in most surface waters decreased between Summer/Fall 2013 and Winter/Spring 2014 likely due to an increased groundwater signal as a result of drought conditions in 2014. A relationship between tritium and electrical conductivity in surface water was found to be indicative of water provenance and anthropogenic influences such as agricultural runoff. Despite low initial concentrations in precipitation, tritium continues to be a valuable tracer in a post nuclear bomb pulse world. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precipitation on the subtropical Andes in northwestern Argentina is the main source of freshwater to rivers, which provide water for consumption, hydroelectric generation and irrigation of agricultural fields. Regional streamflow records for the past 60 years indicate a period of enhanced inter-annual and inter-decadal variability during recent decades. Here we present a long-term perspective of streamflow variations for Rio Bermejo, a major river in the subtropics of Argentina-Bolivia. This streamflow reconstruction covers the period 1680-2001 and was performed using principal component regression models based on precipitation sensitive tree-ring width series. Composite tree-ring chronologies from Juglans australis, Cedrela lilloi and Schinopsis lorentzii were used as predictors to reconstruct the May-October (dry season) streamflow variations. Monthly instrumental streamflow records were used to assess the temporal relationship between climatic data and tree-ring records. The regression model explains 52% of the variance of May-October Bermejo discharge (R-2 adj = 0.499) over the period 1941-1992. Analyses of the frequency, intensity and duration of pluvials and droughts indicates a sustained increase in streamflow since the 1960s, which is exceptional since 1680. Pearson's correlation coefficients between Rio Bermejo records against gridded interpolated precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation indicate that the South American monsoon is the main source of regional precipitation and the consequent discharge of subtropical rivers in northern Argentina. Long-term streamflow reconstructions in subtropical South America contribute to our understanding of past and present climate variations and the related large-scale atmospheric features that drive these variations.

AB The flood-pulse of the large rivers in Central Amazonia triggers ecological processes of the floodplain systems inducing a severe seasonality in the annual cycle between the aquatic and the terrestrial phase. The nutrient-rich floodplains (varzea) have the highest human population density in Amazonia and economic activities such as fishing, agriculture, pasture and timber extraction are directly associated with water-level fluctuations. The discharge of many tropical river systems responds to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) originating from the tropical Pacific. Several studies show a strong relationship between the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers and ENSO-indices, such as the meteorological Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). During warm ENSO-phases (El Nino) flood-levels are lowered and aquatic phases are shortened, white high and prolonged flooding is associated to cold ENSO-phases (La Nina). Here we present retrospective forecasts of the maximum water Level in Central Amazonia from 1903 to 2004-generally occurring in the second half Of June-and the length of the aquatic phase along the flood-gradient by models based on the SOI and SST anomalies of the El Nino 3.4 region in February, four months before its appearance. The forecast of the flood-pulse allows also predicting parameters correlated with the flood-pulse (e.g., tree growth, biogeochemical cycles) and increases the efficiency in planning and executing of economic activities by the human population (e.g.; fishery, timber extraction, agriculture).

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of point precipitation quantites representing abnormal moisture conditions over the Colorado River Basin (CRB) is analyzed by means of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), calculated in annual and seasonal aggregations. From a cell-by-cell analysis, the area covered by abnormally wet and dry conditions during the last century shows an inverse relationship with their frequency of occurrence, with frequent events (occurring 80% of the time) in which abnormal conditions cover less than 10% of the basin and infrequent events (occurring 5% of the time) in which abnormal conditions cover around 50% of the basin. During Et Nino years, both extremely wet and dry conditions are likely to occur, while only extremely dry conditions are probable during La Nina years. Regions of homogeneous SPI realizations were delimited using principal components analysis (PCA) to highlight major variation modes distinguishable in the basin, and a frequency analysis was performed over the reconstructed values of SPI to identify their multiannual oscillation modes. Common multiannual oscillations between the SPI index, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Bivariate Et Nino-Southern Oscillation (BEST) time series were explored using multichannel singular spectrum analysis (M-SSA). The coupled impact of PDO-ENSO indicates the presence of a trend and two significant oscillations around 5 and 15 years on the SPI time series. The occurrence of extreme SPI values associated with ENSO and PDO was also evaluated as a common product of these indices that highlights moisture conditions affected by common enhancement phases of ENSO and PDO.

AB In relatively large, forested watersheds, different types of forest disturbances such as timber harvesting, wildfire, and insect infestation often cumulatively and interactively affect runoff. There is a general lack of studies examining cumulative hydrological impacts caused by different types of forest disturbance, particularly in boreal forested watersheds. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of cumulative forest disturbances (timber harvesting, mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation, and wildfire) on annual runoff in two large, forested watersheds situated in the boreal northern interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The study period was divided into the reference period of 1981 to 2003 and the disturbance period of 2004 to 2018. Time series analysis (cross-correlation) was used to determine the statistical relationship between cumulative forest disturbances and annual runoff, while two quantification methods including the modified double mass curve (MDMC) and a sensitivitybased technique were applied to separate the effects of cumulative forest disturbances and climate variability to annual runoff. Surprisingly, our results contradict the well-accepted conclusion that annual runoff increases with forest disturbances. We found that cumulative forest disturbances overall decreased annual runoff in the study watersheds, with varied reductions depending on severities of dominated disturbance types and post-disturbance forest dynamics. Our results also revealed that both cumulative forest disturbance and climate variability played an additive role in decreasing annual runoff during the entire disturbance period. These results provide valuable implications for supporting water management in boreal forested watersheds in the context of the warming climate.

AB Changing conditions of the climate and underlying surface have altered the rainfall-runoff relationships in many basins, greatly increasing additional challenges in the applicability of hydrological models for studying the hydrological response to those potential changes. However, systematic and simultaneous testing and comparing of both temporal and spatial transferabilities of different hydrological models under changing conditions have not received enough attention. The present study investigates the potential differences between temporal and spatial transferabilities of different hydrological models under different climatic and underlying surface conditions, which are synthesized from two basins in Southern China with 50-year historical records (1966-2015). The transferability of five hydrological models, i.e., XAJ, HBV, SIMHYD, IHACRES and GR4J, is investigated under the synthesised changing conditions by using a new evaluation method, proposed in this study. The results show that: (1) the proposed evaluation method is proved to be effective in evaluating the transferability of the models; (2) for temporal transferability under stationary condition, the five models show similar performances, but for spatial transferability, the performances of complex models (XAJ and HBV) are better than that of the simple model (GR4J); (3) the difference in underlying surface conditions in the target basin affects spatial transferability of the models; (4) hydrological models have much better transferability from dry to wet period than otherwise. This study provides an insight to test temporal and spatial transferabilities of hydrological models in the context of changing climate and underlying surface conditions.

AB We conducted a multidisciplinary study to analyze the structure and the hydrogeological functioning of an andesitic coastal aquifer and to highlight the importance of faults and associated rock fracturing on groundwater flow. A helicopter-borne geophysical survey with an unprecedented resolution (SkyTEM) was flown over this aquifer in 2013. TDEM resistivity, total magnetic intensity, geological and hydrogeological data from 30 boreholes and two pumping tests were correlated, including one which lasted an exceptional 15 months. We demonstrate that heterogeneous hydrodynamic properties and channelized flows result from tectonically-controlled aquifer compartmentalization along the structural directions of successive tectonic phases. Significant fracturing of the central compartment results in enhanced hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer and an inverse relationship between electrical resistivity and transmissivity. Basalts within the fractured compartment have lower resistivity and higher permeability than basalts outside the compartment. Pumping tests demonstrate that the key factor is the hydraulic conductivity contrast between compartments rather than the hydrodynamic properties of the fault structure. In addition, compartmentalization and associated transmissivity contrasts protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion. Finally, unlike basaltic volcanic islands, the age of the volcanic formations is not the key factor that determines hydrodynamic properties of andesitic islands. Basalts that are several million years old (15 Ma here) have favorable hydrodynamic properties that are generated or maintained by earthquakes/faulting that result from active subduction beneath these islands, which is superimposed on their primary permeability.

DE aquifer test; discontinuous medium; karst; exploitation borehole
AB A 5-year daily measurement of the dynamic level in a borehole was plotted versus cumulative yield since the beginning of exploitation. Eighty percent of the experimental curve is explained by a linear function (h = aQ(c) + h(0)) by intervals. Only floods, which follow heavy storms and non-pumping cannot be taken into account. The slopes of the straight lines are spread around two constant values of the slope: a(r) = +0.35 x 10(-3) m m(-3), which characterizes the part which is controlled by recharge, and a(p) = -0.14 x 10(-3) m m(-3), which characterizes the draining part of the aquifer fractures. This linear fitting demonstrates that the borehole -aquifer system can be considered as an equivalent continuous medium, where the linear relationship between dynamic head and pumped yield are defined by the values of ar and a, Thus the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer differs according to the pumping rate: equivalent continuous medium for a low rate, dual permeability for a high one. This work demonstrates that the long-term behavior of an exploited fissured aquifer can be described by a simple model, if the duration of the aquifer test is long enough (1-3 months). It also shows that the production phase must include repetitive head measurements in order to refine the exploitation yield and the management conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The groundwater tracers, deuterium ( H-2 or D) and oxygen-18 (O-18) are widely used to determine groundwater recharge origin, rate and temperature. Quantitative methods able to interpret delta D and delta O-1(8) mobility in the subsurface, especially under high pressure and temperature conditions, remain the focus of ongoing research. Here we developed an isotope transport module as an add-on to the TOUGH2 simulator, which is able to describe the evolution of delta D and delta O-1(8) in groundwater induced by advection, dispersion, water-rock interaction, and fractionation due to changes of water phase and density. The new model was tested by modelling the groundwater flow, temperature, fluid density and isotopic composition in a faulted, geothermal system in the Guide Basin, China. We found that the density-driven flow induced by temperature variations can lead to isotope fractionation between low- and high-density water. In addition, the density-driven flow creates multiple flow systems in the fault damage zone, increasing the complexity of the spatiotemporal isotope distribution. The results indicate that in scenarios where a density contrast occurs, such as in geothermal systems, the relationship between delta D and delta O-1(8) in recharge water and discharging groundwater can only be fully understood if the coupled processes of fluid flow, heat transport and isotope fractionation in the subsurface are accounted for.

AB Climate change has the potential to intensify the hydrological cycle, leading to more intense precipitation with associated changes in the intensity, frequency and severity of floods. Climate variability and change beyond a few years to a few decades ahead have significant social, economic, and environmental implications. It is believed that some aspects of this decadal variability could be predictable for a decade or longer in advance. Keeping this in mind, phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), for the first time, provides 10-30 years predictions obtained from the General Circulation Models (GCMs).
   This study aims to analyse the CMIP5 decadal predictions for precipitation over five sub-basins of river Brahmaputra. Daily precipitation data of five GCMs, namely F-GOALS-g2, BCC-CSM1-1, IPSL-CM5A, CanCM4 and MRI-CGCM3 are used for this assessment. Empirical relationships between the basin averaged rainfall wet spell (storm) properties and the characteristics of the floods are formulated for storms which lead to significant short-term flood response. Following this, the changes in the flood behaviour in the future are derived on the basis of changes in the characteristics of wet rainfall spells in 2010-2020. The results suggest an increase in the number of spells with higher rainfall and longer duration which can lead to increase in peak flood and the total flood volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate and reliable mid- to long-term streamflow prediction is essential for water resources management. However, streamflow series exhibits strong non-stationary and non-linear; thus the traditional single model may fail to capture the characteristic of hydrological series and hard to maintain the robustness of the model. To overcome this problem, the application of empirical wavelet transform combined with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEWT) is firstly to eliminate the redundant noise and decompose original series into several components as inputs. Secondly, gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to deep learn the relationship between historical streamflow series and those of the future. Finally, balancing underfitting and overfitting the improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) is adopted with the hybrid model to identify the approximate parameter combination. The case study is conducted by monthly streamflow data at Shangjingyou station and Fenhe reservoir station in the upper reaches of Fenhe River. In comparison with parallel experiments using extreme learning machine (ELM) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), the validation results demonstrate that the GRU model can exhibit satisfactory performance in monthly streamflow forecasting. Moreover, the standard GRU model is further improved by IGWO, which consistently remains the performance of in-sample and out-sample. The proposed model ICEEWT-IGWO-GRU is superior to the single GRU model average reducing MAE and RMSE by 50% and 52% for two stations, which indicates its superiority with a more robust prediction.

AB In this study, we proposed a hybrid approach combining the standard FAO-56 method with the complementary principle of evapotranspiration (ET) to predict actual ET (ETa) on a rainfed crop field. A generalized complementary relationship (GCR) was employed to quantify the water stress coefficient (K-s) for the FAO-56 method with no use of soil moisture data. Then, the K-s values were multiplied to the crop ET (ETc) estimated with the corrected air temperatures for the assumption of adequate land-surface moisture. The proposed hybrid method applied to a rotational maize-soybean field where an eddy-covariance flux tower was installed. Results showed that the reference ET (ETo) estimated by the corrected temperatures was within a range of 89-95% of that from non-corrected ones, implying that ETo could be inflated when using the mean air temperatures measured under sub-humid conditions. The K-s values estimated by GCR showed consistent patterns with temporal rainfall variation on the field. The multiplication of the K-s from GCR and ETc showed higher performance in ETa prediction than when the GCR was solely applied. By inverting the hybrid approach, a local crop coefficient curve for the rainfed maize field was developed, and led to further improvement in ETa prediction. This study suggests that combination of the complementary principle and the FAO-standard method, which are seemingly in separate paradigms, may improve ETa prediction on crop fields.

AB Urbanization represents a dramatic example of human interference with the hydrological cycle. Changes to ground cover affect both the hydrological and geochemical characteristics in a watershed. Ecosystem degradation also occurs in undisturbed watersheds at the "urban fringe" due to regional atmospheric deposition. These urban fringe catchments can also serve as an upstream source of various chemical constituents into downstream (urban) river systems. The current study focuses on the impacts of regional urbanization in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed located on the eastern edge of the Los Angeles basin, where estimates of dry deposition are considered some of the highest in North America. Collected hydrologic, geochemical and atmospheric data were assessed at seasonal time scales to evaluate current hydrochemical. dynamics. Stream water chemical composition in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed exhibits significant seasonal variability, particularly for [NO3-]. Almost all study solutes show dilution behavior. However, hydrologically enhanced behavior was observed for [NO3-] with increased concentrations during the wet season. Seasonal stream concentration-discharge relationships were developed using a hyperbolic dilution model The developed model was then used to predict concentrations for observational gaps in stream water chemical composition, allowing for seasonal and annual mass loadings to be estimated for the downstream urban stream. The hydrological. signal in the resultant chemical loads is extremely strong, especially during the wet season. Both observations and model predictions indicate the watershed is a sink for atmospheric nitrate and a source for various cations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The frequency and severity of extreme weather events have been noted to be changing in both time and space as a result of rising global temperatures. In this regard, the analysis of joint occurrences of extreme climate events has gained considerable importance for planning and emergency management as such events often result in system failures that extend beyond a single location in the region impacted. By their very definition, extremes cannot be sampled frequently, necessitating approaches that are robust and efficient and can take advantage of the Big Data movement we are now a part of. This study introduces a new concept for characterizing such dependence, termed relative connectivity, formulated using the theory of empirical copulas which represent a non-parametric method to describe the joint dependence of random variables. The spatial relative connectivity of extreme rainfall events across 2,708 rainfall stations in Australia is ascertained and conclusions drawn. The extreme rainfall events in Western Australia, southeast South Australia, and southwest Victoria exhibit higher relative connectivity than other regions, suggesting a stronger spatial dependence and higher possibility of concurrence when compared to other regions. The overall variation of relative connectivity is also examined under different low-frequency climatic anomalies (i.e. El Nino and La Nina events) and temperature states. We observe that spatial dependence across raingauges increases under both El Nino and La Nina periods, while it weakens at warmer temperatures, with localized lower relative connectivity at target raingauges.

AB A quantitative understanding of virus removal during aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) in physically and geochemically heterogeneous aquifers is needed to accurately assess human health risks from viral infections. A two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model incorporating processes of virus attachment, detachment, and inactivation in aqueous and solid phases was developed to systematically evaluate the virus removal performance of ASR schemes. Physical heterogeneity was considered as either layered or randomly distributed hydraulic conductivities (with selected variance and horizontal correlation length). Geochemical heterogeneity in the aquifer was accounted for using Colloid Filtration Theory to predict the spatial distribution of attachment rate coefficient. Simulation results demonstrate that the combined effects of aquifer physical heterogeneity and spatial variability of attachment rate resulted in higher virus concentrations in the recovered water at the ASR well (i.e. reduced virus removal). While the sticking efficiency of viruses to aquifer sediments was found to significantly influence virus concentration in the recovered water, the solid phase inactivation under realistic field conditions combined with the duration of storage phase had a predominant influence on the overall virus removal. The relative importance of physical heterogeneity increased under physicochemical conditions that reduced virus removal (e.g. lower value of sticking efficiency or solid phase inactivation rate). This study provides valuable insight on site selection of ASR projects and an approach to optimize ASR operational parameters (e.g. storage time) for virus removal and to minimize costs associated with post-recovery treatment.

ID SEA-WATER INTRUSION; COASTAL AQUIFERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HENRY PROBLEM;
   VULNERABILITY
AB Seawater intrusion (SWI) arising from aquifer depletion is often classified as "active" or "passive", depending on whether seawater moves in the same direction as groundwater flow or not. However, recent studies have demonstrated that alternative forms of active SWI show distinctly different characteristics, to the degree that the term "active SWI" may be misleading without additional qualification. In response, this article proposes to modify hydrogeology lexicon by defining and characterizing three classes of SWI, namely passive SWI, passive-active SWI and active SWI. The threshold parameter combinations for the onset of each form of SWI are developed using sharp-interface, steady-state analytical solutions. Numerical simulation is then applied to a hypothetical case study to test the developed theory and to provide additional insights into dispersive SWI behavior. The results indicate that the three classes of SWI are readily predictable, with the exception of active SWI occurring in the presence of distributed recharge. The key characteristics of each SWI class are described to distinguish their most defining features. For example, active SWI occurring in aquifers receiving distributed recharge only creates watertable salinization downstream of the groundwater mound and only where dispersion effects are significant. The revised classification of SWI proposed in this article, along with the analysis of thresholds and SWI characteristics, provides coastal aquifer custodians with an improved basis upon which to expect salinization mechanisms to impact freshwater availability following aquifer depletion.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Intermittent karst springs; Theoretical model; Physical experiments;
   Periodic variation
ID DRAINAGE; SYSTEM
AB Intermittent karst springs (IKS) are common phenomena in karst areas where spring flow rates rise and fall in variable periods, which is generally attributed to the siphon structure in karst aquifers. However, the previous model assumed that the siphon cavity received a fixed recharge rate, thus the IKS showed a fixed periodic characteristic. In this study, an improved theoretical model (IKS model) was proposed to simulate the hydro-logical process of IKS with changing periods by considering the varying recharge rate from aquifers to the siphon cavity. The model uses two tandem tanks to represent the karst aquifer and siphon cavity separately. The nu-merical solution was obtained by the iterative method to predict the periodic variations of flow rate and eruption time of IKS. The IKS model was verified by physical experiments under four representative recharge conditions, showing good consistency between theoretical and experimental results. It reveals the hydrologic processes mechanism of the IKS by quantitatively describing the relationship between the cycle period of the IKS discharge variations and the flow exchanges in the siphon cavity-aquifer system. Furthermore, this model performs well in simulating the hydrological process of Chaoshuidong Spring in central China and approximately estimated the hydraulic coefficient of the aquifer in the basin based on observed periodic changes in spring discharge. These findings might be essential for the development, management, and protection of groundwater resources in IKS.

AB Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in regional runoff variations, energy dynamics, and vegetation productivity. It is also widely used to detecting agricultural drought. Recently, a severe drought occurred in Yunnan Province in southwestern China, so long-term changes in surface SM were of concern. However, there were only 18 SM stations in Yunnan Province, and the longest observation was less than five years; thus, long-term changes in Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM were investigated. CCI SM and in situ SM had similar trends of temporal variations and a systematic difference. The revised CCI SM was built by a linear regression model based on the relationship between in situ SM at each station and the corresponding grid of CCI SM. The revised CCI SM showed an abnormally low value during the severe drought in 2009, indicating that the monthly revised CCI SM could detect drought in Yunnan Province. SM drought easily occurred during the dry seasons, and the frequency of drought seems to decrease, but the severity of drought increased in the 21st century. The seasonal SM struggled to reflect drought correctly and accurately. CCI SM needs validation before use due to its variable quality. In summary, CCI SM provides a better tool than in situ SM to investigate long-term changes in SM and detect drought, and can be used for climate modeling.

AB Mechanical removal of encroached juniper (Juniperus spp.) is a common practice to restore native grasslands. However, the hydrological responses to grassland restoration remain mostly unquantified for the climate transition zone in the southern Great Plains of the USA where ecosystem evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to the change of vegetation functional type. We used a paired watershed approach to directly quantify the impact of mechanical removal of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L., redcedar) and restoration to native prairie or establishment of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) on root zone soil moisture and event-based runoff for eight years including three main phases - calibration, transition, and restored grassland in north-central Oklahoma, USA. Results showed that the root zone soil water storage on average increased 1.6 and 1.9 times for restored prairie and switchgrass, respectively, after juniper removal. The regression model estimation based on the relationships established in the calibration phases between event-based runoff from control watershed and the treatment watersheds found that the restored prairie and switchgrass production system increased annual runoff by 4.46 and 4.54 times, respectively. These results indicated that both soil moisture and runoff are highly responsive to land use change in the southern Great Plains. Reestablishment of herbaceous dominance by mechanically removing encroached woody species is closely followed by restoration of soil moisture dynamics and watershed runoff regime.

TI The effect of climate policy on the impacts of climate change on river

DE Climate change impacts; Climate mitigation policy; Low flows; High flows
ID FUTURE; UNCERTAINTY; SCENARIOS; MODEL
AB This paper compares the effects of two indicative climate mitigation policies on river flows in six catchments in the UK with two scenarios representing un-mitigated emissions. It considers the consequences of uncertainty in both the pattern of catchment climate change as represented by different climate models and hydrological model parameterisation on the effects of mitigation policy. Mitigation policy has little effect on estimated flow magnitudes in 2030. By 2050 a mitigation policy which achieves a 2 degrees C temperature rise target reduces impacts on low flows by 20-25% compared to a business-as-usual emissions scenario which increases temperatures by 4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century, but this is small compared to the range in impacts between different climate model scenarios. However, the analysis also demonstrates that an early peak in emissions would reduce impacts by 40-60% by 2080 (compared with the 4 degrees C pathway), easing the adaptation challenge over the long term, and can delay by several decades the impacts that would be experienced from around 2050 in the absence of policy. The estimated proportion of impacts avoided varies between climate model patterns and, to a lesser extent, hydrological model parameterisations, due to variations in the projected shape of the relationship between climate forcing and hydrological response.

AB Rainfall erosivity is a key component in soil erosion by water. While kinetic energy and momentum are used to describe the erosivity of rainfall, and both are derived from mass and velocity of raindrops, it is not clear how different substrates transform this energy. In our study we conducted rainfall simulation experiments to determine splash detachment amounts of five substrates (coarse sand, medium sand, fine sand, PE balls, silt) for seven different rainfall intensities (52-116 mm h(-1)). We used linear mixed-effect modeling (LME) to calculate erosivity predictors for each substrate. Additionally, we separated drop-size-velocity relationship into lower left and upper right quarter to investigate the effect of small and slow just as big and fast raindrops on splash detachment amounts.
   We suggest using momentum divided by drop diameter as a substrate-independent erosivity predictor. To consider different substrates specific erosivity parameters are needed. Heavier substrates like sand are best described by kinetic energy multiplied by diameter whereas lighter substrates like silt point to momentum divided by diameter to the power of 1.5. Furthermore, our results show that substrates are differently affected by the size and velocity of drops. While splash detachment of light substances can be reliably predicted by drop size and velocity for small and slow drops, drop size and velocity loses its predictive power in heavier substrates like sand.

AB Methane and water vapor transport in shale (mud rocks) is important in many resource and environmental is-sues, e.g., effectively exploiting shale gas and clearly understanding water and methane global cycles. To investigate methane and water vapor permeability in shale, a new permeability determination method was proposed using a linearization approach based on previous studies. The experimental samples are crushed Carboniferous shale from the eastern Qaidam Basin in China. Simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale were performed. Water vapor was derived through deionized water evaporation under different methane pressures. The relative humidity dynamically changed during the experiment. The methane and water vapor transport processes were observed and recorded, and the methane and water vapor permeability in the shale matrix was calculated. Both the methane and water vapor permeabilities temporally varied, and a critical abrupt point occurred in the decreasing process over time. After the abrupt point, the permeability rapidly decreased, which was mainly due to capillary condensation plugging at high relative humidities. Pore throat closure could dramatically affect permeability. The relationship between permeability and water satu-ration (Sw) conformed to an exponential equation. Methane permeability was sensitive to water saturation variation at very low or high levels (Sw <20 % or Sw >50 %, respectively) and relatively insensitive at a moderate water content. Water vapor permeability variation with water saturation was similar to that in methane but basically remained stable at a moderate water saturation (10 % < Sw < 50%). At high water saturations, water vapor permeability reduction was more sensitive than that in methane.

AB Recent increases in the incidences of wildfires have necessitated the development of methodologies to quantify the effect of these fires on streamflows. Climate variability has been cited as a major challenge in revealing the true contribution of disturbance to streamflow changes. To address this, we developed an annual Budyko "decomposition" method for (1) statistical change detection of hydrologic signatures post-fire, (2) separating climate-driven and fire-driven changes in streamflow, and (3) estimating hydrologic recovery timescales after fire. We demonstrate the use of this methodology for 17 watersheds in Southern California with high interannual variability in precipitation. We show that while traditional metrics like changes in flow or runoff ratio might not detect a disturbance effect due to confounding climate signals, the Budyko framework can be used successfully for statistical change detection. The Budyko approach was also found to be robust in detecting changes in 5 highly burned catchments (>40% burned area ratio), while changes in less burned (2) and unburned catchments (10) were insignificant. We further used the Budyko approach to quantify the contribution of fire-driven versus climate driven changes in streamflow and found that fire contributed to an average increase in streamflow on the order of 80 mm yr 1, though the effect varied greatly between years. Finally, we estimated hydrologic recovery timescales that varied between 5 and 45 years for four burned catchments. We found a significant linear relationship between recovery time and burned area at medium and high severity for our study catchments, with about 4 years of recovery time per 10% of the watershed burned.

AB Simple models capable of describing spatial and temporal patterns of pollutants are needed to understand surface water quality and to identify the main processes that influence the fate and transport of pollutants. This study combines exploratory factor analysis with multilevel and structural equation modeling to: find spatial and temporal patterns of metal and metalloids in the Ctalamochita River Basin (Argentina); identify the processes responsible for the occurrence of these elements; and, establish relationships between latent variables of different aquatic compartments. For this purpose, the metal and metalloid concentration in different matrices was analyzed at sampling sites along 330 km of the river course, including seasonal variations. Our results indicate that the concentration of natural occurring elements in surface water increased downstream the catchment and during the warm-rainy season, as a consequence of surface runoff and groundwater discharge. In contrast, the spatial and seasonal variation in sediment showed an inverse pattern (negative correlation) compared to surface water. On the other hand, copper, zinc and lead were derived from anthropogenic sources, such as old mining areas and metal industries. Moreover, the input of these metals into the river evidenced a direct effect of surface water on sediment, Overall, the combined use of multilevel model and SEM allowed for a proper description of spatial and temporal patterns of metals and metalloids in the catchment, and successfully highlighted sources and processes influencing metal transport. The proposed methodological framework could be extended to wider spatial scales including nested regions, and could be applied to environmental studies dealing with repeated observations and multiple matrices.

AB In this paper we investigate the relationship between hydro-climatic trends and their impacts on water resources at the basin scale, focusing on a catchment on the Italian and Swiss Alps in the period 1974-2010. More generally, we address the topic of trend detection in environmental time series combining novel and traditional tools in order to simultaneously tackle the issue of seasonality and inter-annual variability, which usually characterize natural processes. The paper's contribution is twofold. First, we propose a novel tool to be applied in Exploratory Data Analysis, named MASH (Moving Average over Shifting Horizon). It allows to simultaneously investigate the seasonality in the data and filter out the effects of interannual variability, thus facilitating trend detection. We describe how to combine the MASH with statistical trend detection tests, like the Mann-Kendall test, the Seasonal Kendall test, and the Linear Regression test, and Sen's method, to quantify the trends occurring in different seasons. Second, we estimate the impacts of hydrological changes in terms of water resources and we discuss their relevance from the water resources management perspective. We define and simulate a set of indicators of performances, resilience, reliability, and vulnerability, so to assess the ability of the water resources systems to absorb changes in the hydrological patterns. The analysis reveals that, in the case study area, statistically significant trends in hydro-climatic records have been undergoing in the last decades, although they have had limited impacts on water resources.

ID SUMMER PRECIPITATION; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; CHINA; CLIMATOLOGY; O-18
AB To investigate the atmospheric water cycle over eastern Mongolia and its surrounding regions, a monitoring network for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation has been established. We obtained 66 monthly samples at six stations for a year from October 2002 to September 2003 and 204 daily samples at seven stations during the warm period from April to September of 2003. The observed isotopic composition showed considerable coherence in space and was characterized by a strong correlation with air temperatures (and a weak correlation with precipitation). A Rayteigh-type model involving the temperature and amount of precipitation successfully reproduced day-to-day variations in the observations with root mean square errors of 30%. for JD and 2.7%, for 6180. This good reproducibility demonstrates that isotopic variation of precipitation can be explained by rainout history during transportation from a single vapor-source reservoir. The conditions of the reservoirs generally corresponded with those for a subtropical marine atmosphere, indicating that continental recycling generally has a minor effect at least on the temporal variability of isotopes in the precipitation. In July, however, observed 6 values were very much lower than predicted. Considering the atmospheric circulation pattern and its relationship to isotopic data, it is inferred that the additive water vapor with tow 6 might be supplied from regions in the south (e.g., rice paddy fields in southeast China). Transient eddies can play an important role in transporting such water vapor to eastern Mongolia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of artificial neural network (ANN) models in water resources applications has grown considerably over the last decade. However, an important step in the ANN modelling methodology that has received little attention is the selection of appropriate model inputs. This article is the first in a two-part series published in this issue and addresses the lack of a suitable input determintion methodology for ANN models in water resources applications. The current state of input determination is reviewed and two input determination methodologies are presented. The first method is a model-free approach, which utilises a measure of the mutual information criterion to characterise the dependence between a potential model input and the output variable. To facilitate the calculation of dependence in the case of multiple inputs, a partial measure of the mutual information criterion is us In the second method, a self-organizing map (SOM) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and obtain independent inputs. To determine which inputs have a significant relationship with the output (dependent) variable. a hybrid genetic algorithm and general regression neural network (GAGRNN) is used. Both input determination techniques are tested on a number of synthetic data sets. where the dependence attributes were known a priori. In the second paper of the series, the input determination methodology is applied to a real-world case study in order to determine suitable model inputs for forecasting salinity in the River Murray, South Australia, 14 days in advance.

AB The apparent potential evaporation E-pa represents the atmospheric evaporation demand which is essential in estimating the actual evaporation. In practice, E-pa is usually formulated by different functions based on Penman method or by pan measurements. However, it remains unclear which formulation is preferred for different ecosystems. In this study, we adopted two formulations of E-pa by the Penman methods (E-pMO based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and E-pu2 based on the Rome wind function) and another two formulations by the pan evaporation measurements (E-D20 observed by the D20 pan and E-E601 observed by the E-601B pan) at multi eddy covariance (EC) stations including different ecosystem types. The four formulations were compared in estimating actual evaporation (E) with the aid of a generalized complementary function. Our results show that: 1) For short vegetations (i.e., grass and crop), E-D20 is a competitive candidate because this in-situ measurement can accurately reflect the dynamics of the underlying surface through observation, and it is widely accessible and easy to deploy; 2) For high vegetations like forests, E-pMO is the best candidate because this theoretical formulation incorporates both evaporation demands from the high canopy and ground surface, which cannot be reasonably captured by the other three candidates; 3) When the canopy information (e.g., displacement height and roughness lengths) is not available, E-pu2 can be regarded as a useful alternative formulation of E-pa with moderate accuracy in evaporation estimation.

AB This study demonstrated that the Standardised Flow Index (SFI) was a simple and useful tool to research, monitor and manage hydrologic drought in a highly regulated river system, the Murrumbidgee River in southeast Australia. To validate the applicability of the theory underlining the widely used Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) to river discharge data, we investigated the probability distribution of the time series of monthly river discharge month by month using long-term (over 100 years) river flow records. Our results showed that the Gamma probability distribution function was adequate to describe and model the skewed river flow data. The generalised additive models (GAM) with Locally Estimated Scattersplot Smoothing (LOESS) additive terms were applied to the computed SFI and SPI sequences to investigate the impacts of river regulation and water diversion on the duration and magnitude of hydrologic droughts in Lower Murrumbidgee River from 1890. The results revealed that upstream regulations had successfully reduced the drought severity at Wagga Wagga, a weir located downstream of the two major dams but immediately upstream of the major irrigation areas. However, the hydrological benefits of river regulation gradually disappeared as the river travels downstream and more and more water abstracted. At Balranald, the end valley weir, hydrologic drought was progressively aggravated during the modelling period, and the impacts were greater during drier periods. The results of the study highlighted the importance of balancing the needs between upstream and downstream water users in river management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As hydrologic and water quality (H/WQ) models are increasingly used to guide water resource policy, management, and regulation, it is no longer appropriate to disregard uncertainty in model calibration, validation, and evaluation. In the present research, the method of calculating the error term in pairwise comparisons of measured and predicted values was modified to consider measurement uncertainty with the goat of facilitating enhanced evaluation of H/WQ models. The basis of this method was the theory that H/WQ models should not be evaluated against the values of measured data, which are uncertain, but against the inherent measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the deviation calculations of several goodness-of-fit indicators were modified based on the uncertainty boundaries (Modification 1) or the probability distribution of measured data (Modification 2). The choice between these two modifications is based on absence or presence of distributional information on measurement uncertainty. Modification 1, which is appropriate in the absence of distributional information, minimizes the calculated deviations and thus produced substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit indicators for each example data set. Modification 2, which provides a more realistic uncertainty estimate but requires distributional information on uncertainty, resulted in smaller improvements. Modification 2 produced small goodness-of-fit improvement for measured data with little uncertainty but produced modest improvement when data with substantial uncertainty were compared with both poor and good model predictions. This limited improvement is important because poor model good ness-of-fit, especially due to model structure deficiencies, should not appear satisfactory simply by including measurement uncertainty.

   PROOF
AB According to the traditional notion of randomness and uncertainty, natural phenomena are separated into two mutually exclusive components, random (or stochastic) and deterministic. Within this dichotomous logic, the deterministic part supposedly represents cause-effect relationships and, thus, is physics and science (the 'good'), whereas randomness has little relationship with science and no relationship with understanding (the 'evil'). Here I argue that such views should be reconsidered by admitting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of nature, that causality implies dependence of natural processes in time, thus suggesting predictability, but even the tiniest uncertainty (e.g. in initial conditions) may result in unpredictability after a certain time horizon. On these premises it is possible to shape a consistent stochastic representation of natural processes, in which predictability (suggested by deterministic laws) and unpredictability (randomness) coexist and are not separable or additive components. Deciding which of the two dominates is simply a matter of specifying the time horizon and scale of the prediction. Long horizons of prediction are inevitably associated with high uncertainty, whose quantification relies on the long-term stochastic properties of the processes.

AB Groundwater (GW) is a vital resource for human consumption, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic development in different parts of the world. Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.

AB In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is proposed to assess flood susceptibility for urban catchment. Nine explanatory factors covering precipitation, topographical, and anthropogenic aspects were selected and two CNNs, SCNN and LeNet-5, were implemented to identify the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 in the Dahongmen catchment in Beijing, China. The performance of the CNNs was compared with that of support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models for three model input strategies (point-based, array-based and imaged-based strategies). The results showed that (1) The two CNNs performed better than the SVM and RF, with an accuracy of 0.90 for SCNN and 0.88 for Lenet-5 in the testing period. (2) The CNN-based approach provided more reliable flood susceptibility maps than the comparative models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) index of 0.9 validating by another flood inventory. (3) The upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurately identified by using point-based and array-based strategies. These errors were corrected by considering topographical information using the imaged-based CNN approach. (4) The fixed architecture LeNet-5 produced satisfactory results and avoided the time-consuming process of architecture selection of CNN. We conclude that the proposed CNN-based approach is a valid approach and provides a high-quality susceptibility map for urban mitigation and flood management.

AB As one of the largest karst regions in the world, southwest China is experiencing severe soil erosion due to its special geological conditions, inappropriate land use, and lower soil loss tolerance. Knowledge and accurate estimations of changes in sediment discharge rates is important for finding potential measures to effectively control sediment delivery. This study investigated temporal variation in monthly sediment discharge (SD), and developed sediment rating curves and state-space model to estimate SD. Monthly water discharge, SD, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and normalized differential vegetation index during 2003-2015 collected from a typical karst catchment of Yujiang River were analyzed in present study. A Mann-Kendal test and Morlet wavelet analysis were employed to detect the changes in SD. Results indicated that a decreasing trend was observed in sediment discharge at monthly and annual scale. The water and sediment discharge both had a significant 1-year period, implying that water discharge has substantial influence on SD. The best state-space model using water discharge was a simple but effective model, accounting for 99% of the variation in SD. The sediment rating curves, however, represented only 78% of the variation in SD. This study provides an insight into the possibility of accurate estimation of SD only using water discharge with state-space model approach. State-space model is recommended as an effective approach for quantifying the temporal relationships between SD and its driving factors in karst regions of southwest China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture are important for explaining hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. The fate of various hillslope flow paths can vary seasonally and their relationship with rainfall events can be nonstationary. We collected high resolution in situ soil moisture datasets at 30 points (10 locations in three depths) between March and November in a steep mountainous hillslope. The wavelet coherence analysis of eco-hydrometeorological factors and soil moistures indicated distinctive controls of rainfall and evapotranspiration over soil moisture at time scales of under a day. The vertical flow in upslope areas can be explained by significant wavelet coherence in soil moisture profiles. The appearance of lateral flow with vertical flow in the downslope is associated with even more significant wavelet coherence between identical depths. The wavelet coherence analysis between two soil moisture time series both along hillslope layers and depth profiles provided good spatial and temporal representations of hillslope hydrological processes in terms of their timing and scale. The distributions of soil moisture coherences showed distinctive characteristics for three different seasons. The seasonally distinctive role of vegetation to infiltration was apparent for the upslope area, but the combined impact of vegetation and topography controlled more complicated hydrological processes in the downslope area. The phase angle analysis was introduced to show the profile difference of hydrological processes on various time scales.

AB Statistical and specific correlation data analyses have been carried out on an ultra-centenarian hydrological series to establish the relationship between spring discharge and rainfall. Analyses focused on the Serino springs, the main spring area of the karst aquifer in the Terminio massif (Southern Italy), which supplies the Naples area with a discharge of approximately 1-3.5 m(3)/s. Due to the Mediterranean climate, which causes a rapid increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in rainfall towards spring-summer, spring discharge amplifies the effect of poor rainfall, especially during drought, and appears to be a highly sensitive climatic parameter. A specific index (cumulative effective rainfall index, Delta(i)) has been introduced to evaluate aquifer recharge. Its high corretation with spring discharge made it possible to establish a cumulative effective rainfall threshold of 450 mm for aquifer response. Below this value, aquifer discharge exceeds recharge and an 'anomalous' spring hydrograph is observed, which is precisely what occurred during the droughts of 1949 and 2002. Cross-correlation between moving cumulative rainfall and daily spring discharge have shown a wide range of the water pore pressure transfer time inside the Serino karst aquifer. Effects of changes in hydrological extremes are investigated, and frequency of droughts and spring discharge forecasting are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory evaporation experiments are used to determine soil hydraulic properties (SHP). In most cases, data are evaluated with the simplified evaporation method (SEM). Numerical simulations were used before to quantify the accuracy of the SEM and it was found that the method yields accurate estimates of SHP. However, previous tests neither accounted for heat flow, nor thermal fluxes of liquid water and water vapor, nor temperature effects on the transport properties. Since evaporation experiments are under most circumstances non-isothermal, past studies were therefore oversimplified and likely inaccurate. The objective of this article is to test the accuracy of the SEM using numerical simulations with a coupled model of water, vapor, and heat flow which is based on the Philip-de Vries theory and solves the surface energy balance. The model provides a state-of-theart description of the fluxes of water, vapor and energy during laboratory evaporation from bare soil. We present simulation results for different soil textures and resistances to vapor flow between soil and air, and analyze the accuracy of the SEM using the simulated data. The resulting average error for the water retention curve is smaller than 0.0025 m(3) M-3 and the relative error of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 15% for sandy loam and clay loam. For sand, the error in conductivity is higher but the structural shape of the conductivity curve is still identified relatively well. Compared to previous analyses of the evaporation method assuming isothermal flow, the average error of the SEM turned out to be only slightly higher.

AB Resource-user participation in decision-making, through local collective action, likely contributes to effective groundwater management and protection. Despite efforts to construct generalized theoretical frameworks explaining factors influencing successful collective action in groundwater management, this is a highly complex process that remains challenging. This paper analyzes factors facilitating and impeding collective action in groundwater management, using the rare and successful collective-action example of the Angas Bremer irrigation district (South Australia). Drawing on data gathered through semi-structured interviews this paper further explores the context under which collective action arose and changed over time. The findings show a dynamic transient interaction between the following factors responsible for the rise and fall of collective action: (i) perceived crisis, (ii) small, homogenous community (iii) strong leadership from respected community members, (iv) shared norms and values, (v) shared goals, and (vi) trustworthy two-way relationship between resource users and formal institution. Although it is difficult to generalize from one case study, collective action and groundwater management are highly contextual. These findings are useful (i) for other communities with similar characteristics, (ii) to explore conditions for achieving successful groundwater governance including efficient and effective reforms, (iii) to highlight the importance of participatory management processes, (iv) to help government agencies understand what motivates communities to engage in collective action and how that leads to successful groundwater co-management, and (v) to expand on a very small body of literature documenting stakeholders narratives on collective action and groundwater management.

DE Analytical approach; Groundwater flow; Levees; Underseepage; Pressure
   head; Seepage quantity
AB Levee underseepage analyses are commonly performed to assess the risk of erosion and piping of levee foundation soils. They are also commonly used to estimate the quantity of seepage that is expected to pass beneath a levee over time, and to assess the risk of excessively high pore pressures at various points in the foundation. A variety of approaches have historically been utilized to perform steady-state underseepage analyses in levees, including flow-nets, closed-form analytical solutions, and numerical techniques such as finite difference or finite element analyses. This paper provides a derivation of a series of closed-form "blanket theory" analytical equations that can be used to perform a levee underseepage analysis. This derivation starts from a generic confined flow analytical solution, of the type that is common in groundwater flow analyses. The solution is then extended to simulate semiconfined flow beneath a levee in a shallow aquifer. Equations are presented for calculating total head and seepage quantity values for different model boundary conditions. A typical example problem is used to compare the analytical equations that are derived with the analytical equations that are presented in the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) levee design manual. The results provide validation for both the equations that are presented and the conventional USACE analytical design approach. Using the results from the example problem, general guidance and suggestions are provided for designers that use closed-form analytical approaches for modeling levee underseepage.

AB Dam breaches often have catastrophic consequences in downstream areas. Hydrodynamic factors and the evacuation potential of the population at risk (PAR) have significant impacts on the loss of life (LOL) caused by dam breaches. However, the existing comprehensive evaluation models have not conducted in-depth research on the evacuation potential of populations. Thus, limited guidance is available for relevant departments to formulate emergency plans to reduce the potential LOL. Therefore, a new comprehensive evaluation model was proposed in this study. According to the relevant references and disaster theory, the main influencing factors and the process through which the LOL is caused by dam breaches were determined. The specific occurrence process was divided into six stages: a dam breach causes flood, the flood puts the PAR, the PAR complete the preparation work, the PAR evacuate, the un-evacuated population shelter themselves inside buildings, and flood causes the death of the exposed population. To calculate the LOL, the parameters relevant at each stage were defined. Furthermore, the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, Geographic Information System, and related materials were used to simulate the flood routing and evacuation potential of the PAR, quantifying the parameters in the model. The model was applied to 14 towns in the downstream areas of the Luhun Reservoir in Henan Province, China, and its accuracy was verified by comparing the results obtained from the two existing models. In addition, the specific suggestions for reducing the potential LOL were proposed based on the results of the simulation.

AB Groundwater withdrawn in a multi-aquifer-aquitard system (MAAS) may cause vertical cross-flow supplement and result in groundwater drawdown and soil deformation in both aquifers and aquitards. This study investigates the responses of groundwater and deep soils to dewatering in the MAAS through statistical and numerical analyses. Field data of ten pumping tests conducted in the MAAS, in Shanghai urban area are collected, and a statistical analysis for groundwater drawdown and ground settlement is performed. Field measurements indicate that the drawdowns are distributed linearly along radial distance in logarithmic coordinates. However, the ground settlements are disproportional to the drawdowns and show a trilinear distribution along the radial direction. To examine the inconsistent distributions of the groundwater drawdown and the ground settlement, representative dewatering models are developed numerically and solved explicitly by the coupled Biot's three-dimensional consolidation theory. Numerical results of dewatering in MAAS are compared to those obtained by a non-coupling formula. Moreover, effect of a micro-confined aquifer on drawdown and soil deformation is discussed. It is found that soil compression in each stratum is closely related to the decline of the pore pressure, whilst small expansions are observed in early dewatering stages. Due to the hydro-mechanical coupling effect, the ground surface settlement near the pumping well obtained by the coupled numerical method is significantly smaller than that by the non-coupling formula. Owing to horizontal and vertical cross-flow supplement, an additional aquifer embedded in aquitard above the pumping aquifer can relief both the groundwater drawdown and ground surface settlement significantly.

DE daily flows; stochastic processes; autocorrelation function "over
   realizations" autocorrelation function "over time"
AB A study of the structure of daily river flows is made by means of the correlation theory of stochastic processes, i.e. on the basis of time functions of the first two moments: mean, variance, and autocorrelation function. The experimental basis of the study are long (over 50 years) time series of daily flows, without any gaps from five stations, with an average length of 71.2 years and areas of drainage basins ranging from 25,083 to 131,959 km(2).
   As a result of the analysis, it can be stated that (i) days with high mean have also high variance: (ii) the coefficients of variations cannot be considered to be constant even approximately (iii) the lag 1 autocorrelation functions rho(i),(1) i = 1.2,...,365, estimated "over realizations" have at least half of their coefficients significantly different from other coefficients; (iv) autocorrelation functions estimated "over time" are greater in the absolute value for data which have not been standardized but were initially treated with the logarithmic transformation only (v) autocorrelation Functions estimated "over realizations" are preferred to autocorrelation functions estimated "over time'' because the daily river process is not ergodic. It is suggested that the description of daily Rows as ergodic stochastic processes should he abandoned and the autocorrelation functions should be estimated "over realizations". The "over time" estimated autocorrelation Functions may only be treated as a very rough approximation of the "over realizations" autocorrelation functions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The fundamental rationale for statistical downscaling is that the raw outputs of climate change experiments from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are an inadequate basis for assessing the effects of climate change on land-surface processes at regional scales. This is because the spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to resolve important sub-grid scale processes (most notably those pertaining to the hydrological cycle) and because GCM output is often unreliable at individual and sub-grid box scales. By establishing empirical relationships between grid-box scale circulation indices (such as atmospheric vorticity and divergence) and sub-grid scale surface predictands (such as precipitation), statistical downscaling has been proposed as a practical means of bridging this spatial difference. This study compared three sets of current and future rainfall-runoff scenarios. The scenarios were constructed using: (1) statistically downscaled GCM output; (2) raw GCM output; and (3) raw GCM output corrected for elevational biases. Atmospheric circulation indices and humidity variables were extracted from the output of the UK Meteorological Office coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (HadCM2) in order to downscale daily precipitation and temperature series for the Animas River in the San Juan River basin, Colorado. Significant differences arose between the modelled snowpack and how regimes of the three future climate scenarios. Overall, the raw GCM output suggests larger reductions in winter/spring snowpack and summer runoff than the downscaling, relative to current conditions. Further research is required to determine the generality of the water resource implications for other regions, GCM outputs and downscaled scenarios. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID SEDIMENT TRANSPORT
AB We present a two-dimensional, time independent, kinematic simulation of a gravel streambed that models impacts between clasts as elastic collisions without momentum transfer between discrete, circular disks. The prototype bed forms that we seek to simulate are the "stone cells" observed in Harris Creek, south central British Columbia. The basic algorithm causes simulated stones to cluster into longitudinal structures that resemble such gravel bed forms as imbricate clusters and cluster bed forms. A modified algorithm incorporating programming rules such as stone rotation, entrainment probability inversely proportional to stone size, and the shielding effects of neighbors causes simulated stones to cluster into structures that resemble transverse ribs. Trials incorporating the rotation rule, with or without additional rules, produce a cobble structure most similar to the prototype. Of all the parameters in the simulation, the number of stones seems to have the most control on the development of an extended surface structure.

AB The transport of water vapor in shale (mudrocks) plays an important role in many natural and engineering issues, such as the global water cycle and shale gas production. However, the permeability of water vapor in shale is not well understood. An experimental approach to investigate the water vapor permeability in shale is presented in this paper. Water vapor sorption was conducted under the dynamic relative humidity condition in which the vapor evaporation was generated from the liquid distilled water at different gas (helium) pressures. Three crushed samples of Carboniferous shale from the eastern Qaidam Basin, China, were obtained and tested. In the experiments, the adsorption process of water vapor into the crushed shale was observed, and the permeability of water vapor through shale was calculated with the data collected during the dynamic water vapor adsorption process. The results show that the permeability decreases with increasing water vapor adsorption. The relationship between permeability and water vapor adsorption amount fits an exponential equation well. The permeability at the equilibrium of water vapor adsorption is 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the initial stage of water vapor adsorption. The decrease in pore size and resulting pore throat blockage cause this permeability reduction. The water film thickness and water saturation in the shale pores at adsorption equilibrium were estimated. The permeability reduction is closely related to the maximum water film thickness. The larger the range of pores blocked by the water film is, the more obvious the permeability reduction.

AB Developing an understanding of how groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) systems function and interact to impact water quantity, water quality, and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources, environmental protection, and land management. Although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades, there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating GW-SW interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues. For this reason, a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying, understanding, and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling GW-SW interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems. The framework identifies fundamental hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of GW-SW systems. The framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue. The framework focuses on streams, rivers, and lakes but can be adapted for use in other GW-SW settings such as ponds, wetlands, and coastal marine environments. Applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three GW-SW interaction settings in southern Ontario, Canada: a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the Pine River, discharge of groundwater nutrients to Lake Huron, and a regional-scale conceptualization of GW-SW flow interactions in the Duffins Creek watershed. The case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models, assess environmental issues, identify knowledge gaps, and provide a basis for designing site investigations.

AB This paper describes the application of a networked version of TOPMODEL, TOPNET, as part of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP). The model implementation is based on a topographically derived river network with spatially distributed sub-basins draining to each network reach. The river network is mapped from the US National Elevation Dataset Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using procedures that objectively estimate drainage density from geomorphic principles. Rainfall inputs are derived from NEXRAD (radar) for each sub-basin. For each sub-basin, the wetness index distribution is derived from the DEM. The initial model parameters for each sub-basin are estimated using look up tables based on soils (STATSGO) and vegetation (1-km AVHRR). These initial model parameters provide the spatially distributed pattern of parameters at the scale of each sub-basin. Calibration uses a multiplier for each parameter to adjust the parameters while retaining the relative spatial pattern obtained from the soils and vegetation data. Parameter multipliers were calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm [J. Optim. Theory Appl. 61 (1993)] with the objective to minimize the mean square error between observed and modeled hourly streamflows. We describe the model and calibrated results submitted for all basins for the time periods involved in the DMIP study. We were encouraged by the relatively good performance of the model, especially in comparison to streamflow from smaller interior watersheds not used in calibration and simulated as ungaged basins. The limited resources used to achieve these results show some of the potential for distributed models to be useful operationally. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multivariate standardized drought indices (MSDIs) are helpful in effectively characterizing, monitoring, and forecasting drought events over various spatial-temporal scales. Currently, there is a need to develop nonstationary versions of such indices for use in climate change scenarios to account for nonstationarities in different hydrometeorological variables (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration) affecting droughts. This article contributes nonstationary versions of two drought indices: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) and SDDI (Standardized Deficit Distance Index). They consider time-varying probability distribution whose location parameter is determined using climate covariates. It is suggested to delineate homogeneous drought regions using a fuzzy dynamic clustering approach to characterize regional droughts. Furthermore, a multi-site block bootstrap-based modified seasonal Mann-Kendall test is proposed to detect regional trends in drought analysis. For the first time, the performances and agreement of different pairs of stationary and nonstationary versions of three MSDIs, namely SPEI, SDDI, RDI (Reconnaissance Drought Index), are analyzed at at-site and regional scales through a case study on Karnataka state, India. The strength of agreement between different pairs of MSDIs is moderate to fair, and climate indices chosen for their estimation differed across regions and months. In analysis with nonstationary MSDIs, (i) at-site mean intensity and frequency of moderate/severe/extreme drought events were higher, whereas (ii) at-site mean duration and mean/maximum severity, and regional drought severity and intensity (discerned using severity-area-frequency and intensity-area-duration relationships) were generally lower relative to their stationary counterparts. Furthermore, nonstationary and stationary versions of RDI yielded higher regional drought intensity values for higher accumulation periods.

AB Water diversion has been increasingly applied to accelerate lake water exchange and alleviate urgent water crisis. However, effects of water diversion on water exchange and water quality for eutrophic lakes remain controversial. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-water quality-sediment diagenesis model has been developed to assess effects of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow Lake Wanghu. Results suggested that water diversion could dramatically promote water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions but its influence on water quality was diverse. A water transferring flow rate of 20-30 m(3)/s could reduce water age to 40-58 days during regular water diversion operation, whereas a high transferring flow rate of 100 m(3)/s was the best for emergency operation in late spring before the wet season. Moreover, nutrients and Chlorophyll-a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency. Nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales, nutrients, and algal biomass in this eutrophic lake. During a clean water diversion, nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age. However, when the donating system contained high level of nutrients, accumulated nutrients in the lake may still trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect. Therefore, these water diversion strategies could be applied to guide a sustainable management of eutrophic Lake Wanghu in terms of transferring flow rate, wind fields, water quality in the donating system, transferring operation, and water diversion route.

AB The finding of important explanatory variables for the location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, when the latter is used for the modelling of annual streamflow maxima, is known to have reduced the uncertainties in inferences, as estimated through regional flood frequency analysis frameworks. However, important explanatory variables have not been found for the GEV shape parameter, despite its critical significance, which stems from the fact that it determines the behaviour of the upper tail of the distribution. Here we examine the nature of the shape parameter by revealing its relationships with basin attributes. We use a dataset that comprises information about daily streamflow and forcing, climatic indices, topographic, land cover, soil and geological characteristics of 591 basins with minimal human influence in the contiguous United States. We propose a framework that uses random forests and linear models to find (a) important predictor variables of the shape parameter and (b) an interpretable model with high predictive performance. The process of study comprises of assessing the predictive performance of the models, selecting a parsimonious predicting model and interpreting the results in an ad-hoc manner. The findings suggest that the median of the shape parameter is 0.19, the shape parameter mostly depends on climatic indices, while the selected prediction model is a linear one and results in more than 20% higher accuracy in terms of RMSE compared to a naive approach. The implications are important, since it is shown that incorporating the regression model into regional flood frequency analysis frameworks can considerably reduce the predictive uncertainties.

ID DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL; RUNOFF GENERATION; GEOMORPHOLOGY; RESOLUTION
AB The assignment of hydrological model parameters from physically measurable catchment attributes remains an unsolved problem. Several authors have shown that for the hydrological model, TOPMODEL, there is a relationship between the scale of the digital elevation model (DEM) and the saturated hydraulic conductivity parameter used to calculate water table position and baseflow. For models that use DEM data from pixels measured in tens of metres, the value of the corresponding saturated hydraulic conductivities for satisfactory flow reproduction are often much larger than measured values and this causes most surface flow to be generated by the saturation excess mechanism. This is undesirable in environments where infiltration-excess runoff can also occur. This paper presents a way to objectively compensate for the distorting effect of DEM-scale on the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity so that its measured value can be used in TOPMODEL simulations. The method described links the distribution of topographic index, 1n(a/tan beta), to a spatial variability measure (SVM) based on the Shannon and Weaver information content equation for a digital signal. By maximising the SVM, an optimum adjustment to the mean of the distribution of topographic index can be made so that the distribution represents what would have been calculated had a DEM been available at the spatial resolution at which the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured. The method is applied to a TOPMODEL of the Mahurangi basin in New Zealand, and it is shown that physically reasonable simulations are achieved with the adjusted distribution of topographic index.

AB Some studies that investigate the climate change and hydrologic balance relationships utilize reference (potential) evapotranspiration (ETref) to either calculate the changes in trends and magnitude of actual ET or to determine changes in atmospheric demand. In such cases, it is important to acquire robust ETref estimates to correctly assess the impact of changes in meteorological variables on atmospheric evaporative demand, hydrologic balances, response of vegetation to climate, and their interactions. Despite its crucial importance, unfortunately, ETref is sometimes poorly addressed in climate change studies as some studies utilize temperature or radiation-based empirical equations due to various reasons (unavailability of climate data to solve combination-based energy balance equations, etc.). Since many climate variables that affect ETref rates have been changing and are expected to change in the future, single-variable equations for estimating the trend in ETref should be avoided due to the inherent nature of the trend passed to ETref from the variable. Here, we showed an integrated approach of practical and robust procedures that are already exist to estimate necessary climate variables [incoming shortwave radiation (R-s), net radiation (R-n), wind speed at 2-m (u(2)), relative humidity (RH), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)] only from observed maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min) and precipitation (P) data to be used in Penman-Monteith-type combination-based energy balance equations to predict grass-and alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ETo and ETr respectively). We analyzed the trends and magnitudes of change in meteorological variables for a 116-yr period from 1893 to 2008 in the agro-ecosystem-dominated Platte River Basin in central Nebraska, USA. Although we found a significant (P < 0.05) increase in T-min and T-avg at a rate 0.038 degrees C yr(-1) and 0.0187 degrees C yr(-1), respectively, and insignificant increase in u(2) and VPD, we observed a significant (P < 0.05) decline in ETref (-0.3596 mm yr(-1) for ETo and -0.3586 mm yr(-1) for ETr). We present data, analyses, and interpretation that the decrease in ETref is most likely due to significant (P < 0.05) increase in precipitation (0.87 mm yr(-1)) that results in significant reduction in R-s (-0.0223 MJ m(-2) yr(-1)) and, in turn in R-n (-0.0032 MJ m(-2) yr(-1)), which resulted in reduction in ETref because increase in P decreases available energy, which is primary driver of ETref. There was approximately 100 mm of increase in precipitation from 1893 to 2008 in the study location at a rate of about 0.90 mm yr(-1). Also, there was a significant increase in maximum daily precipitation, especially in the very high events (i.e., >70 mm d(-1)). We present detailed analyses of relationships between ETref and all meteorological variables. On an annual time step ETref significantly (P < 0.05) and inversely correlated to precipitation and RH, and significantly and positively correlated to T-max, T-avg, VPD, R-s, and R-n.
   We observed a higher degree of responsiveness of ETo to changes in meteorological variables than ETr, which may indicae that ETo may be more apposite to better detect the impact of changes in meteorological variables on ETref in climate change studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dams are vital infrastructure for water resource management, and their safety is threatened by the complex interplay of multiple risk factors. Consequently, for dam safety maintenance, it is significant to conduct dam risk analysis by detecting the relationship between dam failure and risk factors and identifying the critical risk factors. Bayesian network (BN) is an effective tool for this issue and has been widely used in previous studies. However, there is still a lack of variable selection methods in BN that can automatically select predictors from numerous candidates by considering both predictability and parsimony. Herein, an optimized variable selection is proposed for BN and used in the risk analysis of widespread earth dams in the United States. The results showed that the proposed method can automatically determine the optimal predictor set. The BN with selected predictors not only exhibits good performance but also has a significantly more concise network than the BN without variable selection and significantly weakens overfitting. Using the established BN, the clear causal network of earth dam failure and 12 risk factors were quantified through influence strength analysis. The three foremost risk factors based on their sensitivity analysis were identified to be insufficient spillway capacity, extreme flood, and slope instability, which can serve as a reference for the safety maintenance of earth dams in the United States. Our study highlights that the proposed variable selection is a powerful step of BN for dam risk analysis and contributes to the development of an intelligent BN modeling framework.

AB Satellite images, which are effectively used to monitor changes in water areas, water management and planning, and to determine the measures to be taken against possible natural disasters, provide data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This study represents the monitoring of temporal surface water dynamics and estimating the volume fluctuations by combining the in-situ data with remotely sensed area data for Kemer Dam, containing the Arapapis,ti Canyon (Turkey). Also, it demonstrates the production of the underwater topography in the water reservoir areas of absent or difficult to obtain bottom topography by integrating the in-situ water level and the PlanetScope Remote Sensing data in GIS environment. The temporal changes of dynamic volume of the reservoir above the lowest water level were estimated by the Hypsometric Relationship equation, Pyramidal Frustum Model and TIN-based Calculation method and their accuracy were evaluated using in-situ data. The simplicity and ease of application of the Pyramidal Frustum method, as well as its relatively low RMSE and Standard Error Rate of the Regression (SER) values, compared to other methods in this study, increase its usability in such studies. PlanetScope Imagery will make an important contribution to hydrological studies by producing daily images in high-resolution. Mission characteristics of satellite images (e.g. spatial, temporal and spectral resolution and, geometric accuracy), data sparseness, concurrency in parameters, chosen volume calculation method and linearity of hypsometry are important components that affect the performance of the Volume Fluctuation Monitoring studies using satellite images.

AB The ENVISAT, Jason-2 and -3, Sentinel-3A, CryoSat-2, and AltiKa satellite altimeters were used to estimate the discharge of two Arctic rivers: the Ob and Pur in western Siberia. The accuracy of the water height estimates from ENVISAT varied with river size from 0.63 m for the Ob (similar to 2 km in width) to 1.1 m for the Pur (similar to 0.5 km in width). A new method for water level estimation combining the CryoSat-2, AltiKa, and Sentinel-3A altimeters provided better height accuracy (0.49 m for the Ob). The rating curve method of discharge estimation outperforms the Manning formulation, on the Ob, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 13% vs 20% for daily discharge and 1% vs 5% for annual discharge. Sensitivity analysis performed on the Manning formulation showed high sensitivity to the river depth parameterisation. A functional relationship was identified between the depth of rivers, in the north of western Siberia, and their widths and deposits types. The combination, for the Ob, of the rating curve method with the multi-satellite water level retrieval algorithm provided higher discharge accuracy than previous studies relying on satellite measurements, on numerical modelling or on their combination. A synthesis of worldwide river altimetry studies supported our finding that the accuracy of altimetric discharge estimations decreases for narrower rivers. The rating curve method applied to Jason 2/3 height measurements allows estimation of daily discharges with RMSE of 18% for the wide Ob River but 38% for the narrow Pur River.

AB Southwestern Australia has experienced recent climate change, with an increase in air temperature of 0.6 degrees C and a reduction in mean annual precipitation of -15% since 1970. Along with the warming and drying trends, dramatic declines of streamflow have occurred across the region. However, both forest mortality and an increase in leaf area index have been observed in the southwestern forest, suggesting varied responses of vegetation to climate change. In this study, 30 catchments were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt's change point test and the theoretical framework of the Budyko curve to study the rainfall-runoff relationship change, and effects of climate and land cover change on streamflow. A declining trend and relatively consistent change point (2000) of streamflow were found in most catchments, with 14 catchments showing significant declines (p < 0.05, - 68.1% to - 35.6%) over 1970-2000 and 2001-2015. Most of the catchments have been shifting towards a more water-limited climate condition since 2000. For the period 1970 to 2015, the dynamic of vegetation attributes (land cover/use change and growth of vegetation) dominated the decrease of streamflow in about half the study catchments. In general, a coequal role of climate and vegetation on the decline in streamflow was found in the study, suggesting the importance of vegetation management on future water management and production. Precipitation is predicted to decline in the future; therefore, some forest management intervention is required to maintain forest growth and water supply in the southwest of Australia.

AB A quantitative framework for characterizing the intensity of the water cycle over land is presented, and illustrated using a spatially distributed water-balance model of the conterminous United States (CONUS). We approach water cycle intensity (WCI) from a landscape perspective; WCI is defined as the sum of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) over a spatially explicit landscape unit of interest, averaged over a specified time period (step) of interest. The time step may be of any length for which data or simulation results are available (e.g., sub-daily to multi-decadal). We define the storage-adjusted runoff (Q') as the sum of actual runoff (Q) and the rate of change in soil moisture storage (Delta S/Delta t, positive or negative) during the time step of interest. The Q' indicator is demonstrated to be mathematically complementary to WCI, in a manner that allows graphical interpretation of their relationship. For the purposes of this study, the indicators were demonstrated using long-term, spatially distributed model simulations with an annual time step. WCI was found to increase over most of the CONUS between the 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 periods, driven primarily by increases in P. In portions of the western and southeastern CONUS, Q decreased because of decreases in Q and soil moisture storage. Analysis of WCI and Q at temporal scales ranging from sub-daily to multi-decadal could improve understanding of the wide spectrum of hydrologic responses that have been attributed to water cycle intensification, as well as trends in those responses.

ID STOCHASTIC STORM TRANSPOSITION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RESOLUTION
AB If risk-based criteria are used in the design of high hazard structures (such as dam spillways and nuclear power stations), then it is necessary to estimate the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of extreme rainfalls up to and including the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP). This paper describes the development and application of two largely independent methods to estimate the frequencies of such extreme rainfalls. One method is based on stochastic storm transposition (SST), which combines the "arrival" and "transposition" probabilities of an extreme storm using the total probability theorem. The second method, based on "stochastic storm regression" (SSR), combines frequency curves of point rainfalls with regression estimates of local and transposed areal rainfalls; rainfall maxima are generated by stochastically sampling the independent variates, where the required exceedance probabilities are obtained using the total probability theorem. The methods are applied to two large catchments (with areas of 3550 km(2) and 15,280 km(2)) located in inland southern Australia. Both methods were found to provide similar estimates of the frequency of extreme areal rainfalls for the two study catchments. The best estimates of the AEP of the PMP for the smaller and larger of the catchments were found to be 10(-7) and 10(-6), respectively, but the uncertainty of these estimates spans one to two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the SST method was applied to a range of locations within a meteorologically homogenous region to investigate the nature of the relationship between the AEP of PMP and catchment area.

ID SIMULATION; EROSION; TOOL
AB Accurate predictions of sediment yield from distributed models of runoff and sediment yield depends in part of how well matched the model structure is to input data spatial representation. This study investigated how model structure and input data representation affect sediment predictions made using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The study focused on the integration of two specific components of SWAT: the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and the hydrologic response unit (HRU). MUSLE, a watershed erosion model, was applied to different levels of watershed partitioning and alternative HRU schemes for a watershed and its two subwatersheds over a 4-year period of measured stream flow and sediment yield. The results show that across different levels of watershed partitioning, HRUs do not conserve sediment. Instead, HRUs introduce almost half of the variability in sediment generation, which has previously been attributed solely to input data aggregation. This occurs for two reasons. First, MUSLE defines a nonlinear relationship between sediment generation and HRU area, but the sediment load is scaled linearly from the HRU level to the subwatershed level. Second, HRUs aggregate land areas without regard for the surface connectivity assumptions, which are implicit in MUSLE. These conflicts caused by the integration of HRU and MUSLE makes it difficult to determine the effect of different land use on soil erosion. This study indicates that greater attention should be made to structuring the data inputs to match the underlying assumptions of sub-models within SWAT. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of hydrological model components on performance and uncertainty of streamflow simulations are investigated using a multi-model approach over 698 catchments in North America. An ensemble of 180 different hydrological model structures is obtained by combining five snow models (SM), four potential evapotranspira-tion formulations (PET), three vertical (VFS) and three horizontal (HFS) flow rounting schemes. This study aims to first compare the multiple component combinations of SM, PET, VFS and HFS in terms of their ability at simulating streamflows for ten Ko center dot ppen climate zones. A secondary goal is to evaluate the contribution of each model component to the total variance of the streamflow response according to the model structure for three streamflow metrics representing mean, high and low flows. Results indicate that there is no clear relationship between the structural and parametric complexity of the hydrological components and model performance for all three streamflow metrics. There is no single model structure which performs best in all climate zones and for all streamflow metrics. Streamflow uncertainty generated by the 180 synthetic hydrological model structures de-pends primarily on the metrics under study, but also on the climate zone. The evapotranspiration formulation is only critical for the mean flow metric. For the low-flow criterion, the VFS generates the most uncertainty and is therefore the most critical, whereas for the high-flow metric, performance is mostly related to the HFS component and SM for Nordic catchments. A better understanding of how hydrological model components generate uncertainty for a given climate and streamflow metric will lead to more robust model structures and therefore reduce the uncertainty of hydrological simulations.

AB The Meca River is highly contaminated by acid mine drainage coming from the Tharsis mining district, belonging to the Iberian Pyrite Belt. This river is regulated by the Sancho reservoir (58 hm(3)), with a pH close to 4.2. In this work, the load transported by the Meca River to the Sancho reservoir has been assessed. Due to the lack of streamflow data, the hydrological behaviour of the Meca River basin has been simulated using the SWAT model. The model has been calibrated against registered daily inflows of the Sancho reservoir (1982-2000), excluding the hydrological years 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 that were kept for the validation. The results were satisfactory; the evaluation coefficients for monthly calibration were: r = 0.85 (Pearson's correlation coefficient), NSE = 0.83 (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) and DV = 1.08 (runoff volume deviation). The main uncertainty was the calibration during low water because of the poor accuracy in the measurement of the inputs to the reservoir in these conditions. Discharge and dissolved concentration relationships for different elements were obtained from hydrochemical samplings, which allowed us to estimate the element pollutant load transported to the reservoir: 418 ton/year of Al, 8024 ton/year Of SO4, 121 ton/year of Zn, etc. Based on these loads, concentrations in the reservoir were calculated for some elements. Apart from Mn and Sr, good adjustment between calculated and measured values was observed (+/- 20% for Ca, Co, Li, Mg, Na, Ni, Zn and SO4).
   Capsule: Hydrological model combined with water quality data show how pollution by AMD can generate huge loads of contaminants acidifying streams and reservoirs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Network theory is applied to an array of stream-flow gauges located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (BC) and Yukon, Canada. The goal of the analysis is to assess whether insights from this branch of mathematical graph theory can be meaningfully applied to hydrometric data, and, more specifically, whether it may help guide decisions concerning stream gauge placement so that the full complexity of the regional hydrology is efficiently captured. The streamflow data, when represented as a complex network, have a global clustering coefficient and average shortest path length consistent with small-world networks, which are a class of stable and efficient networks common in nature, but the observed degree distribution did not clearly indicate a scale-free network. Stability helps ensure that the network is robust to the loss of nodes; in the context of a streamflow network, stability is interpreted as insensitivity to station removal at random. Community structure is also evident in the streamflow network. A network theoretic community detection algorithm identified separate communities, each of which appears to be defined by the combination of its median seasonal flow regime (pluvial, nival, hybrid, or glacial, which in this region in turn mainly reflects basin elevation) and geographic proximity to other communities (reflecting shared or different daily meteorological forcing). Furthermore, betweenness analyses suggest a handful of key stations which serve as bridges between communities and might be highly valued. We propose that an idealized sampling network should sample high-betweenness stations, small-membership communities which are by definition rare or undersampled relative to other communities, and index stations having large numbers of intracommunity links, while retaining some degree of redundancy to maintain network robustness.

AB The identification of groundwater contamination sources (GCS) can provide comprehensive knowledge for the remediation and risk assessment of contaminated sites. This study develops an innovative framework that can be effectively and efficiently used for the optimal sampling well location design and GCS parameters identification. The framework is based on Bayesian theory and integrates the relative entropy (RE), a 0-1 integer programming optimization model (0-1 IPOM), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and a Kriging surrogate model (KSM). The expected RE is used to quantify information about unknown parameters from concentration measurements based on a Bayesian design. The optimal sampling well locations are determined through the comprehensive application of 0-1 IPOM and the expected RE. After determining the optimal sampling well locations, a Bayesian approach based on MCMC is employed to identify the GCS parameters. However, such problems are time-consuming because both determination and identification require the contaminant transport model to be run multiple times. To address this challenge, a KSM is constructed for the contaminant transport model, which greatly accelerates the determination and identification processes. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are verified by two hypothetical numerical case studies. The results show that the developed Bayesian-based integrated approach can be accurately and effectively applied for optimal sampling well location design and GCS parameter identification. Overall, this study highlights that the Bayesian-based integrated approach represents a promising solution for GCS parameter identification.

AB Urban flooding occurs frequently in the world and urban hydrological models are widely applied in urban flood management and disaster mitigation. In this study, an enhanced inundation method (EIM) for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale is proposed. EIM can be easily coupled with urban hydrological models and the coupled framework can consider both source flooding and non-source flooding in floodwater generation. In EIM, the floodwater spreading order in the positive process is based on the topological relationship between depression outlets; the floodwater from lower depression elements is considered as a feedback process. These improvements make this proposed method suitable for inundation estimation in large urban catchments. Dahongmen (DHM) catchment in Beijing, China was selected as the case study area to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Historical inundation records during one heavy storm were applied to test the performance of the method. EIM is compared with USISM (urban storm-inundation simulation method) on the flood hazard map in the DHM catchment, which reveals the effectiveness of the improvements. The results show that all inundation locations are successfully identified by EIM and are distributed in flooding areas (water depth greater than 0.15 m) in the catchment. The average relative error of simulated inundation depths is 15%, which indicates that EIM can successfully simulate flooding scopes and depths in the study area. The results revealed that EIM can be a valuable tool for mapping urban flood hazards at the large catchment scale based on GIS techniques.

AB Time-varying parameters, which are often expressed in functional forms, have been widely used to improve hydrological modeling. Here, we assume that the time-varying parameters may be caused by deficiencies of the model structures. To justify this point, the SIMHYD model was selected as the base model, and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was used to identify the temporal variation of parameters. A synthetic experiment was designed to prove that model parameters can partly compensate for the structure deficiencies, while the parameters' time-varying is unavoidable when the structure error has been involved. Two real case studies in the Tongtianhe and Xunhe basins were then conducted to explore the modifications of model structures based on the implications of time-varying parameters. The results are summarized as follows. (1) Model structural deficiencies can be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time-varying. (2) Guided by the identified time-varying parameters, the energy-based snow module was added and the interception module was removed in the Tongtianhe basin, and the infiltration was modified to follow a power function of the soil moisture in the Xunhe basin. As a result, the model performance has been improved, and the parameter variations have been diminished. (3) The modifications of the SIMHYD model structure outperformed the models with time-varying parameters in functional forms. This study provides insights into the compensatory relationship between model structural deficiencies and parameters, and proposes a method to improve model structures by time-varying parameters.

AB The well-known conceptual Xin'anjiang model (XAJ) has limited capability for application in the basins with limited data due to two major runoff routing problems: relying on the observed flow data to estimate the parameters of the Muskingum method and lack of physics-based representation of spatial heterogeneity in key routing parameters such as the river network recession constant (C-s). To tackle these issues, this study first developed a new hybrid rainfall-runoff model named the Xin'anjiang Digital CHannel (XAJ-DCH) model by coupling the XAJ model with the Muskingum-Cunge-Todini (MCT) and diffusion wave methods to improve the river network routing. Then a physics-based C-s estimation method was developed to conquer the data limitation by deriving the quantitative relationships of the C-s parameter with basin characteristics such as sub-catchment area, average river slope, average rainfall intensity, and average river width based on the mass conservation. The flood prediction capabilities of the XAJ and XAJ-DCH models were further tested and compared in the Tunxi Catchment with two nested sub-catchments. The results show that the XAJ-DCH model can predict stream flows well at both catchment outlet and internal channel grid cells without recalibration. Moreover, the derived C-s values based on the proposed method enable both XAJ and XAJ-DCH models to gain good results with the averaged Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0.91 and 0.95.

AB In the emergent Anthropocene, interactions among water supply, power generation, and environment (WPE) systems are increasingly prominent due to the impact of human activity, the understanding of which calls for a holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective. Therefore, inspired by the nexus approach, this study investigates these three systems, integrated as a WPE coupling system. This paper aims to construct a system dynamics model from the perspective of socio-hydrology in order to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and dynamics of the WPE coupling system. Firstly, the system dynamics model, which comprises the conceptual, stock and flow diagrams, and stylized models, is constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the WPE system. Then, the model is implemented in the WPE system of the upper Yangtze River basin of China. Results show that (1) the system dynamics model, which considers two-way feedbacks, is capable of modeling the coevolution of the WPE system and provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the system; (2) the interrelation between economic development and environmental health is not entirely contradictory; however, if the economic development scale is not limited, their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction; and (3) model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns. These observations, obtained by modeling interactions across different systems, are insightful, improving our understanding of the coevolution of the WPE coupling system.

AB Rainfall and runoff are considered the main components in the hydrological cycle. Developing an accurate model to capture the dynamic connection between rainfall and runoff remains a problematic task for engineers. Several studies have been carried out to develop models to accurately predict the changes in runoff from rainfall. However, these models have limitations in terms of accuracy and complexity when large numbers of parameters are needed. Therefore, recently, with the advancement of data-driven techniques, a vast number of hydrologists have adopted models to predict changes in runoff. However, data-driven models still encounter several limitations related to hyperparameter optimization and overfitting. Hence, there is a need to improve these models to overcome these limitations. In this study, data-driven techniques such as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) are integrated with an advanced nature-inspired optimizer, namely, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) to model the rainfall-runoff relationship. Five different scenarios will be examined based on the autocorrelation function (ACF), cross-correlation function (CCF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Finally, for comprehensive analysis, the performance of the proposed model will then be compared with integrated data-driven techniques with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results revealed that all the augmented models with HHO outperformed other integrated models with PSO in predicting the changes in runoff. In addition, a high level of accuracy in predicting runoff values was achieved when HHO was integrated with LSSVM.

AB Ecosystems at the junctions of large lakes and rivers are a significant resource which are yet susceptible to changes in the various water bodies. One of the most crucial river-lake junction points in China is the junction of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River (JPLYR), with the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) upstream. Based on remote sensing images of the dry season from 1987 to 2018, landcover change of JPLYR was obtained using the random forest classification method. Linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to determine relationships between 16 hydrological variables regarding magnitude, duration, timing, variation, and vegetation area throughout different operational stages of the TGD. Results showed that the operation of the TGD has anticipated and elongated the dry seasons, with a consequential shortening of the flood seasons that now occur later in the year. The peak water level was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while the minimum water level remained unchanged throughout the study period. There was a 344% increase in vegetation coverage across the JPLYR from 1987 (0.677 km(2)) to 2018 (3.005 km(2)). The earlier beginning of dry season (BDS) was found to be most significant in affecting the increased vegetation area before and after the operation of TGD. The results provide an essential reference for assessing the potential influence of newly proposed dams in river-lake junctions and for optimizing future operations.

AB The stable isotopic composition of water (delta O-18, delta H-2) is used to trace different components of the hydrological cycle, particularly interactions between precipitation, surface, and ground water. In Greece, insufficient spatial coverage for isotopes in precipitation hinders investigations of relationship between ground water and precipitation, information that is required to help quantify aquifer replenishment rates. We used precipitation, geospatial, ground water isotope data and General Linear Models (GLM) to predict the spatial distribution of isotopes in phreatic ground water in Greece. Prediction covariates of elevation, latitude, distance to nearest coastline, drainage basin (western vs. eastern Greece), and amount of precipitation predicted 62% of the isotopic variance in ground water. The GLM model yielded predictions of the isotopic composition of shallow aquifers, which allowed us to construct maps for use in hydrological and other forensic applications in Greece. A comparison of the stable isotope values predicted by our GLM to those of existing precipitation models revealed that phreatic aquifers in Greece are mainly recharged during the annual wet period, between November and March, as documented by the high overlap coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. Rainy-period-biased aquifer recharge has implications for water quality and management issues, for example, nitrate pollution may be enhanced in the non-growing rainy period when crop uptake is the lowest, or for water resource management if climatic changes alter these temporal rainfall patterns.

AB The flow duration curve is a signature catchment characteristic that depicts graphically the relationship between the exceedance probability of streamflow and its magnitude. This curve is relatively easy to create and interpret, and is used widely for hydrologic analysis, water quality management, and the design of hydroelectric power plants (among others). Several mathematical expressions have been proposed to mimic the FDC. Yet, these efforts have not been particularly successful, in large part because available functions are not flexible enough to portray accurately the functional shape of the FDC for a large range of catchments and contrasting hydrologic behaviors. Here, we extend the work of Vrugt and Sadegh (2013) and introduce several commonly used models of the soil water characteristic as new class of closed-form parametric expressions for the flow duration curve. These soil water retention functions are relatively simple to use, contain between two to three parameters, and mimic closely the empirical FDCs of 430 catchments of the MOPEX data set. We then relate the calibrated parameter values of these models to physical and climatological characteristics of the watershed using multivariate linear regression analysis, and evaluate the regionalization potential of our proposed models against those of the literature. If quality of fit is of main importance then the 3-parameter van Genuchten model is preferred, whereas the 2-parameter lognormal, 3-parameter GEV and generalized Pareto models show greater promise for regionalization.

AB The relationships between fracture facies and permeability distribution have been explored using a well-constrained 3D implicit structural model of hemipelagic low porosity/low permeability carbonate from the Northern Provence region, SE France. Fracture and permeability facies were determined using an extensive
   dataset of 99 hydrogeological wells. Data processing was undertaken using a step-by-step approach, involving: (i) identification of the fracture facies based on well logs detailing structure and stratigraphy; (ii) determination of permeability facies from the a priori correlation between the dimension of the hydraulic radius of influence (deduced from slug test analyses) and the type of reservoir heterogeneity (fissure, fracture, fault zone, etc.); (iii) three dimensional plot of fracture and permeability facies in the geological model using a variographic analysis of data.
   Thirty-three sequential indicator simulations (SIS) based on geostatistic analyses were realised on both fracture and permeability facies. Finally, a connectivity algorithm was developed to compute the probability of connection between selected infiltration areas and the major aquifer springs via moderate- to high-permeability geological bodies.
   Key results are: (i) fault zones have a greater role in controlling permeability fades distribution than on fracture facies repartition; (ii) there is little correlation between permeability and fracture fades distributions; (iii) connectivity results highlight the compartmentalisation of aquifers in the Cadarache area, the extensions of permeable geological bodies being limited by the N130 faults.

AB Statistical classification of hydrograph form is used to elucidate the controls on diurnal runoff cycle evolution at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland during the 1998 and 1999 melt seasons. Hydrographs are objectively grouped using statistical techniques into four principal types that are qualitatively interpreted as rising, falling, peaked-falling and peaked hydrographs. Peaked hydrographs are further grouped on the basis of the magnitude of their bulk flow, baseflow and diurnal flow components. Comparison with the evolution of meltwater sources and pathways demonstrates that runoff cycles evolve systematically during the melt season in response to removal of the seasonal snowpack from the ablation area. Peaked hydrographs predominate following the onset of snowpack removal and demonstrate an increasing and progressively earlier diurnal peak, but also an unusually low baseflow component that is probably due to surface melt mainly contributing direct to subglacial channels. Runoff cycle evolution has potentially significant geomorphic implications because peaked surface runoff cycles result in the formation of hydraulically efficient, channelised subglacial drainage and a significant increase in the gradient of the relationship between suspended sediment transport and discharge. Increasingly peaked diurnal cycles also result in increased basal sediment availability, most likely related to high diurnal water pressure variation within subglacial channels that may also have enhanced rates of basal sliding and hence subglacial erosion. Differences in runoff cycle form and evolution therefore have the potential to significantly influence glacial erosion rates and sediment yields. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land use changes affecting ecological and hydrological processes often shape the biogeochemistry of deserts. As highly productive hotspots, Prosopis flexuosa woodlands located in interdune lowlands of the Monte Desert are subject to intense transformations by humans and livestock, and offer a unique opportunity to understand how phreatophyte vegetation, groundwater, rainfall variability, and vertical solute fluxes connect with each other. In this ecosystem, we evaluated the consequences of heavy disturbance by livestock settlements (partial tree removal, intense grazing) on shallow (7-15 m deep) groundwater recharge/discharge dynamics and vertical solute (nutrients and salts) transport. We compared three relatively undisturbed woodlands with three paired livestock stations in the Telteca Reserve (Mendoza, Argentina). At these locations we monitored groundwater levels and chemical and isotopic compositions during six years (2011-2017). Seasonal groundwater level fluctuations reflected shifts in water demand (lower in the cold season) rather than rainfall (high in the warm season), as shown by fall-winter rises and spring-summer declines. These seasonal fluctuations were more intense in undisturbed woodlands than in livestock stations. At a shorter time scale, intense rainfall events were associated to groundwater level raises, suggesting a partial decoupling of phreatophyte vegetation from the free aquifer and, less likely, recharge episodes. Livestock stations also affected groundwater chemistry by locally increasing chloride and nitrate concentrations, and salinity, suggesting higher water percolation and nitrate leaching to the aquifer in livestock stations than in control woodlands. This study addressed ecohydrological processes, which are necessary to understand the coupling between phreatophyte vegetation and groundwater, and its relationships with human and livestock activities.

AB The relationship between soil detachment capacity (Dc) by rill flow and hydraulic parameters (e.g., flow velocity, shear stress, unit stream power, stream power, and unit energy) at low flow rates is investigated to establish an accurate experimental model. Experiments are conducted using a 4 x 0.1 m rill hydraulic flume with a constant artificial roughness on the flume bed. The flow rates range from 0.22 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) to 0.67 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), and the slope gradients vary from 15.8% to 38.4%. Regression analysis indicates that the Dc by rill flow can be predicted using the linear equations of flow velocity, stream power, unit stream power, and unit energy. Dc by rill flow that is fitted to shear stress can be predicted with a power function equation. Predictions based on flow velocity, unit energy, and stream power are powerful, but those based on shear stress, especially on unit stream power, are relatively poor. The prediction based on flow velocity provides the best estimates of Dc by rill flow because of the simplicity and availability of its measurements. Owing to error in measuring flow velocity at low flow rates, the predictive abilities of Dc by rill flow using all hydraulic parameters are relatively lower in this study compared with the results of previous research. The measuring accuracy of experiments for flow velocity should be improved in future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A number of studies suggest a significant decline of river discharge in the Canadian Plains that drain the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and elsewhere in Canada. Analyses of these trends suggested that apparent decline rates may represent long-term discharge variation as a result of anthropogenic induced change in seasonal flow and/or may also represent true long-term declines in annual flow. Potential for significant declines in river discharge raises concern over future water supply for this region. However, extracting accurate trends in river discharge is challenging for basins with relatively short periods of record as quasi-periodic decadal and multi-decadal oscillations are found to be important components of long-term natural variability. In order to reconstruct historic river flows, a correlation model between river flow and climate variables (that normally have longer periods of record) was developed. This empirical relationship was used as a proxy to reconstruct natural modes of river discharge, allowing a means to extend short term discharge records further back in time. The Athabasca River was used as an example to demonstrate the application of the proposed methods. The resulting long-term Athabasca River flow trends show variation is strongly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Previous studies suggesting decline flows on this river have been biased by examining short-term records of flow, that by chance corresponded with the down limb of a long term cycle.

AB Theories that explain the dynamics of ecological communities are still in the developing stage. Yet, practical problems arise where the effects of man-made alterations in the hydrological environment on ecological communities need to be known. The processes involved in such cases are usually poorly understood and long term data and information are also limited. This study introduced a vegetation model taken from the field of ecology for the purpose of addressing such issues specifically to link the environmental variables with vegetation and to study the effects of changes in the hydrological environment on vegetation. The study was also motivated by the recent findings on species - habitat associations and species distributions on hydrological gradients. The investigation was specifically applied to tropical primary forests. The vegetation model chosen is more general and yet simple in formulation making to a top-down analysis of a system possible thereby reducing the data requirement and computational complexity. The study modified the model to suit the tropical forest modelling and gave analytical solutions to the steady states. The study demonstrated how the general information or data available can be incorporated in the model to produce useful qualitatively appreciable results, without requiring detailed understanding of the processes or comprehensive data records. The model was demonstrated on two tropical primary forests; Sinharaja forest dynamics plot (FDP) in Sri Lanka and Nee Soon freshwater swamp forest in Singapore where the effect of change in hydrological environment on vegetation was studied. The model was shown to be able to produce useful qualitative results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential for the geophysical characterization of fractured rock bulk anisotropy using azimuthal self potential gradient (ASPG) method was investigated at four fractured rock field sites in the New Jersey Highlands (NJH) province. A visual (from polar plots) and empirical (from linear regression of cross plots) correlation exists between ASPG measurements and dominant fracture strike orientations mapped at three of the four study sites, with the magnitude of the SP signal positively correlated to the number of fractures (N) along the same azimuth. This result is consistent with recent electrokinetic theory that invokes a dependence of the streaming potential coupling coefficient on microgeometry in addition to hydraulic gradient. Based on local surface drainage patterns and regional fracture orientations, the direction of the positive lobe of the ASPG signal appears indicative of the likely flow direction within fracture sets. Three repeat measurements at one site over a one year period consistently reproduced the ASPG lobes along major and minor fracture sets, although the magnitude of the self potential varied along the major strike set possibly due to variable rates of groundwater flow. Whereas ASPG captured hydraulic-anisotropy at three of four sites, resistivity anisotropy only dominated azimuthal resistivity surveys (ARS) data at one site. Our results suggest that ASPG is a surprisingly simple, effective toot for characterization of fracture-dominated media. In addition to defining the fracture-induced hydraulic anisotropy, the direction of fracture-controlled flow is evident from the polarity of the SP signal. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the ongoing rapid urbanization across the globe, its interference with groundwater resources is critical to freshwater sustainability. The groundwater transit time distribution (TTD) lumps the flow and transport processes of a regional groundwater system and therefore characterizes the aquifer's resilience to nonpoint-source contamination. However, the influence of large-scale urban areas on the regional groundwater TTD is not clear. This study proposed a novel analytical model for groundwater TTDs accounting for the effects of impervious urban structures. After the verification against results from particle tracking, we apply this analytical expression to investigate how the position and spatial extent of the urban area change the TTDs from the pre-urban ones. The sensitivity analysis suggests that urban areas tend to increase both the mean and the variance of groundwater transit times. Moreover, modeling results highlight the importance of the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer in determining the urban groundwater TTDs. For aquifers intersected by a local urban area, mean transit time (MTT) is dominated by the horizontal extent of the urban area (i.e., the impervious area), whereas for aquifers intersected by a regional urban area, MTT is strongly controlled by the vertical extent of the urban area in addition to its horizontal size. Being computationally efficient, the proposed analytical model can aid decision-making in urban freshwater resources management and urban planning.

AB This work presents the first tree-ring reconstructions of hydroclimate for the Upper Klamath River basin, which stretches from northern California into southern Oregon. The extended record provides a centuries-long perspective on the region's hydroclimatic variability and context for water-related political issues that have erupted in recent years. Reconstructions of water-year precipitation for Klamath Falls, Oregon (extending 1564-2004 and 1000-2010 CE) were developed to compare past drought severity with drought severity of the instrumental record (extending 1896-2011). The reconstructions suggest that variability exhibited during the instrumental period captures extremes of moderate-to-long-duration (6-, 10-, and 20-year) droughts, but not of short (single-year and 3-year) and very long (50-year) droughts, which were more severe during the 11th-13th centuries. The late-16th-century "mega drought" is present in the Klamath River basin, though with less strength than in the neighboring Sacramento River basin. Cool-season storm tracks appear to be a direct driver of hydroclimatic variability, leading to instances of see-saw like relationships with neighboring regions, such as in the mid-14th century. In contrast, the larger area of drought in the 12th century is suggestive of a long-term northward shift in cool-season storm tracks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The hydrological impact of the mediterranean forest: a review of French
   research
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE forest hydrology; floods; annual discharge; Mediterranean climate
AB Forest hydrology studies carried out in France have focused mainly on the Mediterranean part of the country. Three experimental catchment groups exist and have been monitored over a long period. Some forested catchments (Draix catchment) underwent no change during the study period, while others experienced either clear cutting (Lozere catchment) or forest fires (part of the Real Collobrier catchments). In each case studied, the behaviour of the forested catchment was compared to that of a control catchment.
   Included with the experimental catchment studies are the results of research with a fundamentally different approach. The research is based on a statistical study of the interrelated development of afforestation rates and runoff characteristics for average-sized catchments (around 100 km(2)) in that part of the southern French Massif Central which is subject to Mediterranean rainfall conditions.
   The results differ considerably from one site to another, indicating the degree of complexity of the rainfall/runoff relationship. An increase in extreme flood events due to forest disturbance could by no means be confirmed in every case. A closer look at the hydrological behaviour of the catchments cleared up the apparent inconsistencies. It is mainly the contrast between bare soil and vegetated soil. rather than between forest and other types of vegetation witch is relevant in explaining the hydrological behaviour.

AB Aggregation rules for determining mesoscale representative land surface parameters from their patch-scale counterparts have been suggested from previous geld work over the last decade. A selected number of these rules are tested using field data collected in the framework of HEIFE (Heihe River Basin Field Experiment on Land Surface Processes, 1990-1993, China). Data from the stations of the Zhangye, Linze, Gobi and sand deserts have been used. Surface albedo and surface roughness for these four patches were aggregated in a relatively simple manner and the results match the physical expectations. The aggregation rules for surface resistance to evaporation, however, gave strongly diverging predictions (min. 277 to max. 5356 s m(-1)). Comparing with remote sensing date, which comprise a full natural variability of land surface types, revealed that area effective values for surface albedo, surface emissivity and surface roughness for the momentum obtained from the four patches were similar to the values obtained from the distributed remote sensing estimations and aggregation rules. The remote sensing algorithm SEBAL provides distributed estimates of vertical temperature and vapour pressure differences in association with the sensible and latent heat fluxes. Applying area average, flux matching schemes, area-representative values for aerodynamic and surface resistance were obtained. Because of the mathematical flux matching, the representative value for the areal surface roughness length for heat transport in HEIFE is three times larger than for momentum transport. It is demonstrated that, instead of four patches, the area-representative surface resistance and the surface roughness for heat transport need to be derived from a full spectrum of their component values, i.e. the full natural variability in the heterogeneous terrain should be understood.

AB Rainfall distribution has become highly erratic due to climate change and intensive human activities. Hence, the estimation of rainfall distribution has an extraordinary significance in understanding the hydrological cycle and is crucial for water resources management. This paper presents a study on the large-scale spatial rainfall distribution in the Pearl River Basin of China using the information entropy theory and the fuzzy cluster analysis. The Directional Information Transfer Index (DITI) was used to describe the similarity between rainfall gaging stations, and the fuzzy cluster analysis was utilized to classify rainfall gaging stations into distribution zones with the proximity relation defined by the DITI. This research shows that the DITI integrates the rainfall feature at respective stations and the mutual influences among them. Further, the DITI-based fuzzy cluster analysis has a great advantage over the conventional pattern recognition method. Considering the unique temporal and spatial distribution characteristics, the DITI-based model combined with the fuzzy cluster analysis method provided more accurate classification of the rainfall distribution zones. Based on the monthly average rainfall data from 1959 to 2009 at 62 stations, the rainfall distribution in the Pearl River Basin is classified into 10 zones with their unique temporal and spatial distribution characteristics. The correct classification of rainfall distribution zones is crucial for the management and allocation of water resources in the Pearl River Delta to meet the increasing demand of domestic and industrial usage not only within the basin but also as a complementary source for Hong Kong.

AB A set of closed-form series solutions that account for the transient and steady-state responses of excess pore water pressure and total settlement to one-dimensional consolidation in saturated soils exposed to various typical types of time-dependent external loading with any desired excitation amplitude and period is symmetrically formulated based on the theory of poroelasticity. The mathematical approach developed in the current study is quite general so that it can be straightforward extended to arbitrary waveform shapes of harmonic loading after they are simply represented in terms of Fourier trigonometric series. These solutions are numerically calculated to evaluate variations in excess pore water pressure and total settlement due to vertical consolidation in saturated soils with two very different magnitudes of intrinsic permeability, Soil A (higher) and Soil B (lower), as representative examples using two illustrative periods per cycle. Our results show that within excitation frequencies we examined, the excess pore water pressure exhibits greater cyclic swings in Soil B than that in Soil A as harmonic stress compression and relaxation are added, but an inverse trend is observed for total settlement. As compared to static external loading, the excess pore water pressure persists longer with periodic fluctuation in the presence of cyclic loading, but less total settlement is induced in Soil B. The discrepancy in the latter (total settlement) between the static and cyclic loading is most significant in Soil B, reflecting a physical implication that low permeability leads to a slower dissipation of excess pore water pressure, thus causing less settlement with time.

AB As the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process, soil moisture (SM) has the potential to monitor agricultural drought, which can provide practical support for water management. In this study, a drought index, namely Soil Dryness Index (SDI), was proposed based on long-term gridded ERA-5 land SM, and its performance was evaluated. Furthermore, we employed the run theory and copula to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics based on this index in Inner Mongolia. Although the return period of drought events has been assessed in many studies, the drought tends to occur with a nonstationary frequency. The wavelet transform was then applied to drought area proportion time series in sub-regions to study the temporal characteristics of droughts. The results show that SDI performs well in monitoring agricultural drought. There is strong heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of drought events. Frequent and low-severity droughts dominated arid and semi-arid regions, while some high-severity droughts mainly occurred in humid and semi-humid regions (mainly in Hulunbuir and Xing'an). The droughts, especially those with high severity, have become much more frequent in the last two decades. The period from 2000 to 2010 had seen more frequent droughts in recent 40 years, and most 20-year return period droughts occurred during this period. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural droughts and provide a reference for future drought trends in Inner Mongolia.

AB A physical model is proposed for predicting the transport of the stable isotopes of water ((H2O)-O-18 and (HDO)-O-16) in soils under natural climatic conditions. The transport equation for stable isotopes in the unsaturated zone was coupled with a mechanistic model for water and heat exchange across the soil-atmosphere boundary. Diffusive and convective isotope fluxes were each considered in liquid and vapor phases of the soil. Turbulent exchanges of isotopes between the soil surface and the atmosphere were modeled by use of similarity theory in the same way as water vapor. Boundary conditions at the soil surface are based on an energy balance and turbulent fluxes of heat, water, and isotopes. The resulting model provides a framework for understanding the behavior of stable isotopes in soils of variable hydraulic properties and under various climatic conditions.

AB Streamflow and its components, such as baseflow, are momentous links of the hydrological cycle, and their spatiotemporal variations are affected by both climate change and human activities (CCHU). However, dis-crepancies in the influence of CCHU on streamflow and hydrological components are not fully understood. In this study, meteorological factors (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) and hydrological variables (streamflow and baseflow) were analyzed to quantify the responses of the streamflow and baseflow in the Bahe River to the CCHU during 1959-2016. The hydrometeorological variables in the Bahe River showed a downward trend, except for the baseflow at the Luolicun hydrological station (LLC), while the mutation point at the Maduwang hydrological station (MDW) was in 1989, and LLC was mutated in 1980 and 1989. Precipitation was closely related to streamflow in comparison with baseflow (r = 0.871 +/- 0.034), whereas potential evapo-transpiration was the opposite. The streamflow and baseflow at MDW had closer relationships with precipitation than at LLC (r = 0.828 +/- 0.077), while LLC was more affected by potential evapotranspiration (r =-0.698 +/- 0.004). Streamflow and baseflow upstream of the Bahe River were mainly affected by human activities (67-75 % and 74-78 %, respectively), and baseflow midstream due to climate change (90-147 %). The contributions of climate change and human activities to midstream streamflow were 37-75 % and 25-63 %, respectively. Our findings highlight the responses of streamflow and baseflow to environmental changes, which will enhance our understanding of the response mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in a changing environment.

AB Tracer injection is a common technique in the studies of chemical transport in streams and channels. One of its limitations is the requirement of frequent sampling for representative tracer breakthrough data. Frequent collection and analysis of water samples are normally expensive and time-consuming. The measurement of electrical conductivity (EC) is a potential alternative to sample collection and analyses, because of its ease of data acquisition. But whether the EC value can characterize the injected solute concentration requires further evaluation. This article assesses the ability of EC to predict solute concentrations in tracer injections. Two injection studies were conducted in two separate flumes: an instantaneous injection of phosphorus (P) and bromide (Br) in a 20-m flume and a constant injection of Pin a 10-m flume. Water samples were collected intensively at multiple locations and EC was automatically and continuously recorded. Using a linear model, a solute breakthrough was calculated based on recorded EC and compared to the measured solute concentrations.
   The results showed that the EC-solute relationship can reduce the number of water samples needed for an accurate solute breakthrough. A small sample of paired recorded EC and solute concentrations can be used to build a model for each tracer study. By collecting at least 9 water samples at specific times, i.e., at shoulder, peak, and tail of a breakthrough curve, a simple regression model can efficiently predict P concentrations. The correlation is 80% or greater between predicted and observed concentrations, confirming that EC successfully traced P presence in water and can be used to facilitate tracer injection studies.

AB The nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in North America spanning the pluvial-nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by False Nearest Neighbor (FNN) methods. Simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated, and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension. The majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1% threshold at a dimension less than 30, showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather-driven pseudo-stochastic systems. A less restrictive threshold, 5% is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series. Time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over-smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions. The relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas, high elevations, and large mean annual flows and variance, high autocorrelations, and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude. Times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions. Mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features. The use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones. Changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change.

AB Accurate soil moisture information is critically important for hydrological modelling. Although remote sensing soil moisture measurement has become an important data source, it cannot be used directly in hydrological modelling. A novel study based on nonlinear techniques (a local linear regression (LLR) and two feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs)) is carried out to estimate soil moisture deficit (SMD), using the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) multi-angle brightness temperatures (T(b)s) with both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarisations. The gamma test is used for the first time to determine the optimum number of Tbs required to construct a reliable smooth model for SMD estimation, and the relationship between model input and output is achieved through error variance estimation. The simulated SMD time series in the study area is from the Xinanjiang hydrological model. The results have shown that LLR model is better at capturing the interrelations between SMD and Tbs than ANNs, with outstanding statistical performances obtained during both training (NSE = 0.88, r = 0.94, RMSE = 0.008 m) and testing phases (NSE = 0.85, r = 0.93, RMSE = 0.009 m). Nevertheless, both ANN training algorithms (radial BFGS and conjugate gradient) have performed well in estimating the SMD data and showed excellent performances compared with those derived directly from the SMOS soil moisture products. This study has also demonstrated the informative capability of the gamma test in the input data selection for model development. These results provide interesting perspectives for data -assimilation in flood forecasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate-change projections suggest altered precipitation, temperature, and hydrological patterns for the near future. To better understand these future changes, long-term evidence from paleoarchives is necessary to determine the natural variability and climate relations in surficial hydrology. In this study, we aim to demonstrate that distribution of sedimentary mouthparts (mandibles) of aquatic mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae are dependent on stream conditions and this relationship can be used in paleohydrological studies to reconstruct past changes in stream flow. The results from a river-lake continuum in eastern Finland showed that the surface sediment accumulation of mayfly and caddisfly mandibles was strongly related to stream flow with highest abundances found from the riverine sediments. A sediment core taken from the deep basin of the lake revealed mandible accumulation patterns that correlated with a previous independent paleohydrological reconstruction. We interpret that the primary forcer for mandible deposition to lake sediments is spring floods caused by snow melt, and hence the mandible accumulation, represents amount of winter precipitation. Subsequently, the results indicated strong stream flow and wet winters during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and weaker stream flow and dry winters during and after the Little Ice Age (LIA). This wintertime reconstruction contrasts the general summertime trends of dry MCA and wet LIA. The present results confirm the usability of mayfly and caddisfly mandibles in paleohydrological studies and provide evidence for past hydrological dynamics that can be valuable when addressing the potential magnitude of future changes.

ID AIR TEMPERATURES; HABITAT
AB It is now widely accepted that global climate warming is taking place on the earth. Among many other effects, a rise in air temperatures is expected to increase stream temperatures indefinitely. However, due to evaporative cooling, stream temperatures do not increase linearly with increasing air temperatures indefinitely. Within the anticipated bounds of climate warming, extreme stream temperatures may therefore not rise substantially. With this concept in mind, past extreme temperatures measured at 720 USGS stream gauging stations were analyzed by the standard deviate method. In this method the highest stream temperatures are expressed as the mean temperature of a measured partial maximum stream temperature series plus its standard deviation multiplied by a factor K-E (standard deviate). Various K-E-values were explored; values of K-E larger than 8 were found physically unreasonable. It is concluded that the value of KE should be in the range from 7 to 8. A unit error in estimating KE translates into a typical stream temperature error of about 0.5 degrees C. Using a logistic model for the stream temperature/air temperature relationship, a one degree error in air temperature gives a typical error of 0.16 degrees C in stream temperature. With a projected error in the enveloping standard deviate dK(E)= 1.0 (range 0.5-1.5) and an error in projected high air temperature dT(a) = 2 degrees C (range 0-4 degrees C), the total projected stream temperature error is estimated as dT(s) = 0.8 degrees C.

AB A spatiotemporal stochastic simulation approach for constructing maps of daily precipitation at regional scales in a hindcast mode is proposed in this paper. Parametric temporal trend models of precipitation are first established at the available rain gauges. Temporal trend model parameters are then regionalized in space accounting for their spatial auto- and cross-correlation, as well as for their relationships with auxiliary spatial information such as terrain elevation. The resulting residual values at the rain gauges are modeled as a realization of a stationary spatiotemporal process. Sequential simulation is then used to generate alternative synthetic realizations of daily precipitation fields, which reproduce: (i) the rain gauge measurements, and (ii) their histogram and a model for their spatiotemporal correlation over the entire study region and time period of interest. In addition, a post-processing transformation allows reproduction of the rainfall histogram at particular dates, while preserving the observed rain gauge data.
   A case study illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology using daily precipitation measurements recorded at 77 rain gauges in the northern California coastal region from Nov 1, 1981 to Jan 31, 1982. Conditional stochastic simulation in space and time is performed for generating a 30-member ensemble of daily precipitation fields on a 300 x 360 grid of cell size 1 km(2) for the above time period. It is shown that simulated precipitation fields reproduce the spatiotemporal characteristics of the rain gauge measurements, thus providing realistic inputs of precipitation forcing for hydrologic impact assessment studies.

AB Laboratory experiments were carried out to study the flow structure both inside and above different canopy models which were dominated by progressive waves. A set of experimental conditions were considered in a laboratory flume: three vegetation models (submerged rigid, submerged flexible and emergent rigid), three plant densities (128, 640 and 1280 stems m(-2)) and three wave frequencies (f = 0.8, 1 and 1.4 Hz). The progressive waves followed the second-order Stokes theory in the intermediate depth range. The observations revealed that submerged and emergent rigid vegetation models modified the wave-induced velocities i.e., both mean current and wave velocity. The submerged rigid vegetation model for plant densities higher than 640 plants m(-2) and wave frequency higher than 1 Hz acted akin to a false floor, confining the mean current to above the plant bed. A penetration depth around 2 cm below the top of submerged rigid vegetation was found. For the other runs, the vertical profile of mean current did not present changes with respect to runs without plants. The emergent rigid vegetation model reversed the direction of the induced mean current, with the highest velocity corresponding to the highest plant density. In contrast, the submerged flexible vegetation model had a weak effect on the mean current, with the vertical velocity profile similar to that found in experiments without vegetation. The wave velocities inside the vegetation for the densest submerged rigid vegetation were found to be reduced by 20%, when compared to the wave velocities without vegetation, while in emergent rigid vegetation this reduction was of 45%.

AB A hydrological drought magnitude (M-T) expressed in standardized terms is predicted on annual, monthly and weekly time scales for a sampling period of T years in streamflow data from the Canadian prairies. The drought episodes are considered to follow the Poisson law of probability and, when coupled with the gamma probability distribution function (pdf) of drought magnitude (M) in the extreme number theorem, culminate in a relationship capable of evaluating the expected value, E(M-T). The parameters of the underlying pdf of M are determined based on the assumption that the drought intensity follows a truncated normal pdf. The E(M-T) can be evaluated using only standard deviation (sigma), lag-1 autocorrelation () of the standardized hydrological index (SHI) sequence, and a weighting parameter phi (ranging from 0 to 1) to account for the extreme drought duration (L-T), as well as the mean drought duration (L-m ), in a characteristic drought length (L-c ). The SHI is treated as standard normal variate, equivalent to the commonly-used standardized precipitation index. A closed-form relationship can be used for the estimation of first-order conditional probabilities, which can also be estimated from historical streamflow records. For all rivers, at the annual time scale, the value of phi was found equal to 0.5, but it tends to vary (in the range 0 to 1) from river to river at monthly and weekly time scales. However, for a particular river, the phi value was nearly constant at monthly and weekly time scales. The proposed method estimates E(M-T) satisfactorily comparable to the observed counterpart. At the annual time scale, the assumption of a normal pdf for drought magnitude tends to yield results in close proximity to that of a gamma pdf. The M-T, when transformed into deficit-volume, can form a basis for designing water storage facilities and for planning water management strategies during drought periods.

AB The combination of natural forcing and anthropogenic activities affects the global climate system, increasing the frequency of extreme drought events. Drought events with multi-characteristics will have incalculable impacts on ecology, human life, and socioeconomics. However, the quantitative impacts of climate change caused by anthropogenic forcing on the droughts over China remains unclear. In this study, ensemble mean data of seven global climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models (CMIP6) under both natural and anthropogenic forcing experiment and only natural forcing experiment (abbreviated as "ALL" and "NAT", respectively) were used. The drought characteristics are identified by applying the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and run theory. The quantitative impacts of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on drought frequency, duration, intensity, affected area over China in the past 54 years (1961-2014) were investigated by comparing the drought characteristics between "NAT" and "ALL". On the whole region, ACC presented anabatic effects on drought such as increasing the frequency, enhancing the intensity, and prolonging the duration. It also increased the area affected by moderate and extreme drought events. ACC was averagely about 1.47 times more determinative of whether a drought event occurs. However, the effect of ACC on drought characteristics did not show spatial consistency: drought in Southwest China was showing a significant aggra-vation trend influenced by ACC, while droughts in Northwest China were presenting a mitigation tendency. These associated findings emphasize the regional features of drought affected by ACC, and could help policy makers to develop mitigation measures.

AB The transboundary water pollution control is often complex and challenging due to the multiple jurisdictions or countries involved. However, current studies fail to comprehensively examine the issue of incentives in transboundary water pollution control, nor do they consider dynamic changes in the behavior of local actors. Multiple administrative boundaries and multiple actors are spanned in the middle route of China's South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP-MR) making it an ideal case for applying the theory of neoliberal environmentality to examine the governance of transboundary water pollution, as it provides a lens to carefully observe how incentive coordination as a techne of neoliberal environmentality shapes the behavior of local actors to improve water quality. By constructing a baseline scenario, an eco-compensation scenario, and an incentive-coordination scenario, this paper provides a differential game modeling approach to examine and compare the behavioral differences of local actors under different scenarios, and to understand the benefits distribution mechanism under Chinese non-democratic and non-western system. The findings demonstrate that incentive coordination for transboundary water pollution control has the same political and economic roots as neoliberal environmentality. Moreover, compared to eco-compensation modeled as a leader-follower game, incentive coordination as a social planner optimization makes local actors' interests more compatible with improving water quality, and thus is more similar to the voluntary transactions envisaged by PES. Finally, the neoliberal incentive structure constructed by incentive coordination for transboundary water pollution control can help to improve the effectiveness of water pollution control under the existing eco-compensation systems that rely on command-andcontrol instruments.

   Persistence; Seasonality; Annual maxima

AB The concept of return period and its estimation are pivotal in risk management for many geophysical applications. Return period is usually estimated by inferring a probability distribution from an observed series of the random process of interest and then applying the classical equation, i.e. the inverse of the exceedance probability. Traditionally, we form a statistical sample by selecting, from the "complete" time series (e.g. at the daily scale), those values that can reasonably be considered as realizations of independent extremes, e.g. annual maxima or peaks over a certain high threshold. Such a selection procedure entails that a large number of observations are discarded; this wastage of information could have important consequences in practical problems, where the reduction of the already small size of common hydrological records significantly affects the reliability of the estimates. Under such circumstances, it is crucial to exploit all the available information. To this end, we investigate the advantages of estimating the return period without any data decimation, by using the full dataset. The proposed procedure, denoted as Complete Time-series Analysis (CTA), exploits the property that the average interarrival time (i.e. return period) of potentially damaging events is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process, even for cyclo-stationary (e.g. seasonal) processes. For the sake of illustration, the CTA is compared to that based on annual maxima selection, through a simple non-parametric approach, discussing advantages and limitations of the method. Results suggest that the proposed CTA approach provides a more conservative return period estimation in an holistic implementation framework within a broader range of return period values than that pertaining to other methods, which means not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory.

AB The proper understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of multi-year droughts and return periods is important for drought risk assessment. This study evaluated and compared the spatiotemporal variations of drought characteristics and return periods within mainland China between 1961 and 2013. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Composite Index (CI) were calculated at multiple timescales, the run theory was used for objective identification and characterization of drought events while Kendall's method was used to analyze their dependencies. Within the univariate framework, marginal distributions of duration, severity, and peak were derived by fitting Exponential, Weibull and GDP distributions respectively and the drought return periods was investigated and mapped. Comparison of drought indices showed that SPEI and CI performed better than SPI in delineating spatial patterns of drought characteristics. This might be attributed to the temperature effect on evapotranspiration and therefore on drought index. Considering the increasing trend in reference evapotranspiration in the 21st century, the importance of utilizing temperature-based drought index is imperative. Severe and extreme droughts occurred in the late 1990s in many places in China while persistent multi-year severe droughts occurred more frequently over North China, Northeast China, Northwest China and Southwest China. The spatial patterns showed that regions characterized by higher drought severity were associated with higher drought duration. The North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China had much longer drought durations during the 1990s and 2000s. As droughts normally cover large areas, regional drought return periods has been showed to be more effective in providing support for drought management than station based drought return periods. Studies on the spatial comparability of drought return periods across mainland China have therefore been undertaken for drought mitigation and effective utilization of water resources.

TI Revised Horton model for event and continuous simulations of

DE Horton method; Infiltration; Soil water content; Event and continuous

AB The Horton equation has been widely used to simulate infiltration under ponding conditions and many efforts have been made to expand the applicability of this method to non-ponding conditions. However, because of the absence of appropriate drainage controls, most existing modified Horton methods cannot be used for continuous rainfall-runoff simulations with long dry time periods. The objective of this study is to develop a modified Horton infiltration model (MHI) for both event and continuous simulations with soil moisture threshold controls. Unlike other modified Horton methods, nonlinear and linear equations are used in this new method to quantify the relationships between infiltration capacity and soil water storage respectively for wet and dry soil moisture conditions (wet gravity-driven free drainage stage; dry: capillarity-dominated non-drainage stage). Two tests of the MHI model were conducted to evaluate its performance in both event and continuous simulations. Fourteen modeling scenarios were considered in the event modeling test of MHI, which involved three soil types of different initial water contents under various rainfall conditions. The simulation results of MHI were compared with those simulated by a modified Green-Amps model and the reference data from Mein and Larson (1971). Furthermore, MHI was applied to a field site in Grand Forks, North Dakota for continuous modeling and compared against the observed data, which demonstrated its capability in the modeling of infiltration and soil moisture variations.

AB To help improve understanding of how changes in climate and land cover affect water fluxes, water budgets, and the structure and function of regional grassland ecosystems, the Grassland Landscape Productivity Model (GLPM) was used to simulate spatiotemporal variation in primary water fluxes. The study area was a semiarid region in Inner Mongolia, China, in 2002, when severe drought was experienced. For Stipa grandis steppe, Leymus chinensis steppe, shrubland, and croplands, the modeled total, daily and monthly averaged, and maximum evapotranspiration during the growing season and the modeled water deficits were similar to those measured in Inner Mongolia under similar precipitation conditions. The modeled temporal variations in daily evaporation rate, transpiration rate, and evapotranspiration rate for the typical steppes also agreed reasonably well with measured trends. The results demonstrate that water fluxes varied in response to spatiotemporal variations in environmental factors and associated changes in the phenological and physiological characteristics of plants. It was also found that transpiration and evapotranspiration (rather than precipitation) were the primary factors controlling differences in water deficit among land cover types. The results also demonstrate that specific phenomena occur under severe drought conditions; these phenomena are considerably different to those occurring under normal or well-watered conditions. The findings of the present study will be useful for evaluating day-scale water fluxes and their relationships with climate change, hydrology, land cover, and vegetation dynamics.

AB Sustainable water resources management relies on understanding how societies and water systems coevolve. Many place-based sociohydrology (SH) modeling studies use proxies, such as environmental degradation, to capture key elements of the social component of system dynamics. Parameters of assumed relationships between environmental degradation and the human response to it are usually obtained through calibration. Since these relationships are not yet underpinned by social-science theories, confidence in the predictive power of such place-based sociohydrologic models remains low. The generalizability of SH models therefore requires major advances in incorporating more realistic relationships, underpinned by appropriate hydrological and social-science data and theories. The latter is a critical input, since human culture - especially values and norms arising from it - influences behavior and the consequences of behaviors. This paper reviews a key social-science theory that links cultural factors to environmental decision-making, assesses how to better incorporate social-science insights to enhance SH models, and raises important questions to be addressed in moving forward. This is done in the context of recent progress in sociohydrological studies and the gaps that remain to be filled. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and opportunities in terms of generalization of SH models and the use of available data to allow future prediction and model transfer to ungauged basins.

AB Subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) precipitation forecasts can fill the gap between weather and seasonal forecasts. While raw forecasts from S2S models are informative, calibration is necessary to correct systematic biases and quantify forecast uncertainty to facilitate applications of S2S forecasts. This paper develops a seven-parameter Bernoulli-Gamma-Gaussian model to calibrate S2S precipitation forecasts. The Bernoulli distribution characterizes the occurrence of zero versus non-zero values of precipitation, the Gamma distribution accounts for the distribution of non-zero precipitation amounts and the bivariate Gaussian distribution formulates the relationship between raw forecasts and observations. A case study of the East River catchment in South China is devised for the S2S forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF). The Bernoulli-Gamma-Gaussian model is used to calibrate raw forecasts at the daily time step and the Schaake Shuffle is used to instill the temporal patterns to form ensemble time series forecasts. The results show that raw S2S forecasts generally suffer from considerable forecast bias and unreliable ensemble spread and can exhibit negative forecast skill. Compared to the quantile mapping, the Bernoulli-Gamma-Gaussian model with the Schaake Shuffle is effective in correcting biases, improving reliability and yielding forecast skill for daily and accumulated precipitation. Furthermore, a sliding window of 15 days tends to be suitable to pool samples to deal with sampling variability and precipitation seasonality for the purpose of calibration of S2S forecasts. Overall, the Bernoulli-Gamma-Gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate S2S precipitation forecasts for hydrological modeling and water resources management.

AB The Artificial Intelligence (AI) models i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) were used to statistically downscale and project rainfall data from CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for Tabriz and Ardabil synoptic stations in north west Iran. Since one of the important issues in statistical downscaling of GCMs is to select dominant variables among plenty of large-scale climate data (predictors), a predictors screening framework, which integrates Wavelet-Entropy (WE) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was developed in this study to statistically downscale mean monthly rainfall values. The advantage of proposed method is to reduce the noise and dimensionality of data as well as selecting reliable inputs of downscaling model for future rainfall projection. To this end, five GCMs (i.e., Can-ESM2, BNU-ESM, CSIRO-ACCESS1, GFDL-ESM2G and INM-CM4) were employed. ANN, LSSVM and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were trained to capture relationship between the predictors and the stations' observed rainfall values (predictand). Then, ensemble techniques were applied on the outputs of the downscaling models. The calibration, validation and projection of the proposed downscaling models were performed over the periods; Jan. 1951 to Dec. 1991, Jan. 1992 to Dec. 2005 and Jan. 2017 to Dec. 2100, respectively. The projection of rainfall for near and distant future (i.e., 2017-2050 and 2050-2100) by the proposed multi-GCM ensemble framework yielded to rainfall alteration pattern; 40-41% and 35-42% decrease at Tabriz station and 6-12% and 5-13% increase at Ardabil station under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively.

AB This paper evaluates three distinct approaches for disaggregating daily rainfall to sub-daily sequences: (1) random multiplicative cascades (microcanonical and canonical versions), (2) point process (randomized Bartlett-Lewis model - RBLM), and (3) resampling (method of fragments). These methods are used to perform disaggregation of daily rainfall to hourly rainfall at four point locations across Australia (Sydney, Perth, Cairns, and Hobart), which are associated with different climatic regimes. The methods are evaluated based on parameter estimation procedures applied (including introduction of the sequential Monte Carlo sampler in RBLM), the capability of the resulting sequences to reproduce standard validation statistics, and the representation of observed rainfall variability and intermittency, within-day wet spells, and extreme rainfall percentiles. The results generally indicate that the method of fragments outperforms the other models. While all the models are found to simulate reasonably well the commonly used statistical measures (e.g. mean and dry proportions) of rainfall at the hourly timestep, the microcanonical model is found to significantly overestimate the hourly rainfall variance. With respect to extreme value characteristics, the resampling approach is found to match well the observed intensity-frequency relationship at an hourly scale, with the cascade models underestimating (canonical) and overestimating (microcanonical) extreme rainfall. The point process model's performance is poor in Cairns but reasonably good at other locations. An analysis of the empirical within-day wet- and dry-spell distributions further reveals that the cascade-based models are not robust for observed wet and dry spells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lake Urmia-a shallow endemic hypersaline lake in northwest Iran-has undergone a dramatic decline in its water level (WL), by about 8 m, since 1995. The primary cause of the WL decline in Lake Urmia has been debated in the scientific literature, regarding whether it has been predominantly driven by atmospheric climate change or by human activities in the watershed landscape. Using available climate, hydrological, and vegetation data for the period 1981-2015, this study analyzes and aims to explain the lake desiccation based on other observed hydro-climatic and vegetation changes in the Lake Urmia watershed and classical exploratory statistical methods. The analysis accounts for the relationships between atmospheric climate change (precipitation P, temperature T), and hydrological (soil moisture SM, and WL) and vegetation cover (VC; including agricultural crops and other vegetation) changes in the landscape. Results show that P, T, and SM changes cannot explain the sharp decline in lake WL since 2000. Instead, the agricultural increase of VC in the watershed correlates well with the lake WL change, indicating this human-driven VC and associated irrigation expansion as the dominant human driver of the Lake Urmia desiccation. Specifically, the greater transpiration from the expanded and increasingly irrigated agricultural crops implies increased total evapotranspiration and associated consumptive use of water (inherently related to the irrigation and water diversion and storage developments in the watershed). Thereby the runoff from the watershed into the lake has decreased, and the remaining smaller inflow to the lake has been insufficient for keeping up the previous lake WL, causing the observed WL drop to current conditions.

AB This study examines the spatial patterns of annual runoff ratios and their variability and identifies the determinants of runoff indices for 238 reference basins with low levels of anthropogenic influence and 1352 non-reference basins with substantial levels of anthropogenic influence. Runoff ratios are high and runoff ratio coefficients of variation (CV) are low in coastal Pacific Northwest and Northeast basins, both humid temperate climates. The most significant variable that influences annual runoff ratio for both basin types is the average annual days of measurable precipitation. Snow percent of total precipitation and minimum watershed elevation are common predictors of runoff ratio for both types of basins. Slope percent and Horton overland flow are significant predictors for reference basin runoff ratio, while average annual precipitation, basin compactness, and dam storage are significant predictors for non-reference basin runoff ratio. The variables most significantly influencing runoff ratio CV in both types of basins are the average annual days of measurable precipitation, the precipitation seasonality index, and the base flow index. Horton overland flow is a significant predictor for reference basins, while minimum watershed elevation is a significant predictor for non-reference basins. Spatial autocorrelation of ordinary least squares estimated residuals are reduced by geographically weighted regression (GWR) for all models in both basin types. This study shows that GWR modeling, which takes into account spatial non-stationarity, can create more accurate representations of runoff ratio variability in both basin types. The spatially-varying coefficient values in GWR models also show local specific relationships between runoff indices and various climatic and landscape factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Conceptual models are considered to be the best choice for describing the runoff process in a watershed. However, enormous requirements for topographic, hydrologic and meteorological data and extensive time commitment for calibration of conceptual models (especially for distributed models) are often prohibitive factors in their practical applications. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be an efficient way of modeling the runoff process in situations where explicit knowledge of the internal hydrologic processes is not available. An ANN is a flexible mathematical structure that is capable of identifying complex nonlinear relationships between input and output data sets. This paper presents the use of ANN for predicting the peak flow, timing and shape of runoff hydrograph, based on causal meteorological parameters. Antecedent precipitation index, melt index, winter precipitation, spring precipitation, and timing are the five input parameters used to develop runoff hydrograph for the Red River in Manitoba, Canada. A feed-forward artificial neural network is trained by using back-percolation algorithm. Peak flow, time of peak, width of hydrograph at 75 and 50% of peak, base flow, and timing of rising and falling sides of hydrograph are the output parameters obtained from the neural network model to describe a runoff hydrograph. The ANN generated results are evaluated using statistical parameters: percentage error and correlation. For six flood events for which forecasts are made the average absolute error in peak flow and time of peak is 6% and 4 days, respectively. Correlation between observed and simulated values of peak flow and time of peak is 0.99 and 0.88, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Colloids are widely distributed in agricultural runoff, especially from croplands with manure applications. Dense vegetation has been suggested to be effective to reduce surface runoff contaminants, including colloidal particles. In this work, small scale laboratory experiments were used to determine the influence of physical and chemical factors (i.e. solution ionic strength, particle size, surface flow rate, and vegetation type) on the surface transport and removal of colloids in a dense vegetation system without drainage. Conservative tracer studies of bromide were conducted as a control to quantify the deposition of colloids onto grass surfaces and the mass exchange of colloids between the overland flow and soil underneath under various experimental conditions. The deposition of colloids enhanced with increases in solution ionic strength and particle size, and with decreases in flow rate. We also found vegetation type played an important role on colloid transport with more deposition onto Ryegrass than onto Bahia grass under the same experimental conditions. A mathematical model combining overland flow, convection-dispersion equations and exchange layer theory was developed to simulate the transport of colloids in overland flow through the dense vegetation. Simulations of the model fitted the experimental data well and helped to understand the effect of ionic strength, particle size, flow rate, and vegetation type on colloid transport and removal in dense vegetation. Although additional investigations are still needed, findings from this study can inform the installation and maintenance of dense vegetation systems, such as vegetative filter strips, to reduce the loading of colloids in surface runoff.

TI Climate change and reservoir sedimentation implications for irrigated
   agriculture in the Indus Basin Irrigation System in Pakistan

AB Pakistan relies greatly on the water of the Upper Indus basin (UIB) for its vast agriculture in the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). There are already concerns about the extent of unsustainable water use in the IBIS, particularly of groundwater, and these concerns are likely to increase in the future due to population increase and associated increased demand for food. In addition, climate change, continuing reservoir sedimentation in the major dams, and other impacts on water supply and demand are likely to have an impact on the practical implementation of the landmark inter-provincial Water Apportionment Accord (the Accord), which governs surface water allocation in the IBIS. There is, therefore, a need to assess the sustainability of irrigation in light of the potential variations of water availability in the basin under a series of plausible climate change and reservoir sedimentation scenarios.
   In this paper, we examine the impact of continuing reservoir sedimentation and climate change by 2050 on the water balance of canal commands in the IBIS. Firstly, we used a river system model, the first to include water management rules as in the Accord, to propagate climate induced changes on flows in the UIB and their impact on IBIS flow regulation and canal deliveries (I-cw) with and without reservoir sedimentation. Secondly, we used a selection of General Circulation Models (GCMs) that showed skill at simulating the local climate of the IBIS to assess the projected changes to rainfall (P-n) and evapotranspiration (ETa). The analysis revealed that water balances in IBIS canal command areas are more significantly affected by changed inflows from the UIB than by localised climate induced changes (i.e. P-n and ETa). Continuing reservoir sedimentation in the dams to 2050 will diminish the capacity of the system to store flows during the wet summer Kharif season for its later release in the dry winter Rabi season. This will decrease the supply of I-cw in the Rabi season to the downstream IBIS areas in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, and potentially increase supplies in the Kharif season. The impact of reservoir sedimentation on the Rabi water supply (33 mm (13%) decrease in median I-cw, equivalent to 1.89 km(3)), is greater than the impact of projected localised climate change within the IBIS (2 mm (12%) decrease in median P-n, equivalent to 0.13 km(3)). Sedimentation combined with climate change decreases the median I-cw by 51 mm (20%, equivalent to 2.91 km(3)) in Rabi in the low flow scenario and increases it by 48 mm (8%, equivalent to 2.72 km(3)) in Kharif in the high flow scenario. In the upstream Punjab province, however, reservoir sedimentation will have limited impact by 2050 due to lower ETa in Rabi and the availability of groundwater. Continued reservoir sedimentation beyond 2050 will also affect Punjab, again diminishing the supply of I-cw in Rabi and increasing it in Kharif. Concurrently, declining I-cw could lead to a substantial reduction in crop areas in the Rabi season. To avoid this undesirable scenario, Pakistan needs to explore both demand and supply management options to achieve food and economic security, as well as controlling sedimentation rates in reservoirs.

AB Groundwater contaminant source identification (GCSI) can provide support for the confirmation of responsibility and the remediation of pollution. This study has developed an innovative combination algorithm to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination simultaneously. The research idea is based on Bayes theory and combines an ensemble smoother (ES) algorithm, differential evolutionary Markov chain (DEMC) algorithm, and adaptive kriging surrogate model (AKSM). Poor selection of initial estimates for unknown variables will slow down the convergence rate. Therefore, the initial points are not generated completely randomly, but are partially obtained by the ES algorithm. After the initial points have been determined, the DEMC algorithm is used to recognize source properties and model parameters in groundwater contamination. To improve the efficiency of the DEMC algorithm, the updating formula was adjusted by introducing information about the optimal chain into the iteration. However, the inversion process is time-consuming because both the ES and DEMC algorithms need to run the original simulation model frequently. To solve this problem, an AKSM was established for the original simulation model, which greatly accelerated the inversion process. Different hypothetical cases with different complexities were used to illustrate the validity of the combination algorithm. The identification results implied that the combination algorithm had not only faster convergence, but also higher accuracy. These improvements were more evident in the second case and third case. This implies that the proposed method will play a greater role with increasing problem complexity.

AB Urban polluted rivers are important sources of N2O because they receive heavy nitrogen loads containing N2O and its precursors. Understanding the N2O budget is vital to the formulation of N2O emissions reduction policies. The isotopic ratios of N2O from different sources can provide insights into global N2O budgets. Isotopic ratios of N2O from soil and marine has been well studied, yet few studies have explored dynamics of dissolved N2O and its isotopic ratios in urban polluted rivers. In this study, we quantified N2O concentrations, environmental variables and the production pathways of N2O, measured the nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate and ammonia to revealed the nitrogen pollution sources, assessed the isotopic ratios of N2O emitted from a series of polluted rivers and compare them with those of soils, oceans, and freshwaters, and revealed the influence of N2O production pathways and nitrogen pollution sources on the delta N-15-N2O and N2O concentrations of urban polluted rivers in Shenzhen City, China. The concentrations of dissolved N2O ranged from 0.3 to 2482.9 nmol/L, with most values exceeding those equilibrium with the atmosphere, indicating that these rivers in urban subtropical areas are significant N2O sources to atmosphere. The isotopic ratios of dissolved N2O from polluted rivers varied widely, with delta N-15-N2O ranging from-11.9%o to 34.8%o, delta O-18-N2O from 37.9%o to 68.2%o, and SP from-10.5%o to 36.2%o. The delta N-15 of emitted N2O from water surface to atmosphere ranged from-11.9%o to +34.8%o, with a mean value of +9.2%o, which was higher than that from natural rivers, soil, and the troposphere. delta N-15(sp) and delta O-18 values of dissolved N2O were adopted to quantify the relative contributions of nitrification (f), denitrification (1f), and the magnitude of N2O reduction (Fr) by denitrification. The results showed that denitrification was dominant pathway of N2O production, although the relative contribution of denitrification and nitrification had a great temporal and spatial variability. There is no distinct linear relationship between the concentrations of dissolved N2O, delta N-15-N2O and environmental variables (DO, DOC, NO3- , and NH4(+)). The non-linear relationship among delta N-15-N2O and delta N-15-NO3-, f, Fr, and environmental variables were explored by regression tree analysis. The results suggested that f and Fr, not DO, DOC, NO(3)(- )and NH4(+), were the primary correlates of dissolved N2O, for which the N2O concentrations were higher when N2O was primarily produced via nitrification (f > 77.5%) or denitrification (f < 8%), and were lower when Fr > 69.5%. It is the first attempt to reveal the connection between production and consumption processes with N2O concentrations directly. In addition, the elevated values of delta N-15-NO3- (4.3 to 29.8%o) and delta N-15-NH4(+) (3.2%o to 9.3%o) in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrogen contamination is predominantly sourced from urban sewage.
   Regression tree analysis also indicated that intense denitrification and sewage effluent result in enriched delta N-15 in N2O from polluted rivers, for which the delta N-15 values were higher when N2O was primarily produced via denitrification (f < 12%) or delta 15N-NO(3)(- )were higher than 15.6%o. These findings provide a foundation upon which to devise strategies to reducing N2O production and emission in urban rivers.

AB Vegetation cover affects the amount of precipitation, its chemical composition and its spatial distribution, and this may have implications for the distribution of water, nutrients and contaminants in the subsurface soil layer. The aim of this study was a detailed diagnosis of the spatio-temporal variability in the amount of throughfall (TF) and its chemical components in a 72-year-old pine stand with an admixture of oak and birch. The spatio-temporal variability in the amount of TF water and the concentrations and deposition of the TF components were studied. The components that are exchanged in canopy (H+, K, Mg, Mn, DOC, NH4+) were more variable than the components whose TF deposition is the sum of wet and dry (including gas) deposition and which undergo little exchange in the canopy (Na, CI, NO3-, SO42-). The spatial distribution was temporally stable, especially during the leafed period. This study also investigated the effect of the selected pine stand characteristics on the spatial distribution of throughfall and its chemical components; the characteristics included leaf area index (LAI), the proportion of the canopy covered by deciduous species and pine crowns, and the distance from the nearest tree trunk. The LAI measured during the leafed and leafless periods had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of TF deposition. No relationship was found between the spatial distribution of the amount of TF water and (i) the LAI; (ii) the canopy cover of broadleaf species or pines; or (iii) the distance from the trunks.

AB Runoff variability of large ungauged international basins affects water availability to downstream countries making management of transboundary water difficult and sometimes causing geopolitical. tension. The key to successfully predict runoff and its fluctuation in both gauged and ungauged basins is a reliable hydrologic model and an appropriate parameter regionalization approach. The Upper Blue Nile River Basin of Ethiopia is an example where data are limited, water resources are valuable, and competition for water among riparian countries is strong. To predict runoff variability from the basin as well as from ungauged subbasins, a water balance model with six parameters was tested. The model parameters were identified through a sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo experiments and their plausible search ranges were constrained. Six parameter regionalization methods (global mean, subbasin mean, multiple regression, regional calibration, aggregated calibration, and volume fraction calibration) were evaluated by model. performance, volume error, and runoff volume fractions of subbasins. The results showed that the high interdependency of model parameters affects the development of regional relationships. The model parameters regionalized in different basin scales were not transferable to one another due to different basin responses. The study found that regional calibration is suitable for simulating runoff of sites (100-10,000 km(2)), and volume fraction calibration is suitable for subbasins (14,000-50,000 km(2)). Lumped calibration managed to simulate runoff dynamics of lumped basins (65,000-180,000 km(2)) representing two or more aggregated subbasins. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyses the runoff generation processes in a small Mediterranean catchment (Can Vita catchment, 0.56 km(2)), using limited continuous data on water table and soil water potential dynamics along with rainfall and runoff data collected over 6 years. At daily scale, strong non-linearity between rainfall and runoff volume and the effect of the water table position on how rainfall and runoff volume relate were seen. The higher the water table, the greater the runoff for a given rainfall. The relationship between runoff and depth of water table was not straightforward: water table variations sometimes did not correlate with runoff changes, suggesting somewhat intricate hydrological behaviour. Soil water potential data alongside runoff and water table data showed the relatively frequent development of a perched saturation layer in the profile monitored. Examination of soil water potential and water table dynamics during a collection of representative floods helped to identify three types of characteristic hydrological behaviour during the year. Hydrographs corresponding to type 1 events (dry conditions), type 2 events (wetting-up transition) and type 3 events (wet conditions) had different characteristics: each was associated with different dominant runoff generation processes. Under dry conditions, runoff was generated essentially as infiltration excess runoff in tow permeable areas, whereas saturation excess runoff dominated during wetting-up and wet conditions. During wetting-up transition, saturated areas resulted from the development of scattered perched water tables, whereas in wet conditions they were linked to the rise of the shallow water table.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) radar interferometer satellite mission will provide unprecedented global measurements of water surface elevation (h) for inland water bodies. However, like most remote sensing technologies SWOT will not observe river channel bathymetry below the lowest observed water surface, thus limiting its value for estimating river depth and/or discharge. This study explores if remotely sensed observations of river inundation width and h alone, when accumulated over time, may be used to estimate this unmeasurable flow depth. To test this possibility, synthetic values of h and either cross-sectional flow width (w) or effectivewidth (We, inundation area divided by reach length) are extracted from 1495 previously surveyed channel cross-sections for the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, Rio Grande, and Ganges-Brahmaputra river systems, and from 62 km of continuously acquired sonar data for the Upper Mississippi. Two proposed methods (called "Linear" and "Slope-Break") are tested that seek to identify a small subset of geomorphically "optimal" locations where w or We covary strongly with h, such that they may be usefully extrapolated to estimate mean cross-sectional flow depth (d). While the simplest Linear Method is found to have considerable uncertainty, the Slope-Break Method, identifying locations where two distinct hydraulic relationships are identified (one for moderate to high flows and one for low flows), holds promise. Useful slope breaks were discovered in all four river systems, ranging from 6 (0.04%) to 242 (16%) of the 1495 studied cross-sections, assuming channel bathymetric exposures ranging from 20% to 95% of bankfull conditions, respectively. For all four rivers, the derived depth estimates from the Slope-Break Method have root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of <20% (relative to bankfull mean depth) assuming at least one channel bathymetry exposure of similar to 25% or greater. Based on historic discharge records and HEC-RAS hydraulic modeling, the Upper Mississippi and Rio Grande rivers experience adequate channel exposures at least similar to 60% and similar to 42% of the time, respectively. For the Upper Mississippi, so-called "reach-averaging" (spatial averaging along some predetermined river length) of native-resolution h and We values reduces both RMSE and longitudinal variability in the derived depth estimates, especially at reach-averaging lengths of similar to 1000-2000 m. These findings have positive implications for SWOT and other sensors attempting to estimate river flow depth and/or discharge solely from incomplete, remotely sensed hydraulic variables, and suggest that useful depth retrievals can be obtained within the spatial and temporal constraints of satellite observations.

AB The Budyko functions B-1(Phi(p))are dimensionless relationships relating the ratio E/P (actual evaporation over precipitation) to the aridity index Phi(p) = E-p/P (potential evaporation over precipitation). They are valid at catchment scale with E-p generally defined by Penman's equation. The complementary evaporation (CE) relationship stipulates that a decreasing actual evaporation enhances potential evaporation through the drying power of the air which becomes higher. The Turc-Mezentsev function with its shape parameter lambda, chosen as example among various Budyko functions, is matched with the CE relationship, implemented through a generalised form of the advection-aridity model. First, we show that there is a functional dependence between the Budyko curve and the drying power of the air. Then, we examine the case where potential evaporation is calculated by means of a Priestley-Taylor type equation (E-0) with a varying coefficient alpha(0). Matching the CE relationship with the Budyko function leads to a new transcendental form of the Budyko function B-1'(Phi(0)) linking E/P to Phi(0) = E-0/P. For the two functions B-1(Phi(p)) and B-1'(Phi(0) ) to be equivalent, the Priestley-Taylor coefficient alpha(0) should have a specified value as a function of the Turc-Mezentsev shape parameter and the aridity index. This functional relationship is specified and analysed.

AB [1] An investigation into landscape saturation has been carried out analytically using similarity parameters derived from topographic, soil, and climatic attributes. Three parameters (an input index (q/Z)(L/KS), convergence ratio (CR), and profile factor (B)) define the extent of hillslope saturation. From these, a single dimensionless parameter has been derived to describe the occurrence of saturation in planar, concave, and convex profile hillslope shapes, and with parallel, convergent, and divergent planforms. The relationship can be represented by a single dimensionless curve. The theory derived in this paper provides a basis for combining the individual parameters into a similarity criterion for saturation in landscapes. The theory and ensuing similarity hypothesis are applied to three natural catchments near Canberra, Australia, and are tested against observed rainfall-runoff data. The results support the validity of the similarity approach. There is a clear link between the distribution of hillslope similarity parameters and catchment saturation behavior.

AB Lake Chad is an endorheic lake in the Sahel region of Africa at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The lake, which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s, experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during February or March, though sometimes earlier or later. People along the shores of Lake Chad make their living fishing, farming, and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be, particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops. In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters, including rainfall, basin evapotranspiration, lake evapotranspiration, lake elevation, total surface water area, and the previous year's total surface water area, and develop equations for each dry season month (except November) linking total surface water area to the other parameters. The resulting equations allow the user to estimate the December average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late November, and to make the estimates for January to May in early December. Based on the results of a Leave One Out Cross Validation analysis, the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error ranging from 5.3 percent (for February estimates) to 7.6 percent (for May estimates).

AB The relationship between climate indices with Australian river streamflow (ASF) may provide valuable information for long-lead streamflow forecasting for Australian rivers. The current study examines the correlations between three climate indices (SST, 500 mb meridional wind -U-500 and 500 mb geopotential height-Z(500)) and 135 unimpaired ASF gauges for 1971-2011 using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. First, SVD method was applied to check the SST-ASF correlated regions of influence and then extended SST-ASF variabilities were used to determine the correlated regions within Z(500) and U-500 fields. Based on the teleconnection, the most correlated region (150 degrees E to 105 degrees W and 35 degrees S to 5 degrees N) was identified and its persistency was checked by lag analysis up to 2 years from seasonal to yearly time-scale. The results displayed positive correlation for the south and south-eastern part of Australia while negative correlation prevails in the north-eastern region (at 95% significance level). The most correlated region was found situated along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) axis which may be considered as a probable climate driver for ASF. The persistency of this region was checked by a separate climate indicator (mean vertical velocity-500 mb) and found prominent in dry period than the wet period. This persistent teleconnected region may be potentially useful for long-lead forecasting of ASF. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PREDICTION
AB Modeling of rainfall-runoff dynamics is one of the most studied topics in hydrology due to its essential application to water resources management. Recently, artificial intelligence has gained much popularity for calibrating the nonlinear relationships inherent in the rainfall-runoff process. In this study, the advantages of artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy system in continuous modeling of the daily and hourly behaviour of runoff were examined. Three different adaptive techniques were constructed and examined namely, Levenberg-Marquardt feed forward neural network Bayesian regularization feed forward neural network, and neuro-fuzzy. In addition, the effects of data transformation on model performance were also investigated. This was done by examining the performance of the three network architectures and training algorithms using both raw and transformed data. Through inspection of the results it was found that although the model built on transformed data outperforms the model built on raw data, no significant differences were found between the forecast accuracies of the three examined models. A detailed comparison of the overall performance indicated that the neuro-fuzzy model performed better than both the Levenberg-Marquardt-FFNN and the Bayesian regularization-FFNN. In order to enable users to process the data easily, a graphic user interface (GUI) was developed. This program allows users to process the rainfall-runoff data, to train/test the model using various input options and to visualize results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   dimension; kriging; multiple regression
ID MANAGEMENT
AB This study investigates possibilities for the regionalisation of flow components within large river basins. One main purpose is the derivation of an empirical relationship for the estimation of the average base flow index (i.e. the ratio of base flow to total flow, BFI), which can be included into simplified models in form of decision support systems aimed at rapid integrated water resources assessment. Based on results from the: hydrological models ARC/EGMO and HBV in 25 mesoscale sub basins of the macroscale Elbe River Basin, the modelled BFI is regionalised for the whole German part of the Elbe Basin, divided into 114 subbasins. For regionalisation of the average BFI multiple regression (MREG) and two geostatistical approaches (ordinary kriging (OK) and external drift kriging (EDK)) are applied using different physical catchment attributes and observed climate data as independent variables. The average base flow index is strongly related to topographical, pedological, hydrogeological and precipitation characteristics and less influenced by land cover/land use properties of the catchments. As indicated by cross validations, both EDK and MREG are suitable for regionalising the BFI with coefficients of determination of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively. Furthermore, the plausibility of the estimated BFI values is shown by comparisons with parameters calculated from statistical and fractal analysis of daily flow time series, which represent a strong relation to the regionalised BFI values.

AB A comprehensive climatology of fog events at Perth Airport was developed with the aim of improving the forecasting of fog through an enhanced understanding of its nature. From 2002 to 2019 (inclusive) the airport experienced 8.9 +/- 3.0 fog events per year with 96% of all events occurring in the cool season (from April to October inclusive). The fog events were ordered into different fog types, following a hierarchical classification method. Radiation fog were found to be the most prevalent in this region. A k-means clustering method was applied to 2300 UTC (0700 LST) observations at Perth Airport to divide the dataset into 5 different weather regimes. The majority of fog events occurred in a post-frontal/trough system with a high-pressure system to the west, bringing in moisture from the Indian Ocean. Perth Airport is located on a coastal plain with an escarpment 10 km to the east of the airport, roughly parallel to the coast and rising to about 300 m. In the 2002-2019 cool season period, 41% of fog events had northerly to easterly 10 m winds at 2300 UTC (0700 LST) while the 925 hPa winds were southerly to westerly. This compares with 15% of days with north to east winds at 10 m across all cool season days in the same period. These results support the current theory that fog often forms when nocturnal cooling on the coastal plain leads to increased stability in the near surface layer and a decoupling between the moist environmental westerlies and the surface flow at Perth airport. This allows the development of local circulations forced by the local topography.

AB For shallow lakes, the water exchange process is a crucial factor that affects lake eutrophication, which can be solved by a water diversion project (WDP). However, the water exchange process in shallow lakes is complex and affected by hydrological characteristics (the water level and inflow stream) and external forcing (the wind field). It is of profound significance to evaluate the process of lake water exchange by combining dynamic and static methods. In this study, for hydrological characterization, a Morlet wavelet analysis was used for the periodic analysis of 24-year water level data. The monthly discharge of the main rivers over three hydrological years was calculated by a hydrological frequency curve and water balance theory. The external wind field was studied by the wind sheltering coefficient to simulate an uneven distribution. The water age model and particle tracking model were coupled to explore the water exchange process of Dianchi Lake with the influence of two major WDPs. The results show that in each scenario, the distribution of the water age presents a radial distribution and decreases in age from the centre of the lake to the shore, and the largest proportion of the oldest water occurs without exception at the centre of Dianchi Lake. Moreover, the water mass in Dianchi Lake generally circulates counter clockwise around a circle of a fixed size. When the Niulanjiang Water Diversion Project (NWDP) and the Dianzhong Water Diversion Project (DWDP) are combined for water diversion, the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76% of the lake water volume, which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38%-52%.

ID CLIMATE; RAINFALL; ENTROPY; US; REGIONALIZATION; ROTATION; FUTURE; CYCLE
AB With climate change, precipitation variability is projected to increase. The present study investigates the potential interactions between watershed characteristics and precipitation variability. The watershed is considered as a functional unit that may impact seasonal precipitation. The study uses historical precipitation data from 370 meteorological stations over the last five decades, and digital elevation data from regional watersheds in the southwestern United States. This domain is part of the North American Monsoon region, and the summer period aune-July-August, JJA) was considered. Based on an initial analysis for 1895-2011, the JJA precipitation accounts, on average, for 22-43% of the total annual precipitation, with higher percentages in the arid part of the region. The unique contribution of this research is that entropy theory is used to address precipitation variability in time and space. An entropy-based disorder index was computed for each station's precipitation record. The JJA total precipitation and number of precipitation events were considered in the analysis. The precipitation variability potentially induced by watershed topography was investigated using spatial regionalization combining principal component and cluster analysis. It was found that the disorder in precipitation total and number of events tended to be higher in arid regions. The spatial pattern showed that the entropy-based variability in precipitation amount and number of events gradually increased from east to west in the southwestern United States. Regarding the watershed topography influence on summer precipitation patterns, hilly relief has a stabilizing effect on seasonal precipitation variability in time and space. The results show the necessity to include watershed topography in global and regional climate model parameterizations. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Wetting-induced soil structural changes: The theory of liquid phase
   sintering
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID GLASS POWDER COMPACTS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DENSIFICATION; INFILTRATION;
   DENSITY
AB Rapid wetting of structurally unstable soils causes aggregate disintegration and settlement near the soil surface, thereby reducing soil porosity and intake properties. Beneath the slaked surface layer where unsaturated flow conditions develop, structural changes driven mostly by capillary forces take place at slower rates. The collapse of structural voids in the sublayer is due to coalescence of aggregates into larger units. We propose to adopt a model of liquid phase sintering of glass compacts to describe wetting induced densification of aggregated soil. The analogy between these processes is based on the observations that (1) the reduction in soil strength upon wetting is similar to the effect of high temperatures on glass powders and (2) in both systems capillary forces induce viscous flow. A sintering model which assumes a porous medium with tractable geometry was modified to accommodate soil conditions. The model considers the reduction in the water-coated solid surface areas (i.e., water-air interfaces) as the energy source for the soil viscous flow. Data from wetting experiments of aggregated silt Ic,am were used to test the plausibility of the theory. The main unknown in the system was the viscosity of wet soil which was estimated to be in the range of 1.37 x 10(6) to 1.9 x 10(6) Pa s(-1). The use of solid matrix with tractable geometry and energy considerations should prove useful for other studies of the dynamics of soil structure.

AB Multi-objective requirements including water supply, hydropower generation, water-sediment regulation (WSR), and inner-river ecosystem maintenance should be fully valued in the operation of reservoirs located on a sediment-laden river. In order to balance the satisfaction of multiple objectives with intense competition and guarantee the primary requirements preferentially, this paper presents a novel framework that incorporates the recognition and classification of primary and secondary requirements of multiple operation targets, a set of principles for multi-objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs (MOSRR) following the theory of synergetics, and the optimization model construction of MOSRR considering the maximization synergetic degree of multi-objective. The Analytic Hierarchy Process and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are employed to determine the weight and solve the MOSRR model, respectively. MOSRR is applied to a system of cascade reservoirs along the Upper Yellow River in China considering climatic and hydrologic variability. The results from MOSRR are compared to those from a traditional multi-objective optimal operation model. It is found that the guarantee of multi-objective requirements from MOSRR have been improved visibly compare with the traditional model at the expense of a slight reduction in the hydropower generation (especially the secondary requirement of the energy output in the dry season). Also, MOSRR can mitigate the effects of runoff reduction through minimizing the damage of primary requirements, which is more appropriate for multi-objective reservoir operation with limited water in sediment-laden river. The proposed MOSRR framework can be applied to other large-scale reservoir systems with stiff competition in water resources.

AB Assessment of hydrological connectivity is a valuable tool for water management. It enables various environ-mental factors related to water-mediated transport of matter and energy within or between elements of a system to be identified and incorporated into hydrological models. The index of connectivity (IC) is widely used to quantify hydrological connectivity; however, it may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM), which is one of the common inputs, as pixel size modifies some basin parameters. Several DEMs available on open-access platforms, with spatial resolutions from 5 to 30 m (LiDAR, ALOS, MEC, ASTER, SRTM), were compared to identify differences between IC in two basins with contrasting environments (Site 1: steep slope terrain with warm-humid climate, and Site 2: gentle hill slopes with semi-arid climate). Differences in perimeters were analyzed using GLM Repeated Measures ANOVA, while for differences in IC, one-way ANOVA was used. Relationships between IC subtracted maps and basin parameters were explored with classification and regression trees (CART). Basin perimeters and IC varied as a function of DEM resolution, but environmental factors such as relief and land use/cover seemed to influence IC maps. Distance to sinks was one of the variables explaining spatial differences in IC between DEMs. The selection of DEM spatial resolution for hydrological connectivity analysis should be based on the characteristics of the study area, economic and technological issues, and whether the objectives can be met with the available DEM resolution.

AB Defining the catchment transit time distribution remains a challenge. Here, we used a new semi analytical physically-based integrated subsurface flow and advective dispersive particle movement model to assess the subsurface controls on subsurface water flow paths and transit time distributions. First, we tested the efficacy of the new model for simulation of the observed groundwater dynamics at the well-studied S-transect hillslope (Vastrabacken sub-catchment, Sweden). This system, like many others, is characterized by exponential decline in saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity with soil depth. The model performed well relative to a tracer-based estimate of transit time distribution as well as observed groundwater depth discharge relationship within 30 m of the stream. Second, we used the model to assess the effect of changes in the subsurface permeability architecture on flow pathlines and transit time distribution in a set of virtual experiments. Vertical patterns of saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity with soil depth significantly influenced hillslope transit time distribution. Increasing infiltration rates significantly decreased mean groundwater age, but not the distribution of transit times relative to mean groundwater age. The location of hillslope hydrologic boundaries, including the groundwater divide and no-flow boundary underlying the hillslope, changed the transit time distribution less markedly. These results can guide future decisions on the degree of complexity that is warranted in a physically-based rainfall runoff model to efficiently and explicitly estimate time invariant subsurface pathlines and transit time distribution.

AB The effects of soil properties on crop growth and yield have traditionally been analyzed using classical statistics methodologies. These methodologies do, however, not consider sampling position coordinates and assume independence between samples. This study had the objective of using the state-space approach, which considers sampling position, to evaluate and to discuss a spatial process using variables related to the soil-plant system. For this, six data sets were collected in a sugarcane experiment carried out on a Dark Red Latosol (Rhodic Kandiudalf), at Piracicaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The sugarcane was planted on a 0.21 ha field, comprising 15 rows, 100 m long, spaced 1.4 m apart, with three treatments (mulching, bare soil and straw burning before harvest) and four replicates, forming a transect of 84 points. In this way, the relationships between the number of canes per meter of row and available soil P, Ca and Mg, clay content and aggregate stability were studied using a first order state-space model. Results show that all of the used state-space equations described the spatial distribution of number of canes better than the equivalent multiple regression equations. It was also identified that the soil clay content spatial series has an effective contribution to describe the number of canes in this study, because it is related to the best performance in each different scenario.

AB The longitudinal profile of rivers in active orogenic belts records the competitive process occurring between erosion and uplift, and the knickpoint, as a unique sign, can support this. A series of distinctive knickpoints are distributed at different heights in the basin of the Layue River, which is a tributary located on the northwest side of the Yurlung Tsangpo Basin, China. By combining the stream power erosion model and field investigation, this paper explores the relationship among dams, knickpoints and the normalized steepness index (k(sn)). In addition to sporadic damming-type knickpoints, a 4 k knickpoint group located in the basin has attracted attention. Using the slope-area analysis method and the integration analysis method, paleo profile reconstruction of 14 tributaries and trunks was carried out to estimate the resulting paleo relief and net uplift. The results show that the topographic relief increases by 35.3-214.3% during the process in which the knickpoint entered into the basin and spread, which is the result of the growth and retreat of the knickpoint. Using the celerity model for the 4 k knickpoint group, 83.3% of the model knickpoints are less than 5 km away from the observed knickpoints, which indicates that the model is suitable for application in the Layue River Basin. And the migration rate of the knickpoint in the Layue Basin is 10.8-51.7 km/Ma at an initial setup time of 1.25-6 Ma.

AB This paper analyses the way in which the complex relationships among topography, climate, and forest canopy influence the spatiotemporal variability of accumulation and melting of snowpack in a subalpine valley. We used weekly to monthly snow course data and a numerical model (COUP) to estimate the snow water equivalent (SWE) at 16 sites distributed in the Alptal valley (Central Switzerland) from 1984 to 2004. From these SWE series, we derived indicators that represent the annual accumulation, the most intense annual melting events and the length of the period with snow cover. Generalized mixed linear models (GMLMs) were used to relate these indices to attitude and exposure to solar radiation, taking into account the interactions of both variables with the presence or absence of a forest cover. Regression analyses were carried out for the 20 analysed years and for specific years with particular climatic conditions during the accumulation or melting periods. On the basis of these results, we conclude that a small number of predictors are able to explain a large proportion of the observed SWE and snowmelt variability. The statistical analysis confirmed the role of a forest canopy in reducing snow accumulation. The reduction of the magnitude of snowpack below forest canopy will impact also in a lower amount of snow melted during the most intense thawing events. The role of forest in terms of the length of the snow cover season changes noticeably with attitude and exposure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Variability and possible teleconnections between annual maximum streamflow from the lower, the middle and the upper Yangtze River basin and Et Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are detected by continuous wavelet transform (CWT), cross-wavelet and wavelet coherence methods. The results show that: (1) different phase relations are found between annual maximum streamflow of the Yangtze River and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the lower, the middle and the upper Yangtze River basin. In-phase relations are detected between annual maximum streamflow of the lower Yangtze River and anti-phase relations are found in the upper Yangtze River. But ambiguous phase relations occur in the middle Yangtze River, showing that the middle Yangtze River basin is a transition zone. Different climatic systems control the upper and the lower Yangtze River. The upper Yangtze River is mainly influenced by the Indian summer monsoon and the lower Yangtze is mainly influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon; (2) as for the individual stations, different phase relations are found in the longer and the shorter periods, respectively. In the longer periods, the annual maximum streamflow is more influenced by climatic variabilities, white in the shorter periods, it is influenced by other factors, e.g. human activities. The results of the study provide valuable information for improving the long-term forecasting of the streamflow using its relationship with ENSO and the Indian Monsoon. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of hydrologic models to assess long-term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation. However, obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult. The goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time-varying, Landsat-derived vegetative values to parameterize an event-based, watershed-scale hydrologic model. This study was conducted on a small, instrumented grassland watershed in the USDA Agricultural Research Service operated Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern, Arizona. Cloud-free Landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996-2014. The Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite-based foliar cover rasters. These values were used to parameterize the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) for 26 rainfall-runoff events with corresponding observed data. Three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions (static, long-term mean, annual mean, and intra-annual values) were compared to a static literature-based scenario for evaluation. The linear relationship between field-measured foliar cover and SATVI showed statistically significant agreement with R-2 = 0.85 and p < 0.05. Simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature-based scenario, with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations. The methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed-scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long-term analysis.

AB The detection of preferential flow paths and the characterization of their hydraulic properties are major challenges in fractured rock hydrology. In this study, we propose to use temperature as a passive tracer to characterize fracture connectivity and hydraulic properties. In particular, we propose a new temperature tomography field method in which borehole temperature profiles are measured under different pumping conditions by changing successively the pumping and observation boreholes. To interpret these temperature-depth profiles, we propose a three step inversion-based framework. We consider first an inverse model that allows for automatic permeable fracture detection from borehole temperature profiles under pumping conditions. Then we apply a borehole-scale flow and temperature model to produce flowmeter profiles by inversion of temperature profiles. This second step uses inversion to characterize the relationship between temperature variations with depth and borehole flow velocities (Klepikova et al., 2011). The third inverse step, which exploits cross-borehole flowmeter tests, is aimed at inferring inter-borehole fracture connectivity and transmissivities. This multi-step inverse framework provides a means of including temperature profiles to image fracture hydraulic properties and connectivity. We test the proposed approach with field data obtained from the Ploemeur (N.W. France) fractured rock aquifer, where the full temperature tomography experiment was carried out between three 100 m depth boreholes 10 m apart. We identified several transmissive fractures and their connectivity which correspond to known fractures and corroborate well with independent information, including available borehole flowmeter tests and geophysical data. Hence, although indirect, temperature tomography appears to be a promising approach for characterizing connectivity patterns and transmissivities of the main flow paths in fractured rock.

AB Soil infiltrability plays a critical role in controlling soil erosion and enhancing water storage in arid and semi-arid areas. Presently, knowledge is lacking regarding the dynamic mechanism and characteristics of soil infiltration during long-term natural vegetation restoration. This study evaluated how soil infiltrability changes along a 79-year chronosequence of natural restoration from cropland to permanently restored grassland. A slope cropland (control) and five grasslands of successive age-classes (6-, 16-, 36-, 56-, and 79-year natural restoration treatments) were selected to establish a chronosequence on China's Loess Plateau. Soil infiltrability was measured under simulated rainfall conditions at three intensities (20, 40, and 60 mm/h) using a run off-on-out method. The steady-state infiltration rate (SIR) of the control treatment decreased with increasing intensity of rainfall while those of the natural restoration treatments showed a contrary tendency. With the extension of restoration period, the SIR was gradually increased while the runoff was decreased and the time-to-runoff and time-to-SIR were prolonged. The SIR had a significant negative exponential relationship with the restoration period under different rainfall conditions (P < 0.01). Soil infiltrability showed rapid increases within 16 year of natural restoration and slight changes thereafter. Soil parameters including SIR and the contents of macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) and organic matter were significantly correlated with each other (P < 0.01). Long-term natural restoration of grassland, especially for 16-year, significantly enhanced soil infiltrability and reduced soil erosion through organic matter accumulation and the resulting improvement of structural properties. This study provides reference data for describing hydrological parameters on the Loess Plateau. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI How might Australian rainforest cloud interception respond to climate
   change?

AB The lower and upper montane rainforests in northern Queensland receive significant amounts of cloud interception that affect both in situ canopy wetness and downstream runoff. Cloud interception contributes 5-30% of the annual water input to the canopy and this increases to 40-70% of the monthly water input during the dry season. This occult water is therefore an important input to the canopy, sustaining the epiphytes, mosses and other species that depend on wet canopy conditions. The potential effect of climate change on cloud interception was examined using the relationship between cloud interception and cloud frequency derived from measurements made at four different rainforest locations. Any given change in cloud frequency produces a greater change in cloud interception and this 'amplification' increases from 1.1 to 1.7 as cloud frequency increases from 5% to 70%. This means that any changes in cloud frequency will have the greatest relative effects at the higher altitude sites where cloud interception is greatest. As cloud frequency is also a major factor affecting canopy wetness, any given change in cloud frequency will therefore have a greater impact on canopy wetness at the higher altitude sites. These changes in wetness duration will augment those due to changes in rainfall and may have important implications for the fauna and flora that depend on wet canopy conditions. We also found that the Australian rainforests may be more efficient (by similar to 50% on average) in intercepting cloud water than American coniferous forests, which may be due to differences in canopy structure and exposure at the different sites.

AB Submarine groundwater discharge is investigated numerically for a confined aquifer considering three types of permeability distribution (uniform, anisotropic and heterogeneous lognormal) as well as for an aquifer in which a surface water body is embedded. The latter case corresponds to aquifers with lagoons, flat lakes or wetlands near the coast. The numerical simulations are performed using the code FAST-C(2D), developed by Holzbecher (1998). For the confined aquifer, the portion of recirculated seawater in submarine groundwater discharge and the length of the recirculation zone are investigated. The parameters influencing these variables in the case of homogeneous aquifer (isotropic or anisotropic) are discussed. Further, the validity of a linear relationship between the submarine groundwater discharge and the flux of terrestrial groundwater toward the sea, proposed by Destouni and Prieto (2003), is investigated. As far as possible, our results are compared with results presented by Smith (2004), which were obtained using different codes. The investigation of a heterogeneous model aquifer concerns the influence of the variability of the permeability distribution on the portion of recirculated seawater and is performed by means of Monte Carlo analyses. Finally, for coastal aquifers in which surface water bodies are embedded, the main flow features are investigated. Particularly, the pathway of terrestrial groundwater to the sea, the flux of groundwater of marine origin to the surface water body, the recirculation of seawater and the flux from the surface water body to the sea have been considered. The parameters influencing these fluxes, which are important for the transfer of pollutants and tracers from the groundwater to the surface water and to the near shore seawater, are discussed.

AB The Loess Plateau (LP) is a typical water-limited area. Since the revegetation plan started in 1999, the rapid growth of vegetation has not only significantly changed the local water cycle, but also probably affected regional groundwater drought. However, the effect of revegetation on groundwater drought remains largely unexplored. To this end, we isolated the groundwater anomalies from terrestrial water storage of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and soil moisture of the Global Land Data Assimilation System, and further used the drought severity index to characterize groundwater drought. The evolution characteristics of groundwater drought in the LP were analyzed, and the effect of revegetation plan on groundwater drought were explored. Results indicated that: (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2003 similar to 2015 in the LP was growing rapidly, meanwhile, groundwater storage significantly decreased (p < 0.01) and groundwater drought intensified in terms of its area and intensity; (2) compared with meteorological factors, NDVI is more strikingly correlated (p < 0.05) with groundwater drought on annual, seasonal and monthly scales, especially near the key areas of vegetation restoration; (3) the growth rate of vegetation is a dominant factor affecting groundwater drought in the LP, in which the groundwater consumption rate caused by vegetation dynamics in the significant area is higher than non-significant area. Our research results provide guidance for formulation scientific and sustainable ecological restoration policies in the LP, and also offer new ideas for the study of the relationship between vegetation and groundwater drought.

AB Hydraulic characteristics are important fundamental properties of fractured rock masses and involve various geoscience and engineering disciplines. The determination of the permeability tensor is the basic input of the equivalent continuum (EC) model for hydraulic behavior analysis. An analytical method to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses is developed based on the orientation and linear frequency of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction. The orientation and linear frequency of fractures can be easily sampled in practice, and the value of the permeability in some direction can be tested by a relatively cheap single-well pumping test. The key step of this method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions. In addition, an anisotropy index of permeability AI(p) is defined to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy. Some numerical experiments were conducted with the universal distinct element code (UDEC) to validate the developed method. The results show that (a) the predicted values are very close to the real ones; (b) for all cases of rock masses with equal-aperture fracture sets, the mean error rate of the permeabilities in 23 different directions is approximately 10%; (c) for rock masses with different-aperture fracture sets, the mean error rate increases from 8.6% to 28.9% as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4; and (d) therefore, the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid, especially for those rock masses in which the aperture ratios of the fracture sets are small (e.g., less than 3).

AB Salt dissolution occurs frequently during the drilling, water-flooding development and other operations of saline-lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, greatly changing the petrophysical properties of rocks. To understand the salt dissolution behavior and its effect on the rock structures, core-flooding and crushed sample soaking experiments are conducted on saline-lacustrine carbonate samples. Results indicate that ion concentration from core flooding experiments increases first and then decreases fast with time proceeding, while it has a positive e-based logarithmic relation with soaking time from sample soaking experiments. According to ion analysis, the main dissolved salt minerals include halite, anhydrite and glauberite. With the size increase of crushed samples, the dissolved mass is decreased, having a positive logarithmic relation with sample specific surface, and sample specific surface is logarithmically increased with soaking time. Rock capillary pressure curves get lower, and pore throat size distributions become wider than those before dissolution of salt minerals. Salt dissolution mainly affects the pore microstructure with size ranging from 0.01 to 10 mu m, while having little effect on nanopores < 0.01 mu m. Salt dissolution could make the clay swelling and fine migration, inhibiting the increment in porosity and permeability. In addition, rock permeability has a power relation with porosity during the dissolution, and a permeability-growth-controlling threshold porosity is observed, which indicates the transformation point of dissolution area from pore bodies to throats. Furthermore, a mathematical model for characterization of rock porosity and permeability evolution relationship is derived, which allows for rock microstructure, salt composition and dissolution, and clay composition and swelling behavior.

AB The relationship of sheet erosion rate (SE), slope gradient (S) and rainfall intensity (I), and hydraulic parameters, such as flow velocity (V), shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega) and unit stream power (P), was investigated to derive an accurate experimental model. The experiment was conducted at slopes of 12.23%, 17.63%, 26.8%, 36.4%, 40.4% and 46.63% under I of 48, 60, 90, 120, 138 and 150 mm h(-1), respectively, using simulated rainfall. Results showed that sheet erosion rate increased as a power function with rainfall intensity and slope gradient with R-2 = 0.95 and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) = 0.87. Sheet erosion rate was more sensitive to rainfall intensity than to slope gradient. It increased as a power function with flow velocity, which was satisfactory for predicting sheet erosion rate with R-2 = 0.95 and NSE = 0.81. Shear stress and stream power could be used to predict sheet erosion rate accurately with a linear function equation. Stream power (R-2 = 0.97, NSE = 0.97) was a better predictor of sheet erosion rather than shear stress (R-2 = 0.90, NSE = 0.89). However, a prediction based on unit stream power was poor. The new equation (i.e. SE = 7.5 x 10(12)S(1.43)I(3.04) and SE = 0.06 Omega - 0.0003 and SE = 0.011 tau - 0.01) would improve water erosion estimation on loess hillslopes of China.

   DESIGN
AB The Bayesian method has been increasingly applied to the inversion of seepage parameters owing to its superiority of considering the uncertainty in the inversion process. However, most of the current Bayesian inversion studies only focus on parameter uncertainty, ignoring the model structure error. In addition, existing research has mostly adopted a single machine learning algorithm or an ensemble of surrogates based on a single prediction performance indicator as a substitute for the seepage forward model and has not considered the interactions between multiple prediction performance indicators, thereby leading to poor accuracy. To address these issues, this study proposed an efficient Bayesian inversion method for seepage parameters using a datadriven error model and an ensemble of surrogates considering the interactions between prediction performance indicators. A data-driven error model based on Gaussian process regression was integrated into the Bayesian inversion model to modify the likelihood function for dealing with the model structure error. For determining the weight coefficients of the ensemble surrogates, the improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory based on the Hellinger distance and Deng entropy was proposed to fuse multiple prediction performance indicators and consider their interactions. Further, an ensemble of surrogates in conjunction with support vector regression, Kriging, and multivariate adaptive regression splines was constructed through weighted summation. The validity and accuracy of the proposed method were verified by applying it to a real hydropower station in China. The results showed that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of Bayesian inversion of seepage parameters. The proposed method therefore serves as a new basis for the inversion of seepage parameters and can be applied to parameter inversion in other related fields.

AB We measure and model the unsteady, axisymmetric response of an unconfined aquifer to delayed, arbitrary recharge. Water table drainage follows the initial elastic aquifer response, as modeled for uniform, instantaneous recharge by Zlotnik and Ledder [Zlotnik, V., Ledder, G., 1992. Groundwater flow in a compressible unconfined aquifer with uniform circular recharge. Water Resources Research 28(6), 1619-1630] and delayed drainage by Moench [Moench, A.F., 1995. Combining the Neuman and Boulton models for flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer. Ground Water 33(3), 378-384]. We extend their analyses with a convolution integral that models the delayed response of an aquifer to infiltration from a circular infiltration basin. The basin routes the hydrograph to the water table with a decay constant dependent on a Brooks and Corey [Brooks, R.H., Corey, A.T., 1966. Properties of porous media affecting fluid flow. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division ASCE 92(2), 61-88] unsaturated permeability exponent. The resulting closed form model approaches Neuman's [Neuman, S.P., 1972. Theory of flow in unconfined aquifers considering delayed response of the water table. Water Resources Research 8(4), 1031-1045] partially penetrating pump test equation for a small source radius, instantaneous, uniform drainage and a shallow screen section. Irrigation pump data at a weR characterized part of the Plymouth-Carver Aquifer in southeastern Massachusetts calibrate the small source model, while infiltration data from the closed drainage system of State Route 25 calibrate the infiltration basin model. The calibrated permeability, elasticity, specific yield, and permeability exponent are plausible and consistent for the pump and infiltration data sets. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) has significantly increased under recent climate and vegetation changes. Discriminating the primary driver of ETa variation would improve our knowledge of the interaction between regional hydrological and ecological systems. In this study, a reliable ETa dataset was obtained by validating three ETa products from different sources with in-situ observations. We modified the elasticity-coefficient method using partial correlation, and compared it with the traditional regression-based method in estimating ETa variation in northwest China (NWC). On the basis of the magnitude and the sensitivity of ETa variation, results revealed that annual ETa significantly increased (2.32 mm/yr, p <= 0.05) in NWC over 1982-2015 with over 75% of the vegetated area showing an increasing trend. Robust in capturing spatial variation patterns in ETa the partial correlation coefficient-based elasticity method was able to explain 83% of the annual variation in ETa. Precipitation, temperature, and NDVI were the most important factors controlling the increase in annual ETa from 1982 to 2015. Regionally, precipitation was the dominant factor and contributed 73% to the variation of annual ETa in the vegetated NWC. However, the contribution rates of precipitation varied across the different land cover types and ranged from 31% in irrigated cropland to 81% in the steppe. Potential uncertainty in the attribution of causative factors could arise in selecting the separation method and potential driving factors. Establishing a reliable relationship between ETa and potential driving factors should be confirmed with observations. The present study's results can guide sustainable water resources management and ecological restoration in water limited regions.

AB Understanding of turbidity, an indicator of water quality, is of great importance in cities and can have significant implications for human society. Many users are interested in mapping turbidity using remote sensing tools for long-term and large-scale monitoring. This study aims to derive turbidity maps in an urbanizing city and to identify the driving factors for better decision-making and water quality management. Taking Wuhan, the most rapidly urbanizing metropolis in central China, as an instance, the water turbidity is monitored using Landsat observations from 1987 to 2019, and the relationships of turbidity and climatic/human factors are examined. Climatic factors are represented by meteorological conditions (rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and water vapor pressure) and human factors are characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and impervious surface area (ISA). The results demonstrated that: (1) the seasonal mean turbidity increased from spring to summer (34.28 NTU to 36.27 NTU), decreased in autumn (25.04 NTU), and increased again in winter (37.20 NTU), and the variations were related to changes in rainfall; and (2) the annual mean turbidity was fluctuatingly stable during 1987-2004 and decreased by 1 NTU/yr. since 2005. The decline of water turbidity was highly correlated to the increase of NDVI and ISA with p values < 0.01. The study indicates that meteorological conditions affect seasonal variations in turbidity, while human factors have long-term impacts. A cautious approach to human activities during urbanization is needed to achieve a balance between water quality protection and the city's developments.

AB The management of water resources system and energy system belongs to different decision-making departments, and there is a certain hierarchical relationship between them. Optimizing the configuration of regional-scale water and energy systems from a global perspective, and considering the correlations between water resources shortage risk and energy shortage risk as well as their joint-risk interaction, can improve the accuracy and efficiency of management decisions. This study aims to propose a copula-based interval two-level programming (CITP) method by integrating a copula-based interval stochastic programming (CISP) method and two-level programming (TP) method. CITP cannot only balance the goals and preferences among different decision-making levels but also analyze the risk interactions between water resources availability and electricity demand. The CITP method is then applied to planning the energy-water nexus system (EWNS) of Henan Province (China), where various decision-making levels and diverse risk-interaction scenarios are analyzed. Results reveal that: during the planning horizon, a) the total electricity-generation amounts can change by 7.31 x 10(3) GWh from S1 to S5; b) the future electricity-supply structure will toward a more sustainable aspect, and the electricity generated from gas-fired, hydro and wind power can increase by 6.2 x 10(3) GWh, 3.7 x 10(3) GWh and 5.8 x 10(3) GWh, respectively. Results can provide decision supports for the coordinated development of regional-scale EWNS management among water, energy, economy and society as well as environment.

AB Temporal and spatial monitoring play a significant role in evaluating and examining the riverbank morphology and its spatiotemporal changes. Unlike the terrestrial laser scanners, other previously used methods such as satellite images, total station surveying, and erosion pins have limited application to quantify the small-scale bank variations due to the lack of rapid survey and resolution in data acquisition. High cost, lack of availability, specialized equipment and hard movement of laser scanners make it necessary to develop new accurate, economical and easily available methods. The present study aims to test the Kinect photogrametric technology for measuring and assessing riverbank variations in laboratory environment. For this purpose, three models of layered soil blocks for three different levels of groundwater (i.e. 24, 34 and 44 cm) were designed to investigate the seepage erosion behavior experimentally. The results indicate the high accuracy of Kinect in measuring the bank erosion cavity dimensions (i.e., 0.5% error) with high spatial resolution data (i.e. 300,000 points per frame). The high speed of Kinect in riverbank scanning enables the analysis of time variations of mechanisms such as seepage erosion which occurs rather rapidly. The results confirmed that there is a power relationship between the seepage gradient and the time of the bank failure with a determination coefficient of 0.97. Moreover, an increase in the level of groundwater on the riverbank increases the rate of undercutting retreat that caused more rapid failure of the riverbank. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The frequency of rain-on-snow (ROS) hydrologic events, which produce high runoff volumes and lead to large-scale flooding and avalanching, are likely to change in the future as the types and timing of precipitation change. The relationship between ROS precipitation events and peak daily flow events >= 1-year return were examined for historical and future runoff affected by climate change within the Santiam River Basin, Oregon. Historical streamflow records and modeled historical and future streamflow projections were analyzed for three sites across three elevation zones defined by the dominant precipitation types; rain, rain and snow transition, and snow. The results illustrate that, across elevation zones, historical peak daily flows >= 1-year return have a high frequency (>60%) of association with ROS. The historical association between peak daily flows and ROS is highest within the transient rain and snow elevation band (350-1100 m), with 80% and 100% of >= 1 and >= 5-year return peak flows associated with ROS, respectively. In a future with increased air temperature due to climate change, our results indicate that a decrease in the frequency of high peak flow ROS events will occur in the low and middle elevation zones while the frequency of ROS associated peak flows will increase in high elevation areas. The transition of winter precipitation from snow to rain is predicted to increase peak daily flows <5-10-year return interval and decrease peak daily flows >= 10-year return in the middle to high elevation zones.

AB Peatland ecosystem processes are strongly influenced by hydrology linked to climate change. However, how transpiration, as major water loss pathway in closed peatland, responds to climate change and then regulates ecosystem water balance that remains poorly understood. Here, we reported an 18,000-year fossil phytolith record from an herbaceous community-dominated mountain peatland in central China to reconstruct climate changes and vegetation evolution and reveal the interactions between regional climate changes and peatland ecosystem. The abundance of bulliform phytoliths-a silicified type of cells that regulate the movements of plant leaves to reduce light exposure and transpiration rate-shows close correlations with the Holocene climate variations with higher bulliform abundance in response to warm-dry climate (11,500-9600 cal yr BP; 7500-3000 cal yr BP) and lower values associated with cold-wet climate (13,000-11,500 cal yr BP; 3000 cal yr BP-present). Spectral analysis reveals that bulliform abundance and reconstructed climate vary with a major similar to 1000-year periodicity during the Holocene, suggesting a possible causal relationship to solar activity. A high bulliform abundance and warm-dry climate correspond with enhanced solar activity, and vice versa. We interpret that the resultant leaf water deficit resulted from greater light interception, high temperature and drought promoted the production of bulliform cells to fold leaf for water conservation, which is an effective protective mechanism of peatland grasses from the environmental stress. These results expand our understanding of how grass-dominated peatland plant water regulation recorded by bulliform phytoliths responds to solar radiation and local hydroclimate during geological period.

AB There is a need to quantify the hydrologic performance of vegetated roadside swales (drainage ditches) as stormwater control measures (SCMs). To quantify their infiltration performance in both the side slope and the channel of the swale, a model has been developed for coupling a Green-Ampt-Mein-Larson (GAML) infiltration submodel with kinematic wave submodels for both overland flow down the side slope and open channel flow for flow in the ditch. The coupled GAML submodel and overland flow sub model has been validated using data collected in twelve simulated runoff tests in three different highways located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, MN.
   The percentage of the total water infiltrated into the side slope is considerably greater than into the channel. Thus, the side slope of a roadside swale is the main component contributing to the loss of runoff by infiltration and the channel primarily conveys the water that runs off the side slope, for the typical design found in highways. Finally, as demonstrated in field observations and the model, the fraction of the runoff/rainfall infiltrated (V*(i)) into the roadside swale appears to increase with a dimensionless saturated hydraulic conductivity (K*(s)), which is a function of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, rainfall intensity, and dimensions of the swale and contributing road surface. For design purposes, the relationship between V*(i) and K*(s) can provide a rough estimate of the fraction of runoff/rainfall infiltrated with the few essential parameters that appear to dominate the results.

AB Environment isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and Cl/Br ratios in groundwater have been used to trace groundwater recharge and geochemical processes for arsenic contamination in Datong Basin. The arsenic concentrations of groundwater samples ranged from 0.4 to 434.9 mu g/L. with the average of 51.2 mu g/L, which exceeded China's drinking water standard (10 mu g/L). All the groundwater samples are plotted on or close to the meteoric water line of the delta O-18 vs. delta H-2 plot, indicating their meteoric origin. The relationship between delta O-18 values and Cl/Br ratios and Cl concentrations demonstrate that leaching and mixing are the dominant processes affecting the distribution of high arsenic groundwater in this area. The observed non-linearity in the trend between delta O-81 and arsenic concentration is due to combined effects of mixing and leaching. The similarity of the trend in Cl/Br ratios and delta O-18 values for high arsenic groundwater demonstrate that extensive leaching of irrigation return and salt flushing water flow could be the dominant process driving arsenic mobilization in the groundwater system. Moreover, the long term irrigation practice can cause the drastic change of the biogeochemical and redox condition of in the aquifer system, which in turn promotes the mobilization of arsenic. Therefore, groundwater pumping for irrigation in this area of waterborne endemic arsenic poisoning should be under strict control to protect groundwater quality in this area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Free convection limit (FCL) approaches to estimate surface fluxes are of interest given the evidence that they may extend up to near neutral stability conditions. For measurements taken in the inertial sublayer, the formulation based on surface renewal theory and the analysis of small eddies (SASE) to estimate the sensible heat flux (H) was extended to latent heat flux (LE) with the aim to derive their FCL approaches. For sensible heat flux (H-FCL), the input requirements are traces of the fast-response (such as 10-20 Hz) air temperature and the zeroplane displacement. For latent heat flux (LEFCL), input requirements are fast response traces of water vapor density, mean temperature of the air, the available net surface energy (Rn-G, where Rn and G are the net radiation and soil heat flux, respectively) and the zero-plane displacement. Taking eddy covariance (EC) as a reference method, the performance of the FCL method was tested over a growing cotton field that involved three contrasting surfaces: partly mulched bare soil, a sparse canopy and a homogeneous canopy. Using traces at 10 Hz and 20 Hz, H-FCL overestimated and underestimated the EC sensible heat flux (H-EC), respectively. In general, LEFCL tended to slightly underestimate LEEC. The surface energy balance closure show that (H-EC+ LEEC) underestimated (Rn-G) in a range of 19% (homogeneous canopy) and 8% (sparse canopy). Given that, in general (H-FCL+LEFCL) was closer to (Rn-G) than (H-EC + LEEC), the FCL method may be recommended for field applications, especially when the wind speed is not available.

AB The urban drainage model is an important tool for the management and decision-making around an urban drainage network. Owing to urban drainage networks' complex distribution, existing model analysis methods have gradually exposed problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information, weak coupling and analytical capacity of multi-source heterogeneous data, and poor human-computer interaction. By coupling an urban drainage model with 3D GIS technology and 3D visualization technology, this study presents a 3D dynamic visualization method of an urban drainage model (3DDVM-UDM). A case study from Chaohu, China, is used to demonstrate the method. The environmental information and distributions of pipe network objects in 3D space were presented. The urban drainage model can be edited and simulated in the 3D environment, and a 2D flooding simulation method was also established. Multiple model results were dynamically and simultaneously visualized in the pipe network entity models. By coupling and comparing the model results under different rainfall return periods, various information was intuitively analyzed, such as the water level and water quality differences of each pipe and node, and the spatial distribution differences of fully filled pipes, overflowed nodes and buildings influenced by node overflow. The operation state of a drainage pipe network can be systematically analyzed by intuitively combining with the attribute information of a pipe network, 3D spatial information and other relevant data. This study provides a feasible theory and method to assist in environmental management and decision-making, to facilitate communication between different fields, and to promote a shift in analysis from 2D to the combination of 2D and 3D.

AB Satellite-based products can provide valuable information for model calibrations and evaluations. However, effectively and efficiently constraining hydrological models with both satellite-based information and streamflow measurements remains a challenge. Here, a parallel computing-based and spatially stepwise strategy that enables separate optimizations of different objective functions in a spatially distributed and parallel manner was proposed for model calibration with streamflow observations and satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET). The new calibration strategy (M5) was tested with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the upper Heihe River basin of China, a mountainous watershed on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The performance of M5 was evaluated and compared with two single-variable calibration strategies, i.e., streamflow-only calibration and ET-only calibration, and with two multivariate calibration methods, i.e., joint calibration and stepwise calibration. Results indicate that M5 achieves the best model performance among the five calibration strategies in reproducing temporal variations of streamflow and ET. Moreover, M5 improves the simulation of the spatial pattern of ET and attains a higher spatial efficiency than the other calibration strategies. M5 also exhibits a higher computational efficiency, with a magnitude up to 2 times greater than the other calibration strategies, due to the application of parallel computing. Further analysis demonstrates that the new calibration strategy can lead to a synergic relationship between the simulation accuracy of streamflow and ET, underscoring the added value of satellite-based products for model calibrations.

AB Understanding the tradeoffs between water yield and ecosystem productivity is important for developing strategies for large scale ecological restoration worldwide. This study focused on a national forest protection project in the Upper Yangtze River Basin where a logging ban was implemented in 1998. We used a hydrologic model and remote sensing data to study the interactions between water and carbon cycles along elevation gradients in the Minjiang watershed (MJ), where extensive deforestation and reforestation have occurred in the past seven decades. Average annual evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2000 to 2015 were estimated as 429 mm yr(-1), 555 mm yr(-1), and 1002 g.C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. ET decreased sharply and consistently with increasing elevation, whereas GPP only decreased significantly in high elevation areas (i.e., > 3,000 m), resulting in divergent trends of water use efficiency (WUE) with elevation. Evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) contributed 28% of water yield and 37% of GPP at the watershed scale, while grassland (GRA) also contributed 28% of water yield, but only 20% of total watershed GPP. Moreover, runoff coefficients showed strong negative correlations with GPP, suggesting a general trade-off relationship between water yield and ecosystem productivity in MJ. Our results suggest that vegetation composition and elevation played a key role in determining the relative ecological benefits for carbon and water in the study watershed with a complex terrain.

AB Streaming potentials are produced by the coupling between the water flow and the electrical current generated by the drag of electrical charges within the pore water of the media. This electrokinetic coupling is strongly influenced by the hydraulic properties that control groundwater flow (permeability, saturation and pressure head). Under unsaturated conditions, hydrogeologic studies have widely established that the relationships of permeability and saturation with pressure head are different for drainage and imbibition experiments. The hysteresis phenomenon present on these properties produces a hysteretic behaviour on the streaming potential which has been recently observed in experimental data. Hysteresis can be explained by the presence of irregularities in the pore geometry of the media which affects the water flow and, therefore, the excess charge density that is effectively dragged by the flow. In this study, we present a physically-based analytical model to describe the hysteresis phenomenon in the estimates of the effective excess charge density. Under the assumptions of a porous medium represented by a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with throats and a fractal pore size distribution, hysteretic curves are obtained for the effective excess charge density as a function of pressure head using a flux averaging technique. These analytical expressions are closed-form and depend on the medium petrophysical and chemical properties. The predictions of the proposed model are consistent with laboratory data from drainage-imbibition experiments. These results open up exciting possibilities for studies involving water movement and processes in the vadose zone.

AB Improved hydrological processes simulation and identification of determinants are urgently needed in risk management to reduce socio-economic losses resulting from polder water problems. This paper improved the lowland Polder Hydrology and Phosphorus modelling System (called PHPS2.0) by coupling the PHPS, Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), and Integrated Catchments model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P). Then, based on the PHPS2.0 and data collected from the Jianwei polder in southeastern China, a boosted regression tree (BRT) algorithm was used to explore the key factors determining the temporal variations in polder discharge and phosphorus export. The results showed that PHPS2.0 achieved excellent agreements between the simulated and observed discharge, surface water and phosphorus. The model performance was significantly improved because field-scale phosphorus dynamics were considered. The water and phosphorus balances exhibited substantial seasonal changes, especially in terms of fertilization, crop harvest, and discharge. The temporal change in catchment discharge mainly depended on precipitation and evaporation, which accounted for 63.7% of the discharge variations. In contrast, the temporal variation in phosphorus export was determined by the crop cover and fertilizer application, which accounted for 75.4% of the phosphorus variation. To mitigate the phosphorus loss to downstream freshwater, it is recommended to remain crop residues, reduce the overuse of phosphorus chemical fertilizers, and draft emergency plans. This study expands the knowledge of the relationship between polder environmental factors and hydrological processes and provides guidance for pollution controls.

AB Small and medium river basins may frequently suffer from the destructive hydrological extremes (e.g., floods). However, the common problem in such regions is a lack of long-term historical observations. Meteorological and hydrological station networks in some river basins in China were newly-built only a few years ago, and it is infeasible to estimate hydrological parameters from calibration and validation with a long time period directly. This paper aims to develop a method to estimate the feasible hydrological parameters based on rainfall patterns in such regions. Digital Yellow River Integrated Model (DYRIM) is adopted as the hydrological model, and the feasible hydrological parameters can be estimated based on limited rainfall-runoff events. First, for each rainfall-runoff event, the parameters are independently calibrated with the observed rainfall and hydrological data using a double-layer parallel system. Then, the performances of the simulation results are comprehensively evaluated, and the value ranges of the parameters can be obtained. Finally, the statistical relationships between hydrological parameters and rainfall patterns (i.e., amount and intensity) are established, which are expressed by the statistical equations and the distribution of hydrological parameters with the rainfall patterns. From a sample demonstration, it is concluded that this parameter estimation method will be useful to estimate the feasible hydrological parameters for future rainfall-runoff events in river basins with no long-term historical observations.

AB Hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (Ss) are closely related to porosity, the compressibility of aquifer skeleton, connectivity of pores, sorting of the grains, and many others. These well-known relationships promote the investigation of the correlation between spatially varying K and Ss values and their sensitivity to the overlying materials stresses in heterogeneous aquifers. However, the costs of the field experiments for this investigation limit us to a laboratory heterogeneous sandbox aquifer. Before the laboratory experiments, we conducted numerical experiments to verify our tools and approaches. Specifically, we tested the ability of the recently developed hydraulic tomography (HT) for mapping K and Ss fields in two cases. One case in which Ss field was correlated with the K field, and the other was uncorrelated. With the assurance of the ability of our approaches, the laboratory experiments mimicking the numerical ones followed. Accurate drawdown predictions of different flow events in the laboratory experiments further guarantee the reliability of the estimated detailed K and Ss fields. The estimated K and Ss fields reveal that the Ss field's variability is much less significant than K and has much longer correlation scales. Further, the K distribution is closely related to the distribution of sand grain sizes in the sandbox, while Ss is not. Moreover, Ss estimates show a decreasing trend with depth. This trend does not exist in K estimates, indicating that Ss is highly sensitive to overburden stresses and K is not. Lastly, there is no clear spatial correlation between K and Ss, and the variability of Ss is critical in predicting the transient behavior of groundwater flow.

AB Vulnerability analysis is crucial to assess natural hazard risk. Methods for vulnerability assessment include indices as well as vulnerability curves. Vulnerability curves make use of empirical data to show the relationship between the process intensity and the resulting degree of loss on each affected building whereas vulnerability indices are based on a number of indicators representing building characteristics and their surroundings. In the present paper, damage data from two relatively recent torrential events in the European Alps are used to compare results using a vulnerability curve (Beta model) and a physical vulnerability index (PVI). Following the appli-cation of both methods, their strengths and weaknesses are outlined. Vulnerability curves constitute a valuable quantitative method for the assessment of physical vulnerability but, in the present study, they tend to over-estimate damages. On the other hand, vulnerability indices better support the understanding of local-scale damage patterns but they require detailed data and further research on weighting and indicator selection. The study leads to the conclusion that both methods complement each other providing better insights into the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to torrential hazards. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the two approaches are related to the required data. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is carried out showing that process intensity is a key variable for the assessment of vulnerability, whereas, differences in the calculation of the degree of loss based on different building values are less important. Finally, the paper gives clear recom-mendations for improved event and damage documentation and provides an outlook on future needs in vulnerability assessment, including constant updating of both methods based on recent events.

AB In this study, a Bayesian-neural-network-based factorial analysis (abbreviated as BNN-FA) method is developed for quantifying the effects of multiple factors on inflow from the Syr Darya to the Aral Sea (abbreviated as ISA). BNN-FA cannot only reflect the complex relationship between inputs and outputs, but also reveal the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors. BNN-FA is applied to the downstream of the Syr Darya river basin, where effects of human-activity, hydrological, and ecological factors are analyzed. Results reveal that (i) during 1960-1991, the main factors affecting ISA are: agricultural water consumption of Uzbekistan (31.2%) > agricultural water consumption of Kazakhstan (23.8%) > agricultural water consumption of Tajikistan (14.3%) > reservoir water storage (10.6%) > evapotranspiration (7.5%); interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries (i.e. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan) and interactions between evapotranspiration and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on ISA; (ii) during 1992-2015, the main factors are: agricultural water consumption of Uzbekistan (21.4%) > upstream inflow (19.0%) > agricultural water consumption of Kazakhstan (16.0%) > agricultural water consumption of Tajikistan (14.2%) > industrial water consumption of Uzbekistan (9.4%); interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between upstream inflow and agricultural water consumptions have important effects on ISA; (iii) the contribution of agricultural activity decreases from 69.3% in 1960-1991 to 51.6% in 1992-2015. The findings are helpful for decision makers to formulate effective strategies to increase the runoff of the Syr Darya and restore the eco-environment of the Aral Sea.

AB The interactions between surface water, the vadose zone, groundwater, and vegetation are governed by complex feedback mechanisms. Numerical models simulating these interactions are essential in quantifying these processes. However, the notorious lack of field observations results in highly uncertain parameterizations. We suggest a new type of observation data to be included in the calibration data set for hydrological models simulating interactions with vegetation: Tree rings as a proxy for transpiration. We use the lower Tarim River as an example site for our approach. In order to forestall the loss of riparian ecosystems from reduced flow over a 300 km reach of the lower Tarim River, the Chinese government initiated periodical, ecological water releases. The water exchange processes in this region were simulated for a cross-section on the lower reaches of the Tarim River using a numerical model (Hydro-GeoSphere) calibrated against observations of water tables, as well as transpiration estimated from tree ring growth. A predictive uncertainty analysis quantifying the worth of different components of the observation dataset in reducing the uncertainty of model predictions was carried out. The flow of information from elements of the calibration dataset to the different parameters employed by the model was also evaluated. The flow of information and the uncertainty analysis demonstrate that tree ring records can significantly improve confidence in modeling ecosystem dynamics, even if these transpiration estimates are uncertain. To use the full potential of the historical information encapsulated in the Tarim River tree rings, however, the relationship between tree ring growth, and transpiration rates has to be studied further.

AB Catchment salt mass balances and export/import ratios were calculated for 55 gauging stations in nine major catchments across the Queensland Murray-Darling Basin (QMDB), Australia. Salt inputs were comprised of atmospheric, groundwater and inter-basin transfer contributions, while exports were derived from model runs calibrated to streamflow data and flow-salt relationships. Catchment atmospheric salt inputs were larger than groundwater inputs in the major catchments, with the exception of the Condamine catchment. Across the whole QMDB, the magnitude of atmospheric and groundwater inputs is potentially equal. Average annual streamflow salt export is generally much less than salt input, even when atmospheric inputs alone are considered, and is strongly influenced by episodic, large events. The exceptions to this are some smaller salt-affected upland catchments in the eastern QMDB where flow is more continual (i.e. baseflow occurs) and stream salinity is higher - a result of long-term land use change impacts. Variability in catchment salt export/import ratio (E/I) as a result of different calculation methods for both inputs and outputs creates a wide range in possible E/I for some sites, but trends remain the same. Losses of stream water to floodplains, seepage and extractions in lower portions of catchments leads to significant reductions in E/I with distance downstream. It appears that in general, the natural status of the QMDB is one of salt accumulation and significant hydrologic changes - as represented through salt mass balance calculations - are largely confined to the eastern half of the Basin, although further change may yet express in the landscape.

AB The admixture of loess in soils formed in sandy parent materials has considerable impact on pedogenesis and soil ecological functions. This study aimed to evaluate these effects on soil hydrology by quantifying the relationships between loess content and soil hydrological properties in a sandstone landscape covered by Pleistocene periglacial slope deposits in central Europe. Studied properties were saturated soil water capacity, field capacity, permanent wilting point, available water capacity, macro-porosity, matrix porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The effect of loess addition on soil hydrological properties differed between topsoil (pedogenic A horizons) and subsoil (pedogenic B and C horizons). In the subsoil, the studied soil hydrological properties were mainly controlled by loess content. By contrast, in the topsoil the effects of loess content on soil hydrological properties were largely masked by the effects of soil organic matter (reflected by soil organic carbon, SOC). The enhancing effect of SOC on soil hydrological properties was most prominent for saturated soil water capacity and was also significant for all other parameters except permanent wilting point. After the effects of SOC were accounted for, the residual effects of loess on soil hydrological properties were the same in both topsoils and subsoils, with one exception: Saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with increasing loess content for subsoils, but not for topsoils. This study highlighted the ecohydrological significance of loess admixture in coarse-textured soils, especially for subsoils with low SOC contents. However, for coarse-textured topsoils, SOC content plays the dominant role in affecting soil hydrological properties.

AB Rapid urbanization has great potential to adversely impact the local hydrological cycle, the environment, and ecosystems, as well as trigger severe problems, such as urban flooding, waterlogging, and water contamination. Understanding runoff generation mechanisms in urban areas helps identify the impacts of urbanization on runoff response and better simulate urban floods. However, in most urban hydrological models, urban surfaces are coarsely classified into impervious and pervious ones, which likely ignores differential rainfall-runoff responses of different urban surfaces and leads to large discrepancies between simulated and observed runoff. Here we developed the TVGM_Urban model, a new urban hydrological model based on the time variant gain model (TVGM), that represents nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationships for different urban surfaces. We applied the model to the Fenghuangcheng region of Shenzhen City, China and compared the results to those of two commonly used urban hydrological models: the Horton infiltration and Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCSCN) model. For each of these models, we conducted model uncertainty analysis using the GLUE method. The results showed that the TVGM_Urban model outperformed the other two models in terms of total runoff and peak flow. This could be due to the consideration of different land covers and both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation in the TVGM_Urban model. In addition, the uncertainty analysis indicated better performance of the TVGM_Urban model in reducing structural uncertainty and prediction uncertainty. This study highlights the need to account for detailed land covers and different runoff generation mechanisms in urban hydrological modeling.

AB The temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation. This study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework. Two parameters of the monthly model, i.e., k and m, are assumed to be time-variant at different months. Based on the hydrological data set from 121 MOPEX catchments in the United States, we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters (k and m) and catchment properties (NDVI and frequency of rainfall events, alpha). The results show that parameter k is positively correlated with NDVI or alpha, while the correlation is opposite for parameter m, indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m. The multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between 8 and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m. Based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time-variant parameters and NDVI, the mean annual parameter s is downscaled to monthly k and m. The results show that it has lower NSEs than these from model with time-variant k and m being calibrated through SCE-UA, while for several study catchments, it has higher NSEs than that of the model with constant parameters. The proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydro-climatic data at short time steps are considered essential to model the rainfall-runoff relationship, especially for short-duration hydrological events, typically flash floods. Also, using fine time step information may be beneficial when using or analysing model outputs at larger aggregated time scales. However, the actual gain in prediction efficiency using short time-step data is not well understood or quantified. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the performance of hydrological modelling is improved by short time-step data, using a large set of 240 French catchments, for which 2400 flood events were selected. Six-minute rain gauge data were available and the GR4 rainfall-runoff model was run with precipitation inputs at eight different time steps ranging from 6 min to 1 day. Then model outputs were aggregated at seven different reference time scales ranging from sub-hourly to daily for a comparative evaluation of simulations at different target time steps. Three classes of model performance behaviour were found for the 240 test catchments: (i) significant improvement of performance with shorter time steps; (ii) performance insensitivity to the modelling time step; (iii) performance degradation as the time step becomes shorter. The differences between these groups were analysed based on a number of catchment and event characteristics. A statistical test highlighted the most influential explanatory variables for model performance evolution at different time steps, including flow auto correlation, flood and storm duration, flood hydrograph peakedness, rainfall-runoff lag time and precipitation temporal variability.

AB The practice of stormwater infiltration is widely used to reduce the amount of urban stormwater runoff delivered to drainage systems and receiving waters. In theory, the practice recharges groundwater, leading to increased urban stream baseflow. In reality, however, little is known about the fate of infiltrated stormwater. Because urban groundwater pathways are numerous and the interactions with subsurface infrastructure (e.g. trenches, pipes, etc.) are highly complex, the spatial and temporal variability of the contribution of infiltrated stormwater to baseflow is difficult to predict. We tracked the fate of infiltrated stormwater out of an 1800 m(2) infiltration basin (3.5% of its 5-ha impervious catchment) using a network of piezometers for over three years. We found that groundwater levels downslope of the basin were increased (up to 4 m) while water levels in an array of reference piezometers lateral to the basin showed no change (dry at depths ranging 2-4 m). Monthly water balance calculations indicated that in summer, most of the infiltrated stormwater was evapotranspired by the vegetation downslope of the basin, and thus did not reach the receiving stream. In the colder months, some infiltrated stormwater did reach the stream as plant water use declined. Anthropogenic disturbances (a sewer pipe and stream re-alignment) interacted with the upper part of the plume of infiltrated stormwater, locally lowering the water table. The study provides evidence that the fate of infiltrated stormwater is complex, and that infiltrated stormwater does not always reach receiving streams as baseflow as is often assumed.

ID DETACHMENT; MODEL; DEPOSITION
AB Dynamic changes take place in the nature of sediment eroded from bare soil at low slopes by rainfall impact when there is no inflow of water at the top of the eroding slope. This relates initially to fine soil sediment not settling back onto the soil after the rainfall impact. Coupled partial differential equations describing such dynamic changes have been solved numerically for a bed of soil, bounded at its upper end, and subject to a constant rainfall rate. This solution allows prediction of the change with time and downslope distance in the concentration and settling velocity (or size) characteristics of eroding sediment, allowing critical evaluation of the assumption of space-independent sediment characteristics made in prior approximate analytical solutions of the equations involved. Following the determination of as yet unpredictable soil-related parameters in the equations, the solution was tested by comparison with experimented data on two soils of contrasting structural stability, namely a vertosol [The Australian Soil Classification (1996)] and a aridisol. Investigations included the determination of a minimum number of sediment size classes required to adequately describe the settling velocity characteristics, based on the shape of the underlying basic settling velocity characteristic, which is used to predict the dynamics of sediment deposition. The effect on the solution of observed structural breakdown in soil aggregation due to rainfall impact was investigated, leading to more accurate predictions of the settling velocity characteristics of eroded sediment. Other sources of discrepancy between theory and observation remain to be determined. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The article substantiates that the effectiveness of implementing socio-economic development strategies is to a large extent determined by the adequate provision of basic resources. The key role of water resources in economic strategic development is empirically illustrated. The article demonstrates the practicability of strategic management of water resources based on the principle of a combination of river basin management approaches and the consideration of regional development strategies. The Game Theory technique was used to develop economic and mathematical tools for supporting decision making in meeting the needs of regional consumers under water balance deficit conditions. The choice of methods was determined from two positions: the methods should allow for the possibility of multi variant solutions for the selection of optimal options for the distribution of limited water resources between different consumers; the methods should be orientated on the maximum possible harmonization of multidirectional and multi-scale interests of the subjects in the water management system of the different regions (including the state) in order to achieve a balance, The approbation of developing a toolkit for the example of the regions located in the Don and Kuban river basins resulted in the appropriate selection of priority regions for the allocation of water resources in terms of strategic management as well as the determination of measures of ensuring the sustainable use of the river basins under consideration. The proposed tools can be used for coordinating decisions on the water supply of regional economic systems with actual and projected indicators of socio-economic development of the respective regions for a strategic perspective.

TI Approximate calculation of flash flood maximum inundation extent in

AB Inundation analysis is one of the core aspects of flash flood prevention and control in mountainous area. Remote sensing technology can conveniently extract submerged region of a large flood, but infeasible to dynamically obtain flood inundating process in a high temporal resolution. Meanwhile, it is difficult to establish a suitable hydrodynamics-based inundation model under conditions of complex terrain. Moreover, such model usually requires huge input data and long simulation time. The Bulk Method (BM) can quickly calculate flood inundation extent, given the total water yield in the catchment and local Digital Elevation Model (DEM). However, the traditional BM is only applicable for relatively flat terrain. In order to apply BM to calculation of the flash flood inundation extent in the catchment of large elevation difference, the differential BM based on differential element theory is proposed in this paper. In the method, the main flood channel is divided into a certain number of differential channel segments, in which the local elevation difference is relatively small, and the BM can be soundly applied. The flood inundation extent of the whole channel can be obtained by combining the maximum inundation extents of all differential channel segments. Furthermore, it is the key to determine the optimal number of channel segments by repeating the prior steps of the proposed method until the area change ratio of the total inundation extents calculated in two consecutive loops is less than the specified threshold value. Taking Zharugou Catchment as the study area, we obtained the approximate maximum inundation extent of a once in 10-year flood occurred there on July 10th, 2018. As the calculation results were generally in good agreement with the field measuring data, it demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the differential BM in approximately calculating the maximum flood inundation extent in a small ungauged catchment with sharp elevation variation.

AB Areal reduction factors (ARFs) transform an estimate of extreme rainfall at a point to an estimate of extreme rainfall over a spatial domain, and are commonly used in flood risk estimation. For applications such as the design of large infrastructure, dam safety and land use planning, ARFs are needed to estimate flood risk for very rare events that are often larger than the biggest historical events. The nature of the relationship between ARFs and frequency for long return periods is unclear as it depends on the asymptotic dependence structure of rainfall over a region, i.e., the extent to which rainfall from a surrounding region is extreme as rainfall at a point becomes more extreme. Miscalculating this for very rare events could lead to poor design of infrastructure. To investigate this, spatial rainfall processes are simulated using asymptotically dependent and independent models, and the implications for ARFs of the asymptotic assumptions are explored in a synthetic study. The models are then applied to a case study in Victoria, Australia, using 88 daily rainfall gauges with 50 years of data. The analysis shows that the observed data follow the behaviour of an asymptotically independent process, leading to ARFs that decrease with increasing return period. The study demonstrates that the use of inverted max-stable process models to simulate ARFs can provide a rigorous alternative to empirical approaches, particularly for long return periods requiring significant extrapolation from the data.

AB Three-phase displacement events often occur in unsaturated porous media, especially when immiscible con-taminants (e.g., non-aqueous phase liquid, NAPL) inadvertently enter the subsurface. In this study, the influence of initial water saturation on the three-phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution during NAPL invasion into unsaturated porous media was experimentally investigated. The low-field nuclear magnetic reso-nance (LF-NMR) technique was used to dynamically monitor the spatial distribution of water in unsaturated porous media during the invasion of NAPL. The residual distributions (e.g., volume fraction) of NAPL/water/gas were quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that both the initial water saturation and the NAPL injection rate had a significant influence on the three-phase displacement. We found that the displacement efficiency of water/gas exhibited a non-monotonic relationship with the initial water saturation in the unsaturated porous media at certain NAPL invasion rates. A method was proposed to characterize the three-phase displacement regime in terms of the classical two-phase Lenormand's diagram. A significant increase in the volume fraction of residual NAPL after NAPL invasion was observed during the transition from the strong drainage region to the transitional displacement region. However, the initial water saturation was insensitive to the volume fraction of residual NAPL, once the characterized three-phase displacement regime transitioned to the stable displacement region. This study not only highlighted the influence mechanism of initial water saturation and NAPL injection rate on the three-phase displacement efficiency, but also endowed the classical two-phase Lenormand's diagram with the three-phase displacement regime.

AB The Loess Plateau of China suffers from severe soil erosion. In the gullied rolling loess region, approximately half of the sediment derives from gully areas, which are the most prominent topographical features of this region. No existing soil erosion models are appropriate in accuracy or applicability for the Loess Plateau because existing models only consider slope and river erosion processes at the catchment scale. The absence of the gully erosion process in these models significantly limits their application to the Loess Plateau. Taking this issue into account, a three-process-based distributed soil erosion model, denoted by WEP-SED, is proposed to investigate soil erosion in this region based on the Water and Energy transfer Processes in Large river basins (WEP-L) model. In WEP-SED, a sequential "slope-gully-river" structure is built for the physically-based simulation of soil erosion and sediment yield. In this structure, soil erosion is integrated from six parts with successive transport relationships. The proposed model is applied to the upstream region of the Wenjiachuan hydrological station in the Kuye River basin. The simulated monthly average sediment transport rates from 1956 to 2010 at the Wenjiachuan hydrological station agree well with the observations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.76, an NSE of 0.58, and a relative error of - 5.60%. Furthermore, the simulated average annual amount of gully erosion reaches 60.30% of the total soil erosion, reflecting the fact that the gully erosion is a serious problem and demonstrating that gully erosion must be considered separately in this area.

AB The changes in seawater volumes caused by seawater intrusion are often neglected in coastal aquifer management studies. The conditions under which this can result in significant water balance errors are not well understood. Interface movements also influence temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels, but there is little guidance on this effect. In this study, we use steady-state, sharp-interface, analytic modelling to generate idealised relationships between seawater volume, freshwater volume and water levels. The approach assumes quasi-equilibrium conditions, which are evaluated using a selection of transient, dispersive simulations. The results demonstrate that seawater volume changes can influence significantly coastal aquifer water level trends, relative to the corresponding non-coastal aquifer situation, particularly within deep aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity and low net recharge. It is also shown that seawater volume changes can be a significant component of coastal aquifer water balances, e.g., relative to freshwater discharge to the sea, especially within deep aquifers characterised by low hydraulic conductivity and low freshwater discharge. Transient simulations show that steady-state conditions are a reasonable approximation for a range of transient seawater intrusion situations, including two of the three cases considered in this analysis. We conclude that changes in seawater volumes should be included routinely in coastal aquifer water balances. Also, temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels may not provide an adequate measure of freshwater storage trends. It follows that the assessment of coastal aquifer condition should consider groundwater levels relative to the hydraulic head imposed by the ocean, accounting for density effects.

AB This study explores the influence of rainfall and runoff production on wash load sediment transport in a low-order, ephemeral watershed in southeast Arizona. Wash load concentrations measured at the watershed outlet generally decreased throughout a runoff event and were better correlated with the rainfall intensity and the rainfall volume that fell within the 6 min (the watershed's 'time of concentration') before the sediment concentration was measured than with the runoff discharge. The difference between the rainfall volume per unit time and the runoff discharge was primarily due to infiltration and transmission losses, processes that reduce runoff volume but do not appear to affect the wash load concentration within the runoff. Infiltration and transmission losses are significant in this watershed and vary considerably in space and time but are generally described by an inverse relationship between the runoff coefficient and drainage area. Runoff coefficients vary amongst runoff events and are correlated to the peak rainfall intensity during each event. Results indicate that wash load concentrations are set by the sediment entrainment processes occurring on the hillslopes (e.g., rainsplash, Hortonian overland flow) and do not greatly fluctuate as water is routed through the watershed. This suggests that wash load concentration may be better predicted by metrics of rainfall than flow discharge in certain environments. Using rainfall as a predictor of wash load could be useful for estimating sediment fluxes in semiarid regions where flow discharge is often difficult to monitor and sediment transport concentrations can be high (i.e., >10,000 mg L-1).

AB This study compared five different models for evaluating solute transport in a 1250-cm long, saturated and highly heterogeneous soil column. The five models were: the convection-dispersion equation (CDE), the mobile-immobile model (MIM), the convective lognormal transfer function model (CLT), the spatial fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) and the continuous time random walk model (CTRW). Each of these models was used to fit the breakthrough curve (BTC) at each distance individually and was also used to fit the BTCs at different distances simultaneously. Dependence of estimated parameters on distance was investigated. The estimated parameters at 200 cm were used to make predictions at subsequent distances. Highly anomalous transport behavior was observed in the column as the BTCs demonstrated significantly irregular shape and long tailing. This study indicated that CDE, CLT and FADE were unable to describe the anomalous BTCs adequately and their parameters changed with transport distance significantly. Compared to CDE, CLT and FADE, MIM better captured the evolution of anomalous BTCs. However, MIM did not explain the distinct BTC tailing satisfactorily. In contrast to MIM, CTRW better simulated the long tails of BTCs. The spreading parameter (beta) of CTRW was close to one and remained approximately constant at different travel distances. To make the comparison of these five models more general beyond the specific transport condition in the soil column, a generic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these five models was presented in terms of their theory framework and a priori knowledge of the model behaviors.

AB Tracer tests have been per-formed on a 3D tank of dimensions 560 x 100 x 100 cm(3). These experiments at laboratory scale are used to define effective hydraulic conductivity and macrodispersivity. The tracer tests have been performed on two kinds of heterogeneous porous material: a channel Structured medium, with channels crossing the whole tank, and a statistically correlated random structure. The statistically correlated field was first established by a sequential type generator with a prescribed exponential covariance. The theoretical random field is then modified according to the available sand hydraulic conductivities. The obtained LnK variance is 1.03 and the integral scale 23.1 cm.
   Results obtained concerning the channel structured media show that it behaves like a stratified medium from an hydrodynamical and mass transfer point of view. The effective hydraulic conductivity is equal to the arithmetic mean and the variance of the concentration is proportional to t(2), t being the mean travel time of the tracer displacement.
   For the correlated random field, the effective hydraulic conductivity falls between by the geometric and the arithmetic mean. No match with theoretical values have been found because the boundary conditions effects cannot be neglected due to the dimension of the tank compared to the integral scale. Similar conclusions have been obtained for macrodispersivity. The tracer tests could be simulated by a 1D advection-dispersion equation but with a significant higher macrodispersivity than predicted by stochastic theories for infinite media.

AB To adjust heavy radar rainfall, a novel approach based on combining adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) and six geographical variables was proposed. This study is the first to adjust radar rainfall using ANFIS-PSO, and it has the advantages of a fuzzy inference system for quantifying the contribution of related factors to phenomena and artificial neural networks in a data-driven approach. Six geographic variables, including slope, aspect, elevation, distance from the sea, plan curvature and profile curvature, were utilized to adjust the radar rainfall at three South Korean stations. The adjusted rainfall captured well the location and heavy rainfall amount for comparison with the Marshall-Palmer-based rainfall (M-P). The adjusted rainfall also showed an improved mean absolute percentage error of approximately 70 % and correlation value of approximately 12 % compared to the M-P. The sensitivity results of geographical variables showed that adjusted rainfall has a high sensitivity ratio to elevation and distance from the sea, with values of 28.7 % and 12.0 %, respectively, while other variables showed 6 %-9 % sensitivity ratios. Since most sensitivity and relationship results are consistent with previous studies, the data-driven results were reasonable. This study contributes to the radar rainfall adjustment field by analyzing the causal link between rainfall and geographic variables. Due to the ability of this method to consider the effect of geographic variables in radar adjustment, it can be utilized in mountainous areas that are highly affected by spatial variables.

AB The increasing risk of floods across the globe needs focused attention because of the extensive damage to human lives and economy. A comprehensive understanding of its causative factors is of vital importance. Yet catchment characterization studies are generally limited to case studies or regional domains. A comprehensive global characterization is currently unavailable, which requires collecting and collating a large number of datasets over vast areas. This study embraces large-sample data-driven science as a new paradigm to characterize streamflow extremes by utilizing global datasets of physiographic explanatory variables that could explain various facets of extreme streamflows. Along with the spatial and temporal variations of high streamflow extremes, their corre-lation with various catchment characteristics such as geomorphology, meteorology, climatology, landcover, li-thology, etc. were examined. The multidimensional relationships between the streamflow extremes and catchment characteristics were modeled using a Random Forest approach and combined with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the most dominant factors in varying climate classes. Interpretation with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) reveals that meteorological variables are the most influential variables across the climatic classes. However, the variables and their influences change among different climatic classes. Moreover, different geomorphological variables come into dominance across climatic classes (such as basin relief in warm temperate and drainage texture in arid climates). Overall, the insights from the study could play a crucial role in predicting the unit peak discharge at ungauged stations from the known catchment characteristics. Moreover, these findings can also play a crucial role in formulating risk management strategy.

AB Short-term water demand forecasting (StWDF) is the foundation stone in the derivation of an optimal plan for controlling water supply systems. Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, k-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that extending the data set significantly reduces the error by about 30%. However, it increases the training time.

AB The hydrologic design of nonstationary flood extremes is an emerging field that is essential for water resources management and hydrologic engineering design to cope with changing environment. This paper aims to investigate and compare the capability of four nonstationary hydrologic design strategies, including the expected number of exceedances (ENE), design life level (DLL), equivalent reliability (ER), and average design life level (ADLL), with the last three methods taking into consideration the design life of the project. The confidence intervals of the calculated design floods were also estimated using the non stationary bootstrap approach. A comparison of these four methods was performed using the annual maximum flood series (AMFS) of the Weihe River basin, Jinghe River basin, and Assunpink Creek basin. The results indicated that ENE, ER and ADLL yielded the same or very similar design values and confidence intervals for both increasing and decreasing trends of AMFS considered. DLL also yields similar design values if the relationship between DLL and ER/ADLL return periods is considered. Both ER and ADLL are recommended for practical use as they have associated design floods with the design life period of projects and yield reasonable design quantiles and confidence intervals. Furthermore, by assuming that the design results using either a stationary or nonstationary hydrologic design strategy, should have the same reliability, the ER method enables us to solve the nonstationary hydrologic design problems by adopting the stationary design reliability, thus bridging the gap between stationary and nonstationary design criteria.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID WATER TEMPERATURE
AB Shading by riparian vegetation and streambanks reduces incident solar radiation on channels, and accurate estimation of riparian shading through the sun's daily arc is a critical aspect of water temperature and dissolved oxygen modeling. However, riparian trees exhibit complex shapes, often leaning and growing branches preferentially over channels to utilize the light resource. As a result, riparian vegetation cast complex shadows with significant variability at the scale of meters. Water quality models necessarily simplify factors affecting shading at the expense of accuracy. All models must make simplifying assumptions about tree geometry. Reach-based models must average channel azimuth and riparian conditions over each reach, and GIS models must also accept errors in the channel-riparian relationships caused by the DEM grid detail. We detail minor improvements to existing shade models and create a model (SHADE2) that calculates shading ratio (%) by riparian canopy at any time and location for given stream characteristics including stream azimuth, stream width, canopy height, canopy overhang, and height of maximum canopy overhang. Sensitivity of simulated shade to these variables is explored. We also present a new field photographic technique for quantifying shade and use this technique to provide data to test the SHADE2 algorithm. Twenty-four independent shade measurements were made in eight channels with mature hardwood riparian trees at different times of the summer and at different times of the day. Agreement between measured and modeled shade was excellent, with r(2) of 0.90. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Infiltration is of great concern in many fields like hydrology, agriculture as well as geotechnical and geological engineering. This study aims to investigate water infiltration in a cracked soil. Infiltration tests were conducted on compacted soil samples with different cracking degrees by drying to various water contents. Three drying-wetting cycles were applied. Experimental results show that no desiccation cracks are observed in the first drying process while cracks initiate and propagate in the second and third drying processes. Different from the infiltration curve of the non-cracked soil sample consisting of two distinct stages, that of the cracked soil consists of three distinct stages, representing constant, rapid reduction and gradual reduction in infiltration rate, respectively. A modified equation is proposed to describe the infiltration behavior of a cracked soil considering the prehealing time of cracks. Furthermore, it is found that for the tested soil, 4% of surface crack ratio is a critical value. When surface crack ratio is smaller than the critical value, its influence on infiltration capacity is insignificant. Afterwards, the infiltration capacity increases dramatically with increasing surface crack ratio. Based on this observation, a piecewise function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the normalized infiltration capacity of cracked soil and surface crack ratio. Infiltration capacity also increases with decreasing initial water content and increasing number of drying-wetting cycles. In terms of steady final infiltration rate, it increases with increasing initial water content as well as increasing number of drying-wetting cycles, but is not affected by desiccation cracking.

TI A framework to develop joint nutrient criteria for lake eutrophication

AB Nutrient criteria provide the numeric basis for lake eutrophication management. However, there are two obstacles that can hinder the effective application of nutrient criteria, including 1) although total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) might co-limit phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic lakes, their criteria are often developed independently; and 2) the linkage between nutrient criteria and the percentile-based compliance assessment method of chlorophyll a (CHL; as a measure of phytoplankton biomass) has not been well established. To resolve these obstacles, we propose a novel analytical framework of nutrient criteria development, by which joint nutrient criteria are developed using quantile regression (QR). We demonstrated the steps necessary to utilize this novel approach using TP, TN, and CHL data from Lake Dianchi, a hypereutrophic lake located in southwestern China. First, we built candidate QR models to quantify the nutrient-CHL relationship at six regression quantiles. Next, we conducted the sequential Wald test to select the "best" model for each regression quantile. Finally, we visualized the joint nutrient criteria surface using a contour map. The contour map effectively illustrated the joint nutrient criteria by showing the linkage of TP and TN criterion. In addition, based on the QR, it was easy to deduce nutrient criteria which met the requirement of percentile-based compliance assessment. We further found that joint nutrient criteria could help the selection of an efficient load reduction strategy in the watershed. The proposed method can be generalized to other systems and may facilitate sitespecific lake eutrophication management.

AB As one of the largest contiguous karst regions in the world, Southwest China is vulnerable to soil erosion because of its unique geology and inappropriate land use. Understanding the linkages between geological conditions, land cover patterns and sediment yield is thus of paramount importance to effectively control sediment delivery in heterogeneous karst watersheds. The objective of this study was to examine how the specific sediment yield was related to lithology and landscape variables for 40 karst watersheds in southwest China. Due to these watershed variables were highly codependent, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to elucidate the relationship between the sediment yield and 30 lithology and landscape variables. The first-order controls were determined by calculating the variable importance for the projection (VIP). Predictors with VIP scores larger than 1 were considered to be the most influential predictors of the PLSR model. Results indicated that the lithology and landscape indeed exerted substantial influence on sediment yield (explained variance: 66.8%) for the investigated 40 watersheds. Specifically, the first dominant factor for sediment yield was karst coverage (VIP = 2.19), followed by dolomite coverage (VIP = 1.42), landscape shape index (VIP = 1.33), patch richness (VIP = 1.23), relative patch richness (VIP = 1.23), number of patches (VIP = 1.22), and Simpson's diversity index (VIP = 1.03). The PLSR technique enabled the elimination of codependency among the variables and facilitated a more unbiased view of the control factors for sediment yield. Therefore, this approach is recommended as a useful tool for identifying the dominant factors controlling sediment yield in heterogeneous karst watersheds.

AB In this paper, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry was applied to ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT satellite data covering 1992-2000 and 2002-2010 respectively, to analyse the relationship between ground motion and hydraulic head changes in the London Basin, United Kingdom. The integration of observed groundwater levels provided by the Environment Agency and satellite-derived displacement time series allowed the estimation of the spatio-temporal variations of the Chalk aquifer storage coefficient and compressibility over an area of similar to 1360 km(2). The average storage coefficient of the aquifer reaches values of 1 x 10(-3) and the estimated average aquifer compressibility is 7.7 x 10(-10) Pa-1 and 1.2 x 10(-9) Pa-1 for the periods 1992-2000 and 2002-2010, respectively. Derived storage coefficient values appear to be correlated with the hydrogeological setting, where confined by the London Clay the storage coefficient is typically an order of magnitude lower than where the chalk is overlain by the Lambeth Group. PSI-derived storage coefficient estimates agree with the values obtained from pumping tests in the same area. A simplified one-dimensional model is applied to simulate the ground motion response to hydraulic heads changes at nine piezometers. The comparison between simulated and satellite-observed ground motion changes reveals good agreement, with errors ranging between 1.4 and 6.9 mm, and being 3.2 mm on average. 2016 British Geological Survey a Component body of NERC.

AB We present new equations for infiltration and absorption based on the distributed-order fractional Fokker-Planck equation of flow in swelling porous media in a material coordinate. We show that the cumulative infiltration into dual porous swelling soils is I(t) = At + St(beta 2/2-beta 1/4), where beta(1) and beta(2) are the orders of fractional derivatives for immobile and mobile zones respectively, A the final infiltration rate, and S the sorptivity. When the single porosity model is assumed by neglecting beta(1), the infiltration equation degenerates to the anomalous infiltration equation presented earlier, i.e., I(t) = At + St(beta 2/2), where beta(2) is the order of the fractional derivative for single porous media. Furthermore, when beta(2) = 1 and beta(1) is neglected, the infiltration equation becomes Philip's two-term infiltration equation. We have also derived the cumulative absorption or horizontal infiltration as I(t) = St(beta 2/2-beta 1/4), and established a fractional relationship for water exchange between the mobile and immobile zones, and present solutions subject to two types of conditions: one for the known initial water content and the other with the known rate of exchange of water between the immobile and mobile zones. Using the published data collected under the field and laboratory conditions for infiltration and absorption, we have found that the values of beta(1) and beta(2) change (0 < beta(2) < 2 and beta(1) < 1) with different classes of diffusion mechanisms operating in the different soils.

AB Rapid population growth in the intermontane, semi-arid, Okanagan Valley of Western Canada has led to water shortages with increasing debate over competing water interests. Nevertheless, the relationships between the various water resources of the Okanagan remain poorly defined. Stable isotopes of hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (O-18) were used to assess rainfall importance and the sources and flux of water to and from rivers and lakes in watersheds, and to evaluate the origin of ground water resources. Precipitation isotopes resulted in a meteoric water line of delta H-2 = 6.6 (delta O-18) - 22.7 for the Okanagan Valley. Isotopic seasonality in precipitation was evident, with summer precipitation clearly affected by local recycling of water vapor. The H-2 and O-18 of surface waters were more positive than mean annual precipitation, indicative of basin-scale evaporation of surface waters; however, Okanagan Lake and its downstream river and lake system were isotopically synchronous, indicating that they behaved as a single well-mixed hydrologic unit. Isotopic mass-balance modeling revealed similar to 35% of inflow to the Lake Okanagan watershed was lost to evaporation, validating a meteorological water balance model for the region. Highland bedrock was recharged with snow-melt and early spring rains, with the isotopic composition dependent on elevation. Ground waters in the Valley bottom aquifers west of Osoyoos were recharged by irrigation water obtained from the Okanagan River system, with no evidence of recharge connections from the highland bedrock.

AB The ensemble forecasts from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are considered as essential elements for operational hydrologic forecasting. However, these forecasts are burdened with significant inherent biases and cannot be used directly for hydrologic forecasting. Therefore, the present study examines the capability of ensemble precipitation forecasts obtained from two NWP models i.e., a 20-member ensemble from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and a 50-member ensemble from the European center for Medium -term Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The skill of 70-member multi-model grand ensemble (MME) generated from the NCEP and ECMWF forecasts is also verified in this study. Furthermore, post-processing of the raw ensemble members was carried out using two methods (Quantile Mapping (QM) and Quantile Regression Forests (QRF)) in order to minimize the inherent biases. The analysis was performed over subbasins of an Indian river basin namely the Godavari River Basin. Here, a set of deterministic and probabilistic verification measures (forecast error box plots, correlation coefficient, Relative Mean Error, mean Continuous Ranked Probability Score, spread-skill relationship, rank histograms, reliability diagram, Area under Relative Operating Characteristic Curve) were employed to assess various quality attributes of the forecasts. The findings from the study suggests that QRF post -processed NCEP and MME forecasts are comparatively better than other forecasts in terms of all employed verification measures over all subbasins. The QRF post-processed forecasts were found to be superior than QM post-processed and raw forecasts over all subbasins. The adopted post-processing methods resulted in improved forecasts at shorter lead times. However, the skill of both raw and post-processed forecasts declines at higher lead times over all subbasins.

AB The dynamics of fog droplets depend on their size and chemical composition as well on the ambient conditions such as relative humidity (RH) and turbulence. We analyze the droplet size distribution (DSD) in clouds and fog and how it covaries with the air humidity. We developed a new setup to remove fog droplets from the foggy air in order to quantify RH in the droplet-free air. The setup consists of a newly developed fog droplet separator with an attached H2O gas analyzer and precision thermometer. The fog droplet separator works similarly to an active fog collector, yet with a high collection efficiency of 98.4% for the liquid water content. The water vapor concentration and the air temperature are measured in the droplet-free air at a frequency of 1 Hz. Using this system and a FM100 Fog Monitor, we analyzed the droplet size distribution (DSD) and studied how it covaries with RH. We examined two long-lasting fog events in March and April 2017 on Mt. Lulin, Taiwan. We found that the DSD differed between data with high RH (>100.3%) and low RH (<99.7%). For one event, we were able to confirm the hypothesis of the Kohler theory, which states that droplets are smaller at a low RH than at a high RH. In the other event, the droplets were larger at low RH, which was caused either by entrainment of air masses of different compositions or by droplet growth from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size, or by a decrease of droplet sizes beyond the critical diameter with decreasing RH. The results show that the developed setup is appropriate to analyze how the DSD covaries with RH in fog.

AB Simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments remains a challenging task in hydrology and increases the demand for regionalization studies worldwide. Here, we investigate the effect of three modes of parameter transfer, including temporal (transferring across different periods), spatial (transferring between same calibration periods but different sites), and spatiotemporal (transferring across both different periods and sites) on simulating streamflow using HBV conceptual rainfall-runoff model at 576 unregulated catchments throughout Iran (407,000 Km(2)). Our main conclusions are: (1) temporal mode shows the best performance, with the lowest decline in performance (median decline of 5.8%) as measured using the NSE efficiency metric, (2) difference between spatial and spatiotemporal options was negligible (median decline of 13.7% and 15.1% respectively), (3) all parameters are associated with some uncertainties and those related to runoff and snow components of the model are associated with the highest and lowest uncertainties, respectively, (4) overall, the model performance in arid regions is not as good as humid regions which confirmed that elevation and climate play a major role in parameter estimation in these areas, and (5) aridity and catchment elevation are two major controls on model transferability at regional (climate classes) and local (the whole country) scales. We also show that the superiority of the temporal mode is maintained with: (i) increasing spatial distance between gauged (donor) and ungauged (target) catchments, (ii) increasing time lag (10 years) between calibration and validation, and (iii) gradually increased time lags between calibration and validation. Our study suggest that spatiotemporal parameter transfer can be a reliable option for PUB studies and climate change-related studies, at least in wetter catchments. However, further research is needed to explore the complicated relationship between temporal and spatial aspects of hydrological variability.

AB The chloride mass balance method of estimating groundwater recharge is generally applied at a point scale but water resources management generally requires information at a regional scale. To estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation. This study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging: in data-sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates, while in data-dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge. The uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall, the chloride exported in runoff, the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling. This study focused on the coal bearing Sydney, Gunnedah, Gloucester and Surat Basins of Eastern New South Wales (Australia). Historically, groundwater recharge to the Permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water. The increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance. We found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers (up to 20% of long-term mean annual rainfall) and lowest in the Permian units (-1% of long-term mean annual rainfall). The magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate. The method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty. The method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a groundwater flow system, the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone within the same streamline. However, it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain, and the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain. A new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes was employed to reassess the groundwater C-14 ages from the discharge zone in the North China Plain (NCP). Carbonate precipitation, organic matter oxidation and cross-flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone are recognized according to the corresponding changes of HCO3- (or DIC) and delta C-13 in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the NCP. The effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation are calibrated with a C-13 mixing model and DIC correction, but these corrected C-14 ages seem unreasonable because they grow younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone in the NCP. The relationship of Cl- content and the recharge distance is used to estimate the expected Cl- content in the discharge zone, and In(a(14)C)/Cl is proposed to correct the a(14)C in groundwater for the effect of cross-flow mixing. The C-14 ages were reassessed with the corrected a(14)C due to the cross-flow mixing varying from 1.25 to 30.58 ka, and the groundwater becomes older gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. The results suggest that the reassessed C-14 ages are more reasonable for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross-flow mixing.

AB The linkage between sewer pipe flow and floodplain flow is recognised to induce an important source of uncertainty within two-dimensional (2D) urban flood models. This uncertainty is often attributed to the use of empirical hydraulic formulae (the one-dimensional (1D) weir and orifice steady flow equations) to achieve data-connectivity at the linking interface, which require the determination of discharge coefficients. Because of the paucity of high resolution localised data for this type of flows, the current understanding and quantification of a suitable range for those discharge coefficients is somewhat lacking. To fulfil this gap, this work presents the results acquired from an instrumented physical model designed to study the interaction between a pipe network flow and a floodplain flow. The full range of sewer-to-surface and surface-to-sewer flow conditions at the exchange zone are experimentally analysed in both steady and unsteady flow regimes. Steady state measured discharges are first analysed considering the relationship between the energy heads from the sewer flow and the floodplain flow; these results show that existing weir and orifice formulae are valid for describing the flow exchange for the present physical model, and yield new calibrated discharge coefficients for each of the flow conditions. The measured exchange discharges are also integrated (as a source term) within a 2D numerical flood model (a finite volume solver to the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)), which is shown to reproduce the observed coefficients. This calibrated numerical model is then used to simulate a series of unsteady flow tests reproduced within the experimental facility. Results show that the numerical model overestimated the values of mean surcharge flow rate. This suggests the occurrence of additional head losses in unsteady conditions which are not currently accounted for within flood models calibrated in steady flow conditions. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB The dynamics and relationships between society and nature are complex and difficult to predict. Anthropogenic activities affect the ecological integrity of our natural resources, specifically our streams. Further, it is well-established that the costs of these activities are born unequally by different human communities. This study considered the utility of integrating stream health metrics, based on stream health indicators, with socio-economic measures of communities, to better characterize these effects. This study used a spatial multi-factor model and bivariate mapping to produce a novel assessment for watershed management, identification of vulnerable areas, and allocation of resources. The study area is the Saginaw River watershed located in Michigan. In-stream hydrological and water quality data were used to predict fish and macroinvertebrate measures of stream health. These measures include the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Family IBI, and total number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Stream health indicators were then compared to spatially coincident socioeconomic data, obtained from the United States Census Bureau (2010), including race, income, education, housing, and population size. Statistical analysis including spatial regression and cluster analysis were used to examine the correlation between vulnerable human populations and environmental conditions. Overall, limited correlation was observed between the socio-economic data and ecological measures of stream health, with the highest being a negative correlation of 0.18 between HBI and the social parameter household size. Clustering was observed in the datasets with urban areas representing a second order clustering effect over the watershed. Regions with the worst stream health and most vulnerable social populations were most commonly located nearby or down-stream to highly populated areas and agricultural lands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mahanadi River basin is one of the recognized climatic vulnerable regions of India. Recent occurrences of the extreme climatic events in this basin underscore the importance of evaluating the trend and variability of hydroclimatic variables in order to understand the potential impact of future change. In this study, the monthly streamflow data for the period 1972-2007 and the daily rainfall data for the period 1972-2005 have been analyzed using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test after removing serial correlation. The results reveal a substantial spatial and subseasonal difference in the monsoon season streamflow and rainfall patterns, with a predominance of the increasing trends in June and decreasing trends in August. However, a marked increase is observed in the streamflow and rainfall of the pre- and post-monsoon season. The correlation coefficients show a direct correspondence of the rainfall and streamflow series with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is contrary to the established inverse relationship over India. The noteworthy feature of this study is the observed climate uncertainty in terms of large variability in the extreme indices since the 1990s, consistent with the warming induced intensification of the hydrological cycle. Strong evidences have emerged regarding the basin-wide increases in extreme rainfall indices. In particular, the coastal sector of the basin is more vulnerable to the heavy rainfall, whereas the southern Eastern Ghats region is susceptible to the moisture stress. The discharge at the basin outlet has declined at a rate of 3388 x 106 m(3) decade(-1), suggesting the need of environmental flow assessment. The results of this study would help the reservoir managers and policy makers in planning and management of water resources of the Mahanadi River basin. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water are common environmental tracers used to investigate hydrological processes, such as evaporation, vegetation water use, surface water-groundwater interaction, and groundwater recharge. The water isotope signature in surface water and groundwater evolves from the initial rain signature. In mountain terrain, rain water stable isotope composition spatially varies due to complex orographic precipitation processes. Many studies have examined the isotope-elevation relationships, while few have quantitatively investigate the terrain aspect and slope effect on rain isotope distribution. In this paper, we examine the orographic effects more completely, including elevation, terrain slope and aspect, on stable isotope distribution in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR) of South Australia, using a multivariate regression model. The regression of precipitation isotope composition suggests that orographic effects are the dominant controls on isotope spatial variability. About 75% of spatial variability in delta O-18 and deuterium excess is represented by the regression using solely orography-related variables (elevation, terrain aspect and slope), with about 25% of delta O-18 spatial variability attributed to the terrain aspect and slope effect. The lapse rate is about -0.25 parts per thousand for every 100 m at both windward and leeward slopes. However, at the same elevation, delta O-18 at the leeward slope (eastern MLR) is 0.5 parts per thousand larger than that at the windward slope. The difference can be explained by different mechanisms - continuous rain-out processes on the windward side and sub-cloud evaporation on the leeward side. Both delta O-18 and deuterium excess maps (1 km resolution) are constructed based on the regression results for the MLR. Both maps are consistent with groundwater of local precipitation origin, and useful to examine groundwater recharge. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Hydrology Lab (HL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) is currently developing and testing the HL Research Modeling System (HL-RMS). Currently, the system has one snow model (SNOW-17) and two runoff models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and the Continuous Antecedent Precipitation Index (CONT-API). The NWS lumped CONT-API model is operational in one of the NWS River Forecasting Centers (RFCs), the Middle Atlantic RFC (MARFC) in the United States. This study deals with the derivation of a priori distributed parameters for the CONT-API model. In our strategy, initial distributed parameters based on the calibrated lumped CONT-API parameters of 67 basins in the Susquehanna River Basin are derived. This study shows that the CONT-API model six-hourly calibrated parameters can be used in an one-hourly lumped model with only minor changes in total runoff volume (less than 5%). However, to obtain the timing of simulated hydrographs, appropriate one-hourly unit hydrographs need to be derived. A priori-distributed model parameters were based on relationships between soil properties and calibrated lumped CONT-API parameters. Multiple linear regressions with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.39 to 0.63 were obtained for 10 lumped model parameters. Using these predicted parameters, the lumped model produced simulations having Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, N-eff, statistics ranging from 0.69 to 0.78 for five of the 67 basins. These are commensurate with goodness-of-fit statistics from lumped model calibrations. Furthermore, application of the method in deriving a priori parameters gave a promising result in distributed model simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ABSTR A C T The complexity of rainfall-canopy interactions is likely to increase under extreme weather events. Extreme conditions may affect forest structure and change the throughfall (TF) spatial distribution over time. Mistakenly claiming the time stability of TF spatial variability can lead to misunderstanding the rainfall-canopy interactions, obscuring the relationships between weather, forests, and hydrology. Herein we rely on an unprecedented six-hydrological-year event-based dataset from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, spanning from 2013 to 2019 (summing up 427 rainfall events) to assess: (i) the effects of a prolonged drought period on the TF time stability; and (ii) the importance of forest structure for the TF time stability. The mean relative difference and time stability index were applied for different period lengths and related to forest structure, gross rainfall amount (GR), maximum rainfall intensity, and drought occurrence to assess whether they affect the TF spatial variability. The results indicated that the throughfall spatial variability is less time stable during droughts due to a combination of more light intensity events with some extreme intensities (> 20 mm h(-1)), which were not observed in the non-drought period. Changes in forest structure became evident after drought conditions and could not be tracked in studies with short monitoring periods. Since throughfall spatial distribution is driven by forest structure (e.g., tree density, species dominance, and biomass), such dynamics affected the time stability of the spatial variability. The time instability was even greater for GR < 10 mm because of the greater rainfall-canopy interactions prior to canopy saturation. Therefore, not accounting for forest dynamics and drought effects on the TF spatial variability lead to misinterpreting time stability.

AB Lack of high spatial resolution soil moisture data is a major limitation in many regional scale hydrologic, climatic and agricultural applications. The available satellite soil moisture data products are too coarse and unable to cater for this resolution requirement. Downscaling coarse spatial resolution satellite soil moisture retrievals is a feasible option to meet the required level of spatial resolution for those applications. The main focus of this study is to compare two soil thermal inertia-based downscaling models, built by using long-term time records of (i) point scale in-situ data and, (ii) 25 km resolution Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land surface model outputs. The developed models were tested over Goulburn River catchment in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, Australia to downscale Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 36 km radiometric product into 1 km resolution. The downscaled SMAP product from both models produced encouraging results with unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSEs) of 0.07-0.10 cm(3)/cm(3), against in-situ field data, and an average ubRMSEs of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) when compared to the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE'05) soil moisture retrievals. Both models showed promising results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, but with their own strengths and weaknesses. The findings here provide useful insights on the robustness of the soil thermal inertia relationship across scales and the effects of the model resolution to the downscaled soil moisture estimates. The approach demonstrated encouraging results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution.

AB A reservoir operation chart is effective in guiding the actual operation of reservoirs. With the development and construction of large-scale mixed reservoirs, operating reservoirs using multiple objective operations has become a hot issue. This study, therefore, improved and expanded the traditional energy storage operation chart (ESOC) model for pure cascade reservoirs based to the special relationships between hydraulics and water volume of the upstream and downstream reservoirs in a mixed reservoir system. Considering the objectives of flood control, energy generation (including power generation, guaranteed output, and assurance rate), and ecological flow, a multi-objective ESOC optimization model for large-scale mixed reservoirs is established, and the corresponding solving method for this model is proposed. Taking the Pearl river basin of China as an example, the multi objective Pareto fronts of different minimum discharges of upstream reservoirs are obtained. According to the actual operation demands and constraints, the optimal multi-objective schemes under different assurance rates and different ecological flow satisfaction rates are extracted based on the obtained Pareto fronts. For example, if the assurance rate of power generation is required to be equal to or greater than 90% and the ecological flow, the satisfaction rate of downstream control sections is required to be equal to or greater than 0.97, the scheme is the best when the minimum discharge of upstream reservoirs is 300 m(3)/s, and the corresponding power generation and guaranteed output are 58.989 x 10(8) kWh and 439 GW, respectively. On the whole, the proposed models and related results have significance for the actual operation of large-scale mixed reservoirs.

AB This study presents a methodology for the estimation of a-priori parameters of the widely used kinematic wave approximation to the unsteady, 1-D Saint-Venant equations for hydrologic flow routing. The approach is based on a multi-dimensional statistical modeling of the macro scale spatial variability of rating curve parameters using a set of geophysical factors including geomorphology, hydro-climatology and land cover/land use over the Conterminous United States. The main goal of this study was to enable prediction at ungauged locations through regionalization of model parameters. The results highlight the importance of regional and local geophysical factors in uniquely defining characteristics of each stream reach conforming to physical theory of fluvial hydraulics. The application of the estimates is demonstrated through a hydrologic modeling evaluation of a deterministic forecasting system performed on 1672 gauged basins and 47,563 events extracted from a 10-year simulation. Considering the mean concentration time of the basins of the study and the target application on flash flood forecasting, the skill of the flow routing simulations is significantly high for peakflow and timing of peakflow estimation, and shows consistency as indicated by the large sample verification. The resulting a-priori estimates can be used in any hydrologic model that employs the kinematic wave model for flow routing. Furthermore, probabilistic estimates of kinematic wave parameters are enabled based on uncertainty information that is generated during the multi-dimensional statistical modeling. More importantly, the methodology presented in this study enables the estimation of the kinematic wave model parameters anywhere over the globe, thus allowing flood modeling in ungauged basins at regional to global scales.

AB Detailed measurements of the piezometric head from sand flume experiments of an idealised coastal aquifer forced by a simple harmonic boundary condition across a vertical boundary are presented. The measurements focus on the pore pressures very close to the interface (x = 0.01 m) and throw light on the details of the boundary condition, particularly with respect to meniscus suction and seepage face formation during the falling tide. Between the low and the mean water level, the response is consistent with meniscus suction free models in terms of both the vertical mean head and oscillation amplitude profiles and is consistent with the observation that this area of the interface was generally within the seepage face. Above the mean water level, the influence of meniscus formation is significant with the mean pressure head being less than that predicted by capillary free theory and oscillation amplitudes decaying faster than predicted by suction free models. The reduced hydraulic conductivity in this area due to partial drainage of pores on the falling tide also causes a delay in the response to the rising tide. The combined influence of seepage face formation, meniscus suction and reduced hydraulic conductivity generate higher harmonics with amplitudes of up to 26% of the local main harmonic. To model the influence of seepage face formation and meniscus suction a numerical solution of the Richards' equation was developed and evaluated against the data. The model-data comparison shows a good agreement with the behaviour high above the water table sensitive to the choice of moisture retention parameters.

AB Hyetographs, hydrographs, pollutographs, and deicing agent applications are analyzed with linear reservoir theory to explain the fate and transport of water and chloride in a small (1 km(2)) urban watershed subbasin. The subbasin delivers highway runoff to a public supply reservoir in eastern Massachusetts. Aquifer, vadose zone, and highway drainage systems deliver hydrographs with physically plausible exponential decay constants and seasonally varying discharge fractions. Continuous data from November 2005 to August 2012 suggest that baseflow contributes 48% of the water volume past a USGS gaging station at the subbasin outlet, while interflow and runoff calibration of 162 hydrographs yield respective water volume estimates of 21% and 31%. Specific conductivity, also measured continuously at the gage, is a surrogate for dissolved chloride concentration. The average chloride concentration for the 82 month period of record is 0.334 kg Cl-/m(3) at the gage, which exceeds the USEPA secondary drinking water standard of 0.250 kg Cl-/m(3) for dissolved chloride. Model calibration of 162 pollutographs suggests that baseflow contributes 61% of the chloride mass past the gage over the period of record, while the interflow and runoff chloride mass fractions are 17% and 22%. Most (85%) of the chloride flux past the gage is attributable to state application of chloride based deicing agents on major highways, with the remaining 15% due to municipal applications on local streets in the subbasin. A perennial stream with a small, urban watershed in a cold climate is likely to discharge an appreciable flux of subsurface chloride all year long. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB From the non iterative numerical method proposed by [Ross, P.J., 2003. Modeling soil water and solute transport-fast, simplified numerical solutions. Agronomy Journal 95, 1352-1361] for solving the ID Richards' equation, an unsaturated zone module for large scale hydrological model is developed by the inclusion of a root extraction module and a formulation of interception. Two root water uptake modules, first proposed by [Lai, C.-T. and Katul, G., 2000. The dynamic role of rott-water uptake in coupling potential to actual transpiration. Adv. Water Res. 23: 427-439; Li, K.Y., De Jong, R. and Boisvert, J.B., 2001. An exponential root-water-uptake model with water stress compensation. J. Hydrol. 252: 189-204], were included as the sink term in the Richards' equation. They express root extraction as a linear function of potential transpiration and take into account water stress and compensation mechanism allowing water to be extracted in wetter layers.
   The vadose zone module is tested in a systematic way with synthetic data sets covering a wide range of soil characteristics, climate forcing, and vegetation cover. A detailed SVAT model providing an accurate solution of the coupled heat and water transfer in the soil and the surface energy balance is used as a reference. The accuracy of the numerical solution using only the SVAT soil module, and the loss of accuracy when using a potential evapotranspiration instead of solving the energy budget are both investigated.
   The vadose zone module is very accurate with errors of less than a few percent for cumulative transpiration. Soil evaporation is less accurately simulated as it leads to a systematic underestimation of soil evaporation amounts. The [Lai, C.-T. and Katul, G., 2000. The dynamic role of rott-water uptake in coupling potential to actual transpiration. Adv. Water Res. 23: 427-439] module is not adapted for sandy soils, due to a weakness in the compensation term formulation. When using a potential evapotranspiration instead of the surface energy balance, we evidenced a difference in partitioning the energy between the soil and the vegetation. A Beer-Lambert law is not able to take into account the complex interactions at the soil-vegetation-atmopshere interface. However, under field conditions, the accuracy of the vadose zone module is satisfactory provided that a correct crop coefficient could be defined.
   As a conclusion the numerical method proposed by [Ross, P.J., 2003. Modeling soil water and solute Transport-fast, simplified numerical solutions. Agronomy Journal 95, 1352-1361] coupled with the [Li, K.Y., De Jong, R. and Boisvert, J.B., 2001. An exponential root-water-uptake model with water stress compensation. J.

AB Precise estimation of flow conveyance in a two-stage open channel with vegetated floodplains is a key prerequisite to the management of the river ecosystem and the creation of flood retention space. The presence of vegetation alters the structure of water flow and affects the discharge in a two-stage channel. Nevertheless, the effect of vegetation on flow conveyance is not studied separately in the previous flow discharge research. By conducting force analysis in a control volume with considering the vegetation drag force and quantifying the energy loss caused by vegetation blocking effect and the transverse velocity gradient, this paper proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in compound channel covered with vegetation based on the relationship which is the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by the local flow. Experimental data series are collected to verify the new method by comparing the measured and estimated discharges and it presents a good accuracy with 2.47% relative error. The new method is also compared with the other methods, which quantify the additional resistance of vegetation by using the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient. The results indicate that both the vegetation drag force and the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient can be used in flow conveyance estimation and dominantly influence the accuracy of the predictive method so that they need to be properly quantified and calibrated. And adopting the vegetation drag force is suggested here for the simplicity of calculation.

AB Many urbanized areas in the world are using artificial recharge basins (ARB) as an efficient solution to maintain adequate groundwater recharge while coping with flooding problems. The effective management of these basins to adequately maintain their functionality over mid-to-long term requires a suitable monitoring network. Here, we explored the use of a temporal satellite analysis to closely evaluate the efficiency of the ARB in terms of infiltration capacity, depending on hydraulic conditions of the topsoil transitioning from unclogged to clogged conditions in the ARB.
   COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were integrated with ground data and numerical modeling to advance the capability for monitoring low water levels and flooded areas within the ARB. The understanding of biofilm development and effects was achieved by identifying anomalous drawdown phases, by constraining ponding boundary conditions in the numerical model, and by estimating subsequent infiltration rate changes under progressive clogging.
   With appropriate meteorological conditions (consecutive rainfall events separated by few dry days), the biofilm could develop rapidly and cover large surfaces (e.g., 22 ha) in about two months. During this process, the hydraulic conductivity of the basin surface could decrease by more than three orders of magnitude, completely altering the relationship with the local groundwater regime. Quantitative estimation of the evolution of the infiltration rate provides crucial insights about the overall recharge behavior of ARBs to make reliable economical plans in both the design and monitoring phase.

AB The relationships between the evaporation from a medium size (168.7 km(2)) Lake Kinneret (Northern Israel), and its governing synoptic factors are well demonstrated during the summer of 2010. During July-August the daily temperature of the air and water surface were similar to 2-4 degrees C higher, the daily wind over the lake was similar to 80% weaker, and the evaporation from the lake was similar to 5% lower than the long-term July-August mean. In this study, we explore the impact of the regional and local synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions on the evaporation from the lake during exceptionally hot days in the mid-summer months (July-August). The factors that were found to be correlated with the lake evaporation are the temperatures at 850 hPa (negative) and 500 hPa (positive), the sea level pressure difference between Northern Egypt and Armenia (positive), and the height of the marine inversion (positive). Synoptic analysis indicates that two conditions are responsible for the reduction of the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (MSB) during exceptionally hot days, and consequently to the reduction of evaporation from the lake. First, the weakening of the permanent synoptic Etesian winds, which otherwise supports the inland penetration of the MSB; and second, the descent of the marine inversion to a height below the topographic ridge of the Galilee Mountains upwind of the study area, which blocks the Marine Sea Breeze from reaching Lake Kinneret.

AB Soil burn severity has been widely used to describe the impacts of fire on soils and is increasingly being recognised as a decisive factor controlling post-fire erosion rates. However, there is no unique definition of the term and the relationship between soil burn severity and post-fire hydrological and erosion response has not yet been fully established.
   The objective of this work was to review the existing literature on the role of soil burn severity on post-fire runoff and erosion ratios. To this end, a meta-analysis was carried out of the runoff and inter-rill erosion data from field rainfall simulation experiments (RSE's) that compared burnt and unburnt conditions. In this study, 109 individual observations were analysed that covered a wide geographical range, various types of land cover (forest, shrubland, and grassland) and two types of fire types (wildfire and prescribed fire). The effect size of the post-fire runoff and erosion response was determined for four key factors: (i) soil burn severity; (ii) time-since-fire; (iii) rainfall intensity; and (iv) bare soil cover.
   Statistical meta-analysis showed that fire occurrence had a significant effect on the hydrological and erosive response. However, this effect was only significantly higher with increasing soil burn severity for inter-rill erosion, and not for runoff. This study furthermore highlighted the incoherencies between existing burn severity classifications, and proposed an unambiguous classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Generation of synthetic seasonal hydrographs for a large river basin

ID FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; FLOOD; MODEL
AB This paper describes a methodology for the generation of synthetic seasonal stage hydrographs with a number of flood waves for a large braided river basin based on statistical analysis of the historical stage records. The synthetic seasonal hydrographs in a river is required for different purposes such as assessing the hydraulic performances of various river training structures, morphological predictions, environmental impact analysis. The typical stage hydrograph of such a river has two components: flood waves and seasonal (monsoonal) response. Using historical stage records, flood waves in a seasonal stage record were identified and their characteristics were approximated using Maxwell distribution. The extracted characteristics of flood waves such as time of occurrence and successive flood lifts were analysed with various probability distribution function to find out their best distribution. The frequency analysis of the annual maximum flood lift was carried out. Beside this, seasonal responses were also approximated using Maxwell distribution. A relationship between the seasonal lift and total monsoonal rainfall was established. For a given total seasonal rainfall and return period of annual maximum flood wave lift, synthetic seasonal hydrograph is generated by superimposing both seasonal response and flood waves. The generated hydrographs are evaluated by comparing the cumulative frequency function of river stage and relative frequency of daily stage changes (rise/fall) for three seasons with different flood wave return periods, at two river gauging stations for the river Brahmaputra, India.

AB Knowledge of dynamics of profile soil moisture is of importance for soil moisture prediction and modeling. However, information on the relationships between soil moisture at the surface and subsurface layers is relatively inadequate. The objective of this study was to examine the similarities in the overall and scale specific temporal patterns of soil moisture across soil profile. Soil moisture was measured at five soil depths using time-domain reflectometry in two sampling plots over 242 days in a karst depression. Spearman rank correlation and wavelet coherency analyzes were used to determine overall and scale-dependent similarities of temporal patterns of soil moisture, respectively. Results showed that soil moisture in farmland was higher than grassland especially in 10-50 cm depths. The surface depth had higher variability for both farmland and grassland. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between any two soil depths were significant, indicating strong depth persistence in the overall temporal pattern of soil moisture. The similarity decreased as the distance between depths increased. Wavelet coherency analysis indicated that soil moisture temporal pattern had a higher depth persistence in the farmland than grassland. Soil depth had a larger influence than land uses on the similarity in soil moisture temporal pattern, and the relative humidity and precipitation had larger effect than air temperature controlling the change of soil moisture at larger scales. These scale specific similarity in the temporal pattern of soil moisture can be used to guide estimating deeper soil moisture and to improve sampling strategies for soil moisture prediction with a higher prediction accuracy.

AB Recently, the characterization of soil moisture spatiotemporal variability is recommended to consider temporal soil moisture anomalies because of their distinctive behaviors with absolute soil moisture and their importance in hydrological applications. Here we characterized soil moisture spatiotemporal variability in the Yuanzegou catchment (0.58 km(2)) on the Loess Plateau of China, considering both absolute soil moisture and temporal anomalies. The dataset contained soil moisture observations in the 0-80 cm between 2009 and 2011 at 78 sampling locations. The spatial variance of time-invariant temporal means was shown to be the primary contributor (61.7-76.2%) to the total variance but the magnitude of this contribution was much lower than observed in large-scale studies. The seasonal variation in contribution can be attributed into differences in soil wetness conditions; lower contribution was found at intermediate wetness for spatial variances of temporal mean and temporal anomalies. Furthermore, the upward-convex relationship between spatial variance and spatial means of absolute soil moisture was mainly characterized by the covariance of temporal mean and temporal anomalies. Time stability of absolute soil moisture and its components were analyzed by using both the "accuracy" metric mean relative difference (MRD) and the "precision" metric variance of relative difference (VRD). As MRD was considered, time stability of absolute soil moisture primarily characterized time-invariant patterns. However, as VRD was used, the time stability of absolute soil moisture characterized only a small part of time-invariant or -variant pattern. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recharge estimations are required for efficient groundwater systems management. Better estimations could be obtained by improving our understanding of the relationship between climate factors and recharge. This study explores the calibration of a Richards' equation-based model to transient deep vadose zone data, thereby allowing simulation of groundwater recharge over long periods and an investigation of the temporal correlations between recharge and precipitation. An array of four vadose zone-monitoring systems implemented in four different slanted boreholes drilled in different orientations into a deep vadose zone sandy formation (20 m x 20 m x 20 m) enabled continuous monitoring of water content at selected depths and locations across the entire vadose zone under a Mediterranean climate. This unique high-resolution set of transient deep vadose zone data was used for inverse simulations. The flow model was then validated with a set of data under different atmospheric boundary conditions. The long-term mean annual recharge under a natural sand dune was calculated as 327 mm year(-1), 72% of the average annual precipitation (1996/7-2012/3), reflecting low evapotranspiration and runoff. The temporal cross-correlation analysis showed high correlations between the accumulated precipitation (over 69 months) and the monthly recharge after 3 to 4 months. Therefore, we conclude that the recharge fluxes are mainly influenced by the relatively recent (5-12-months) precipitation patterns. Including this time lag between precipitation and recharge, a predictive regression model was developed in which the May-to-April recharge is explained by annual precipitation in the previous year.

TI Water resource protection in Australia: Links between land use and river

DT Review
DE Watershed protection; Aquatic ecology; River health; Water quality; Land
   use; Ecosystem services

AB Stubble farming (conservation farming, minimum tillage, zero tillage) has increased in Australia over several decades with claims of improved productivity, landscape stability and environmental benefit including ecosystem services downstream, yet recent audits show a dramatic and general decline in river health. This review explores explanations for this apparent anomaly. Many confounding factors complicate interactions between land use and river condition and may disguise or over-ride the potential benefits of adoption of stubble systems or other improvements in agricultural land use practice. These factors include climate change and variability; land use changes including an increase in bushfires, growth of farm dams and afforestation; lag times between land use change and expression of benefits in river systems; use of inappropriate scale that disguises local benefit; variations in the extent of ecosystem resilience; impacts of river regulation; and impacts of introduced species. Additionally, the value of river condition and utility is complicated by different local or regional perceptions and by contrasting rural and urban outlooks. The use of indicators, risk frameworks and biophysical modelling may help elucidate the complex relationships between land use and downstream ecosystem impact. The strengthening of local, regional and catchment scale approaches is advocated. This includes the re-integration of land management and governance with water management and planning. It is encouraging that farmers are themselves developing systems to optimise trade-offs between on-farm activities and ecosystem service benefits. This approach needs to be supported and extended.

AB The prediction of streamflow at ungauged sites is one of the fundamental challenges to hydrologists today. While major progress has been made in the regionalization of statistical flow properties (e.g. extreme values), and methods for synthesis of event response at ungauged sites are widely applied, the estimation of continuous strearnflow time-series is still very uncertain. The challenge of predicting the response at ungauged sites is often met through a process of parameter regionalization. Little attention has so far been given to the impact of new insights into model identification at gauged sites, e.g. regarding the problem of structural error, on this regionalization process. Questions that are addressed in this paper are the following: (1) What is the relationship between local parameter identifiability and catchment characteristics? (2) How is the uniqueness of catchments reflected in regionalization? (3) What is the result of local model structural uncertainty on the regionalization result? (4) How can we propagate local parameter uncertainty into predictions in ungauged basins and what is the result? A case study of 10 catchments located in the southeast of England is utilized to deal with these questions. The main conclusions from this study are that the uncertainty in the locally estimated model parameters is a function of their importance in representing the response of a given catchment, model structural error hinders identification of a parameter to represent a certain process and therefore hinders the regionalization, and the uncertainty in the calibrated parameters can be propagated to ungauged sites using a weighted regression approach.

AB Citizen Science can fulfill the quest for high-quality and sufficient environmental data, such as rainfall. However, the factors affecting the quality of rainfall data collected by the citizen scientists are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effect of citizen scientists' attributes on the quality of rainfall data. For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), stepwise regression and Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR) were used. A quality control procedure was developed and applied for daily observed rainfall data collected in the summer rainy season of 2020. Attributes of the citizen scientists' were gathered for those who collected rainfall data in the urban and peri-urban Akaki catchment which is located in the Upper Awash sub-basin, Ethiopia. We found that easy-to-detect errors, which were identified during the initial stage of quality control, formed most of the errors in the rainfall data. The PCA and the stepwise regression results revealed that four dominant attributes (education level, gauge relative location, use of smartphone app, and supervisor's travel distance) highly affected the rainfall data quality. The MLR model using these four prominent dominant variables performed very well with R-2 value of 0.98. The k-fold cross validation result showed that the developed model can be used to predict the relationships between data quality and attributes of citizen scientists with high accuracy. Hence, the PCA technique, stepwise regression and MLR model can provide useful information regarding the influence of citizen scientists' attributes on rainfall data quality. Therefore, future studies should carefully consider citizen scientists' attributes when engaging and supervising citizen scientists, with a comprehensive data quality control while monitoring rainfall.

TI Calibration of river hydrodynamic models: Analysis from the dynamic

LA English
DT Article
DE Hydrodynamic modelling; Calibration; Unsteady flow; SihQual model
ID WATER-QUALITY; ESTUARY
AB Hydrodynamic modelling is an important tool for several studies, such as flood forecasting and analysis of energy and mass transport. In rivers, the most common calibration parameter is the roughness coefficient, that accounts for the friction term. However, while uncertainties are associated to this parameter definition, it is often defined as constant over time or space. Even though sophisticated techniques are available for model calibration, unsteady flow routing applications usually involve simplified methods, such as trial-and-error and Monte Carlo strategies. These practices can be subjective, time consuming and dependent on user experience; on the other hand, automatic approaches may generate unrealistic values and require large computational efforts. This study introduces a new strategy to calibrate one-dimensional hydrodynamic models, accounting for temporal and spatial variation while maintaining computational thrift. Among multiple random roughness coefficients, a time series is generated according to a linear relationship with observed water depths or flow for five control sections; the resulting daily series of parameters are the set for simulation inputs. The algorithm was combined with the hydrodynamic module in the SihQual model (Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Simulation); when compared to observed data, it showed to be suitable to predict discharges and water levels for different years over 85 km of the Iguacu river, located in Parana (Brazil). Compared to Monte Carlo and trial-and-error techniques for calibration, the HTC method (Hydrodynamic Temporal Calibration) was able to match their results or even improve simulations in some cases, requiring less user interaction than the other approaches. The study highlights the relevance of including a temporal component in model calibration, aiming to reduce the overall inherent uncertainty of this process.

AB The effects of vegetation restoration on the hydraulic processes of steep colluvial deposits at collapsing gullies in South China have rarely been evaluated. This study quantified the influences of canopy, biocrusts, and roots on 30 degrees deposit slopes planted with Melinis minutifora and Chrysopogon zizanioides via rainfall simulation experiments. Intact M. minutifora and C. zizanioides effectively decreased flow velocities (v) by 35.3% and 29.5%, and increased Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficients (f) by 239.6% and 130.8% compared to that of the control treatments, respectively. The roots of M. minutifora contributed most to the decrease of v and the increase off, while roots and canopy of C. zizanioides decreased v and increased f to the greatest extents, respectively. Biocrusts increased f and decreased v for all rain intensities when they were combined with roots. However, when they grew on bare slopes, these positive effects were only observed in response to 60 mm h(-1) rain events, but were reversed for 120, and 180 mm h(-1) rain events. Canopy decreased flow shear stress (tau) and stream power (omega), while roots showed a contrasting result, and the effects of biocrusts varied on different slopes. The influences of plants and components also varied with rain intensities. Sediment yield rates showed significant relationships with v, Re, tau, and omega and could be predicted using linear regression of r or to. This study highlights the effects of canopies, roots of different vegetation types, and biocrusts on the hydraulic process on steep colluvial deposit. The presented results aid the decision-making and management of vegetation restoration of collapsing gullies.

AB This study links the changing hydrology in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB) caused by accelerated dam construction to a dietary shift from fish to land-animal meat (meat hereafter) as a primary source of protein. A shift toward a westernized diet in the LMRB countries (i.e., Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam) has been observed in the recent past. However, neither the hydrological changes from dam construction as a cause for the dietary shift nor the effects of increasing shift from fish to meat on virtual water have been adequately studied. Here, we derive a univariate relationship between fish catch and flooded areas by using a hydrodynamic model and yearly fish catch data. We find a strong correlation between catch per capita and yearly flood occurrence in the LMRB. Results suggest that fish catch in the Tonle Sap Lake region may reduce by similar to 8% under a scenario of altered flood occurrence caused by potential reduction in peak flow in the main stem Mekong by 50%. The same reduction in peak flow could, however, lead to an increase in catch within a larger LMRB subregion but such increase would be marginal. Next, based on the historical production and consumption of meat, we find an increase in meat production and consumption per capita over time. Further, analysis of land use change suggests a 2% cropland expansion mainly due to an increase in meat production. Finally, from the virtual water trade (VWT) network we find that the total VWT of the LMRB tripled from 1988 to 2016 due to a significant rise in trade partners.

AB Climate change has the potential to significantly alter the characteristics of high-intensity, short-duration rainfall events, potentially leading to more severe and more frequent flash floods. Research has shown that future changes to such events could far exceed expectations based on temperature scaling and basic physical principles alone, but that computationally expensive convection-permitting models are required to accurately simulate sub-daily extreme rainfall events. It is therefore crucial to be able to model future changes to sub-daily duration extreme rainfall events as cost effectively as possible, especially in Australia where such information is scarce. In this study, we seek to determine what the shortest duration of extreme rainfall is that can be simulated by a less computationally expensive convection-parametrizing Regional Climate Model (RCM). We examine the ability of the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM), a similar to 10 km high-resolution convection-parametrizing RCM, to reproduce sub-daily Intensity-Frequency-Duration (IFD) curves corresponding to two long-term observational stations in the Australian island state of Tasmania, and examine the future model projections. We find that CCAM simulates observed extreme rainfall statistics well for 3-h durations and longer, challenging the current understanding that convection-permitting models are needed to accurately model sub-daily extreme rainfall events. Further, future projections from CCAM for the end of this Century show that extreme sub-daily rainfall intensities could increase by more than 15% per degrees C, far exceeding the 7% scaling estimate predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron vapour pressure relationship and the 5% scaling estimate recommended by the Australian Rainfall and Runoff guide.

TI Hydrologic response to stormwater control measures in urban watersheds

AB Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are designed to mitigate deleterious effects of urbanization on river networks, but our ability to predict the cumulative effect of multiple SCMs at watershed scales is limited. The most widely used metric to quantify impacts of urban development, total imperviousness (TI), does not contain information about the extent of stormwater control. We analyzed the discharge records of 16 urban watersheds in Charlotte, NC spanning a range of TI (4.1-54%) and area mitigated with SCMs (13-89%). We then tested multiple watershed metrics that quantify the degree of urban impact and SCM mitigation to determine which best predicted hydrologic response across sites. At the event time scale; linear models showed TI to be the best predictor of both peak unit discharge and rainfall-runoff ratios across a range of storm sizes. TI was also a strong driver of both a watershed's capacity to buffer small (e.g., 110 mm) rain events, and the relationship between peak discharge and precipitation once that buffering capacity is exceeded. Metrics containing information about SCMs did not appear as primary predictors of event hydrologic response, suggesting that the level of SCM mitigation in many urban watersheds is insufficient to influence hydrologic response. Over annual timescales, impervious surfaces unmitigated by SCMs and tree coverage were, best correlated with streamfiow flashiness and water yield, respectively. The shift in controls from the event scale to the annual scale has important implications for water resource management, suggesting that overall limitation of watershed imperviousness rather than partial mitigation by SCMs may be necessary to alleviate the hydrologic impacts of urbanization.

AB The concentrations and Loading characteristics of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) in runoff from a 50.1-ha rice paddy field watershed in South Korea were investigated for eight storm events during the 1998-2001 growing seasons. TN concentrations in total runoff were inversely related to discharge, except in periods with high fertilization rates. In contrast, TP concentrations were strongly proportional to discharge under non-ponded paddy conditions, but not correlated with discharge under most ponded paddy conditions. Stormflow and irrigation return flow were separated from total runoff using the constant-discharge method. The flow-weighted mean TN concentration in stormflow was tower than that in irrigation return flow, mainly because of rainwater dilution, except for periods with a residual fertilizer effect. The flow-weighted mean TP concentration in stormflow however, was always higher than that in irrigation return flow, Likely a result of sediment-associated phosphorus transport. The ratio of mean TP concentration in stormflow to that in irrigation return flow under ponded paddy conditions (1.6) was approximately one-half that under non-ponded conditions (3.1), suggesting that ponding on paddy fields played an important rote in reducing soil erosion-related phosphorus export. Relationships between TN Loads and stormflow runoff volumes were found except during a storm event in the high fertilization period (p < 0.05). TP loads were also correlated with stormflow runoff volumes (p < 0.05), except for storm events under non-ponded and dry antecedent conditions. These results indicate that nitrogen runoff from paddy field watersheds depends on fertilization rates, white phosphorus runoff is controlled by ponding conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Unprecedented alterations in precipitation characteristics over the last century and especially in the last two decades have posed serious socio-economic problems to society in terms of hydro-meteorological extremes, in particular flooding and droughts. The origin of these alterations has its roots in changing climatic conditions; however, its threatening implications can only be dealt with through meticulous planning that is based on realistic and skillful decadal precipitation predictions (DPPs). Skillful DPPs represent a very challenging prospect because of the complexities associated with precipitation predictions. Because of the limited skill and coarse spatial resolution, the DPPs provided by General Circulation Models (GCMs) fail to be directly applicable for impact assessment. Here, we focus on nine GCMs and quantify the seasonally and regionally averaged skill in DPPs over the continental United States. We address the problems pertaining to the limited skill and resolution by applying linear and kernel regression-based statistical downscaling approaches. For both the approaches, statistical relationships established over the calibration period (1961-1990.) are applied to the retrospective and near future decadal predictions by GCMs to obtain DPPs at 4 km resolution. The skill is quantified across different metrics that evaluate potential skill, biases, long-term statistical properties, and uncertainty. Both the statistical approaches show improvements with respect to the raw GCM data, particularly in terms of the long-term statistical properties and uncertainty, irrespective of lead time. The outcome of the study is monthly DPPs from nine GCMs with 4-km spatial resolution, which can be used as a key input for impacts assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large and numerous landslides can result in widespread impacts which are felt particularly strongly in the largely subsistence-orientated communities residing in the most landslide-prone areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Understanding the characteristics of rainfall preceding these landslide events is essential for the development of appropriate early warning systems and forecasting models. Relationships between rainfall and landslides are frequently complex and uncertainties tend to be amplified by inconsistent and incomplete landslide catalogues and sparse rainfall data availability. To address some of these uncertainties a modified Bayesian technique has been used, in conjunction with the multiple time frames method, to produce thresholds of landslide probability associated with rainfall events of specific magnitude and duration. Satellite-derived precipitation estimates have been used to derive representative rainfall accumulations and intensities over a range of different rainfall durations (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days) for rainfall events which resulted in landslides and those which did not result in landslides. Of the two parameter combinations (accumulation-duration and intensity-duration) analysed, rainfall accumulation and duration provide the best scope for identifying probabilistic thresholds for use in landslide warning and forecasting in PNG. Analysis of historical events and rainfall characteristics indicates that high accumulation (>250 mm), shorter duration (<15 days) rainfall events and long duration (>75 days), high accumulation (>1200 mm) rainfall events are more likely to lead to moderate- to high-impact landslides. This analysis has produced the first proxy probability thresholds for landslides in PNG and their application within an early warning framework has been discussed.

AB In this study, groundwater spring potential maps produced by three different methods, frequency ratio, weights of evidence, and logistic regression, were evaluated using validation data sets and compared to each other. Groundwater spring occurrence potential maps in the Sultan Mountains (Konya, Turkey) were constructed using the relationship between groundwater spring locations and their causative factors. Groundwater spring locations were identified in the study area from a topographic map. Different thematic maps of the study area, such as geology, topography, geomorphology, hydrology, and land use/cover, have been used to identify groundwater potential zones. Seventeen spring-related parameter layers of the entire study area were used to generate groundwater spring potential maps. These are geology (lithology), fault density, distance to fault, relative permeability of lithologies, elevation, slope aspect, slope steepness, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport capacity index, drainage density, distance to drainage, land use/cover, and precipitation. The predictive capability of each model was determined by the area under the relative operating characteristic curve. The areas under the curve for frequency ratio, weights of evidence and logistic regression methods were calculated as 0.903, 0.880, and 0.840, respectively. These results indicate that frequency ratio and weights of evidence models are relatively good estimators, whereas logistic regression is a relatively poor estimator of groundwater spring potential mapping in the study area. The frequency ratio model is simple; the process of input, calculation and output can be readily understood. The produced groundwater spring potential maps can serve planners and engineers in groundwater development plans and land-use planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many models have been developed in previous studies for predicting the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. However, most of them were linear or log-linear regression models, and generated based on simulated disinfection of source water or treated water in a laboratory other than real tap water, which shows low application potential in practice. In this study, a radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF ANN) as well as the hybrid method of RBF ANN and grey relational analysis (GRA) was proposed to predict trihalomethanes (THMs) levels in real distribution systems. A total of 64 sets of data including THM5 levels (trichloromethane (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM) and total-THMs (T-THMs)) and 8 water quality parameters (temperature, pH, UV absorbance at 254 (UVA(254)), dissolved organic carbon, bromide, residual free chlorine, nitrite and ammonia) were used to train and verify the proposed model. As compared to linear and log-linear regression models (r(p) = 0.254-0.659; N-25 = 46-78%), RBF ANN5 for THM5 (TCM, BDCM and T-THMs) prediction consistently show higher regression coefficients (r(p) = 0.760-0.925) and prediction accuracy (N-25 = 92-98%), which indicates the high capability of RBF ANN to learn the complex non-linear relationships involved THM5 formation. Further analysis shows that RBF ANN5 using fewer water quality parameters based on GRA still make excellent performance in THM5 prediction (r(p) = 0.760-0.946; N-25 = 92-98%). This result demonstrates that GRA can be an effective technique to facilitate the generation of sound RBF ANN models with fewer factors.

AB On atoll islands, fresh groundwater occurs as a buoyant lens-shaped body surrounded by saltwater derived from the sea, forming the main freshwater source for many island communities. A review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals framework before the year 2030. In this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. Over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. We find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. Methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three-dimensional density-dependent models. Generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. Major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea-level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. We find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs.

AB In this study, we use a finite difference method to solve low velocity non-Darcian flow to a well in the first kind of leaky aquifer system. Flow in the confined aquifer is assumed to be Darcian and horizontal, whereas flow in the aquitard is assumed to be non-Darcian and vertical. The threshold hydraulic gradient existence of non-Darcian flow in low permeability porous media is employed to describe the non-Darcian flow in the aquitard. A numerical solution has been obtained by using a finite difference method. This solution is compared with the previous solution for Darcian flow case in leaky aquifer system. The error has been analyzed. The comparison of this study and Darcian flow case (Hantush and Jacob, 1955) in leaky aquifer system indicates that the error is very small and can be neglected. However, the hydrogeological parameter calculation of leaky aquifer system is remarkably influenced by low velocity non-Darcian flow in aquitard. For the inflection point method (Hantush, 1956), the absolute values of estimated errors for coefficient of transmissibility of confined aquifer and vertical hydraulic conductivity of aquitard show negative relationship with the pumping rate. For the type curve-fitting method (Walton, 1962), the estimated errors for coefficient of transmissibility and elastic drainable porosity of confined aquifer are very small under small pumping rate. In general, the estimated errors for coefficient of transmissibility and elastic drainable porosity of confined aquifer can be controlled under certain level through adjusting pumping rate. The estimated error of vertical hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is quite large no matter which method is used, even up to nearly 300%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of proper parameterizations of spatial heterogeneity is required for precipitation-runoff models. However, relevant studies with a specific aim at hourly runoff simulation in boreal mountainous catchments are not common.
   We conducted calibration and evaluation of hourly runoff simulation in a boreal mountainous watershed based on six different parameterizations of the spatial heterogeneity of subsurface storage capacity for a semi-distributed (subcatchments hereafter called elements) and distributed (1 x 1 km(2) grid) setup. We evaluated representation of element-to-element, grid-to-grid, and probabilistic subcatchment/subbasin, subelement and subgrid heterogeneities.
   The parameterization cases satisfactorily reproduced the streamflow hydrographs with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values for the calibration and validation periods up to 0.84 and 0.86 respectively, and similarly for the log-transformed streamflow up to 0.85 and 0.90. The parameterizations reproduced the flow duration curves, but predictive reliability in terms of quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots indicated marked over and under predictions. The simple and parsimonious parameterizations with no subelement or no subgrid heterogeneities provided equivalent simulation performance compared to the more complex cases. The results indicated that (i) identification of parameterizations require measurements from denser precipitation stations than what is required for acceptable calibration of the precipitation-streamflow relationships, (ii) there is challenges in the identification of parameterizations based on only calibration to catchment integrated streamflow observations and (iii) a potential preference for the simple and parsimonious parameterizations for operational forecast contingent on their equivalent simulation performance for the available input data. In addition, the effects of non-identifiability of parameters (interactions and equifinality) can contribute to the non-identifiability of the parameterizations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bayesian Networks (BNs) are powerful tools for assessing and predicting consequences of water management scenarios and uncertain drivers like climate change, integrating available scientific knowledge with the interests of the multiple stakeholders. However, among their major limitations, the non-transient treatment of the cause-effect relationship stands out. A Decision Support System (DSS) based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is proposed here aimed to palliate that limitation through time slicing technique. The DSS comprises several classes (Object-Oriented BN networks), especially designed for future 5 years length time steps (time slices), covering a total control period of 30 years (2070-2100). The DSS has been developed for assessing impacts generated by different Climate Change (CC) scenarios (generated from several Regional Climatic Models (RCMs) under two emission scenarios, A1B and A2) in an aquifer system (Serral-Salinas) affected by intensive groundwater use over the last 30 years. A calibrated continuous water balance model was used to generate hydrological CC scenarios, and then a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) was employed in order to analyze the aquifer behavior under CC conditions. Results obtained from both models were used as input for the DSS, considering rainfall, aquifer recharge, variation of piezometric levels and temporal evolution of aquifer storage as the main hydrological components of the aquifer system. Results show the evolution of the aquifer storage for each future time step under different climate change conditions and under controlled water management interventions. This type of applications would allow establishing potential adaptation strategies for aquifer systems as the CC comes into effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural intra-annual flow fluctuations vary between rivers, being a determining factor for aquatic insects, fish and riparian communities which are adapted to the habitat conditions and different flows throughout the seasons. Moreover, restoration of seasonal flow patterns plays an important role in achieving good ecological status of rivers, through the preservation and/or recovery of components and processes of natural river ecosystems. In this work we: (a) classify fluvial segments in the Ebro basin (North-Eastern Spain) according to the intra-annual variability of flows under natural conditions using statistical cluster analysis of monthly mean flow data; (b) characterise the resulting flow typologies according to several ecologically important hydrological variables; (c) analyse the relationships between flow regimes of fluvial segments and physical variables from their catchments; and finally (d) predict the most probable natural flow regime using logistic models based on the most determinant physical characteristics. Fifteen natural flow typologies were described in the Ebro basin, which were characterised in terms of flow fluctuation through the year as well as timing, flow ratio and duration of the maximum and minimum flows. Precipitation, biogeography and geology of catchments showed the highest correlations with flow regimes. Basin size, mean elevation and slope were also correlated. The logistic model we developed had a prediction success of 72% in the Ebro basin. The definition of the natural hydrological conditions (to which the biological communities are tailored), even when flow data are not available, is an important support in the management of river ecosystems. It is especially suitable for setting goals in aquatic ecosystem conservation or restoration projects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An accurate prediction of sediment yield at the watershed scale is critical not only for sustainable watershed management but also for improving knowledge regarding the relationship between sediment yield and its determinant factors, which often rely on the varying model complexity. In this study, a modified sediment yield formula based on the modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) model was developed by introducing a channel factor into the original formula. The reliability of the proposed method was tested using data from 1,341 storm events in 38 watersheds and was applied to 256 storm events in five application watersheds using the optimized parameters. Results indicated that the proposed method is very accurate, as demonstrated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 88.18 %, 85.72 %, and 85.51 % during calibration, validation, and application, respectively. The performance of the proposed model was superior to that of the original MUSLE model. Subsequently, the proposed method was used to predict sediment yield from the last five typical wa-tersheds. This prediction utilized the parameters derived from the initial 38 watersheds; the peak discharge predicted by the modified Chemicals, Runoff, and Erosion from Agricultural Management Systems (CREAMS); and the runoff estimated by the modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. Elevated NSE (61.88-81.42 %) and low root mean square error values (2.35-11.40 t ha- 1) were calculated for the five watersheds. From the results, the proposed sediment yield model, combined with the modified SCS-CN method and CREAMS, was found to accurately predict the event-based sediment yield, peak discharge, and runoff in the Loess Plateau region under varying hydrological and geomorphic conditions.

AB The decision to use either daily-averaged or sub-daily streamflow records has the potential to impact the calculation of sediment transport metrics and stream channel design. Using bedload and suspended load sediment transport measurements collected at 138 sites across the United States, we calculated the effective discharge, sediment yield, and half-load discharge using sediment rating curves over long time periods (median record length = 24 years) with both daily-averaged and sub-daily streamflow records. A comparison of sediment transport metrics calculated with both daily-average and sub-daily stream flow data at each site showed that daily-averaged flow data do not adequately represent the magnitude of high stream flows at hydrologically flashy sites. Daily-average stream flow data cause an underestimation of sediment transport and sediment yield (including the half-load discharge) at flashy sites. The degree of underestimation was correlated with the level of flashiness and the exponent of the sediment rating curve. No consistent relationship between the use of either daily-average or sub-daily streamflow data and the resultant effective discharge was found. When used in channel design, computed sediment transport metrics may have errors due to flow data resolution, which can propagate into design slope calculations which, if implemented, could lead to unwanted aggradation or degradation in the design channel. This analysis illustrates the importance of using sub-daily flow data in the calculation of sediment yield in urbanizing or otherwise flashy watersheds. Furthermore, this analysis provides practical charts for estimating and correcting these types of underestimation errors commonly incurred in sediment yield calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   DESCRIPTORS
AB Distributed hydrological models have the capability to incorporate spatially variable inputs, to represent spatial heterogeneity of catchments and to generate outputs at interior locations. However calibrating a distributed model is challenging so much so that a less powerful lumped model is often preferred. This paper describes a method of calibrating a semi-distributed model based on regionalisation of parameters, maintaining as far as possible their physical meaning, and applying spatial multipliers to optimise performance. A semi-distributed implementation of the Probability Distributed Moisture (PDM) model is employed using hourly data from the Upper Lee catchment, UK. Regression relationships between known catchment descriptors (land cover, soil type, climate and topography) and parameters of the PDM are developed using 10 gauged subcatchments and applied to give prior estimates of the parameters at smaller ungauged subcatchment scales. These prior estimates are adjusted using multipliers which are spatially uniform for each parameter. The analysis reveals that the semi-distributed PDM usually (but not always) performs better than a lumped version at gauged points in the catchment, without the introduction of additional degrees of freedom into the calibration. This result applies even when the rainfall input is assumed uniform over the catchment. However, predictions at ungauged points are poor, and the scope for using for additional sources of information, including using more physics based model components and the outputs of broader scale regionalisation studies, is discussed. Results also highlight the sensitivity of the model parameter estimates to the number of gauged catchments used in the regression analysis and to uncertainty associated with parameter equifinality.

AB It is generally accepted that the seasonal cycle of precipitation and temperature in cordillera of the western US exhibits a north-south pattern for annual, interannual and decadal time scales related to large-scale climate patterns. In this paper we explore these relationships, with special attention to the role of local and regional physiographic, hydrogeologic and anthropogenic conditions on low-frequency climate and terrestrial response modes. The goal is to try to understand the spatio-temporal structure in historical precipitation, temperature and stream flow records (P-T-Q) in terms of climate, physiography, hydrogeology, and human impacts. Spatial coherence in time series is examined by classification of factor loadings from principal component analysis. Classification pattern of P-T-Q stations indicate that local physiography, the hydrogeology, and anthropogenic factors transform atmospheric forcing and terrestrial response into unique clusters. To study the temporal structure, dominant low-frequency oscillatory modes are identified for a region from historical P-T-Q records using singular spectrum analysis. Noise-free time trajectories are reconstructed from the extracted low-frequency modes (seasonal-decadal) for each contributing watershed area corresponding to stream flow observation stations, and the phase-plane plots are obtained. Together, the spatial classification and phase plane provides a means of detecting how large-scale hydroclimatic patterns relate to major landforms and anthropogenic impacts across the CRB. The main result of this paper is that resolving the relative impact of basin-wide patterns of climate, physiography and anthropogenic factors (irrigation, dams, etc.) on runoff response can be a useful tool for detection and attribution for each source of variability.

AB A grid or cell based process oriented distributed rainfall-runoff model capable of handling the catchment heterogeneity in terms of distributed information on landuse, slope, soil and rainfall is developed and applied to isolated storm events in several catchments. Model inputs such as slope, flow direction and overland flow sequencing (drainage path) are generated for each cell of the catchment using a digital elevation model and information about landuse, soil, etc. were derived through digital analysis of satellite data and published information. The input variables for each cell area are provided to the model through geographic information system. Infiltration in cell areas is computed by Philip two-term infiltration model, the parameters of which were determined mainly through the information on soil type in the cell. The mechanics of overland flow is described by the diffusion wave approximation of St Venant equations which are numerically solved for depth of flow and runoff by the method of finite volume. The model utilizes a relationship explaining the dependence of flow resistance on depth of flow and surface roughness.
   Results from several catchments indicate that the model can simulate reasonably well the runoff hydrograph at the catchment outlet. The model also realistically predicts temporal variation of the spatial distribution of flow depth and runoff over the catchment. Also the grid or cell based structure of the model allows studying the effect of catchment modifications in terms of soil and landuse changes on spatial and temporal distribution of the runoff. However, the proposed model has the limitation that the values of some parameters of the model need to be obtained through calibration. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   The theory of regionalized variables enables one to point out the relationship between the spatial correlation of hydrometeorological or hydrogeological fields and the precision of interpolation, or determination of average values, over these fields.
   A new estimation method called kriging has proven to be quite well adapted to solving water resources problems.

ID CHEMICAL-TRANSFER; TRANSPORT; IMPACT
AB Surface water pollution due to solute loss from soil to surface runoff is a serious threat to the environment, and it is of great significance to predict the solute loss. While soil mixing layer theory has been widely used to predict the solute loss, it has been observed that the conventional soil mixing layer models with constant mixing layer depth underestimate solute concentration in surface runoff, and thus underestimate the solute loss after surface runoff starts. This study introduced a new soil mixing layer model with a new concept that the mixing layer depth increases downward with time after surface runoff occurs. This new concept was implemented by adding a mixing front between the soil mixing layer and its underlying soil layer, which is conceptually similar to the wetting front of soil infiltration given by the Green-Ampt equation. This is equivalent to treating the soil mixing layer as a deforming control volume. A mechanistic explanation for the new model was presented. This study also developed a closed form solution of the new model. The new model was evaluated by simulating five laboratory experiments conducted by two groups of researchers. The first two experiments have ponding water, and consider different drainage and runoff conditions at both early and late runoff times. The other three experiments do not have ponding water, and consider different infiltration conditions at the bottom of soil boxes. Simulation results of the five experiments show that the new model resolves the underestimation problem of conventional soil mixing layer models. The new model is subject to a total of six limits such as that the new model only considers conservative solute. Three limits are related to the assumptions used to derive the closed form solution, and they may be alleviated in a future research as briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE flood forecasting; neural networks; process models
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; RUNOFF
AB The Process Modelling and Artificial Intelligence for Online Flood Forecasting (PAI-OFF) methodology combines the reliability of physically based, hydrologic/hydraulic modelling with the operational advantages of artificial intelligence. These operational advantages are extremely tow computation times and straightforward operation. The basic principle of the methodology is to portray process models by means of ANN. We propose to train ANN flood forecasting models with synthetic data that reflects the possible range of storm events. To this end, establishing PAI-OFF requires first setting up a physically based hydrologic model of the considered catchment and - optionally, if backwater effects have a significant impact on the flow regime - a hydrodynamic flood routing model of the river reach in question. Both models are subsequently used for simulating at meaningful and flood relevant storm scenarios which are obtained from a catchment specific meteorological data analysis. This provides a database of corresponding input/output vectors which is then completed by generally available hydrological and meteorological data for characterizing the catchment state prior to each storm event. This database subsequently serves for training both a polynomial neural network (PoNN) - portraying the rainfall-runoff process - and a multilayer neural network (MLFN), which mirrors the hydrodynamic flood wave propagation in the river. These two ANN models replace the hydrological and hydrodynamic model in the operational mode. After presenting the theory, we apply PAI-OFF - essentially consisting of the coupled "hydrologic" PoNN and "hydrodynamic" MLFN - to the Freiberger Mulde catchment in the Erzgebirge (Ore-mountains) in East Germany (3000 km(2)). Both the demonstrated computational efficiency and the prediction reliability underline the potential of the new PAI-OFF methodology for online flood forecasting. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rapid economic development and population growth in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin makes it imperative for water resources to be used fairly and efficiently among all stakeholders. This paper proposes an integrated model framework to assess the water benefits sharing schemes among the five stakeholders in the basin, namely, China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Three objectives are considered for this assessment-hydropower (HP), eco-index (EI), and agricultural water use (AW). The hydrologic model, optimization model, and cooperative game theory methods are jointly used to analyze the water benefits of stakeholders under different scenarios. According to the model, cooperation can bring more incremental benefits in dry years when water resources are scarce. Three cooperative game theoretical methods, namely, the Shapley value, the Gately point, and the Nash-Harsanyi solution, are employed to find the possible benefit sharing solutions. The results show that China and Laos need to operate their reservoirs for downstream countries' beneficial uses under cooperation, and thus, compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit from cooperation is necessary no matter which method is used. It is found that all of the future damming plans would enhance the basin-level cooperation in most cases. In particular, according to the analysis, damming in the basins of the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong rivers would have more effect than damming in the upper Lancang-Mekong River Basin after 2030. Based on some verified assumptions, the results of this paper can offer real-world preferences, but the uncertainties need to be further explored.

AB As an important part of lake ecosystems, sediments play a key role in the carbon cycle in lakes. Due to the complex sources of organic matter in sediments, the link between sequestration and transformation of humic substance is largely unknown. Therefore, it is essential to understand the characteristics of humic substance in lake sediments. In this study, the relationship between the characteristics of humic substance and environmental conditions was found in sediment samples from six typical lakes of northeast China. The structure of humic substance (HS), fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) tended to be simplified with decreasing lake depth. Pearson analysis indicated that characteristics of humic substances in deep lake sediments were dominantly determined by nutrient factors (e.g., NO3-N, NO2-N, NH4+-N) and physicochemical factors (e.g., pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen), while the changes of HS in shallow lake sediments were dominantly determined by physicochemical factors (e.g., pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen). Variation partitioning results also indicated that nutrient factors and physicochemical factors explained 64% and 24.2% of the variations of HS content in boreal deep lakes. In comparison, physicochemical factors explained most of the variation (35.6%) of HS composition, while nutrient factors only explained 3.4% of the variation in shallow lakes. Structural equation models further confirmed that complex components were transformed into simple components by nutrient and physicochemical factors with decreasing lake depth. This study suggests that changes in environmental conditions with lake depth may result in changes in the quality of HS in lake sediments.

AB Point throughfall data were generated in two representative red oak stands of a small Madrean watershed in northeastern Mexico during the 2000 and the 2001 wet seasons. Cumulative gross precipitation for 18 selected events was 392.9 turn, while the mean cumulative point throughfall flux from 38-fixed gauges was 331.0 +/- 9.0 mm (84.2 +/- 2.3%). The influence of canopy and understory cover fraction, vegetation area index (VAI), distance to nearest tree bole, as well as the basal area and height of that tree may have on point throughfall depth were evaluated. No significant (alpha = 0.05) relationship between point throughfall and these stand characteristics could be established for gross precipitation inputs > 5 mm. However, excluding events in which occult precipitation was thought to contribute to throughfall generation, the spatial distribution of throughfall was found to be a function of at least one of these factors during each of the gross precipitation inputs < 5 mm. For gross precipitation events > 5 mm point throughfall for all but one event did not significantly deviate from the normal distribution, suggesting that stand-scale throughfall fluxes associated with these relatively larger events may be estimated from a random array of gauges. An average of 9 (range = 3-14) and 34 (range = 11-54) gauges would have been required to estimate mean event throughfall input to the red oak forest floor to within +/-10 and +/-5% at the 95% confidence level, respectively, for gross precipitation events > 5 mm.

AB Probabilistic modelling of drought events is a significant aspect of water resources management and planning. In this study, popularly applied and several relatively new bivariate Archimedean copulas were employed to derive regional and spatial based copula models to appraise drought risk in mainland China over 1961-2013. Drought duration (Dd), severity (Ds), and peak (Dp), as indicated by Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were extracted according to the run theory and fitted with suitable marginal distributions. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and curve fitting method (CFM) were used to estimate the copula parameters of nineteen bivariate Archimedean copulas. Drought probabilities and return periods were analysed based on appropriate bivariate copula in sub-region I-VII and entire mainland China. The goodness-of-fit tests as indicated by the CFM showed that copula NN19 in sub-regions III, IV, V, VI and mainland China, NN20 in sub-region I and NN13 in sub-region VII are the best for modeling drought variables. Bivariate drought probability across mainland China is relatively high, and the highest drought probabilities are found mainly in the Northwestern and Southwestern China. Besides, the result also showed that different sub-regions might suffer varying drought risks. The drought risks as observed in Sub-region III, VI and VII, are significantly greater than other sub-regions. Higher probability of droughts of longer durations in the sub-regions also corresponds to shorter return periods with greater drought severity. These results may imply tremendous challenges for the water resources management in different sub-regions, particularly the Northwestern and Southwestern China. 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; SYSTEM; SUBSIDENCE; PARAMETERS; RESPONSES; RATES;

AB Artificial recharge measures have been adopted to control the drawdown of confined aquifers and the ground subsidence caused by dewatering during deep excavation in Tianjin, Shanghai and other regions in China. However, research on recharge theory is still limited. Additionally, confined aquifers consisting of silt and silty sand in Tianjin have lower hydraulic conductivities than those consisting of sand or gravel, and the feasibility and effectiveness of recharge methods in these semiconfined aquifers urgently require investigation. A series of single-well and multiwell pumping and recharge tests was conducted at a metro station excavation site in Tianjin. The test results showed that it was feasible to recharge silt and silty sand semiconfined aquifers, and, to a certain extent, the hydrogeological parameters obtained from the pumping tests could be used to predict the water level rise during single-well recharge. However, the predicted results underestimated the water level rise near the recharge well (within 7 m) by approximately 10-25%, likely because the permeability coefficient around the well was reduced during the recharge process. Pressured recharge significantly improved the efficiency of the recharge process. Maintaining the recharge and pumping rates at a nearly equal level effectively controlled the surrounding surface and building settlement. However, the surrounding surface subsidence tended to rapidly develop when recharge stopped. Therefore, the recharge process should continue and gradually stop after the pumping stops. The twin-well combined recharge technique can be used to control the head loss of an aquifer when one of the recharge wells requires pumping to solve the associated clogging problems.

AB The catchments in the Loess Plateau in China have experienced significant land use change since the 1950s with a great number of soil conservation measures such as revegetation being implemented. Such soil conservation measures and climate variability have had considerable impacts on annual streamflow from these catchments. However, much less is known about changes in groundwater storage as the period of direct groundwater storage measurements is too short to reliably infer groundwater storage trends. For this study, annual values of groundwater storage from 38 catchments in the Loess Plateau were estimated from daily streamflow records based on groundwater flow theory. It was found that over the period of record (viz. 1955-2010), statistically significant (p < 0.1) downward trends have been identified in 20 selected catchments with an average reduction of -0.0299 mm per year, mostly located in the northern part of the Loess Plateau. Upward groundwater storage trends were observed in 10 catchments with an average increase of 0.00467 mm per year; these upward trends occurred in southern parts of the study area. Groundwater storage showed no statistically significant trends in 8 out of the 38 selected catchments. Soil conservation measures implemented in the Loess Plateau such as large-scale revegetation may have contributed to the estimated groundwater storage trends. Changes in sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean, as indicated by shifts in climate variability modes such as El Nifiu-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, appear to have also contributed to the decreasing trends in groundwater storage in this region.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources forms the major component of the annual carbon budget in many headwater streams. In high-elevation catchments in the Rocky Mountains, DOC originates in the upper soil horizons and is flushed to the stream primarily during spring snowmelt. To identify controls on the size of the mobile soil DOC pool available to be transported during the annual melt event, we measured soil DOC production across a range of vegetation communities and soil types together with catchment DOC export in paired watersheds in Summit County, Colorado. Both surface water DOC concentrations and watershed DOC export were lower in areas where pyrite weathering resulted in lower soil pH. Similarly, the amount of DOC leached from organic soils was significantly smaller (p < 0.01) at sites having low soil pH. Scaling point source measurements of DOC production and leaching to the two basins and assuming only vegetated areas contribute to DOC production, we calculated that the amount of mobile DOC available to be leached to surface water during melt was 20.3 g C m(-2) in the circumneutral basin and 17.8 g C m(-2) in the catchment characterized by pyrite weathering. The significant (r(2) = 0.91 and p < 0.05), linear relationship between overwinter CO2 flux and the amount of DOC leached from upper soil horizons during snowmelt suggests that the mechanism for the difference in production of mobile DOC was heterotrophic processing of soil carbon in snow-covered soil. Furthermore, this strong relationship between over-winter heterotrophic activity and the size of the mobile DOC pool present in a range of soil and vegetation types provides a likely mechanism for explaining the interannual variability of DOC export observed in high elevation catchments.

AB Anisotropy of the medium plays a dominant role in shaping the flow pattern in the soil profile. This study analyses the effect of anisotropy on the horizontal spreading of the flow trajectories from a contaminating source point at the soil surface to a high water table. It considers a phreatic aquifer with infinite lateral extension and uniform sedimentary-layered soil profile, where a state dependent anisotropy factor (SDAF) - A(psi), and Mualem's (1984) anisotropy model might be applicable. The numerically calculated streamlines portray the effect of anisotropy, and allow discernment among various anisotropic media. Different flow cases are analyzed with regard to their dependence on A(psi), as well as their dependence on the infiltration rate, and on the orientation of the principal axes. Theory indicates that the flux direction is dependent on the capillary head and thus on the flow rate. Consequently, it is the infiltration rate, which determines the particular path line from the contaminant source point to the ground water table. Accordingly, we have defined the "affected domain" as the domain within the unsaturated profile which is vulnerable to contamination from a source point at the soil surface, and the "affected segment" as the segment on the phreatic surface where pollutants may potentially reach the ground water aquifer. Both are determined with respect to anisotropy, infiltration rate, and depth. The non-linear horizontal shift of the contaminant trajectory indicates that a substantial error may result when adopting a constant anisotropy factor.
   This study suggests that the maximal horizontal shift is the relevant scale when characterizing the anisotropic flow system. This measure should be taken into consideration when designing a related laboratory experiment or a field monitoring system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In calibrating a model, a set of parameters is assigned to the model which will be employed for the making of all future predictions. If these parameters are estimated through solution of an inverse problem, formulated to be property posed through either pre-calibration or mathematical regularisation, then solution of this inverse problem will, of necessity, lead to a simplified parameter set that omits the details of reality, while still fitting historical data acceptably well Furthermore, estimates of parameters so obtained will be contaminated by measurement noise. Both of these phenomena will lead to errors in predictions made by the model, with the potential for error increasing with the hydraulic property detail on which the prediction depends. Integrity of model usage demands that model predictions be accompanied by some estimate of the possible errors associated with them.
   The present paper applies theory developed in a previous work to the analysis of predictive error associated with a real world, water resource management model. The analysis offers many challenges, including the fact that the model is a complex one that was partly calibrated by hand. Nevertheless, it is typical of models which are commonly employed as the basis for the making of important decisions, and for which such an analysis must be made. The potential errors associated with point-based and averaged water level and creek inflow predictions are examined, together with the dependence of these errors on the amount of averaging involved. Error variances associated with predictions made by the existing model are compared with "optimized error variances" that could have been obtained had calibration been undertaken in such a way as to minimize predictive error variance. The contributions by different parameter types to the overall error variance of selected predictions are also examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations can be influenced by both climatic variability and human activities. In this study, we made an integrated use of GRACE data and meteorological data to characterize the TWS variations in the Yellow River basin (YRB) during 2003-2015 and investigated the relationships between terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) and human activities and climatic variability respectively. Additionally, a novel, simple but effective index was also proposed to quantify the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities to TWSC in the YRB and its different subregions. The results indicated that there existed a significant TWS decrease at a rate of -4.6 +/- 1.4 mm/yr (approximately 3.7 +/- 1.1 Gt/yr) across the entire YRB during the past decade. The variables including precipitation, PET and NDVI had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.76, - 0.63 and - 0.38 respectively with TWSC at annual scale. Apart from these, the correlations between reservoir operation and annual TWSC also have been estimated for the first time, which showed a better performance (r = 0.85) than that between TWSC and water withdrawals (r = 0.40). The results mainly indicated that TWSC was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities especially reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on TWSC in the YRB. These conclusions can provide beneficial guidance for the management and assessments of local water resources.

AB Water depth above the flood deposits should be taken into account in calculations of the palaeoflood peak stages, which can provide more accurately estimate of palaeoflood stage. Here we present a new method, slackwater flow depth, to assess palaeoflood peak stage and to reduce the underestimation of palaeoflood stage. Palaeoflood slackwater deposits (SWDs) were identified by palaeohydrological criteria in cliff riverbank on the Yanhe River, middle Yellow River basin. Palaeoflood events recorded in four layers of SWD were dated by optical stimulated luminescence to 9.5-8.5 ka. The estimation of palaeoflood maximum stage was 778.3 m using the slackwater flow depth method and the palaeoflood peak discharge is 15,000 m3/s using the step-backwater method. Palaeoflood results greatly extend the current flood data series in the Yanhe River basin. The regional flood history including gauged flood, historical and palaeoflood data was compiled and evaluated for the major tributaries of the middle Yellow River. The relationship between palaeoflood peak discharges and drainage areas in this region fit well with the global maximum curves. The results of site-specific and regional palaeoflood evaluations demonstrate that the approach estimates the true palaeoflood peak stage and discharges and improves the flood frequency analysis of extreme and rare floods for a particular basin. Meanwhile, the advantages and uncertainties of this method need ongoing discussion in palaeoflood investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensitivity analysis (SA) aims to identify the key parameters that affect model performance and it plays important roles in model parameterization, calibration, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. However, the increasing complexity of hydrological models means that a large number of parameters need to be estimated. To better understand how these complex models work, efficient SA methods should be applied before the application of hydrological modeling. This study provides a comprehensive review of global SA methods in the field of hydrological modeling. The common definitions of SA and the typical categories of SA methods are described. A wide variety of global SA methods have been introduced to provide a more efficient evaluation framework for hydrological modeling. We review, analyze, and categorize research into global SA methods and their applications, with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the hydrological modeling field. The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in SA for hydrological modeling are outlined. Further discussions cover several important and often overlooked topics, including the relationship between parameter identification, uncertainty analysis, and optimization in hydrological modeling, how to deal with correlated parameters, and time-varying SA. Finally, some conclusions and guidance recommendations on SA in hydrological modeling are provided, as well as a list of important future research directions that may facilitate more robust analyses when assessing hydrological modeling performance.

AB This paper discusses the results of studies on sediment transport and the erosion rate in the Nubra river carried out in hydrological years from 1986 to 1991. Discharge data of proglacial stream of the Siachen Glacier shows seasonal variation ranging from 0.26 x 10(6) m(3) d(-1) in the beginning of the ablation season to about 23 x 10(6) m(3) d(-1) in the peak ablalion season. Suspended sediment mass in the Nubra River varies from 0.01 kg m(-3) s(-1) in the beginning of the ablation season to about 2-3 kg m(-3) s(-1) at its peak. A relationship is developed between daily suspended sediment transport and daily discharge. The total sediment load calculated from the data varies from 296 to 1287 tons km(-2) (of the glacier basin area) per year. The erosion rate calculated from total sediment load which includes suspended sediment and bedload varies from 0.11 to 0.46 mm year(-1). The erosion rates in the Nubra basin are much lower than the Hunza basin in Western Karakoram Himalayas (1.8 mm year(-1)) which may be due to its geological setting consisting of highly erosion resistant rocks like diorites, granodiorites, granites and granite-gniesses, Tectonic upliftment and high relief ave rise to comparatively higher erosion rates in Karakoram Himalayas.

AB Large-scale afforestation exacerbates soil water scarcity in a semiarid region of northern China, causing the formation of a dried soil layer (DSL) and ecosystem degradation, and overmature Populus simonii Carr (>30 years) degradation in the Three North Shelterbelt Program (TNSP) area has recently been observed. Determining the relationship between degraded Populus simonii Carr and soil water deficit is essential for afforestation in semiarid regions. We monitored soil water content (SWC) to a 160 cm depth in an area with five degradation degrees (healthy, light degradation, moderate degradation, severe degradation, and dead) to investigate soil water dynamics and DSL characteristics from May 2018 to December 2021. The results showed that: compared with that of healthy Populus simonii Carr (94.7 +/- 26.2 mm), the shallow layer (0-80 cm) soil water storage of severely degraded (114.1 +/- 29.9 mm) and dead Populus simonii Carr (128.0 +/- 35.7 mm) was restored by 19.4 mm and 33.3 mm, respectively. However, the deep-layer (80-160 cm) SWC was difficult to recover and a DSL gradually developed, the DSL SWC was only 9.3-11.95 %. The deep-layer relative extractable soil water (REW) of healthy Populus simonii Carr was significantly higher than that of moderately degraded, severely degraded, and dead Populus simonii Carr (P < 0.05). The deep-layer SWC decreased with increasing degradation due to coarser soils and increased BD. A greater bulk density (BD) and higher sand proportion reduced the soil water holding capacity. Poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts, causing the degradation and mortality of Populus simonii Carr during drought. Therefore, our results improve the understanding of the soil water dynamics and degradation mechanism of Populus simonii Carr, providing a theoretical basis for managing and maintaining the TNSP.

AB Stochastic nature of streamflow poses significant challenges in attaining a reliable forecasting model. In general, variational mode decomposition (VMD) can improve the forecast performance but easily expose the sub-signals to boundary effect. Furthermore, one model is not able to adapt all properties of different sub-series. Accordingly, we have two aims in this study. One is to propose an adaptive weight combined forecasting model to improve the middle and long-term streamflow forecast skill. It adapts the boundary effect in such a way that its inputs come from decomposition during calibration sets, and outputs are extracted from decomposition during the entire series. The other one is to link system performance improvement, i.e., the forecast skill, to the forecast value to address the gap in methodologies appropriate for data-limited locations (only hydrological time series collected). Four artificial intelligence-based models coupled with adaptive appendant and parameter optimization are developed as hybrid adaptive (HA) for forecasting each sub-signal decomposed by VMD in the proposed forecast model. The multi-objective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithm is then employed to combine individual forecasts based on performance-based weighting strategies and provide the Pareto-optimal ensemble forecasts. The proposed model is applied to forecast streamflow 1 to 6 months ahead of two stations in the Yellow River, China, and the results show that the ensemble forecasts can increase the values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient by 0.10 similar to 7.96% and reducing the values of root mean squared error by 1.08 similar to 32.11% compared to the HA model. The relationship between the forecast skill and its value can be strongly affected by decision-makers priorities, but the relative improvement in hydropower generation obtained by the compromised forecasts going from 0.02% to 3.39% indicates that improved forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions.

In this study, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) model was configured to produce highresolution atmospheric data for spatial modeling of snow at seven watersheds in central/southern Sierra Nevada. The configured WRF model downscaled a global reanalysis dataset into hourly time intervals and 3-km spatial grid resolution. Performance of the configured WRF model was validated by comparing basin averages of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature between the WRF simulation and data from Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The WRF model demonstrated satisfactory performance in simulating peaks and variations of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature. The atmospheric data which were obtained by the dynamical downscaling of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis dataset (CFSR) were then used for calibration and validation of the snow model for the seven watersheds. The dynamical downscaling and the subsequent simulation of snow were performed through the application of The Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro-Climate Model (WEHY-HCM) into the central/southern Sierra Nevada. The daily scale validation of the calibrated snow model showed that the simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) was mostly in agreement with observed SWE, however, tended to somewhat underestimate SWE. The snow model simulation with the precipitation input from PRISM indicated that the results using the dynamical downscaling had comparable performance with the results using PRISM precipitation, while some observation points showed improvements of the simulated SWE by using PRISM precipitation. Spatial comparison of the snow cover between the snow model simulations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations showed that the snow model was capable of detecting the snow cover at high elevation bands while the snow cover detection at low elevation bands, which correspond to the boundary between snow cover and no snow cover area, was less accurate.

AB Recent significant channel evolution in the Jingjiang Reach has raised much attention, particularly the remarkable bank erosion. A coupled model for simulating bed deformation and bank erosion has been proposed in this study, which focuses on the erosion of the bank with a composite structure in the Lower Jingjiang Reach. In order to cover three contributing processes that may interact with each other, the proposed model integrates a one-dimensional morphodynamic module with a two-dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank. Model performance was evaluated through a detailed simulation of channel evolution along a 150.8-km subreach in the Jingjiang Reach over the 2005 hydrological year. Satisfying results were obtained from the simulation, showing relatively close agreement between the calculations and measurements in terms of hydrological data at the outlet section, bank erosion sites, longitudinal channel profile and typical cross-sectional profiles. In addition, investigations into temporal changes in bank soil properties and critical overhanging width at cantilever failure demonstrate that there was a seasonal variation in the volumetric water content of bank soil, which increased during the rising and flood periods and then decreased during the recession period, showing an impact on the occurrence timing of cantilever failures. The tensile strength and critical overhanging width had an inverse relationship with the water content, whereas the critical width sharply increased and then decreased during high flows affected by a rapid change in river stage. The temporal distribution of cantilever failure events indicates that cantilever failure primarily occurred in the flood and recession periods. The effects of bed roughness, water content variation and secondary flow on bank erosion were also discussed.

AB Prediction of Ground Water Level (GWL) is extremely important for sustainable use and management of ground water resource. The motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived terrestrial water change (Delta TWS) data and GWL, so that Delta TWS could be used as a proxy measurement for GWL. In our study, we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in India. The datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict GWL with the help of Delta TWS, we have built Linear Regression Model (LRM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Comparative performances of LRM, SVR and ANN have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient (rho) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and fitted (for training dataset) or predicted (for test dataset) values of GWL. It has been observed in our study that Delta TWS is highly significant variable to model GWL and the amount of total variations in GWL that could be explained with the help of Delta TWS varies from 36.48% to 74.28% (0.3648 <= R-2 <= 0.7428). We have found that for the model GWL similar to Delta TWS, for both training and test dataset, performances of SVR and ANN are better than that of LRM in terms of rho and RMSE. It also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with Delta TWS as input parameters to model GWL, the performance of SVR improves and it performs better than ANN. These results imply that for modelling irregular time series GWL data, Delta TWS could be very useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ephemeral gullies or rills are major sediment sources and the primary channel to convey runoff and sediments from hillslopes. Quantifying the detachment rate is important for understanding the erosion process of ephemeral gullies. This study suggests a method to estimate the detachment rate for use in WEPP model, using sediment distribution data along an eroding rill or ephemeral gully under controlled flume experiments, conducted at four slope gradients (8.74%, 17.62%, 26.78%, and 36.38%) and four flow rates (32, 64, 128 and 256 L min(-1)). The experimental soil materials were packed into the flume of 0.5 m wide, 0.6 m deep and 12 m long, to a thickness of 0.5 m at a bulk density of 1300 kg m(-3). Regulated water flow was introduced to soil surface at the upper end of flumes. The detachment rate was calculated from the spatial distribution data of sediment concentrations measured with sediment-laden water samples simultaneously taken along the gullies at one meter intervals. Results showed that the detachment rate was well fitted with downslope distance along the rill or ephemeral gully by an exponential equation. The regression parameters indicated that detachment rate decreases linearly with sediment load in the gully flow. The feedback relationship between sediment load and detachment rate in nil or ephemeral gullies could be adequately represented by the first-order coupling equation for loess soil under steep slopes and high flow rates. The detachment rates along the rills or ephemeral gullies were found to increase with slope gradient and flow rate and the detachment rate was positively related to unit stream power and the deficit between max sediment load and the local sediment load.

AB Runoff conditions are strongly controlled by climate. Therefore, any uncertainties in the projections about future climate directly translate to uncertainties in future runoff. If several climate models are applied with the same emission scenario, there may be large differences in the climate projections due to model related biases and natural climate variability. To address this issue, an ensemble modelling approach - which considers a set of climate models - is applied in this study with a monthly, conceptual hydrological model for assessing future runoff conditions in the upper Danube basin (101,810 km(2)). Observed data of the past 120 years of the HISTALP data-set are used to evaluate runoff simulations under historic climate variations as well as to test the delta-change method for bias correction of climate data. Uncertainties caused by the hydrological model or by the method for bias correction appear to be small. Projections about future climate are obtained from 21 regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES project for the A1B emission scenario. Evaluation and ranking of the RCMs reveals that some of the models have considerable biases in simulation of spatio-temporal patterns of historic precipitation and temperature. There is however, no systematic relationship between historic performance and projected future change. Even for the better performing RCMs the differences in the simulation results are large. This is a strong argument for using an ensemble modelling approach, which yields a range of future runoff conditions instead of a deterministic projection. In general, a strong decrease of summer runoff is simulated, whereas there is no clear signal for changes in winter runoff. The spread between different RCMs in future seasonal runoff is larger than for the monthly flow duration curve. Overall, the projected changes in future runoff conditions become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century. (C ) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we develop and test two artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast streamflow in ungauged basins. The model inputs include time-lagged records of precipitation and temperature. In addition, recurrent feedback loops allow the ANN streamflow estimates to be used as model inputs. Publically available climate and US Geological Survey streamflow records from sub-basins in Northern Vermont are used to train and test the methods. Time-series analysis of the climate-flow data provides a transferable and systematic methodology to determine the appropriate number of time-lagged input data. To predict streamflow in an ungauged basin, the recurrent ANNs are trained on climate-flow data from one basin and used to forecast streamflow in a nearby basin with different (more representative) climate inputs. One of the key results of this work, and the reason why time-lagged predictions of steamflow improve forecasts, is these recurrent flow predictions are being driven by time-lagged locally-measured climate data. The successful demonstration of these flow prediction methods with publicly available USGS flow and NCDC climate datasets shows that the ANNs, trained on a climate-discharge record from one basin, prove capable of predicting streamflow in a nearby basin as accurately as in the basin on which they were trained. This suggests that the proposed methods are widely applicable, at least in the humid, temperate climate zones shown in this work. A scaling ratio, based on a relationship between bankfull discharge and basin drainage area, accounts for the change in drainage area from one basin to another. Hourly streamflow predictions were superior to those using daily data for the small streams tested due the loss of critical lag times through upscaling. The ANNs selected in this work always converge, avoid stochastic training algorithms, and are applicable in small ungauged basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil cores were taken at seven paired sites (native vegetation and adjacent dryland cropping on cracking clay soils) which had been cropped for 10-65 years in the Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland, northern Australia. Levels of soil chloride (Cl-) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) were determined in 0.3 m increments to a depth of 5 m where possible. The amounts of Cl- in the soil (0-1.5 m depth) under native vegetation were generally high (10-23 t ha(-1) at six of the seven sites). The amounts of Cl- that had leached below 1.5 m depth during dryland cropping varied from 2.2 to 16.8 t ha(-1) or 19-91% of the original totals at 0-15 m. Leaching of salt from the crop rooting zone in combination with higher rates of deep drainage can lead to outbreaks of soil salinisation but can also increase the soil plant available water capacity (PAWC). NO3-N had also been leached below crop rooting depth at three sites. Such leaching not only contaminates the groundwater but also wastes crop nutrients. The transient chloride mass balance approach was used to determine mean annual rates of deep drainage below crop rooting depth (1.5 m). At all seven sites annual deep drainage was low under native vegetation (0.2-1.7 mm yr(-1)) but increased under dryland cropping (1.6-27.5 mm yr(-1)). Drainage losses showed an inverse relationship with plant available water content (PAWC). Drainage losses waste the limited supply of water available for dryland cropping but can be reduced by practising opportunity cropping or by growing ley (temporary) pastures in rotation with annual crops.

AB Lake Ihotry is a closed saline lake extending in the semi-arid southwestern part of the Madagascar Island. Monitoring of lake level and chemistry, rainfall and pan evaporation close to the lake was conducted over more than two years, recording large seasonal variations in both lake area and salinity. In addition, diatom and pollen data from a 4000 years-sediment core showed that hydrological fluctuations of much larger magnitude have occurred in the past. The instrumental record was used to establish the present-day lake water balance and to calibrate a lake level and chloride content model at a daily time step. Sensitivity experiments showed that the present-day lake is very sensitive to rainfall variations, both through direct rainfall on the lake surface and through the local shallow groundwater availability. In the sediment core, diatom data document a wet episode with freshwater conditions from ca. 3300 to 2550-2000 cal. yr, followed by a desiccation trend punctuated by large variations of diatom-inferred salinity between X2250 and 1350 cal. yr, and finally the onset towards modern conditions by 700-650 cal. yr. A digital elevation model enabled to quantitatively reconstruct the morphometric parameters of an open lake. These lake area-depth-volume relationships were used in the combined water and chloride balances model to investigate conditions of the freshwater lake, and to simulate short-term oscillations of diatom-inferred salinity and the lake evolution towards its present state. We conclude that whatever the rainfall and/or evaporation changes accounting for, the regional water table evolution was an important factor controlling the long-term lake evolution, through its successive connection/disconnection to the lake.

AB Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a convenient tool for volumetric soil water content (VSWC) estimation in hydrological and agricultural studies. Although case studies have been widely carried out, little attention has been paid to subsoil moisture estimates. In this research, we investigated three-dimensional soil moisture variation down to a depth of 1 m and the effect of rainfall events on spatial soil moisture dynamics. GPR surveying lines were conducted both before and after a heavy rainfall event to map the VSWC. Soil sampling and time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe data at different depths (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 cm) were acquired. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between the dielectric constants and VSWCs at all depths. The established relationships for the different depth ranges had a low VSWC discrepancy when the dielectric constants ranged from 10 to 15. The effective range of each variogram was larger than 20 m, except for that of the 0-100 cm VSWC map after rainfall. In addition, the validation diagrams using corrected TDR values demonstrated relatively reliable VSWC maps. Approximately 89% of the variation in VSWC could be explained by the dielectric constants in the depth range of 0-40 cm, and VSWC predictions at this soil depth outperformed those at other depth ranges, with an overall RMSE of 0.027 m(3) m(-3) and R-2 of 0.725. Furthermore, we also monitored the effect of precipitation on the accuracy of the VSWC prediction on shallow surfaces. Our study shows that three-dimensional soil moisture dynamics can be accurately estimated at the field scale by integrating GPR interpretation and spatial extrapolation methods.

ID BETIC CORDILLERA; EVOLUTION; PERIOD; OVEREXPLOITATION; RESOURCES;

AB The carbonate aquifers of Sierra de Estepa, situated in southern Spain, are undergoing intensive groundwater exploitation. Consequently, the volume of pumping surpasses the average recharge for periods of several consecutive years. Under such conditions, nearby springs have either dried up or only function during short time periods, after very rainy episodes followed by long droughts. During the brief periods when the springs are active, their water and the water extracted by pumping are calcium bicarbonates, with a spatial temporal variability of their physico-chemical characteristics that is mainly conditioned by the degree of functional karstiflcation of each system. When the springs are inactive, the pumping water gradually increases in salinity and becomes HCO3ClCaNa, CIHCO3NaCa and CINa. Under the new conditions caused by so much pumping, the main factors determining the hydrochemical changes are the mixing of waters and the subsequent reactions of dissolution precipitation between (I) the recharge coming from rainwater, (2) the hypersaline inputs from the clay-evaporite aquitards situated on the edges and at the base of the aquifer, and (3) the water stored in each aquifer. The hydrochemical information acquired allowed us to characterize and model the groundwater of these aquifers, to study the causes of its great spatial and temporal variability, and explain the influence of exploitation. This research shows that making sustainable use of water resources associated with carbonate aquifers calls for sound knowledge of the relationship between the aquifer and other bodies of groundwater or surface water, the hydrochemical quality of these possible inputs, and the vulnerability of the aquifer to exploitation, which in turn is conditioned by the ratio between water reserves and recharge.

AB A small stream in the Great Plains of USA was sampled to understand the streamflow components following intense precipitation and the influence of water storage structures in the drainage basin. Precipitation, stream, ponds, ground-water and soil moisture were sampled for determination of isotopic (D, O-18) and chemical (Cl, SO4)composition before and after two intense rain events. Following the first storm event, flow at the downstream locations was generated primarily through shallow subsurface flow and runoff whereas in the headwaters region - where a pond is located in the stream channel - shallow ground-water and pond outflow contributed to the flow. The distinct isotopic signatures of precipitation and the evaporated pond water allowed separation of the event water from the other sources that contributed to the flow. Similarly, variations in the Cl and SO4 concentrations helped identify the relative contributions of ground-water and soil moisture to the streamflow. The relationship between deuterium excess and Cl or SO4 content reveals that the early contributions from a rain event to strearnflow depend upon the antecedent climatic conditions and the position along the stream channel within the watershed. The design of this study, in which data from several locations within a watershed were collected, shows that in small streams changes in relative contributions from ground water and soil moisture complicate hydrograph separation, with surface-water bodies providing additional complexity. It also demonstrates the usefulness of combined chemical and isotopic methods in hydrologic investigations, especially the utility of the deuterium excess parameter in quantifying the relative contributions of various source components to the stream flow.

AB Understanding the morphological erraticism for large braided river systems is still a challenging issue in the present era of fluvial geomorphology. The present paper reports thorough spatio-temporal variability of sand bar dynamics (2000-2019) and their influence on the braided belt disorderness in the large braided Brahmaputra River. The sand bar area is detected using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and an entropy-based intensity disorder index (IDI) is further proposed to measure the spatio-temporal disorderness the post-monsoon period. The IDI varies at a lowest value of less than 0.5 to a highest value of more than 0.9 for the selected study reach. Interestingly, IDI displays a declining trend for the first decade, followed by an increasing trend in the subsequent time slice, which signals the large-scale heterogeneity in process-form in-teractions for the Brahmaputra. An attempt was made to establish relationship between IDI, stream power de-rivatives (monsoon, peak flood, and post-monsoon), and bar area classes in order to facilitate a process-based understanding of the geomorphic adjustments. In comparison with other stream power derivatives, the peak flood stream power showed a better correlation with the disorderness measure of the reach. Finally, this study has highlighted that smaller, highly immobile bars have significant control on the IDI variations and govern the yearly planform disorderness of the Brahmaputra. Further, the findings of this study can be used construct a process-form-interaction framework for large braided river systems.

AB Floods can mobilize large amounts of unconsolidated material, which also includes large wood in forested river basins. Yet, the influence of the shape and volume of flood hydrographs on wood dynamics in rivers remains poorly understood. Quantitative data on this relation are, however, critically needed to properly address management strategies and to improve the relevant understanding of wood dynamics in rivers. In this work we used a deterministic model, run in a multi-scenario mode, to simulate the transport of wood pieces fully coupled to hydrodynamics. The goal was to analyze how the transport of large wood occurs under different unsteady flood scenarios. We applied the model to two contrasting geomorphic configurations (channelized, single-thread and multi-thread reaches) in the Czarny Dunajec River in Poland, where extensive field observations of wood transport and deposition after floods of different magnitude were available to validate, interpret, and discuss model results. We show that the peak of wood transport is generally reached before the flood peak, and that the wood remobilization ratio is not always positively correlated to peak discharge. We found a positive correlation between the number of mobilized wood pieces and the duration of the rising limb. In addition, hysteresis was observed in the relationship between wood remobilization and discharge. We conclude that numerical modelling allows analysis of wood dynamics in a detail which cannot typically be achieved in field observations. Therefore, modelling improves our understanding of the process and helps disentangling the complex linkages between flood hydrographs and large wood transport dynamics in rivers.

AB Among the three sites distributed along the West African latitudinal gradient in the AMMA-CATCH observation system, the experimental setup in the Niamey area of south-west Niger samples the cultivated Sahel environment, for hydrological, vegetation and land surface processes. The objective is to investigate relationships between climate, land cover, and the water cycle, in a rapidly changing semiarid environment. This paper first presents the main characteristics of the area, where previous research, including the EPSAT and HAPEX-Sahel experiments, had evidenced a widespread decadal increase in water resources, concurrently with severe drought conditions. The specifics of AMMA-CATCH research and data acquisition at this site, over the long-term (similar to 2001-2010) and enhanced (similar to 2005-2008) observation periods, are introduced. Objectives and observation strategy are explained, and the main characteristics of instrument deployment are detailed. A very large number of parameters - covering rainfall, vegetation ecophysiology, phenology and production, surface fluxes of energy, water vapour and CO2, runoff and sediment, pond water, soil moisture, and groundwater - were monitored at local to meso scales in a nested structure of sites. The current state of knowledge is summarized, connecting processes and patterns of variation for rainfall, vegetation/land cover, and the terrestrial hydrologic cycle. The central role of land use and of its spectacular change in recent decades is highlighted. This paper provides substantial background information that sets the context for papers relating to the south-west Niger site in this AMMA-CATCH special issue. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigate the conditions and criteria for identifying flow regimes in shallow groundwater-dominated lakes in arid environments. Relying on regional and local water-table configurations, we develop a steady-state model of lake-aquifer systems. Using dimensional analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate relationships between groundwater inflow and outflow. A new framework uses the concepts of gradient ratio G, defined as the ratio of regional-to-local head gradients, and the topohydrologic offset (THO), defined as the difference between actual lake level and regional groundwater level. It is shown that a critical value of gradient ratio, G(c), exists for each aquifer thickness and anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity. In cases where the regional gradient is larger than the local gradient and G > G(c), the lake is "flushed" in a flow-through regime. When the local gradient is larger than the regional head gradient and G < G(c), the lake gains and large evaporative losses occur. G(c), becomes progressively larger with increasing aquifer thickness and anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity. Variation in the ratio of groundwater inflow-to-outflow as G approaches G(c) is consistent with observed variability in lake salinity. Transition from flow-through conditions to other regimes in groundwater-dominated lakes in arid environments may occur with subtle changes in the gradient ratio, regional water-table slope, lake size, and THO. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of using a geographic information system to delineate the potential for lake to retain solutes in areas with numerous lakes, similar to Nebraska, USA.

TI Wetland mitigation functions on hydrological droughts: From drought

AB Wetlands have been singled out as a potential nature-based solution for improving the resilience and reducing the risks of hydrometeorological extremes. However, whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydro-logical droughts is not well understood. To fill this gap, we proposed a general framework to discern the effect of wetlands on: (i) the characteristics (duration, severity, development and recovery processes) of hydrological droughts, and (ii) the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts. First, hydrological modeling was conducted with a spatially-explicit model integrated with wetland modules. Then, the run theory and pooling method were selected to recognize hydrological drought events and identify their characteristics. Further, the Pearson correlation coefficient, temporal shift method and cross wavelet transform were used to explore the propagation processes. Finally, the characteristics and propagation processes were compared to quantify wetland mitigation services on hydrological droughts. To validate the proposed framework, two river basins from China and Canada (the Gan River Bain and the Nelson River Bain), with distinct land cover, were chosen to perform hydrological modeling and quantify wetland effects. The results indicate that wetlands mainly contribute to alleviating hydrological droughts by decelerating the development process, accelerating the re-covery, shortening the duration, and reducing the severity of the hydrological drought events. However, the effects are variable as they may have weak impacts and even worsen drought conditions. Wetlands can extend drought propagation time and weaken the transition of meteorological to hydrological droughts. The likelihood of hydrological drought formation due to meteorological decreased by 19% and 18% respectively, for the Gan River Bain and Nelson River Bain, thanks to the mitigation services of wetlands. These findings highlight the drought-mitigation roles of wetlands and the proposed modelling framework has the potential to be useful in beneficial in assisting basin management on drought risks in the context of climate change mitigation.

AB Infiltration and deep flow on sloping surfaces were studied by combining controlled laboratory experiments with mathematical models. Experimental variables included soil types, rainfall intensities, and surface slopes. Preliminary analyses of the data indicated that increased slope has a positive influence on surface flow, and that this influence increases relatively with decreasing rainfall rate. However, current theories could not adequately explain the observed behavior of deep and surface flows for varying slopes. Three mathematical models of varying complexity were employed to supplement the experimental results. These models were (i) the 2-D Hydrus numerical model, (ii) numerical solution of 1-D saturated-unsaturated flow equation on sloping surfaces, and (iii) a simplified 1-D sharp-front model for sloping surfaces. For the latter two models, a surface flow component based on the kinematic wave approximation for shallow flows was externally coupled to the subsurface flows to route water over the soil surface. For each soil, one experiment at the lowest slope and rainfall rate was utilized for estimation of model parameters that could not be measured independently, while all the other results were used for model corroboration. The Hydrus model indicated that a 1-D analysis would be adequate as the water front moves essentially parallel to the slope. To account for the influence of slope and soil-type on experimental results, an effective saturated conductivity was proposed. Model results were found to be in reasonable agreement with observations of surface flow, deep flow, and water contents in the soil profile with the use of the proposed effective saturated conductivity. Limitations on the applicability of the sharp-front model in this context were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water options trading (WOT) is an effective way to promote efficient allocation of water resources and to manage risks of water scarcity. Scientific prediction information can help hedge the risks brought by uncertain hydrological and market environment to WOT. However, confronting with the prediction information, irrigation areas characterizing with heterogeneous resource endowments often exhibit different willingness in WOT. Therefore, through using prediction information, this study provides a novel perspective to assess the water option trading willingness (WOTW) in irrigation areas with heterogeneous resource endowments. Firstly, according to multiobjective optimization and expected utility theory, a three-phase dynamic adjustment model involving tradable water prediction, expected return analysis of WOT, and WOTW calculation is constructed and integrated. Then, based on three sets of comparative analysis data from 2014 to 2020 in five irrigated areas, the influence mechanism of heterogeneous resource endowments on the evolution, intensity and improvement potential of the WOTW is analyzed and the option contract with optimal water demand to motivate the WOTW in heterogeneous irrigation areas is proposed. The results of the case study suggest that the WOTW is largely affected by the matching equilibrium of water and arable land resources in irrigation areas. Larger water resource endowment per unit of arable land indicates smaller fluctuation of the WOTW evolution and greater intensity and improvement potential of the WOTW. Conversely, larger inter-annual variation of the water resource endowment per unit of arable land implies more inclination of the WOTW intensity in irrigation areas to be weakened, in which situation the irrigation areas prefer the option contracts with less water demand. This study provides a new method and theoretical foundation for the optimal allocation and options trading of agricultural water resources.

AB In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis to identify and quantify spatial patterns of heavy, very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall and their trends that have emerged during the last seven decades (1951 to 2020) of monsoon months (June to September) under warming scenario as well as to project these extreme rainfall counts during the near- (2036-2060) and late-21st century (2075-2099) w.r.t. historical period (1990-2014) using biascorrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensemble method. On the basis of daily maximum rainfall occurrences, the Central India, North-East India, Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats are found to be susceptible to extreme rainfall zones over the Indian landmass. The trend distribution during 1951-2020 suggests an increase of 42-63 heavy rainfall events over Orissa, Chattisgarh and parts of Madhya Pradesh and a declination over Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and hilly regions of North-East India. Our study suggests the causal theory for the rise of monsoon rainfall extremes in terms of both dynamics and local-scale thermodynamics over the sub-continent. Moreover, the bias-corrected dataset is developed using Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) for historic and projected climate for the three scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) using output from 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP6. Hence, the bias-corrected projections suggest that most susceptible places for increasing heavy rainfall extremes likely to be Mumbai, Pune, Panaji in the Western coasts of India (Western Ghats), Itanagar and Shillong in the North-East India, Raipur and Bhopal in the Central India in near- and late-21st century under all scenarios in a warming climate. Thus, the bias-corrected projections from CMIP6-GCMs can be used for hydroclimate impact assessment in Indian region under the changing atmospheric circulation dynamics and warming induced by greenhouse gases.

AB Terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the endorheic Tibetan Plateau (ETP) increased from 2002 to 2012 but decreased in 2012-2016. This study used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data to analyse TWS changes in the ETP in 2012 from increasing to decreasing. The results showed that these TWS changes could be divided into two stages. From April 2002 to August 2012, TWS increased at a rate of 4.43 Gt/yr from the GRACE-Mascons and 1.11 Gt/yr from the GRACE-SH, whereas after September 2012, it declined at a rate of-5.62 Gt/yr from the GRACE-Mascons and-6.99 Gt/yr from the GRACE-SH. The increase in lake water storage (LWS) (7.98 Gt/yr) was higher than the loss of other components from 2002 to 2012, therefore, the LWS gradually dominated the increase in TWS. However, the soil moisture storage (SMS) decreased more significantly (-5.27 Gt/yr) than the increase in LWS (<1 Gt/yr) during 2012-2016, accounting for 66% of the decrease in TWS in the ETP. From a water balance perspective, the relationship between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration determined the region's changes in TWS. It was found that 90% of the decrease in TWS in the ETP during 2012-2016 was attributed to an increase in potential evapotranspiration (PET), whereas 7% was attributed to a decrease in P. Thus, climate change (P and PET) accounted for 97% of the TWS reduction during 2012-2016. Furthermore, 3% of the decrease in TWS in the region was attributed to land surface changes.

AB Studying the temporal dynamics and fluxes of riverine dissolved carbon is crucial in understanding the regional and global carbon cycles under various climatic conditions. Here, we studied the behaviors and fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) responding to various hydrologic conditions in the Min River, originated from Tibetan Plateau. The DIC concentrations decreased with increasing runoff, partially reflecting dilution effect, which may be ascribed to the shortened fluid transit time and then the reduced contact time with rocks. Nevertheless, DOC concentrations were positively correlated with runoff, which can be attributed to that a large amount of soil organic carbon flowed into the river as a result of the strong flushing effect. The negative relationship between delta C-13(DIC) and runoff could be explained by soil CO2 influx and organic matter degradation during the high flow season. Delta DIC (the production of DIC with changing hydrologic conditions) had a strong positive correlation with water temperature due to the accelerated DIC production rates by high temperature, which always co-varied with intense precipitation in Asian monsoonal regions. The mean DIC/DOC ratio in the Min River was 15.09, and the DOC and DIC fluxes were 1.1 and 15.2 t C km(-2) yr(-1), respectively, for the studied year. And the DOC and DIC fluxes varied dramatically with runoff changes, suggesting that hydrologic conditions were critical factors for the variations in dissolved carbon export. This study shows that carbon dynamics of rivers draining from the Tibetan Plateau are greatly affected by short-term climatic variabilities, which has implications for understanding global carbon cycle under future climate change.

AB Two variants of the Muskingum flood routing method formulated for accounting nonlinearity of the channel routing process are investigated in this study. These variant methods are: (1) The three parameter conceptual Nonlinear Muskingum (NLM) method advocated by Gillin 1978, and (2) The Variable Parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) method recently proposed by Perumal and Price in 2013. The VPMM method does not require rigorous calibration and validation procedures as required in the case of NLM method due to established relationships of its parameters with flow and channel characteristics based on hydrodynamic principles. The parameters of the conceptual nonlinear storage equation used in the NLM method were calibrated using the Artificial Intelligence Application (AlA) techniques, such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Differential Evolution (DE), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Harmony Search (HS). The calibration was carried out on a given set of hypothetical flood events obtained by routing a given inflow hydrograph in a set of 40 km length prismatic channel reaches using the Saint-Venant (SV) equations. The validation of the calibrated NLM method was investigated using a different set of hypothetical flood hydrographs obtained in the same set of channel reaches used for calibration studies. Both the sets of solutions obtained in the calibration and validation cases using the NLM method were compared with the corresponding solutions of the VPMM method based on some pertinent evaluation measures. The results of the study reveal that the physically based VPMM method is capable of accounting for nonlinear characteristics of flood wave movement better than the conceptually based NLM method which requires the use of tedious calibration and validation procedures.

AB In this study, the likelihood functions for uncertainty analysis of hydrological models are compared and improved through the following steps: (1) the equivalent relationship between the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) and the likelihood function with Gaussian independent and identically distributed residuals is proved; (2) a new estimation method of the Box-Cox transformation (BC) parameter is developed to improve the effective elimination of the heteroscedasticity of model residuals; and (3) three likelihood functions-NSE, Generalized Error Distribution with BC (BC-GED) and Skew Generalized Error Distribution with BC (BC-SGED)-are applied for SWAT-WB-VSA (Soil and Water Assessment Tool - Water Balance - Variable Source Area) model calibration in the Baocun watershed, Eastern China. Performances of calibrated models are compared using the observed river discharges and groundwater levels. The result shows that the minimum variance constraint can effectively estimate the BC parameter. The form of the likelihood function significantly impacts on the calibrated parameters and the simulated results of high and low flow components. SWAT-WB-VSA with the NSE approach simulates flood well, but baseflow badly owing to the assumption of Gaussian error distribution, where the probability of the large error is low, but the small error around zero approximates equiprobability. By contrast, SWAT-WB-VSA with the BC-GED or BC-SGED approach mimics baseflow well, which is proved in the groundwater level simulation. The assumption of skewness of the error distribution may be unnecessary, because all the results of the BC-SGED approach are nearly the same as those of the BC-GED approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents an operational approach to integrate a storm classification method into a real-time radar rainfall estimation. A minor modification of a texturing classification algorithm proposed by Steiner et al. [Steiner, M., Houze Jr., R.A., Yuter, S.E., 1995. Climatological characterisation of three-dimensional storm structure from operational radar and rain gauge data. J. Appl. Meteorol. 34, 1978-2007] that can classify each pixel in the radar image as stratiform or convective is used to classify the instantaneous reflectivity field into convective and stratiform components. A method to derive the climatological Z-R relations for convective and stratiform rainfall is proposed. Vertical profiles of reflectivity (VPRs) are used to verify the accuracy of the storm classification. An alternative method for verification of a storm classification scheme based on differences between probability distribution functions of rain gauge rainfall of the two rainfall categories is also presented. A 6-month record of radar and rain gauge rainfall for Sydney, Australia for November 2000-April 2001 is used for training and rainfall events during February 2007-March 2007 are used to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed operational approach for classifying storms in real-time radar rainfall estimates reduces RMSE between radar and rain gauge rainfall from 4.63 to 4.30 mm h(-1) and from 5.31 to 5.01 mm h(-1) for the training and verification periods compared to the case where the rainfall is assumed to have a single Z-R relationship.

AB In an empirical/statistical approach, the relationship between watershed characteristics and the inter-lake variance of chemical lake water composition is analyzed. The lake water quality data sampled in 87 extensively monitored glacial/boreal lakes is hence supplemented with digital landscape information covering the categories: geology, soils, land cover, and topography. With standard I : 50 000 scale maps as the source of information, 33 classes of landscape elements are identified and described with respect to morphological and hydrological characteristics. When regression models based on the combined morphology/ hydrology information are compared with models excluding the hydrology information, the hypothesis whether or not information regarding hydrological watershed characteristics improves the performance of existing models can be tested. It is concluded that the introduction of hydrological element descriptors significantly improves the overall performance of regression models describing the inter-lake variance of lake water: hardness, color, pH, total phosphorus concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, and Secchi depth. When these variables are ranked according to the amount of model performance achieved, the general importance of surface hydrology in the process of emitting and transporting associated substances through the landscape can be assessed. Out of the 33 landscape elements totally digitized, ten are identified as significantly correlated to the inter-lake variance of characterizing lake water quality. When they are ranked according to their influential power, the consequence of watershed interference can be qualitatively assessed. The results should be easily implemented in watershed management and because of the general validity given by the extensive empirical database - valid in many glacial/boreal watersheds throughout the world.

ID RESOURCES
AB Crafting institutions related to the supply and use of irrigation systems require skills in understanding how rules, combined with particular physical, economic, and cultural environments, produce incentives and outcomes. If the users and suppliers of irrigation systems design their own institutional arrangements to cope with the physical, economic, social, and cultural features of each system, the variety of institutional arrangements could be immense. Examining specific rules of particular systems, however, is like focusing on specific blueprints of successful irrigation projects around the world. Recent theoretical and empirical work on institutional design has attempted to elucidate the core design principles used in long-enduring, self-organized irrigation institutions throughout the world. By ''design principle'' is meant a characteristic that helps to account for the success of these institutions in sustaining the physical works and gaining the compliance of generations of users to the rules in use. By ''long enduring'' is meant that the irrigation system has been in operation for at least several generations. Eight design principles identified in prior research are discussed and analyzed.

AB The availability of distinctly interpretable assessments to characterize and describe river discharge for mountainous rivers for different climatic events can improve our understanding of the various dynamics related to hydrological processes. Furthermore, information and complexity metrics can reveal invaluable information about the unseen processes that occur within a system. In this study, hourly streamflow records obtained from five gauging stations of a mountainous river were analyzed to quantify different patterns and characterize system states at both low and high frequencies using increasing aggregation lengths. In addition, we propose a new extension for the information and complexity theory, allowing it to be customized for flood assessment. Moreover, we clarify how a pattern (i.e., a word length) can be suitably defined by means of information and complexity metrics. Regarding low-frequency analyses, our results related to information and complexity metrics indicate two scaling regimes for river discharge, one of which may describe river memory characteristics. Regarding high-frequency analyses, our findings indicate the presence of an additional scaling regime that occurs along an hourly scale, captured by streamflow data, and is obtained using a novel hydroacoustic system. Additionally, power spectral density results confirmed our findings. A further significant result from our study is the clear correlation between complexity and fractal fluctuations, which should be addressed in future studies. In summary, this research focuses on new aspects of information and complexity metrics to be customized for the detection and understanding of temporal structures of streamflow patterns during both standard and extreme events.

AB Theories and models used in soil hydrological sciences rely on the knowledge of the spatially and temporally variable soil hydraulic properties, i.e. the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Obtaining reliable experimental information on these curves for an area of interest is not easy and it still remains a challenge for soil scientists. In 2006, a simple and physically based methodology was proposed to completely characterize the soil using a single ring infiltration experiment in the field and determination of soil particle size distribution, initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density. This methodology, named BEST - Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters, has received great attention and interest from the worldwide scientific community and it shows promise for further developments. This review paper aims to take the reader into the BEST world. Initially, the BEST experiment is described and the different algorithms that can be applied to analyze the infiltration data are illustrated. Then, an overview of the use that has been made of BEST up to now in the world is provided. Subsequently, infiltration prediction by BEST equations is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view, i.e. with reference to the shape and geometric parameters of the assumed infiltration model and to the effects of the available information for the transient and steady-state phases of the process. Then, the application of BEST is presented with reference to different types of heterogeneous soils. Finally, practical recommendations and theoretical and experimental perspectives are provided.

AB The lack of stream gauging data worldwide has inspired an abundance of methods attempting to predict the complex natural process of streamflow. A set of traditional regression equations have been developed by the U.S. Geological Survey for the state of Iowa. However, several inconsistencies were noted, including irregular region definition and varying input parameters between regions. To overcome the common problems faced in modelling, and to combat the irregularities in the regression equations, a new Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) algorithm has been proposed using a combination of the classical combinatorial GMDH and multilayer GMDH to predict the 2-year peak flow. Data from 365 stream gauges located in the state of Iowa were used in the model development. The new algorithm was compared to the two classical algorithms and the traditional linear regression equations developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The new algorithm which requires fewer input parameters without relying on regionalization was found to be the best method. The developed algorithm is based on a more robust hydrologic theory and therefore is a reliable method for predicting the 2-year peak flow for ungauged basins. The two main hypotheses inspired by the past regression equations and suggested in this study were that regionalization is not necessary and that using fewer input parameters to avoid redundancy still produces a robust prediction method. This study has developed a novel and reliable prediction method for peak flow prediction at ungauged basins while advancing insight into the most influential variables governing the magnitude of the flow.

AB Plant pathogens are a major agent of disturbance in ecosystems worldwide. Disturbance by diseases which inhibit plant water uptake can alter the hydrological function of affected ecosystems. However, many plant pathogens are also sensitive to soil moisture and can be propagated by the transport of infectious tissue or reproductive structures in surface flow, so that hydrological processes can drive pathogen infection. These feed-forward and feed-back processes set up the possibility of complex ecohydrological dynamics relating plant disease and the water cycle. Here the generalist root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi (Pc) is used as a case study to examine the potential importance of hydrological dynamics on disease spread. A numerical model of Pc growth and dispersal is used to investigate the importance of Pc transport in intermittent surface runoff compared to more continuous rhizosphere Pc spread via diffusion-like hyphal growth. We apply and test this model at two well-studied sites of Pc infection with contrasting hydrology: a Banksia woodland in Western Australia where deep sandy soils inhibit surface runoff, and an Erica heathland in the Spanish Central Plateau where relatively shallow soils on steep slopes generate intermittent saturation excess overland flow. Predictions of Pc spatial spread at the Spanish site improve when Pc transport in runoff is incorporated into the model, while no such improvements arise at the Australian site. Omitting transport in overland flow from model predictions at the Spanish site results in an average under-prediction of final pathogen patch areas by 350 m(2) for each year of growth between observations, highlighting the importance of surface hydrological transport to Pc growth and spread and need for further studies. Hydrological theories that predict the occurrence of overland flow based on soil, topographic, and climate properties can be used to better incorporate this transport pathway and the influence of local hydrological processes in existing Pc risk assessment methods.

TI Short-term runoff prediction with GRU and LSTM networks without
   requiring time step optimization during sample generation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID MODELS
AB Runoff forecasting is an important approach for flood mitigation. Many machine learning models have been proposed for runoff forecasting in recent years. To reconstruct the time series of runoff data into a standard machine learning dataset, a sliding window method is usually used to pre-process the data, with the size of the window as a variable parameter which is commonly referred to as the time step. Conventional machine learning methods, such as artificial neural network models (ANN), require optimization of the time step because both too small and too large time steps reduce prediction accuracy. In this work two popular variants of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were employed to develop new data-driven flood forecasting models. GRU and LSTM models are in theory able to filter redundant information automatically, and therefore a large time step is expected to not reduce prediction accuracy. The three models (LSTM, GRU, and ANN) were applied to simulate runoff in the Yutan station control catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly discharge measurements of one runoff station and hourly rainfall of four rainfall stations from 2000 to 2014. Results show that the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models increases with increasing time step, and eventually stabilizes. This allows selection of a relatively large time step in practical runoff prediction without first evaluating and optimizing the time step required by conventional machine learning models. We also show that LSTM and GRU models perform better than ANN models when the time step is optimized. GRU models have fewer parameters and less complicated structures compared to LSTM models, and our results show that GRU models perform equally well as LSTM models. GRU may be the preferred method in short term runoff predictions since it requires less time for model training.

AB The ensemble random forest filter (ERFF) is presented as an alternative to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse modeling. The EnKF is a data assimilation approach that forecasts and updates parameter estimates sequentially in time as observations are collected. The updating step is based on the experimental covariances computed from an ensemble of realizations, and the updates are given as linear combinations of the differences between observations and forecasted system state values. The ERFF replaces the linear combination in the update step with a non-linear function represented by a random forest. This way, the non-linear relationships between the parameters to be updated and the observations can be captured, and a better update produced. The ERFF is demonstrated for log-conductivity identification from piezometric head observations in several scenarios with varying degrees of heterogeneity (log-conductivity variances going from 1 up to 6.25 (ln m/d)2), number of realizations in the ensemble (50 or 100), and number of piezometric head observations (18 or 36). In all scenarios, the ERFF works well, reconstructing the log-conductivity spatial heterogeneity while matching the observed piezometric heads at selected control points. For benchmarking purposes, the ERFF is compared to the restart EnKF to find that the ERFF is superior to the EnKF for the number of ensemble realizations used (small in typical EnKF applications). Only when the number of realizations grows to 500 the restart EnKF can match the performance of the ERFF, albeit at more than double the computational cost.

AB Hydraulic fracturing is an important means to develop unconventional resources. Fracture diagnosis techniques have been emerged in recent years, which can evaluate hydraulic stimulated fractures after stimulation treat-ment. Fracture geometry evaluation is an important part of hydraulic fracturing diagnosis. The fracture geometry evaluation techniques based on water hammer signal has the advantages of high economic efficiency, easy implementation and high timeliness. Previously, a model that couples the wellbore and the fracture (RCI model) had been proposed, which could calculate the fracture geometry. However, this model was mainly based on the assumption of a single fracture with a pair of double wings, and there was no research on the calculation of the geometry of multi-fractures. In this paper, a new model for calculating the geometry of multi-fractures was proposed. First, a new factor, the stress interference between the various fractures, was considered in the model. Second, based on the conservation of the total volume of fractures, the rationality of the volume equivalent relationship of multiple fractures was proved. Third, a new method was proposed to allow the new factor to be added to the model reasonably base on volume conservation. Additionally, our model was validated with the model in the previously published research. The effect of different parameters (number of fractures, fracture spacing, fracture volume) on the water hammer was analyzed. At last, the fracture geometry evaluation of micro -seismic and our model in field cases were compared. This paper provides a new model for evaluating the geo-metric characteristics of multiple fractures of water hammer signals.

AB The frequency of extreme precipitation is increasing globally and poses a significant threat to human and natural systems. At the regional scale, these changes are becoming increasingly uncertain. Therefore, it is critical to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of extreme precipitation on a regional scale. In this study, we applied the connected component labelling algorithm to define regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs). This approach considers spatial coverage and its correlation with precipitation. We further investigated the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the Yangtze River basin using the empirical orthogonal function and examined their potential relationships with large-scale climate indices, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The results show that REPEs in the study area exhibited an increasing trend in both frequency and spatial coverage since 1970. In addition, the integrated effects of PDO and ENSO have a significant impact on REPEs at various scales in summer and at large scales in winter. We also analysed the differences in these events between the current year and the following year for PDO and ENSO combinations and found that the position of REPEs change with different PDO and ENSO combinations in both summer and winter season. The spatiotemporal characteristics of REPEs in the study area reveal the corresponding connections with the East Asian continent-ocean 500-hPa pressure field. Based on our analysis and current predictions of these ocean-atmospheric oscillations, we suggest creating more REPE scenarios for upcoming decades, which may benefit forecasting and water resource management.

AB This study investigates moisture origin, characteristics and intra-event scale variability of the isotopic signature of rainfall in a Mediterranean mountain area, based on data from the Vallcebre Research Catchments, NE Spain. Weekly data and samples were used to analyse the general dynamics of the isotopic composition of precipitation and its relationship with meteorological variables at the sampling site. Then, based on the data and samples available at the intra-event scale, the variability of the isotopic signature during rainfall events was characterised and an explanation of what caused the observed variability was attempted. Results at the weekly time scale show that the maximum relative deviation of the heavy isotopic content with respect to Standard Mean Ocean Water (delta O-18) of the precipitation signature occurred during summer months and, in contrast, the minimum during winter months. The intra-annual trend of rainfall delta O-18 roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature. Using intra-event information, three main types of delta O-18 isotopic trends were found during rainfall events: most of the events had a V-shaped isotopic trend, followed by L-shaped and constant trend events. Changes in moisture sources 'diagnosed using a Lagrangian approach and a previously existing contribution algorithm' were one of the causes of the isotopic variability and changes at the intra-event scale, but these may also have been influenced by sub-cloud processes that modified the isotopic signature. Moisture sources for analysed events showed the main influence of the Mediterranean area, but also an important influence of the Atlantic Basin.

AB Terrestrial actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is a crucial component of terrestrial water cycles. The most common methods of estimating catchment-scale ETa are remote sensing and hydrological models. These methods have limitations when applied at the catchment scale due to coarse resolutions of data and uncertainties in model predictions. Data assimilation techniques that combine complementary information from hydrological models and observed data can overcome some of the limitations. These techniques have been used in many hydrological modeling studies, but few have applied data assimilation to ETa within a distributed precipitation-runoff catchment modeling framework. This paper proposes a catchment scale ETa data assimilation technique (termed ET-DA) that assimilates remotely sensed ETa data into a distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (DTVGM-ET) for improving hydrological model simulations. The DTVGM-ET improved the ETa computation on the basis of a nonlinear soil water availability function to establish an explicit time response relationship between ETa and soil moisture for implementing the ETa assimilation. The proposed ET-DA system was tested in the Upper Huai River Basin (UHRB), China using data from 2000 to 2012. Through synthetic simulation experiments, the capability of ET-DA for obtaining accurate, continuous time series of ETa estimates and achieving assimilation feedback on soil moisture and streamflow was examined. The results demonstrated that ET-DA provided improved regional ETa monitoring capability, and assimilation of ETa into the hydrological model led to improved model predictions of soil moisture and streamflow.

TI Reverse level pool routing: Comparison between a deterministic and a
   stochastic approach
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Reverse level pool routing; Bayesian Geostatistical Approach; Reservoir
   routing
ID GEOSTATISTICAL APPROACH; INVERSE PROBLEM
AB Reverse level pool routing is a technique to estimate the inflow hydrograph in a reservoir based on the knowledge of the outflow hydrograph, usually derived from water levels by means of a rating curve, and the level-storage relationship.
   In this work a comparison between a deterministic and a stochastic approach for reverse routing is presented. The deterministic approach rearranges and solves the reservoir differential continuity equation for the unknown inflow hydrograph by means of an explicit centered finite difference scheme. The Bayesian Geostatistical Approach, instead, addresses the inversion combining together prior information on the unknown inflow hydrograph and the available observations. For the stochastic inversion a forward solution of the reservoir continuity equation is required and in this work a scheme based on a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was used. The differences between the two methodologies are highlighted by means of a synthetic example and a case study (Parma river detention reservoir. Italy), considering dams with movable gates. The results show that the stochastic approach always gives better results than the deterministic one, in particular when errors in the reservoir water levels are present and/or the outflow rate changes abruptly after moving the gates. The main reason is the regularization imposed, in the stochastic inverse solution, by assuming the inflow hydrograph auto-correlated. Another advantage of the stochastic approach is that it does not enforce a mass balance through the observed noisy data. Despite this, the volume errors have the same order of magnitude of those obtained with the deterministic procedure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Regarded as the water towers of numerous large rivers in Asia, the Source Area of Yellow River (SAYR) on Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) contains substantial thermokarst lakes, which have exerted significant roles on the regional hydrology and water resources under permafrost degradation. To address the potential impact of climate- and permafrost-induced changes in surface hydrological processes in the SAYR, the hydrological transitions and water balance of thermokarst lakes were characterized on large scales during three years using stable isotope method. Spatial and seasonal deviations in hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes were remarkable. Calculations of evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios based on an isotope-mass balance model revealed substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes during June due to the control of climate conditions and limited input water. Substantial feeds from summer/fall rain and permafrost meltwater resulted in lower evaporation and positive water balance of lakes during July, August, September, and October. Based on the relationship between lake-specific input water isotope compositions (delta(I)) and annual average isotope value of precipitation (delta(P)), the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the SAYR were classified: supra-permafrost water/rainfall-dominated lakes were mainly concentrated during June and October regardless of spatial divergences, and summer precipitation/permafrost thaw-dominated lakes are popular during July and August. Qualitatively, seasonal diversities in the water balance of thermokarst lakes are combinatively controlled by air temperature, precipitation regimes, permafrost degradation in the SAYR. Lastly, the future hydrological trajectories of thermokarst lakes are expected under climatic warming and permafrost degradation. This study serves as an important contribution for understanding future hydrological changes and allocation of water resources on the QTP, as well as an indication of permafrost degradation under climate warming.

AB Streamflow time series data are fundamental to hydrological science and water management applications, which are commonly derived from stage-discharge rating curves. The rating curves are usually nonstationary due to temporal characteristics of stream channel and human activities such as indiscriminate dig of sediment. This implies the need for an efficient method to estimate nonstationary rating curves from an adequate dataset. This study employed a shifting method to estimate the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties. The method includes two steps: a coupled algorithm PELT&CROPS was first performed to divide the gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple change points in a time series of a residual indicator. Then, the rating curves were calibrated with the BaRatin stationary model using these homogeneous gaugings within each stationary period. The method was applied at Shijiao Hydrological Station in China. We found that: (1) Set the lower and upper limit of parameter CROPS (changepoints for a range of penalties) to 0 and Inf respectively, the whole range of segmentation can be calculated. (2) Parameter Minseglen (minimum segment length) is of great significance to the segmentation result. More changepoints will be detected as the value of Minseglen decreasing. An appropriate Minseglen value should be assigned to find the optimal segmentation. (3) The stage-discharge relationship in the low flow part is more sensitive to the variation of river topography. Ten segmentations are needed to produce an accurate discharge for low flow prediction, while two segmentations for calibration can produce an accurate discharge for high flow prediction. (4) Information redundancy exists in the vast amount of gaugings. The BaRatin model can reduce the use of calibration data by employing stage-discharge function with a precise exponent from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station.

AB The 'Dominant Source Layer' (DSL) is defined as the riparian zone (RZ) depth stratum that contributes the most to water and solute fluxes to streams. The concept can be used to explain timing and amount of matter transferred from RZs to streams in forest headwaters. Here, we investigated the potential impact of future climate changes on the long-term position of the DSL in a subhumid Mediterranean headwater catchment. We used the rainfall-runoff model PERSiST to simulate reference (1981-2000) and future (2081-2100) stream runoff. The latter were simulated using synthetic temperature, precipitation, and inter-event length scenarios in order to simulate possible effects of changes in temperature, rainfall amount, and rainfall event frequency and intensity. Simulated stream runoff was then used to estimate RZ groundwater tables and the proportion of lateral water flux at every depth in the riparian profile; and hence the DSL. Our simulations indicated that future changes in temperature and precipitation will have a similar impact on the long-term DSL position. Nearly all scenarios projected that, together with reductions in stream runoff and water exports, the DSL will move down in the future, by as much as ca. 30 cm. Shallow organic-rich layers in the RZ will only be hydrologically activated during sporadic, large rainfall episodes predicted for the most extreme inter-event length scenarios. Consequently, terrestrial organic matter inputs to streams will decrease, likely reducing catchment organic matter exports and stream dissolved organic carbon concentrations. This study highlights the importance of identifying vertical, hydrologically active layers in the RZ for a better understanding of the potential impact of future climate on lateral water transfer and their relationship with surface water quality and carbon cycling.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is one of the most important components in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of NPP at global and regional scales. Thus, understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in NPP and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed-the Upper reach of the Wei River Basin (UWRB)-on the Loess Plateau, China. To this end, an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) was applied to examine NPP during the period 1987-2016. The results show that the SWAT-DayCent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed. Though the basin average NPP increased slightly during the recent 30 years (1987-2016), the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region, with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part. The strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production, whereas warming may exert negative effects, especially in the southeastern part of the UWRB. Further, the strongly positive relationships between NPP and soil water/ET also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability, indicating a tightly-coupled water-carbon cycle in this region. Overall, our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles. The study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco-environmental management when facing the climate change on the Loess Plateau.

   PROCESSES RELATING TO CAPILLARY-PRESSURE SATURATION RELATIONSHIPS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DISPLACEMENT; WETTABILITY; FLOW
AB An experimental approach to study physical processes affecting fluid behavior in three-fluid porous media systems was designed and implemented. These experiments were designed to provide quantitative evidence of important pore-scale displacement processes. A unique experimental approach using a two-dimensional synthetic porous medium (micromodel) and digital image analysis (DIA) enabled both measurement of three-fluid capillary pressure-saturation relationships and analysis of fluid behavior at the pore level. Experiments were pressure controlled, and were designed to mimic measurements typically performed on laboratory cores. Only quasi-static measurements were made, with a focus on capillary pressure-saturation relations. Different orders of fluid infiltration with respect to wettability were studied. DIA made it possible to obtain quantitative information about the experiments, including fluid saturations, saturation changes between pressure steps, and movement of apparently isolated fluids through films. The results provide insights into important pore-scale mechanisms and provide a basis for three-fluid pore-scale computations.

AB Saltwater intrusion, commonly associated with extensive groundwater extraction, is an important problem for coastal regions. In this study, we present a multi-objective optimization approach to determine pumping rates and well locations to prevent saltwater intrusion, while satisfying desired extraction rates in coastal aquifers. The proposed method is an iterative sub-domain method, in which the proposed algorithm searches for the optimal solution by perturbing the well locations and pumping rates simultaneously. The decision variables of the optimization problem are modeled as continuous independent variables. Sharp interface solution for homogenous steady state problem is used along with the Dupuit and Ghyben-Herzberg assumptions. Using this approach, the direct method of searching for saltwater intrusion points is formulated by comparing the location of the stagnation points of the flow field, and the saltwater intrusion profiles obtained from the single-potential theory solution. The search for the optimal solution, within each sub-domain, is conducted using genetic algorithm. The multi-objective problem is formulated to maximize pumping rates while minimizing the distance between critical stagnation point and the reference coastline location, such that the wells are placed as closely to the coast as possible. Several numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a case study, the numerical results obtained from the proposed method are compared with the work of Cheng et al. [Water Resour. Res. 36 (2000) 2155]. This comparison yielded higher pumping rates than what was reported in their study. The sequential use of multi-objective criteria, with pre-selected weights, successfully demonstrated the capability of the model to achieve two objectives simultaneously. The proposed approach provides a cost effective solution to an important management problem in coastal aquifers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We give several examples of weaknesses in classical, empirically derived models of transport phenomena in porous medium systems. We also place recent attempts to develop improved multiscale porous medium models using averaging theory in context and note deficiencies in these approaches. These deficiencies are found to arise in part from the manner in which thermodynamics is introduced into a constrained entropy inequality, which is used to guide the formation of closed models. Because of this, we briefly examine several established thermodynamic approaches and outline a framework to develop macroscale models that retain consistency with microscale physics and thermodynamics. This framework will be detailed and applied in future papers in this (C)D 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Weathering rate models designed for watersheds combine chemical data of discharging waters with morphologic and hydrologic parameters of the catchments. At the spring watershed scale, evaluation of morphologic parameters is subjective due to difficulties in conceiving the catchment geometry. Besides, when springs emerge from crystalline massifs, rock structure must be accounted in formulas describing the area of minerals exposed to the percolating fluids, for a realistic evaluation of the rates. These particular features are not included in the available approaches and for that reason a new model was developed, coined THROW model. This is a lumped approach that integrates (T)opography, (H)ydrology, (RO)ck structure and (W)eathering in a single algorithm. The study area comprises several stream watersheds and spring sites of the Vouga River basin (northern Portugal), shaped on granites. Firstly, the THROW model couples a terrain modeling analysis with hydrologic models based on discharge rates, to determine hydraulic conductivities (K), effective porosities (n(e)) and annual recharges (V-r) at the stream watershed scale. Subsequently, these parameters are used in a water balance model to estimate concomitant groundwater travel times (t). The mean K [(4.7 +/- 3.2) x 10(-7) m s(-1)] and n(e) [(2.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(-2)] values are adopted as proxies for the spring watersheds and a firm regression equation is defined between time and stream watershed area (A). Secondly, two more runs of terrain modeling analysis are executed to extrapolate morphologic parameters for the spring watersheds. The first run hinges on scaling properties of the drainage networks, known as Horton laws, and is used to scale watershed areas across stream orders (i). The scaling function is described by another regression equation. The second run evaluates the order of a spring watershed, defined as equivalent order (i(eq)) and equated to the mean order of the surrounding stream watersheds. Having calculated the i(eq), spring watershed areas and travel times were downscaled using the regression equations (A < 10 km(2) and t = 1.4-2.8 year). Standing on the physical and hydrologic parameters of the spring watersheds, the THROW model finally calculates plagioclase weathering rates in the vicinity of the spring sites. The SiB model (Pacheco and Van der Weijden, 1996) was used before to estimate the contribution of plagioclase dissolution to the chemical composition of these springs (Van der Weijden and Pacheco, 2006). The chemical data were now coupled with K, n(e) and t in a rate equation to estimate chemical weathering rates of plagioclase in the basin. In the THROW model, the rate equation describes the exposed surface area as a function of fracture spacings, openings and porosities (Pacheco and Alencoao, 2006). The calculated rates (W-pl = (2.5 +/- 1.2) x 10(-14) mol m(-2) s(-1)) are consistent with previous reports and with results of experimental kinetic models. The SIB results predict formation of halloysite and gibbsite along the flow path, which were indeed close to equilibrium with the dissolved Al and Si activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB To explore the impact of climate change on snow cover and spring soil moisture (SM) in areas with seasonally frozen soil, snow cover parameters and spring SM for different land use types in Northeast China are extracted based on remote sensing snow cover and SM products. Snow cover parameters include snow days (SD), first day of snow cover (FSD), last day of snow cover (LSD), maximum snow depth (MSD) and average snow depth (ASD). The spatiotemporal variations and correlations between snow cover parameters and spring SM for different land use types are analyzed. The results showed that the average spring SM for different land use types was ordered woodland > farmland > grassland, with obvious woodland and farmland increases. Woodlands had many SD and large snow depths (MSD and ASD) that eventually decreased. Farmland SM increased significantly in spring, which aided crop development. The decrease in grassland spring SM was not obvious, but the snow cover parameters of certain areas decreased notably. Snow cover significantly impacted farmland SM, and correlation coefficients were highest between all snow cover parameters and SM in spring. The correlations between grassland snow cover parameters and SM in April were higher than those in May, but woodland snow cover parameters and spring SM were not correlated. Among the five snow parameters, FSD had the lowest correlation with spring SM, and SD had the greatest impact on SM. These results show the significant relationship between snow cover and SM and reveal relevant patterns. As future climate warming may introduce drought risk to woodland and grassland areas, advance preparations should be made. Farmland areas will continue to maintain appropriate SM, which is beneficial for agricultural development.

ID SAFETY ASSESSMENT
AB In recent years, the flooding risk of major facilities has increased significantly due to heavy rainfall events. These facilities must evaluate both external and internal flooding risk such as from heavy rainfall, flash floods, watershed flooding, river flooding, and coastal flooding. This study first estimates flooding from extreme rainfall with local intense precipitation and analyzes the resulting impacts on buildings and roads at a specific nuclear power plant (NPP) site, with which a roughness coefficient according to the landuse condition is estimated. A two-dimensional external flooding hazard analysis is then carried out with tidal levels as the external boundary conditions, and based on the results, new hazard curves for the inundation depth with frequency and duration are developed for the NPP site to show the relationships among rainfall, flood depth, and annual exceedance probability. To match the proper probability distribution types to the flood hazard curves, the fit was analyzed through Akaike's information criterion verification. After analyzing the correlation between the flood depths, the mode values were calculated through Monte Carlo simulation with the verified probability distribution types. Finally, probabilistic flood hazard curves for the NPP site were obtained based on the calculated mode values. Representatively, when a 10(6)-year return period rainfall occurs at the nuclear power plant site, the mode flood depth was found to be 1.07 m for power plant 1 and 0.61 m for power plant 2. In this way, the approach of this study is expected to support the waterproof design of critical facilities, flood prevention function design, the advancement of flood prevention measures and procedures, and the evaluation of flood mitigation functions.

AB The relationship between tracer velocities and wave or wetting front celerities is essential to understand water flowing from hillslopes to the stream. The connection between maximum velocity and celerities estimated by means of experimental techniques has not been explored. To assess the pattern of infiltrating water front and dominant flow direction, we performed sprinkling experiments at a trenched plot in the Weierbach catchment in Luxembourg. Maximum velocities and wetting front celerities were inferred at different depths using artificial tracers, soil moisture measurements (TDR), and geophysical techniques. The flow direction was predominantly vertical within the observed plot, with almost no lateral flow observed until depths of 2-3 m; shallow trench flow was intermittent and associated with preferential flow. Average celerity estimates using TDR and geophysical techniques were equal to 707 +/- 234 mm h(-1) and 971 +/- 625 mm h(-1), respectively. Vertical maximum velocity estimates were tracer-dependent and had very variable ranges: 109.3 +/- 89.3 mm h(-1) (Cl-), 177.8 +/- 199.1 mm h(-1) (Br-), and 604.1 +/- 610.7 mm h(-1) (Li+). Preferential flow processes were inferred from maximum velocities apparently greater than celerities and scattered trench flow with highly variable tracer concentrations. The high variability between maximum velocities of different tracers indicated a complex pattern of tracer movement through the soil, not captured by celerity values alone. Our study demonstrated the importance to assess both velocities and celerities to understand flow dynamics in response to sprinkling while information on the wetting front alone would have missed important preferential flow processes.

AB Real world models of seawater intrusion (SWI) require high computational efforts. This creates computational difficulties for the uncertainty propagation (UP) analysis of these models due the need for repeated numerical simulations in order to adequately capture the underlying statistics that describe the uncertainty in model outputs. Moreover, despite the obvious advantages of moment-independent global sensitivity analysis (SA) methods, these methods have rarely been employed for SWI and other complex groundwater models. The reason is that moment-independent global SA methods involve repeated UP analysis which further becomes computationally demanding. This study proposes the use of non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) as a means to significantly accelerate UP analysis in SWI numerical modeling studies and shows that despite the highly non-linear and non-smooth input/output relationship that exists in SWI models, non-intrusive PCEs provide a reliable and yet computationally efficient surrogate of the original numerical model. The study illustrates that for the considered two and six dimensional UP problems, PCEs offer a more accurate estimation of the statistics describing the uncertainty in model outputs compared to Monte Carlo simulations based on the original numerical model. This study also shows that the use of non-intrusive PCEs in the estimation of the moment-independent sensitivity indices (i.e. delta indices) decreases the computational time by several orders of magnitude without causing significant loss of accuracy. The use of non-intrusive PCEs for the generation of SWI hazard maps is proposed to extend the practical applications of UP analysis in coastal aquifer management studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Streamflow forecasting plays a critical role in nearly all aspects of water resources planning and management. In this work, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), an effective kernel-based machine learning algorithm, is applied to probabilistic streamflow forecasting. GPR is built on Gaussian process, which is a stochastic process that generalizes multivariate Gaussian distribution to infinite-dimensional space such that distributions over function values can be defined. The GPR algorithm provides a tractable and flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework for inferring the posterior distribution of streamflows. The prediction skill of the algorithm is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using the MOPEX database, which includes long-term hydrometeorological time series collected from 438 basins across the U.S. from 1948 to 2003. Comparisons with linear regression and artificial neural network models indicate that GPR outperforms both regression methods in most cases. The GPR prediction of MOPEX basins is further examined using the Budyko framework, which helps to reveal the close relationships among water-energy partitions, hydrologic similarity, and predictability. Flow regime modification and the resulting loss of predictability have been a major concern in recent years because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. The persistence of streamflow predictability is thus examined by extending the original MOPEX data records to 2012. Results indicate relatively strong persistence of streamflow predictability in the extended period, although the low-predictability basins tend to show more variations. Because many low-predictability basins are located in regions experiencing fast growth of human activities, the significance of sustainable development and water resources management can be even greater for those regions.

AB Glacier hydrology has profound implications for socio-economic development and nature conservation in arid Central Asia. Process-based hydrological models, which are the traditional tools used to simulate glacier melting, have made considerable contributions to advance our understanding of glacio-hydrology. Simultaneously, deep learning (DL) models have achieved excellent performance in many complex tasks and provide high accuracy. However, it is uncertain whether glacio-hydrological studies can benefit from the application of DL models. In this study, to help us assess water resource change for glacier-influenced regions, we used DL models to simulate glacio-hydrological processes in the Urumqi Glacier No. 1 in northwest China. First, we proposed a newly DL model called Exogenous Regularization Network (ERNet), which focuses on the relationship between exogenous (temperature and precipitation) and endogenous (runoff) variables, balancing the roles of different variables in the simulation process. Second, we compared ERNet with a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a process-based glacio-hydrology model, FLEXG. Experiments showed that compared with the other two models, ERNet not only performed well in runoff and peak flow simulations but also displayed superior transferability. Third, given that the DL model is data-driven, we experimentally compared the importance of air temperature and precipitation to glacial runoff processes. The results show that air temperature plays a dominant role in glacier runoff generation. We believe that the proposed model provides a useful predictive tool and that the results shed light on the future implication in cold region hydrology.

AB Global population growth and rapid economic development, along with modern goals for creating sustainable communities, render it necessary to focus on fundamental, finite resources such as water and energy. The interdependencies between water and energy are well known, while recently the interest of the scientific and policy communities on their dependency relationship has grown noticeably. On the one hand, water is used throughout the energy industry, while, on the other hand, the water system needs energy for collecting, pumping, supplying and treating water. Considering the latter case, great importance should be given when specifically referring to groundwater resources for the abstraction of which a large amount of energy is generally required. Therefore, minimizing the energy consumed for pumping groundwater is extremely important, and, for this reason, a large number of studies have been conducted in order to address this certain issue. However, most of the studies dealing with pumping cost minimization problems ignore the effect of friction losses on the total energy consumed for pumping and transporting groundwater. Under this perspective, the present paper attempts to highlight the importance of including friction losses in such type of problems by combining a simulation model and an optimization algorithm. Through the formulation of different setups of the same problem, that is the energy cost minimization for pumping groundwater from a system of wells and transporting it through transmission lines, it was found that only when including friction losses in the optimization problem, all managed wells are being used for pumping water, thus resulting in more reasonable and workable solutions.

AB Tracer tests are useful field methods with a wide range of applications in karst aquifers. The measured tracer breakthrough curve at a karst spring allows the estimation of the important transport properties of the karst system. The breakthrough curve is typically characterized by a long tailing and a low tracer recovery that is not captured by the classical one-dimensional advection dispersion model. Partitioning models are often used and require a large number of parameters. In the present work, simplified transport models are proposed to simulate the typical karst breakthrough curve. The model setup consists of a karst conduit that is interacting laterally with the surrounding matrix. The solute transport in both the conduit and matrix are governed by the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation and the resulting mathematical model consists of a coupled system of differential equations. The Laplace transform method is used to derive the transport models for various flow and boundary conditions. The models are in terms of four physically meaningful parameters that represent the advection and dispersion properties of the flow in the conduit and matrix. Algebraic relationships to estimate the model parameters are also derived in terms of the key features of the breakthrough curves. The main advantage of the proposed models are their simple formulation and ability to capture the long tailing of the breakthrough curve in terms of just a few parameters. Application of the models to two real karst aquifers demonstrate their effectiveness in simulating the observed breakthrough curves and estimating the key transport parameters.

AB Drought is one of the costliest natural hazards and the main factor of concern impacting crop growth in the arid Hexi Corridor in Northwest China. However, the inter-relationship between meteorological drought severity and crop yield is seldom studied across this region. In this study, two multi-scalar drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) are employed to monitor the evolution of drought condition in the Hexi Corridor. We examined (a) the historical drought evolution of the He'd Corridor since 19705; (b) the possible future drought tendency under different RCP scenarios; and (c) the multi-scale correlation between climatic crop yield and drought indices. The results indicate that the studied area experienced a trend towards warmer and wetter conditions during the last 4 decades and this trend last until the middle 2030s indicated by SPEI. The feasibility of SPEI and SPI for quantifying drought condition and evaluating production loss was tested in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest of China and SPEI was found more reliable. Correlation analysis between climatic yield and drought indices revealed that the drought condition of the month July detected by 3-month SPEI was the most relevant for the observed changes in climate yield in the Hexi Corridor. By obtaining the critical point of each SPEI-climatic yield curve, we found the different levels of yield vulnerability for the four selected districts, according to which we are able to gain an early prediction of the crop production crisis corresponding to the future drought events.

AB This paper examines the flood hydrology of the North Platte River headwaters, northern Colorado, in order to provide information for downstream water resource management. The drainage basin (similar to 3700 km(2)) is bound on all sides by mountain ranges in excess of 3200 m. As with most high-elevation rivers in the Rocky Mountain region, annual peak floods are generated by spring snowmelt runoff. Analysis of an 89-year continuous record of daily and annual peak discharges (1916-2004) in conjunction with historical climate data reveals statistically significant relationships between hydrologic and climatologic parameters. The magnitude of the annual peak discharge explains 73% of the variability in total annual discharge, with higher predictability for low-flow years than for high-flow years. The peak discharge time series exhibits no temporal auto-correlation in flood magnitude, but does reveal a strong 4-7 year periodicity in inter-annual flood variability. Basin-averaged total precipitation explains 76% of the variability in peak flood magnitude, and 84% of the variability in total annual discharge. Furthermore, both total annual discharge and basin-averaged precipitation are strongly correlated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values at regional scales. The regional PDSI index exhibits a 4-7 year periodicity in wet/dry cycles similar to that of the periodicity in inter-annual flood variability. These results indicate multi-annual, regional climatic conditioning of the total annual discharge regime, while local meteorological conditions during spring snowmelt are responsible for the timing and magnitude of the annual peak flood.

AB Quantifying the uncertainty of probabilistic water quality forecasting induced by missing input data is fundamentally challenging. This study introduced a novel methodology for probabilistic water quality forecasting conditional on point forecasts. A Multivariate Bayesian Uncertainty Processor (MBUP) was adopted to probabilistically model the relationship between the point forecasts made by a deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) and their corresponding observed water quality. The methodology was tested using hourly water quality series at an island of Shanghai City in China. The novelties relied upon: firstly, the use of a transfer learning algorithm to overcome flatten- and under-prediction bottlenecks of river water quality raised in artificial neural networks, and secondly, the use of the MBUP to capture the dependence structure between observations and forecasts. Two deep learning ANNs were used to make the point forecasts. Then the MBUP approach driven by the point forecasts demonstrated its competency in improving the accuracy of probabilistic water quality forecasts significantly, where predictive distributions encountered in multi-step-ahead water quality forecasts were effectively reduced to small ranges. The results demonstrated that the deep learning plus the post-processing approach suitably extracted the complex dependence structure between the model's output and observed water quality so that model reliability (Containing Ratio > 85% and average Relative Band-width < 0.25) as well as forecast accuracy (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient > 0.8 and Root-Mean-Square-Error < 0.4 mg/l) for future horizons from 1 h up to 10 h were significantly improved, even if the input data missing rate reaches 50%.

AB Assessing flood frequency is pivotal for hydrology, with implications for many fields ranging from river science to the insurance industry. Reservoir regulation may alter the characteristics of the flood frequency distribution function. This paper incorporates reservoir impacts as an inherent variable to derive an analytical solution of outflow peaks and proposes new flood frequency distributions. Steps are as follows: (1) the original flood without reservoir impacts is assumed to follow a Pearson type III distribution, (2) linear and nonlinear reservoir models, including numerical integration and triangular area calculation methods, are proposed to simulate the relationships between inflow and outflow peaks, and (3) the flood frequency distributions resulting from reservoir impacts are derived. Derived equations are applied to the Shuibuya and Wuqiangxi reservoirs in China. Results show that: (1) although the numerical integration method with the nonlinear model is comparable with the reservoir flood routing, the triangle area calculation method with the nonlinear model is recommended for its accuracy and simplicity, (2) the reservoir regulation changes the flood frequency distribution function entirely in the nonlinear reservoir model, while only change the parameter in the linear reservoir model, and (3) downstream flood's CV can be increased or decreased, which depends on the reservoir regulating capacity. It is indicated that altering the parameters of the flood frequency distribution is not sufficient to characterize watershed under reservoir control. This paper proposes the analytical solution about inflow and outflow peaks, which can point out the possible changes in the watershed with reservoir construction in plan.

AB On the Great Plains of North America, water resources are being threatened by climatic shifts. However, a lack of hillslope-scale climate-runoff observations is limiting our ability to understand these impacts. Here, we present a 52-year (1962-2013) dataset (precipitation, temperature, snow cover, soil water content, and runoff) from three 5 ha hillslopes on the seasonally-frozen northern Great Plains. In this region, snowmelt-runoff drives c. 80% of annual runoff and is potentially vulnerable to warming temperatures and changes in precipitation amount and phase. We assessed trends in these climatological and hydrological variables using time series analysis. We found that spring snowmelt-runoff has decreased (on average by 59%) in response to a reduction in winter snowfall (by 18%), but that rainfall-runoff has shown no significant response to a 51% increase in rainfall or shifts to more multi-day rain events. In summer, unfrozen, deep, high-infiltrability soils act as a 'shock absorber' to rainfall, buffering the long-term runoff response to rainfall. Meanwhile, during winter and spring freshet, frozen ground limits soil infiltrability and results in runoff responses that more closely mirror the snowfall and snowmelt trends. These findings are counter to climate-runoff relationships observed at the catchment scale on the northern Great Plains where land drainage alterations dominate. At the hillslope scale, decreasing snowfall, snowmelt-runoff, and spring soil water content is causing agricultural productivity to be increasingly dependent on growing season precipitation, and will likely accentuate the impact of droughts.

AB The impact of leaf area index (LAI) seasonality on three-year (2005-2007) daily soil moisture predictions was investigated for two different land surface models (IBIS and HYDRUS) at the Stanley semi-arid grassland field site. Three daily LAI time series derived from different empirical NDVI-LAI relationships using the MODIS NDVI data were used in the analysis. Calibration results from both models consistently suggested that an average LAI over time, rather than a time varying daily LAI, was sufficient to reproduce daily soil moisture at our site. We did, however, find that the sensitivity of the impact of LAI time variability on soil moisture estimation was a function of soil parameters. The influence of LAI time variation on the soil moisture simulations is controlled by the sensitivity of modelled soil moisture to the average LAI values over that period, and soil parameters affected the sensitivity of the model to LAI. Those parameter sets that were most sensitive to the long-term mean LAI were also those that were the most sensitive to the time variability. In our case, model calibrations using a constant LAI adjusted the soil parameters to reduce the impact of LAI variability. Results also suggested that the LAI variability could be significant if the varying LAI approached a very low level (i.e. LAI < 1) for a significant proportion of the simulation period. This is most likely to be the case for short grasses in grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zayandeh-Rud River Basin is one of the most important basins in central Iran, which has been continually challenged by water stress during the past 60 years. Traditionally, a supply-oriented management scheme has been prescribed as a reliable solution to water shortage problems in the basin, resulting in a number of water transfer projects that have more than doubled the natural flow of the river. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of inter-basin water transfer to meet the growing water demand in Zayandeh-Rud River Basin. A system dynamics model is developed to capture the inter-relationships between different sub-systems of the river basin, namely the hydrologic, socioeconomic, and agricultural sub-systems. Results from simulating a range of possible policy options for resolving water shortage problems indicate that water is essentially the development engine of the system. Therefore, supplying more water to the basin without considering the dynamics of the interrelated problems will eventually lead to increased water demand. It is demonstrated that the Zayandeh-Rud River Basin management system has characteristics of the "Fixes that Backfire" system archetype, in which inter-basin water transfer is an inadequate water management policy, causing significant unintended side-effects. A comprehensive solution to the problem includes several policy options that simultaneously control the dynamics of the system, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences. In particular, policy makers should consider minimizing agricultural water demand through changing crop patterns as an effective policy solution for the basin's water problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The worth of archival, long-term, high spatial and temporal resolution radarrainfall estimates for hydrologic modeling has not yet been established. In particular, uncertainties remain regarding accuracy at the event time-scale, which is a modeling requirement for mass conservation. To explore this issue, an archival radar-rainfatt precipitation dataset produced from the National Reflectivity Composite for the GEWEX Continentat-Scate International Project (GCIP) and US National Weather Service, Weather Surveillance Radar 1988-D (WSR-88D) Stage III (SIII) data were compared with data from 982 National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) rain gages throughout the Mississippi River Basin. These two datasets are derived from the same radar- reflectivity observations but they are different. The GCIP dataset was developed from low resolution (5 dBZ bins) national radar mosaic imagery using a systematic procedure that employed one climatotogicatly-derived reflectivity-rainfall relationship, while the SIII radar-rainfall estimates are produced using a processing algorithm developed by the US National Weather Service that employs near-real time adjustment and varied parameterizations in different River Forecast Centers around the Mississippi River Basin. Statistical analyses were performed to compare both radar-rainfatt datasets with rain gage data on an event time-scale for the entire year of 1997. The investigation shows that the GCIP dataset, given a change in the equation used to calculate rainfall from reflectivity, has a tower root mean square difference for the majority of gages in four of the five river forecast centers that cover the Mississippi River Basin compared to SIII in 1997.

AB This paper provides the thermodynamic approach and constitutive theory for closure of the conservation equations for multiphase flow in porous media. The starting point for the analysis is the balance equations of mass, momentum, and energy for two fluid phases, a solid phase, the interfaces between the phases and the common lines where interfaces meet. These equations have been derived at the macroscale, a scale on the order of tens of pore diameters. Additionally, the entropy inequality for the multiphase system at this scale is utilized. The internal energy at the macroscale is postulated to depend thermodynamically on the extensive properties of the system. This energy is then decomposed to provide energy forms for each of the system components. To obtain constitutive information from the entropy inequality, information about the mechanical behavior of the internal geometric structure of the phase distributions must he known. This information is obtained from averaging theorems, thermodynamic analysis, and from linearization of the entropy inequality at near equilibrium conditions. The final forms of the equations developed show that capillary pressure is a function of interphase area per unit volume as well as saturation. The standard equations used to model multiphase how are found to be very restricted forms of the general equations, and the assumptions that are needed for these equations to hold are identified.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles. ET products have proliferated. This study evaluates ten monthly, globally available products, including one product from the upscaling of in situ observations (FLUXCOM), one ensemble product (SynthesisET), four remote sensing-based products (SSEBop, MOD16, Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) and PT-JPLSM) and four prod-ucts from land surface models (Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), FLDAS, TerraClimate and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)). The assessments are conducted during the period of 2003-2013 using FLUXNET2015 eddy covariance datasets at the site scale, which are grouped by land cover, elevation and climate, and GRACE-based water balance ET at basin scales. The results indicate that all products show com-parable performance and that no single product shows the best performance. FLUXCOM and GLDAS have outstanding performances at both the site and basin scales, respectively. SynthesisET tends to have suboptimal performance at both validation scales, while FLDAS, SSEBop and TerraClimate show relatively poor results. Other products reproduced ET moderately well. The metrics of the two validation methods are compared. The results indicated that the performance of products at the basin scale is usually better than that at the site scale. The anomalies in specific regions and the trends among ET products are observed at both scales. In addition, the special relationship between the products and the validation methods will affect the credibility of their assess-ment results. This study contributes to the assessment of the performance of products to identify proper can-didates for hydrological analysis and improve the ET algorithm.

AB Modelling the impact of climate change on streamflow for remote or data sparse regions is a challenge for hydrologists, as large datasets are often needed to adequately characterise the processes that dominate. The Tibetan Plateau, which forms the headwaters of the Brahmaputra and many other major rivers in the Indo-China region, is not closely monitored due to its harsh environment. This lack of monitoring is significant as regards its substantial snow resources, of considerable importance given the influence these have on the supply of water to downstream communities. This research uses a conceptual hydrologic model developed to simulate the impact of the changing climate in such large, snow-covered, data sparse catchments, to adequately understand the likely changes in future water availability in the highly populated Brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas in the Tibetan Plateau. A multivariate nested recursive bias correction (MRNBC) approach is used for correcting systematic biases present in the climate model simulations of temperature and precipitation jointly across multiple timescales preserving the dynamic relationships amongst the variables. The results disclose that monthly snow cover fraction in the near future (2041-2060) and far future (2071-2090) will decrease significantly with respect to the historical period (1981-2000). While the annual streamflow is noted to be increasing for the basin, water supply reliability exhibits a reduction, partly as a result of the increased spill volume arising from greater snowmelt concentrated over the wet period, and partly the increase in evaporation losses due to higher temperatures. While the above results pertain to the Brahmaputra basin, similar changes are expected for the other major rivers that originate in the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Quantitative analysis of flow in fractures is an important issue for hydrogeological and geological engineering. In this study, Forchheimer models involving viscous permeability (k(v)) and inertial permeability (k(i)) were developed for groundwater flow in different single fractures or fractured media. Based on experiments and numerical simulation, the relationship between viscous permeability and inertial permeability in a single fracture was disclosed and an important parameter omega (the scaling coefficient omega (omega = k(i)/k(v)(3/2))) was characterized. The results showed: (1) the Forchheimer model fit the non-linear fluid flow in almost all types of artificial single fractures that investigated in this study; (2) inertial permeability could be predicted by viscous permeability based on the empirical quantitative model: k(i) = omega k(y)(\*MERGEFORMAT)(3/2)(omega approximate to 10(8) m(-2)); (3) the fluctuation range of omega was related to the number of medium types, more medium types would induce a larger fluctuation range; artificial single fractures produced a smaller omega than that in natural rock fractures; omega was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the inertial effect, roughness and average aperture; the roughness element shape that caused greater turbulence effects led to larger omega; and single fractures placed vertically produced larger omega than fractures placed horizontally. In addition, the ratio of viscous permeability to inertial permeability (k(v)/k(i)) in fractures could be used as the characteristic length of Forchheimer number (F-o). By characterizing scaling factor omega, the accuracy of the quantitative model could be improved, and basis for further quantification of non-Darcy flow was established.

ID WATER; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; LAKE
AB Due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources, river basins play an important role in reliable water supply. A comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats. In the present study, comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to determine the undesirable events. The FTA method, based on a logical diagram, reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin. It can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins' reliability. In this study, undesirable ecological status, low quality and scarcity of water resources, and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the Urmia Lake Basin. To do this, an FTA model is presented in which "Water Resources Failure Risk of Urmia Lake Basin" is the top event. The probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts' opinions. The results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence. The effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are "Inappropriate governance", "low awareness level", "Entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater", "Entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater", and "Meteorological drought", respectively. The index derived from the FTA can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins.

   AUSTRALIA; RESPONSES; SALINITY
AB Restoration of water quality in deforested watersheds is a major environmental and economic challenge in many parts of the world. In south-western Australia water quality issues manifest as salinisation, where reactivation of groundwater systems has occurred post-deforestation with the consequent discharge of salts stored in deep regolith into rivers. Prior to deforestation the stream salinity of the Denmark River (a forested watershed of 502 km(2)) was between 150 and 350 mg L-1TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and was developed as a small water supply with potential for a much larger development. By the 1970s, 20% of deep rooted vegetation in the watershed was removed resulting in annual flow-weighted stream salinity of 1500 mg L-1TDS making the river unsuitable as a water supply. Two main policy approaches were used to restore this watershed: (1) the control of further deforestation on private land through regulation; and (2) a program to encourage private reforestation with eucalypt pulp-wood plantations. By 2010, 143% of the watershed was reforested leaving only 5.5% still deforested, with a strong relationship between streamflow and stream salinity and the amount of reforestation. River salinity had fallen to 500 mg L-1 TDS by 2017. Although streamflow had fallen from a mean 28.6 GL yr(-1) in 1985-1990 to 13.6 GL yr(-1) in 2012-2017 this was with water that was potable. The challenge into the future is to ensure the lower stream salinity is maintained through maintenance of forest cover. Importantly, this paper demonstrates that stream salinity can be reversed following deforestation if an appropriate scale of reforestation is deployed.

AB This study presents an investigation of probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables (including precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) and the potential links to large-scale atmospheric circulation over Baden-Wurttemberg, Southwest Germany. First, the joint dependence between seasonal streamflow and hydroclimatic variables was established by using copulas. On the basis of the joint dependence structure, we estimated the probabilities of hydrological droughts and prolonged high-streamflow events conditioned upon two different scenarios (high and low) of hydroclimatic variables for various seasons over the study area. The results indicate that both precipitation and soil moisture are positively related to the streamflow variation in Baden-Wiirttemberg for each season and strongly impact the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high-streamflow events. Temperature tends to have less impact on the streamflow variation, and an inverse connection between streamflow and temperature is found in spring and summer. Then, the connections between streamflow variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation in summer and winter were explored by using composite analysis. Although the atmospheric circulation patterns vary in each season, it can be found that in summer high streamflow anomalies over Baden-Wiirttemberg are related to a cyclonic activity over central Europe while low streamflow anomalies are linked to anticyclonic patterns over western Ireland. The high streamflow anomalies in winter are strongly impacted by the westerlies that play an important role in favoring warm and moist airstreams from the Atlantic Ocean towards the study area, while an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies. The presented probabilistic methodology could also be applied in other regions worldwide.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID DISCHARGE
AB A fundamental concept in groundwater hydrology is the notion of steady state, or equilibrium conditions. When a system at some initial steady state condition is perturbed by pumping, a transient cone of depression will develop and the system will approach a new steady state condition. Understanding the time scale required for the transient process to occur is of practical interest since it would help practitioners decide whether to use a steady state model or a more complicated transient model. Standard approaches to estimate the response time use simple scaling relationships which neglect spatial variations. Alternatively, others define the response time to be the amount of time taken for the difference between the transient and steady state solutions to fall below some arbitrary tolerance level. Here, we present a novel approach and use the concept of mean action time to predict aquifer response time scales in a two-dimensional radial geometry for pumping, injection and recovery processes. Our approach leads to relatively simple closed form expressions that explicitly show how the time scale depends on the hydraulic parameters and position. Furthermore, our dimensionless framework allows us to predict the response time scales for a range of applications including small scale laboratory problems and large scale field problems. Our analysis shows that the response time scales vary spatially, but are equivalent for pumping, injection and associated recovery processes. Furthermore, the time scale is independent of the pumping or injection flow rate. We test these predictions in a laboratory scale aquifer and find that our physical measurements corroborate the theoretical predictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relative permittivity of soils is related to the volumetric liquid water content by a monotonous and general relationship. Among others, Topp et al. [1980] have proposed a simple empirical function to allow a direct determination of the water content. The moment method is applied here to calculate the apparent permittivity of a given volume of soil resulting from the electrical coupling between its different constituents and to attempt to reproduce the empirical function. This is not possible when considering randomly isotropically distributed elementary volumes of water, solid, and air. To reproduce the empirical function, it is necessary to consider that as the water content increases, the elementary volumes of water become more elongated since the liquid phase is continuous.

AB Estimated and measured settlements caused by pumping rarely agree. Several reasons could explain this mismatch, including the influence of layering, the mechanical parameters used in the predictions, or the relationship between settlements and drawdown. We analyze the influence of the above issues by investigating the mechanical response of pumped elastic porous media under different conditions. A radially symmetric conceptual model is considered and several hydro-mechanical simulations are performed varying the boundary conditions, the size of the modeled domain and the presence or not of an overlying layer. The simplicity of the considered problem allows us to compare our results with existing analytical solutions, to identify the role of each variable on pumping settlements and to generalize the results. The most relevant results are as follows: (1) settlements are proportional to drawdown only outside a circle of radius equal to 0.7 times the thickness of the pumped porous medium; inside, they are virtually constant, which leads to two simple procedures for computing pumping settlements. (2) Poorly conductive layers located above (or below) a pumped porous medium (with higher hydraulic conductivity) reduce and smooth settlements. (3) Boundary constraints affect the local specific storage coefficient and the displacements occurred. (4) The specific storage coefficient evaluated by interpreting pumping tests with the Cooper and Jacob method (1946) leads to overestimation of the actual Young's Modulus of the soil. The main conclusion is that settlements are less differential than expected near pumping wells. Still, they must always be evaluated acknowledging the nature of layering, the boundary constraints and carefully selecting the mechanical parameters of the soil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Stream-habitat assessment for evaluation of restoration projects requires the examination of many parameters, both watershed-scale and reach-scale, to incorporate the complex non-linear effects of geomorphic, riparian, watershed and hydrologic factors on aquatic ecosystems. Rapid geomorphic assessment tools used by many jurisdictions to assess natural channel design projects seldom include watershed-level parameters, which have been shown to have a significant effect on benthic habitat in stream systems. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed to integrate complex non-linear relationships between the aquatic ecosystem health indices and key watershed-scale and reach-scale parameters. Physical stream parameters, based on QHEI parameters, and watershed characteristics data were collected at 112 sites on 62 stream systems located in Southern Ontario. Benthic data were collected separately and benthic invertebrate summary indices, specifically Hilsenhoffs Biotic Index (HBI) and Richness, were determined.
   The ANN models were trained on the randomly selected 3/4 of the dataset of 112 streams in Ontario, Canada and validated on the remaining 1/4. The R-2 values for the developed ANN model predictions were 0.86 for HBI and 0.92 for Richness. Sensitivity analysis of the trained ANN models revealed that Richness was directly proportional to Erosion and Riparian Width and inversely proportional to Floodplain Quality and Substrate parameters. HBI was directly proportional to Velocity Types and Erosion and inversely proportional to Substrate, % Treed and 1:2 Year Flood Flow parameters. The ANN models can be useful tools for watershed managers in stream assessment and restoration projects by allowing consideration of watershed properties in the stream assessment.

AB Plant water use characteristics and transpiration responses under dry conditions are considered essential for effective and sustainable ecosystem management in arid areas. This study was conducted to evaluate the response of shelterbelt stand transpiration to precipitation, soil drought and groundwater variations in an oasis-desert ecotone in the middle of the Heihe River Basin, China. Sap flow was measured in eight Gansu Poplar trees (Populus Gansuensis) with different diameter at breast height over three consecutive growing seasons (2012-2014). The groundwater evapotranspiration via plant use was estimated by the White method with diurnal water table fluctuations. The results showed that precipitation increased the stand transpiration but not statistically significant (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The recharge of soil water by irrigation caused stand transpiration acceleration significantly (t-test, p < 0.05). Stand transpiration and canopy conductance increased by 27% and 31%, respectively, when soil water conditions changed from dry to wet. Canopy conductance decreased logarithmically with vapor pressure deficit, while there was no apparent relationship between canopy conductance and solar radiation. The sensitivity of canopy conductance to vapor pressure deficit decreased under dry soil conditions. Groundwater evapotranspiration (0.6-7.1 mm day(-1)) was linearly correlated with stand transpiration (1.1-6.5 mm day(-1)) (R-2 = 0.71), and these two variables had similar variability. During the drought period, approximately 80% of total stand transpiration came from groundwater evapotranspiration. This study highlighted the critical role of irrigation and groundwater for shelterbelt, and might provide the basis for the development of water requirement schemes for shelterbelt growth in arid inland river basins.

AB Typhoons or heavy rainfall events account for a significant portion of annual extreme rainfall in southern Taiwan. This study built a dynamic time series model for long duration extreme rainfalls to investigate common trends in annual maximum precipitation. The annual maximum rainfall depths for 24-h duration (AM24 h) and annual maximum rainfall depths for 1-h duration (AM1 h) of the same event were observed at 16 rainfall stations in the Kaoping River watershed, Southern Taiwan. The relationship between short and long duration observations is difficult to directly evaluate from comparative statistical techniques. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA, a dimension reduction technique and can be adopted for analysis of non-stationary time series) was therefore used to identify underlying common trends of AM24 h time series and significant explanatory variables (AM1 h) contributing to variations of AM24 h. The results of best dynamic factor models (DFMs) show that the AM1 h of nearby rainfall stations at both high elevation (coefficient of efficiency, C-eff = 0.924) and low elevation (C-eff = 0.909) successfully describe the AM24 h in the Kaoping River watershed. The AM1 h observed at high elevation, close to the study area center significantly relates to the AM24 h of most rainfall stations. The common trends of extreme precipitation at most stations are upward in the Kaoping River watershed. Due to this successful application of DFA, predicting AM24 h in the Kaoping River watershed should account for the dominant rainfall stations with annual maximum rainfalls for short durations, to provide important information to determine precipitation trends for long-term planning.

AB The South African Water Act of 1998 stipulates that future water resource developments should be environmentally sustainable and that a component of the natural flow of rivers should be reserved to ensure some level of ecological functioning. Detailed methods for quantifying the environmental instream flow. requirements of rivers have been available internationally and in South Africa for some time, but the implementation of the new act introduced a degree of urgency and pointed towards the need for rapid, low-confidence assessments that could be used for initial planning. The desktop reserve model was developed to fulfil this requirement, but since its development in 1999 there have been many more detailed IFR determinations. During 2001 the model underwent a complete review based on the results from 97 detailed IFR determinations involving groups of specialists applying the building block methodology (BBM). The paper explains the conceptual links between the,BBM and the model, describes the algorithms that constitute the model and discusses some of the problems associated with developing a model of this type from limited data and limited scientific understanding of the underlying principles. Most of the problems are related to the lack of a consistent understanding of the relationships between hydrological variations and ecological functioning of rivers across a range of river types within a large geographic region (South Africa, for example). The paper indicates that despite these problems the model has found a niche in the water resource management industry within South Africa land has the potential to be improved as our scientific understanding of eco-hydrology improves.

AB The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provided an entirely new way to measure mass changes on the Earth at unprecedented accuracy and resolution. However, the delayed launch of the GRACE Follow On (FO) mission led to an approximately 1-year gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO data, breaking the continuity of observation and hampering data analysis. Efforts have been made to bridge this gap for the major river basins, but little has been done on ice sheets. To address this limitation, we evaluated multiple linear regression (MLR), a back propagation neural network (BPNN), and a deep belief network (DBN) to fill the data gap in Greenland and its six sub-regions. We employed these methods to establish the relationships between precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and ice discharge and GRACE-estimated ice mass changes. A sliding window testing method shows that the BPNN outperformed the two other methods with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1.5 cm in the metrics for the equivalent water height for the whole of Greenland and 1.5-3.6 cm (2.5 cm in average) for the six sub-regions. This accuracy is rather high given an uncertainty of ~ 2 cm in GRACE estimates, but higher for the whole of Greenland than in the sub-regions. This difference was caused by mass leakage error between adjacent sub-regions in the GRACE observations, and can be mitigated by merging these sub-regions. The BPNN predicted ice mass changes agree with the GRACE estimates for long-term and seasonal signals, but are less accurate and precise for interannual signals. Based on the GRACE observations and the BPNN predicted values, we reestimated the ice mass change in Greenland finding that ice loss on Greenland decelerated after mid-2012, primarily due to deceleration in SW, SE, and NE regions.

AB Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a central role in the hydrology and hydroclimatology of the central United States. More than 25% of the annual rainfall is associated with ARs over much of this region, with many large flood events tied to their occurrence. Despite the relevance of these storms for flood hydrology and water budget, the characteristics of rainfall associated with ARs over the central United has not been investigated thus far. This study fills this major scientific gap by describing the rainfall during ARs over the central United States using five remote sensing-based precipitation products over a 12-year study period. The products we consider are: Stage IV, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); the CPC MORPHing Technique (CMORPH). As part of the study, we evaluate these products against a rain gauge-based dataset using both graphical- and metrics-based diagnostics. Based on our analyses, Stage IV is found to better reproduce the reference data. Hence, we use it for the characterization of rainfall in ARs.
   Most of the AR-rainfall is located in a narrow region within similar to 150 km on both sides of the AR major axis. In this region, rainfall has a pronounced positive relationship with the magnitude of the water vapor transport. Moreover, we have also identified a consistent increase in rainfall intensity with duration (or persistence) of AR conditions. However, there is not a strong indication of diurnal variability in AR rainfall. These results can be directly used in developing flood protection strategies during ARs. Further, weather prediction agencies can benefit from the results of this study to achieve higher skill of resolving precipitation processes in their models. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding and quantifying sediment loads is important in watersheds with highly erodible materials, which will eventually cause environmental and ecological problems. Within this context, suspended sediment (SS) transport and its temporal dynamics were studied in a small mountainous watershed with sloping lands containing rock fragments in subtropical China. Soils containing rock fragments with many macro-pores have a high permeability rate. Over a 7-year period, the mean runoff coefficient of this watershed was 0.65. Overall, 30 flood events were monitored and accounted for 95.5%, 27.3%, 17.1% of the total SS load, precipitation and total discharge, respectively, over a 5-year period. The presence of rock fragments in soils can affect soil loss. When comparing the soil loss in the studied watershed with that of other watersheds under similar climatic conditions, rock fragments negatively affect soil loss. However, an extreme event occurred on 14 August 1990, and the sediment load exhibited a phenomenon called "small deposits towards lump withdrawal", which resulted in a soil loss of 20,499 t (4.6 times the mean yearly soil loss). This event exhausted most of the SSs stored by the rock fragments on the slope and channel. Following this event, the mean SS concentration (EEC) of the 11 events was 1.05 kg m(-3), and the mean SSC of the 18 previous events was 1.75 kg m(-3). Twelve variables were separated using the classical hydrograph separation method. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to determine the highly co-related variables of the discharge. The results indicated that PLSR could explain runoff well. The relationship between discharge and SSC was highly scattered. During 24 flood events, three types of hysteresis loops were observed: clockwise (17 events), figure-eight (3 events), and complex (4 events). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements of the daily evaporation characteristics of deeply buried phreatic water in an extremely arid area are reported. The results are used to analyze the mechanism responsible for water movement in the groundwater-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. A closed PVC greenhouse was set up on Gobi land at the top of the Mogao Grottoes where phreatic water is more than 200 m deep. An air-conditioning unit and an automatic weighing scale were placed inside the greenhouse to condense and monitor phreatic evaporation and soil water changes in this extremely arid region. Soil temperature and humidity at various depths (0-40 cm) and other meteorological factors were also recorded on a sub-hourly basis. The relationship between evaporated water and soil water movement was analyzed by observing changes in soil weight, the condensate from the air-conditioning unit, and air moisture. The results show that phreatic water evaporation occurs from this deeply buried source in this extremely arid zone. The daily characteristics are consistent with the variation in the Sun's radiation intensity (i.e. both show a sinusoidal behavior). In the daytime, most of the soil water does not evaporate but moves to cooler sub-layers. In the afternoon, the shallow soil layer absorbs moisture as the temperature decreases. At night, an abundance of water vapor moves upwards from the sub-layers and supplements the evaporated and downward-moving moisture of the superstratum in the daytime, but there is no evaporation. The stable, upwardly migrating vapor and film water is supported by geothermy and comes from phreatic water, the daily evaporation characteristics of which changes according to soil temperature when it reaches the ground.

AB Soil moisture measurement techniques are of utmost importance to vadose zone hydrologists. Surface hydrogeophysical methods, such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), have the capacity to provide field-scale soil moisture information across a range of depth scales. This paper presents an extensive field study using multi-frequency (i.e., 225 MHz, 450 MHz, 900 MHz) GPR common-midpoint (CMP) soundings to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil moisture conditions at three distinct sites. We examine the use of normal-moveout (NMO) velocity analysis applied to CMP data for monitoring highly dynamic vertical soil moisture conditions in a mid-latitude climate consisting of wetting/drying and freeze/thaw cycles with varying degrees of magnitude and vertical velocity gradient. NMO velocity analysis is used to construct interval-velocity-depth models at a fixed location collected every 1-4 weeks. These time-lapse models are combined to construct temporal interval-velocity fields, which are converted into soil moisture content using an appropriate petrophysical relationship. Using these moisture fields, we were able to characterize the vertical distribution and dynamics of soil moisture in the shallow vadose zone. Although the use of multiple antenna frequencies provided varying investigation depths and vertical resolving capabilities, optimal characterization of soil moisture conditions was obtained with high-frequency 900 MHz antennas. The integration of direct ground wave and NMO velocity data from a single CMP sounding allowed us to better refine the shallow soil moisture profile and underlying vadose zone conditions during seasonal wetting, drying and freezing cycles. This study demonstrates the capacity of GPR to characterize vertical moisture dynamics, and highlights the importance of collecting high-resolution data along the air-soil interface to resolve the water content profile from the surface down to the deeper vadose zone conditions.

AB In this study, a stochastic model is proposed to solve poroelastic problems in heterogeneous Porous media. The model is constructed using the first-order second-moment method to investigate the dynamic behaviors of statistical mean and covariance of the change in pore water pressure and displacement. Although several variables can be simultaneously treated as random in the model, the Darcy conductivity is selected as the only random variable for this preliminary investigation due to its large variation compared to other mechanical and hydrogeological properties in natural environments. The constructed model is general in multiple dimensions; however, the one-dimensional case is taken as an example to demonstrate the use of the stochastic model. This model is validated using analytical and numerical solutions from the literature. Numerical experiments are then performed to investigate the boundary effects on the coupled fluid pressure and mechanical deformation in elastic porous media. The results show that the dynamic behavior of a coupled flow-stress system is more complex than a system that does not consider the deformation of porous media. Loading effects on deformation and pore pressure are instantaneous while the effect of discharge takes time to propagate from the boundary through the whole domain. Both loading and discharge boundary conditions can significantly affect the uncertainty of the system response. In the scenario combining loading at the top boundary and discharge at the bottom boundary, the mean total settlement and the average flux satisfy the relationship of superposition to be the sum of the separated effects of loading at top boundary and discharge at bottom boundary, but the variances do not. The proposed stochastic poroelastic method can be applied to hydrological issues that concern the interaction of flow and geomechanics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An advanced regularization methodology for use in watershed model
   calibration
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE regularization; calibration; watershed modeling
ID PARAMETERS; REGIONALIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; INVERSION; INFERENCE
AB A calibration methodology based on an efficient and stable mathematical regularization scheme is described. This scheme is a variant of so-called "Tikhonov regularization" in which the parameter estimation process is formulated as a constrained minimization problem. Use of the methodology eliminates the need for a modeler to formulate a parsimonious inverse problem in which a handful of parameters are designated for estimation prior to initiating the calibration process. Instead, the level of parameter parsimony required to achieve a stable solution to the inverse problem is determined by the inversion algorithm itself. Where parameters, or combinations of parameters, cannot be uniquely estimated, they are provided with values, or assigned relationships with other parameters, that are decreed to be realistic by the modeler. Conversely, where the information content of a calibration dataset is sufficient to allow estimates to be made of the values of many parameters, the making of such estimates is not precluded by "preemptive parsimonizing" ahead of the calibration process. White Tikhonov schemes are very attractive and hence widely used, problems with numerical stability can sometimes arise because the strength with which regularization constraints are applied throughout the regularized inversion process cannot be guaranteed to exactly complement inadequacies in the information content of a given calibration dataset. A new technique overcomes this problem by allowing relative regularization weights to be estimated as parameters through the calibration process itself. The technique is applied to the simultaneous calibration of five subwatershed models, and it is demonstrated that the new scheme results in a more efficient inversion, and better enforcement of regularization constraints than traditional Tikhonov regularization methodologies. Moreover, it is argued that a joint calibration exercise of this type results in a more meaningful set of parameters than can be achieved by individual subwatershed model calibration.

AB [1] Soil water flux is an important parameter in studies of runoff, infiltration, groundwater recharge, and subsurface chemical transport. Heat pulse sensors have been proposed as promising tools for measuring soil water fluxes. To date, heat pulse methods have required cumbersome mathematical analyses to calculate soil water flux from the measured data. We present a new mathematical analysis showing that a simple linear relationship exists between soil water flux and the natural log of the ratio of the temperature increase downstream from the line heat source to the temperature increase upstream from the line heat source. The simplicity of this relationship makes heat pulse sensors an attractive option for measuring soil water fluxes. In theory, this method is valid for fluxes with magnitudes between 10(-4) and 10(-7) m s(-1). The range of measurable fluxes is defined by temperature measurement resolution at the lower end and by the assumptions used in the analysis at the higher end.

ID ALLOCATION
AB We consider the implementation of Australian water reform over the last two decades and into the future. Reform was to provide security for consumptive users and adequate rights for the environment. Overallocation, a key threat to both these aims, continues to challenge planners particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin and cannot be addressed without community support. We draw from four major studies to provide insights on how implementation needs to be underpinned by theory. From the perspective of institutional design for collaborative and sustainable water planning, seven major improvements are required: (1) Provision of detailed policy guidelines to support general legal requirements, particularly practical advice for interpreting and applying the precautionary principle. (2) Tools to identify and engage unorganised or neglected community sectors, for example Indigenous peoples and youth. (3) Procedural fairness and transparent decision making, to build confidence in reform; use of independent experts and visual tools to improve the quality of discussion and increase the acceptability of trade-offs. (4) Clearer documentation and language in planning, as more litigation is likely. (5) In accord with international literature, the development of comprehensive policy and legislative framework allowing a systems approach to consensus building, especially when the science is contested. (6) Information on exactly how much water is required and where, by capturing societal choices on environmental assets. (7) Planning for sustainable contraction where cutbacks to water use is required, as an additional strategy to the current emphasis on buying water or building infrastructure. In summary we advocate collaborative water planning processes to engender community confidence in planning. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB Suprapermafrost groundwater has an important role in the hydrologic cycle of the permafrost region. However, due to the notably harsh environmental conditions, there is little field monitoring data of groundwater systems, which has limited our understanding of permafrost groundwater dynamics. There is still no effective mathematical method and theory to be used for modeling and forecasting the variation in the permafrost groundwater. Two ANN models, one with three input variables (previous groundwater level, temperature and precipitation) and another with two input variables (temperature and precipitation only), were developed to simulate and predict the site-specific suprapermafrost groundwater level on the slope scale. The results indicate that the three input variable ANN model has superior real-time site-specific prediction capability and produces excellent accuracy performance in the simulation and forecasting of the variation in the suprapermafrost groundwater level. However, if there are no field observations of the suprapermafrost groundwater level, the ANN model developed using only the two input variables of the accessible climate data also has good accuracy and high validity in simulating and forecasting the suprapermafrost groundwater level variation to overcome the data limitations and parameter uncertainty. Under scenarios of the temperature increasing by 0.5 or 1.0 degrees C per 10 years, the suprapermafrost groundwater level is predicted to increase by 1.2-1.4% or 2.5-2.6% per year with precipitation increases of 10-20%, respectively. There were spatial variations in the responses of the suprapermafrost groundwater level to climate change on the slope scale. The variation ratio and the amplitude of the suprapermafrost groundwater level downslope are larger than those on the upper slope under climate warming. The obvious vulnerability and spatial variability of the suprapermafrost groundwater to climate change will impose intensive effects on the water cycle and alpine ecosystems in the permafrost region.

AB Type curves are derived analytically for radial flow in rough horizontal fractures toward a well. The basic assumptions are that there is no turbulent flow near the borehole and the well storage is ignored. The basis of the methodology is to write explicit expressions for the continuity and cubic law flow equations, which are combined using a Boltzmann transformation leading to a simple ordinary differential equation for groundwater movement. Solutions are presented as a set of type curves for different fracture apertures. It is observed that the solutions provide a method of uniquely identifying fracture hydraulic parameters when the fracture is smooth, but pose ambiguity for rough fracture parameter estimations. However, large time portions of these type curves appear as straight lines on semi- logarithmic paper, which provides a unique way for rough fracture parameter determination. Identification of the fracture parameters, namely, the aperture and relative roughness, is possible in a unique manner with the use of these lines and the dimensionless time drawdown concept. The cubic law is the asymptotic behaviour, either for large times or large fracture apertures. Prior to this asymptotic part, there is a non-cubic portion which gives rise to systematic deviations from the cubic law. The technique presented is useful, especially for evaluating pumping tests from a single major fracture isolated by packers.

AB The understanding of the impact of drought on the agricultural ecosystem is key to minimize drought-related yield losses. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in the North China Plain (NCP) based on the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and investigated the impact of drought on winter wheat and summer maize yields. The results indicate an overall drought and wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the Henan and Shandong provinces, respectively. A significant wetting trend was detected in the NCP during the summer maize growing season at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month scales. Moreover, the drought episodes clearly reveal that the drought pattern has changed from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s, to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s, and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade. Our results also show that the annual variations in the detrended SPEI can explain extensive fluctuations associated with both winter wheat and summer maize yields in the NCP. Furthermore, considerable differences in the relationship between agricultural crop yields and the SPEI time series with different lags were observed; the most correlated time scale increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage. The correlations between the winter wheat standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) and detrended SPEI in three subperiods are consistently high and stable, whereas a substantial decrease of the correlation was observed at all time scales for summer maize, except for the 1-month lag. Our findings can help to better understand the drought evolution in the NCP in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references for the design of future drought mitigation plans.

AB This study develops novel geostatistical methods to investigate the spatial relationship between individual soil moisture sensors placed within native soil and #57 crushed stone aggregate subbase. The subbase sensors are beneath a 0.06 ha (0.15 acre) pervious concrete parking lot in Cincinnati, OH, USA. The parking lot treats runon from a 0.198 ha (0.49 acre) asphalt area. A geostatistical characterization of moisture (measured as permittivity) in the subbase beneath pervious concrete indicates that significant spatial correlation is either not present or only present at very short distances (<2.5 m). A two-stage para-statistical model relating antecedent storm moisture to apparent pervious concrete infiltration was developed to identify temporal trends in the data and to detect the clogging processes with relatively simple parameterization. The results suggest that either the placement of the sensors is not sufficient to detect clogging or that clogging is not problematic for the study period. Suggestions are provided to improve future research installations, based upon the findings here. Subbase moisture analysis results are compared with native soil moisture results. Seasonal trends are more pronounced in the native soil than in the subbase. The statistical analyses are applicable to multiple Storm Control Measures (SCM), Best Management Practices (BMP), agriculture, and soil environments. Other studies can determine the statistical power of their sensor installation using the methods applied here, which are flexible enough for multiple applications. Furthermore, data reduction methods presented serve to easily elucidate short-term moisture responses due to rainfall. A quantile response pattern is provided for sensors installed in both subbase and soil. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB With climate warming and frequent extreme weather events, the structure and function of grassland ecosystems have been significantly altered. The Qilian Mountains are a wet island, serving as an important ecological barrier in China and central Asia. It is highly sensitive and prone to climate change, yet the vulnerability of grasslands to climate variability in this region remains unclear. In this study, based a NDVI dataset and meteorological data, we evaluated the relative vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to short-term climate variability by combining three indices: exposure, sensitivity, and resilience, and explored its relationship with water use efficiency (WUE). The results show that the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability in the Qilian Mountains from 2000 to 2018 were largely determined by exposure, and sensitivity is positively correlated with exposure and negatively correlated with resilience. The vulnerability of alpine meadow and alpine steppe is higher than that of temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe. Climate and topography gradients together affect the degree of grassland vulnerability. Grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found at medium elevation (3200-4000 m) area, where the topography is flat. The northern grasslands are primarily influenced by temperature, while the western and southern parts are mainly affected by precipitation. Alpine meadow and alpine steppe are more vulnerable to temperature and temperate desert steppe is more vulnerable to changes in precipitation. The higher the vulnerability, the lower the WUE of the grasslands. This study provides a reference for assessing the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems and developing grassland vegetation management strategies.

AB The Haihe River Basin has become a watershed that suffers from intensive interference from human activities, as landscape patterns and runoff processes have significantly changed in recent decades. Investigating the effect of landscape patterns on surface runoff is helpful for establishing the synergistic evolution relationship between the landscape and the hydrological cycle, providing a theoretical basis and effective way for the future management of water resources. In this study, a landscape metrics approach is used to describe the spatial patterns of landscapes, measure changes in landscape patterns, and relate spatial patterns to surface runoff processes of water resources at a watershed scale. Given that commonly used landscape metrics not considering undulating terrain characteristics, soil properties and landcover conditions, which have significant effects on the surface runoff, a Runoff Landscape Index (RLI) is developed to evaluate the effect of watershed landscape factors on surface runoff. Factors relating to landcover, soil and topography are analyzed, weighed, and integrated during the indicator development. Then, correlation between landscape indicators (RLI and commonly used indicators) and surface runoff is examined. The results show a significant positive correlation between RLI and surface runoff, and the average correlation coefficient is 0.831, much greater than the correlation coefficients for commonly used landscape indices. With potential applications for remote sensing and GIS technology, RLI could be used to efficiently predict annual runoff in ungauged basins even in future land cover scenarios and possibly provide a new perspective for water resource management at the river basin scale.

AB The spatial-temporal variation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences contaminant biodegradation in natural water systems. This study explored seasonal patterns of DOM concentration and composition and the consequent effect on estrone (E1) biodegradation in water columns at the northern bays of Lake Taihu. During bloom seasons, the increased concentration of autochthonous DOM (autoDOM) with higher Fresh/Humic ratios, lower aromatics, molecular weights, and humification degrees exhibited a more substantial promotion on E1 biodegradation than the processed autoDOM after algal bloom. Meanwhile, the inflow rivers imported high -molecular-weight humic-like substances with strong aromaticity in flood seasons, impairing the E1 biodegradation of affected regions. End-member mixing experiments further confirmed that the mixing of algal-derived DOM facilitated the mediation of river water-derived DOM in E1 biodegradation, but microbial ageing reduced the promotive effect of autoDOM and resulted in a weak relationship between DOM source indicators and E1 biodegradation. A significant and positive correlation was further found between E1 biodegradation and DOM bioreactivity (P < 0.001), both of which were well predicted by DOM optical properties as predictor variables in partial least squares regression (PLS-R) modelling (R-2 values of 0.78 and 0.90, respectively). The ratio of fluorescence peak T and C was identified as the most effective predictor, and SUVA254 and slope ratio (SR) were moderately influential factors controlling carbon-normalized E1 biodegradation potential. These results suggested that while algal blooms would likely cause enhanced biotransformation of estrogens in freshwater lakes, the import of allochthonous DOM or the microbially aged autoDOM with high-molecular-weight may lead to higher estrogen concentrations in post-bloom seasons.

AB Previous studies linking large-scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with traditional machine learning techniques have predominantly explored monthly, seasonal or annual streamflow modelling for applications in direct downscaling or hydrological climate-impact studies. This paper identifies major drivers of daily streamflow from large-scale atmospheric circulation using two reanalysis datasets for six catchments in Norway representing various Koppen-Geiger climate types and flood-generating processes. A nested loop of roughly pruned random forests is used for feature extraction, demonstrating the potential for automated retrieval of physically consistent and interpretable input variables. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are compared to multiple-linear regression to assess the role of model complexity in utilizing the identified major drivers to reconstruct streamflow. The machine learning models were trained on 31 years of aggregated atmospheric data with distinct moving windows for each catchment, reflecting catchment-specific forcing-response relationships between the atmosphere and the rivers. The results show that accuracy improves to some extent with model complexity. In all but the smallest, rainfall-driven catchment, the most complex model, MLP, gives a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) ranging from 0.71 to 0.81 on testing data spanning five years. The poorer performance by all models in the smallest catchment is discussed in relation to catchment characteristics, sub-grid topography and local variability. The intra-model differences are also viewed in relation to the consistency between the automatically retrieved feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets. This study provides a benchmark for future development of deep learning models for direct downscaling from large-scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow in Norway.

AB We use the Budyko framework to examine streamflow changes due to climate variation and human activities in the Mauvais Coulee Basin, a 1002 km(2) sub-basin that contributes streamflow to Devils Lake, a terminal lake that has experienced catastrophic flooding over the past three decades. The basin lies within the northern glaciated prairies, contains innumerable wetland complexes that follow fill-spill hydrological principles, has undergone extensive land use change to support dryland farming, and has experienced a drought to deluge hydroclimatic transition over the last century. We implement the Budyko framework to partition the runoff increase to the lake between its climatic or human components. Initial results attribute 45% of the streamflow increase to climate factors, and 55% to human activities. Implementation of the Budyko framework to examine streamflow partitioning, however, rests upon a series of assumptions that are usually not directly verified. We then examine each Budyko framework assumption to determine its suitability for our study site and study period. None of the required assumptions are fully satisfied. Our study site and study period encompass two distinct hydroclimatic modes, contain no clear single inflection point separating baseline and altered periods, experience root zone soil moisture storage changes during the study period, and exhibit a non-stationary precipitation-streamflow relationship during the transitional period between the two hydroclimatic modes. Streamflow attribution produced by the standard application of the Budyko framework is not applicable to our study site or study period. We recommend that local-scale investigations of streamflow partitioning based upon the Budyko framework be more intentional in verifying model assumptions as a standard practice in implementing the method.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the potential of hydrological models derived by genetic programming (GP) to estimate runoff at ungauged catchments by regionalization. A set of 176 catchments from the MOPEX (Model Parameter Estimation Experiment) project was used for our analysis. Runoff models for each catchment were derived by genetic programming (hereafter GP models). A comparison of efficiency was made between GP models and three conceptual models (SAC-SMA, BTOPMC, GR4J). The efficiency of the GP models was in general comparable with that of the SAC-SMA and BTOPMC models but slightly lower (up to 10% for calibration and 15% in validation) than for the GR4J model. The relationship between the efficiency of the GP models and catchment descriptors (CDs) was investigated. From 13 available CDs the aridity index and mean catchment elevation explained most of the variation in the efficiency of the GP models. The runoff for each catchment was then estimated considering GP models from single or multiple physically similar catchments (donors). Better results were obtained with multiple donor catchments. Increasing the number of CDs used for quantification of physical similarity improves the efficiency of the GP models in runoff simulation. The best regionalization results were obtained with 6 CDs together with 6 donors. Our results show that transfer of the GP models is possible and leads to satisfactory results when applied at physically similar catchments. The GP models can be therefore used as an alternative for runoff modelling at ungauged catchments if similar gauged catchments can be identified and successfully simulated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrological flow predictions in ungauged and sparsely gauged watersheds use regionalization or classification of hydrologically similar watersheds to develop empirical relationships between hydrologic, climatic, and watershed variables. The watershed classifications may be based on geographic proximity, regional frameworks such as ecoregions or classification using cluster analysis of watershed descriptors. General approaches used in classifying hydrologically similar watersheds use climatic and watershed variables or statistics of streamflow data. Use of climatic and watershed descriptors requires variable selection to minimize redundancy from a large pool of potential variables. This study compares classification performance of four variable groups to identify homogeneous watersheds in three Mid-Atlantic ecoregions (USA): Appalachian Plateau, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley. The variable groups included: (1) variables that define watershed geographic proximity; (2) variables that define watershed hypsometry; (3) variables selected using causal selection algorithms; and (4) variables selected using principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise regression. The classification results were compared to reference watersheds classified as homogeneous using three streamflow indices: Slope of flow duration curve; Baseflow index; and Streamflow elasticity using a similarity index (SI). Classification performance was highest using variables selected by causal algorithms (e.g.. HITON-MB method, SI = 0.71 for Appalachian Plateau, SI = 0.90 for Piedmont, and SI = 0.72 for Ridge and Valley) compared to variables selected by stepwise regression (SI = 0.72 for Appalachian Plateau, SI = 0.87 for Piedmont, and SI = 0.64 for Ridge and Valley) and PCA (SI = 0.71 for Appalachian Plateau, SI = 0.76 for Piedmont, and SI = 0.57 for Ridge and Valley).

AB Widespread surveillance cameras that continuously record rainfall information offer an opportunity for high-spatiotemporal resolution rainfall inversion. Surveillance video-based rainfall data estimation has become one of the most promising methods. However, existing relevant studies have focused on rainfall observations during the day. Little attention has been given to developing a surveillance camera-based rain gauge that works at night. Generally, ordinary surveillance cameras actively emit near-infrared light (NIR) to supplement the insufficient illumination of a surveillance scenario, providing an essential prerequisite for rainfall observations at night. In this paper, an NIR-surveillance video-based rain gauge (NIR-VRG) was constructed. First, combining the mete-orological and microphysical characteristics of raindrops with the camera imaging principle, the abilities of different NIR-surveillance cameras to capture raindrops during different rainfall scenarios were discussed, providing the theoretical basis for subsequent work; second, a tensor-based algorithm was proposed for rain streak extraction from NIR surveillance video; and finally, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN)-based regression algorithm was proposed and used to build a mapping relationship between the extracted rain streaks and the rainfall intensity (RI). Experimental results on synthetic rainy videos showed that the proposed rain streak extraction algorithm achieves robust performance in a light breeze (speed approximately 3 m/s) and still works in a gentle breeze (speed approximately 5 m/s). Moreover, experiments during various rainfall scenarios show that the designed NIR-VRG measures rainfall information with high accuracy. The relative error of the RI and cumulative rainfall ranged from 8.86 % to 84.84 % and 7.82 % to 30.70 % respectively. The NIR-VRG fills the gap of rainfall observations at night by using surveillance cameras and provides a reference for constructing an all-weather rainfall observation network.

AB The relationship between snowmelt and spring streamflow is changing under warming temperatures and diminishing snowpack. At the same time, the hydrologic connectivity across catchment landscape elements, such as snowpack and surface wetlands, can play a critical role in controlling the routing of snowmelt to streams. The role of hydrologic connectivity is important in headwater regions of the continental northern latitudes, where catchments have low topographic relief and seasonally frozen ground. Nevertheless, the effects of soil frost on the sequence, timing, and magnitudes of hydrologic events that drive the movement of water from a snowpack to a stream are not fully understood. Therefore, we examine two questions: First, what is the flowpath that snow melt and precipitation from spring rain events takes to generate spring streamflow, and second, what hydrologic, climatic, or landscape variables exert the most control on the magnitude of streamflow? Here, we use long-term hydrological records from the two reference basins at the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota to analyze the cascading effects across precipitation, snow, water table elevation, soil frost, and streamflow in peatland-dominated headwater catchments. We identify a sequence of fill-and-spill effects across the landscape that control the timing of spring streamflow generation. Then, we use stepwise regression to show that soil frost is a key supporting predictor for both the magnitude of streamflow in the spring as it adds significantly to the predictive power of precipitation and water table elevation. Our results highlight the importance of recognizing the role of soil frost, when present, on the partitioning of snowmelt between overland runoff and water table recharge during the critical snowmelt period, as well as the later partitioning between evapotranspiration and subsurface flows.

AB Water scarcity greatly hinders sustainable development goal agenda and regional agriculture development in dryland regions. As we know, land use and cover changes are strongly responsible for spatial-temporal evolutions of water resource. However, there is little explicit understanding of how spatial patterns of future dryland use will affect the water supply-demand risk. To answer this question, this study took Yulin city of China, a typical dryland region, as a case study area, and firstly estimated its 2020-2050 land use patterns under three different scenarios, covering Natural Increased Scenario (NIS), Food Security Scenario (FSS) and Economic Development Scenario (EDS), with the help of the path-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model as well as Markov-chain model. Furthermore, this study employed InVEST model to explicitly investigate spatial-temporal evolutions of water supply, water demand and water supply-demand risk in all scenarios. The estimated results indicated that the largest expanding/shrinking land use types were grasslands/croplands in NIS, croplands/ grasslands in FSS and built-up lands/croplands in EDS during 2020-2050, respectively. By 2050, all projected land use changes only slightly affected regional water supply (the fluctuation of - 5% compared to that in 2020), but greatly increased by - 57% regional water demand. Particularly, strong land use changes would likely put nearly 90% regions of Yulin city at endangered water supply-demand risk in 2020-2050. Ecological land and built-up land would easier suffer from critically endangered water supply-demand risk. In view of these modeled and analyzed results, some potential mitigation strategies of water resource utilization, such as developing waterefficient eco-agriculture, adjusting agricultural structures and enriching revegetation diversity, were suggested to coordinate future areal human-nature relationships. This study could provide some valuable information for dryland agricultural development, water-environment management and regional policy decision-making.

AB The Budyko curve, relating a catchment's water and energy balance, provides a useful tool to analyse how physio-climatic and socio-economic characteristics may impact long-term runoff. Often a parametric form of the curve, the Tixeront-Fu's equation, is used to represent the catchment's long-term water partitioning behaviour. Tixemnt-Fu's parameter omega, typically derived from observed climate and runoff data, can further be related to catchments' physio-climatic characteristics to enable understanding the main drivers of their water balance. At times, prior analyses have reported potentially conflicting controls of characteristics on omega. Based on the rationale that several hydrological processes act across varying spatio-temporal scales, we hypothesize that the impact of a physio-climatic factor on omega is driven by its broader regional setting. We test our hypothesis by developing relationships between omega and a curated database of 33 physio-climatic and socio-economic characteristics for 520 regional divisions of India. We employ two related data-space splitting algorithms: classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest (RF) to study the effects of potential controlling factors within their regional context. The algorithms diagnose a hierarchy of representative vegetation, climate, soil, land use land cover, topography and anthropogenic controls. The most important characteristics controlling omega were found to be: correlation between monthly time series of P and PET, long-term temperature, long-term precipitation, and the synchmnicity of P and PET. Human influences quantified in terms of population density and the extent of cultivated area were found to be important factors influencing sub-regional scale hydrological processes. These anthropogenic factors displayed predictive importance similar to vegetation and topographic factors. Our results indicate the dominant influence of climate and its seasonality on long-term water partitioning across Indian landmasses with landscape features including human influences playing a secondary but important role.

AB Groundwater is the most important water resource in arid regions. However, the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters. Here, we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation. To address this hypothesis, we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height, i.e, the maxima of heights and volumes, of three common dominant tree species in northwest China to construct classical measurement error (CME) model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region. Our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth, particularly the tallest plant species. The CME model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth. Mathematically the model can be expressed as: [E(ln(Dw)vertical bar ln(Th), theta) = 7.11 - 1.85E (x vertical bar ln(Th), theta), where Dw and Th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height; xis the measured maximum tree height; theta = {7.11, -1.85, 7.19, 0.15, 1.91, 13.45}; R-2 = 0.82; Marginal log-Likelihood = -131.04; RMSE = 0.33]. In addition, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach. In conclusion, our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth. Our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions.

TI Rainwater catchment system design using simulated future climate data
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Rainwater supply; Rain catchment systems; General circulation models
AB Rainwater harvesting techniques are used worldwide to augment potable water supply, provide water for small-scale irrigation practices, increase rainwater-use efficiency for sustained crop growth in arid and semi-arid regions, decrease urban stormwater flow volumes, and in general to relieve dependency on urban water resources cycles. A number of methods have been established in recent years to estimate reliability of rainwater catchment systems (RWCS) and thereby properly size the components (roof catchment area, storage tank size) of the system for a given climatic region. These methods typically use historical or stochastically-generated rainfall patterns to quantify system performance and optimally size the system, with the latter accounting for possible rainfall scenarios based on statistical relationships of historical rainfall patterns. To design RWCS systems that can sustainably meet water demand under future climate conditions, this paper introduces a method that employs climatic data from general circulation models (GCMs) to develop a suite of catchment area vs. storage size design curves that capture uncertainty in future climate scenarios. Monthly rainfall data for the 2010-2050 time period is statistically downscaled to daily values using a Markov chain algorithm, with results used only from GCMs that yield rainfall patterns that are statistically consistent with historical rainfall patterns. The process is demonstrated through application to two climatic regions of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific, wherein the majority of the population relies on rainwater harvesting for potable water supply. Through the use of design curves, communities can provide household RWCS that achieve a certain degree of storage reliability. The method described herein can be applied generally to any geographic region. It can be used to first, assess the future performance of existing household systems; and second, to design or modify systems that will yield adequate storage for future climate conditions.

AB We evaluated the sensitivity of electromagnetic induction (EMI) method to variation in soil water in an irrigated cotton field by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) with a Geonics EM38. ECa was measured at a fixed position in each plot (within the furrow adjacent to stands of cotton planted on ridges) at ground level as well as at 0.1 and 0.4 m height above the ground. Measurements were made in both vertical and horizontal modes (VM and HM) of EM38 to allow soil water sensing within 1.5 and 0.75 m depths at each location. Surrogate values of soil water were obtained with a locally calibrated neutron probe adjacent to EM38 measurements.
   All measurements were carried out within three replicate plots of four irrigation treatments at various times during cotton growth. As EC is sensitive to variation in temperature, soil and air temperature was also measured at the time of EM38 measurements. Temporal patterns of variation in ECa and soil water were broadly similar for shallow and deep soil layers. Values of ECa over the season increased nonlinearly with increased values of accumulated soil water within specific depths with high degree of confidence (P <= 0.001) and high coefficient of determination (R-2) for fitted models. Although both soil and air temperature varied over the season (21.2-39.1 degrees C for soil and 26.1-33.2 degrees C for air), dependency of ECa on temperature was weak. The relationship between ECa and soil water was greatly affected by surface configuration in crop fields (i.e. whether the crop was planted on a flat bed or a raised bed) and season. Thus, there is a need to calibrate the EMI equipment to suit local condition in order to measure soil water distribution at field scale. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The knowledge of soil moisture spatial variability is an important issue for hydrological and climatic studies. This paper investigates the soil moisture spatial pattern obtained from spot measurements carried out in different experimental plots Located in small basins of Central Italy. The near-surface volumetric soil moisture content was measured using a portable time domain reflectometer (TDR) over regular grids whose areas ranging in extension from 9 to 8800 m 2. The sampling in each site was periodically repeated in order to investigate the moisture pattern as function of wetness conditions. The statistical properties of the measurements and the relation of the statistical parameters with the field-mean soil moisture content were analyzed. The results states that the probability distribution can be assumed normal for soil moisture in flat areas and for normalized soil moisture in gentle slope areas. A general decreasing trend of variance with increasing mean moisture content was observed. Moreover, considering the relationship between the field-mean water content and the coefficient of variation an optimal measurements number ranging from 15 to 35, in the worse case, was found for the study areas. The higher number was required for the site with more significant relief. These results were also confirmed through the geostatistical analysis and the correlation with the topographical attributes. Specifically, the correlation lengths were found increasing with the mean areal slope and the mean drainage direction and ranging between 10 and 15 m. This is corroborated through geostatistical analysis showing that the natural logarithm of the specific upstope area was the best spatial predictor for near-surface soil moisture when the water volume in the soil is higher. On this basis, the surface and subsurface lateral redistribution of water can be surmised fundamental in spatial organization of soil moisture. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is broad interest in the space-time scaling behavior of infiltration over a watershed, but field data is lacking to identify such scaling and the controlling factors. Here, theoretical effects of rainfall and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) on space-time infiltration are simulated using process-based numerical experiments in the framework of a universal multifractal (UM) model. A series of rainfall and K-s fields are generated including both random, non-scaling fields and multifractal fields produced using the UM model. By varying the UM model parameters based on physical considerations, rain and K-s fields with various scaling characteristics are obtained. These rain and K-s data are then fed into a distributed rainfall-runoff model developed for this study to produce space-time infiltration, including the effects of overland flow from upslope areas. The scaling properties of the infiltration are then analyzed to find the impact from the rain and K-s fields mainly in terms of the connections among the UM model parameters between the input and the output fields. Some of the major findings from this research are: (1) rainfall spatial characteristics determine the scaling of infiltration only at very early times; (2) K-s, rather than rain, determines if the resulting infiltration field displays scaling behavior after an adjusting period; (3) generally, the heterogeneity of a rain field and the singularity and sparseness of a K-s field have strong impacts on infiltration; (4) usually, infiltration fields are statistically non-homogeneous; and (5) if an infiltration field subject to space-time rain becomes less singular (localized large infiltration rates) in time, it tends to become less sparse and more heterogeneous, and vice versa. The relationships and sensitivities identified above help us understand some key factors controlling the potential scaling behavior of infiltration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Field measurement of interception loss from rainforest vegetation in the cyclone-prone tropics is complicated by high wind speeds that cause incident rainfall to be inclined from vertical fall paths. Given the characteristic roughness of tropical rainforest canopies, we hypothesized that the more prominent canopy tree crowns create lateral rainshadows and intercept greater volumes of rainwater per unit projected crown area than less prominent neighboring canopy trees under inclined rainfall conditions. This hypothesis was tested by: (1) modeling the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of a tropical rainforest canopy surface in northeast Queensland, Australia, using photogrammetrically derived crown elevation data; (2) computing the inclination angles and azimuths of wind-driven rainfall for raindays on which net rainfall was measured from selected canopy trees; (3) creating and applying a ray-tracing program to the 3-D canopy model to quantify lateral rainshadows and the effective rainfall-intercepting crown areas of the selected canopy trees; (4) calculating the C-e/C index (effective rainfall-intercepting crown area/projected crown area ratio) of each tree; (5) analyzing the relationship between the C-e/C index values and the measured net rainfall totals after correcting for differences in the trees' interception storage capacities. A significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found for more than 80% of the raindays examined with rainfall inclination angles of more than 19 degrees from a vertical fall path. These results suggest that the variation in net rainfall totals among neighboring canopy trees may be explained in part by the differential interception of inclined rainfall. Interception loss is generally measured as the difference between gross rainfall measured in the open and net rainfall reaching the forest floor. We conclude that more meaningful measures of interception loss could be obtained by accounting for differences in gross rainfall intercepted by canopy trees sampled for net rainfall.

AB The utilization of complicated water quality models is the primary approach used to forecast water quality. These models, however, are not easy to employ because of constraints, such as data limitation, extensive computations, and future boundary conditions. Long short-term memory (LSTM) can overcome such constraints; however, its applications in water quality forecast have rarely been explored. In this study, the ability of LSTM to simulate the forecast capacity of a complicated water quality model (i.e., environmental fluid dynamics code, EFDC) is investigated. First, the EFDC is run to produce a long-term (12 years) time series of six water quality variables. These variables are intrinsically associated with equations embedded in the EFDC that represent the dynamics of the simulated system. The LSTM is developed to forecast the concentration of Chlorophyll a 1-31 d ahead of time using six water quality variables. The generated data are thereafter employed to train a number of LSTMs with different model structures (combinations of input variables, numbers of hidden layers, and lag times). The LSTM performances are evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, and random forest is applied to identify the key drivers of LSTM performance. The results show that many LSTMs could achieve an acceptable performance level. Chlorophyll a, water temperature, and total phosphorus are identified as the key drivers of LSTM performances, which are consistent with limnological theories. The number of hidden layers and lag time practically have no impact on the LSTM performance. It is thereby confirmed that an LSTM with a simple structure could simulate the forecast capacity of EFDC. The results also reveal that the mechanism-guided LSTM in our study may capture certain mechanism features. The LSTM is thus expected to be a promising approach for water quality forecast.

AB A theoretical model for the analysis of the reflection and refraction of obliquely incident elastic waves upon the interface between two semi-infinite porous elastic half-spaces saturated by different fluid mixtures is developed in the present study based on the poroelasticity theory of Lo et al. (2005) and the normal coordinates derived by Lo et al. (2010) for describing the modes of dilatory motion. The amplitude and energy ratios of the reflected and refracted waves generated from either an incident P1 wave (the first dilatational wave) or an incident SV wave (the shear wave polarized in the vertical plane) are in turn theoretically determined for the first time with respect to the angle of incidence. As a representative example, a numerical simulation is conducted for Lincoln sand permeated by an air-water mixture in the lower half-space and Columbia fine sandy loam permeated by an air-water mixture in the upper half-space. Our numerical results indicate that regardless of the type of pore fluid mixtures and porous media, the sum of the energy ratio of the reflected and refracted waves is always equal to unity, a result that indeed can not be achieved if the normal coordinates for dilatory motional modes is not taken into account as to represent the Helmholtz potential of the reflected and refracted waves. In addition, their amplitude and energy ratios are shown to be significantly affected by the angle of incidence. It is also revealed that as a SV wave is incident upon the interface, a critical angle of 31 and 33 can be found for the reflected and refracted P1 waves respectively, while the occurrence of the critical angle is not observed for the case of an incident P1 wave.

AB Groundwater salinity in an aquifer system is typically measured through field studies (e.g., groundwater sampling, and direct current resistivity method). The field-based measurements are costly and time-consuming when they are applied over a large domain. In this study, a methodology was developed and evaluated based on available hydrogeology and hydrometeorology data and statistical and machine learning techniques to map the groundwater salinity in the southern coastal aquifer of the Caspian Sea. First, variables affecting groundwater salinity (aquifer transmissivity, distance from the sea, the mean annual precipitation, the mean annual evaporation, elevation, and the depth to the water table) were determined, and the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets of training, testing, and verification. Next, the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors was established using three methods namely extreme gradient boosting (EGB), deep neural network (DNN), and multiple linear regression (MLR), and the models were evaluated by comparing the measured values and the predicted values using the statistical criteria (R-squared, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD)). Finally, the optimum model was applied to the set of known input variables to map the spatial variation of the groundwater salinity across the entire southern coastal plain of the Caspian Sea, and the final map was verified using the verification subset. Results showed that consideration should be given to the EGB method, considering its higher performance on the testing subset (Rsquared 0.89, NSE 0.87, NRMSD 0.45). In-depth analysis of the variables showed that the aquifer transmissivity is the most crucial parameter affecting groundwater salinity in the region. The adopted approach could potentially be used for groundwater management purposes in the study area and similar settings elsewhere.

AB In this paper, the influence of hysteresis on water table dynamics in an unconfined aquifer was examined using a numerical model to solve Richards' unsaturated flow equation. The model was subject to simple harmonic forcing across a sloping boundary with a seepage face boundary condition. Time series from both hysteretic and non-hysteretic models were subject to harmonic analysis to extract the amplitude and phase profiles for comparison with existing sand flume data (Cartwright et al., 2004). The results from both model types show good agreement with the data indicating no influence of hysteresis at the oscillation period examined (T = 348 s). The models were then used to perform a parametric study to examine the relationship between oscillation period and hysteresis effects with periods ranging from 3 min to 180 min. At short oscillation periods, (T approximate to 180 s) the effects of hysteresis were negligible with both models providing similar results. As the oscillation period increased, the hysteretic model showed less amplitude damping than the non-hysteretic model. For periods greater than T = 60 min, the phase lag in the non-hysteretic model is greater than for the hysteretic one. For periods less than T = 60 min this trend is reversed and the hysteretic model produced a greater phase lag than the non-hysteretic model. These findings suggest that consideration of hysteresis dynamics in Richards' equation models has no influence on water table wave dispersion for short period forcing such as waves (T approximate to 10 s) whereas for long period forcing such as tides (T approximate to 12.25 h) or storm surges (T approximate to days) hysteresis dynamics should be taken into account.

AB There is a need to understand and analyze rainfall variability, since it is most variabie in time and space, for assessing the erosive potential of rainfall and its impacts on soil erosion and conservation measures. In order to have a spatially realistic surface of the modified fournier index (MFI) and a statistically valid method, two different procedures of calculating the MFI were performed using the daily rainfall amounts recorded for 29 years in the region of Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP), Turkey and efficiently integrating elevation and GIS. The method that calculated the MFI surface from the monthly rainfall amounts of each individual year and averaged over a number of years (MFIj) was compared with the method that calculated the MFI surface from the averages of ith monthly rainfall amounts and averaged over a number of years ((MFI) over bar). Results indicated that the (MFI) over bar led to the tower-risk MFI classes than the MFI(j) over bar. This was attributed to the fact that the (MFI) over bar was statis tically unable to account for the year-to-year variability in the rainfall data. An analysis with the relationship between the (MFI) over bar and the coefficient of variation (CV) also suggested the total variability in the data set be better represented to have dependable MFI surfaces because of integration of elevation. Further calculations for surfaces of the precipitation concentration index (PCI) similar to the calculations made for the MFI surfaces conclusively indicated that the MFI(j) over bar was valuable in determining the potential of the rains for causing soil erosion by providing information on a tong-term total variability in the rainfall amount received.

AB The research consisted in a detailed analysis of Rain-On-Snow (ROS) events in the winter season (November-April) in the area of Waldemarbreen and Irenebreen - two glaciers subject to long-term monitoring on Kaffioyra, NW Spitsbergen. The intensity and frequency of ROS events were evaluated along with their longterm variability in the years 1976-2018. An attempt was made to identify the relationship between ROS events and the properties of the snow cover of Waldemarbreen and Irenebreen - mainly changes in the number and thickness of ice layers and snow density, which have a major influence on the winter snowpack and on the time the snow begins to melt. These are some of the first studies of this type concerning not only glacier forefields but also changes occurring on glaciers. It was found that as the temperature of air has been rising in recent years, the melting of snow has been beginning earlier on glaciers and in their forefields. Also, the frequency and size of ROS events has increased. In recent years the number of days with heavy ROS events - mainly over 15 mm, but also under 15 mm - have been on the increase. The ROS events affect the number of ice layers, whereas heavy ROS events contribute to the formation of ice layers of greater thickness. The increase in ROS events is accompanied by a decrease in snow density on glaciers. As with the number of ROS events within a given year, there is also a clear increase in the number of ice layers and their thickness on the snow cover, in particular on small glaciers in the High Arctic.

AB The need for accurate modeling of the rainfall-runoff process has grown rapidly in the past decades. However, considering the high stochastic property of the process, many models are still being developed in order to define such a complex phenomenon. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modeling as well as for other fields of hydrology.
   In this paper, two hybrid AI-based models which are reliable in capturing the periodicity features of the process are introduced for watershed rainfall-runoff modeling. In the first model, the SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous input)-ANN model, an ANN is used to find the non-linear relationship among the residuals of the fitted linear SARIMAX model. In the second model, the wavelet-ANFIS model, wavelet transform is linked to the ANFIS concept and the main time series of two variables (rainfall and runoff) are decomposed into some multi-frequency time series by wavelet transform. Afterwards, these time series are imposed as input data to the ANFIS to predict the runoff discharge one time step ahead. The obtained results of the models applications for the rainfall-runoff modeling of two watersheds (located in Azerbaijan, Iran) show that, although the proposed models can predict both short and long terms runoff discharges by considering seasonality effects, the second model is relatively more appropriate because it uses the multi-scale time series of rainfall and runoff data in the ANFIS input layer.

AB The existence of outliers in data sets affects the decision-making process related to design, operation, and management of water resources. Insufficient information on outliers limits our understanding and predictive ability of such extreme hydrologic phenomena. Hydrologic systems are complex and dynamic in nature where current state and future evolutions depend on numerous physical variables and their interactions. Such systems can be represented in a simplified form through chaotic approach. Chaotic approach can determine the tevel, of complexity of a system that provides the required information and parameters for subsequent predictive analyses. This research focuses on the application of chaotic analytical techniques to daily hydrologic series comprising of outliers. Different techniques and concepts of chaotic theory are adopted to enhance our understanding of the phenomena of outliers. Employing the streamflow data of the Saugeen River in Ontario, Canada, this paper illustrates the use of the autocorrelation functions, mutual information, power spectrum analysis, phase space reconstruction, correlation dimension, surrogate tests, and Hurst coefficients for the analysis of chaotic systems.
   Based on the results of analyses, one can arrive at the following conclusions: (1) The analyzed series exhibited random-like fluctuations. However, by rejecting the hypothesis of a random process, the analyzed series were found to be non-random. (2) The existence of outliers was found to increase the complexity of the analyzed series. High embedding dimensionalities obtained from the correlation analysis of the analyzed series support our conclusion. (3) The differentiation of a highly complex system from a random process, and the impact of outliers on the complexity of a system were quantitatively as well as visually presented from a chaotic perspective.

AB This study presents a hybrid spectral method (HSM) to estimate flow uncertainty in large-scale highly nonstationary groundwater systems. Taking advantages of spectral theories in solving unmodeled small-scale variability in hydraulic conductivity, the proposed HSM integrates analytical and numerical spectral solutions in the calculation procedures to estimate flow uncertainty. More specifically, the HSM involves two major computational steps after the mean flow equation is solved. The first step is to apply an analytical-based approximate spectral method (ASM) to predict nonstationary flow variances for entire modeling area. The perturbation-based numerical method, nonstationary spectral method (NSM), is then employed in the second step to correct the regional solution in local areas, where the variance dynamics is considered to be highly nonstationary (e.g., around inner boundaries or strong sources/sinks). The boundary conditions for the localized numerical solutions are based on the ASM closed form solutions at boundary nodes. Since the regional closed form solution is instantaneous and the more expensive perturbation-based numerical analysis is only applied locally around the strong stresses, the proposed HSM can be very efficient, making it possible to model strongly nonstationary variance dynamics with complex flow situations in large-scale groundwater systems. In this study the analytical-based ASM solutions was first assessed to quantify the solution accuracy under transient and inner boundary flow conditions. This study then illustrated the HSM accuracy and effectiveness with two synthetic examples. The HSM solutions were systematically compared with the corresponding numerical solutions of NSM and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and the analytical-based solutions of ASM. The simulation results have revealed that the HSM is computationally efficient and can provide accurate variance estimations for highly nonstationary large-scale groundwater flow problems.

AB High-energy outburst floods triggered by failure of landslide- and glacial dams have strongly impacted rivers in eastern Tibet, affecting river geomorphology, human settlements, and infrastructure. However, understanding the impact of these extreme outburst floods on river landscape evolution is hampered due to lack of event-based observations. The second-largest modern outburst flood recorded in the Yigong River in 2000 provides an opportunity to investigate changes in river morphology caused by such extreme floods. By combining remote sensing images from 1984 to 2020 and 2-D numerical flood simulations with the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software, we show that the riverbank displacement during the Yigong outburst flood (YGOF) is an order of magnitude greater than that in other periods. Channel migration and variation in channel width in the upper reach (UR) straths are greater than those in the down reach (DR) gorges, and the curvature of the UR was greatly reduced by the YGOF while that of the DR increased. Furthermore, the channel morphology after the YGOF has become more dynamic. The relationship among the product of the dimensionless curvature (W/R), simulated flow velocity (U) and relative migration rate (M/VV) in both the UR and DR follow similar distribution patterns, in which the maximum relative migration rates in the UR and DR occur where (W/R) .

AB Quantifying bacteria fluxes and contaminants from the point and nonpoint sources in a watershed are important for the management of water quality and safeguard public health. Therefore, the appropriate characterization of bacteria from different sources is necessary for understanding of fate and transport of bacteria in watersheds. However, it is challenging to simulate the effects of pH on bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the original version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This study aimed to augment SWAT-bacteria module to evaluate the potential effect of pH on E. coli concentrations. We modified SWAT-bacteria module to incorporate pH factor and to check E. coli observations from four sites of Athabasca River Basin. The modified SWAT-bacteria model demonstrated a linear relationship between observed and simulated daily E. coli data with R-2 values found between 0.70 and 0.80; NSE: 0.59 and 0.68; PBIAS: 7.94% and 17.85% during calibration for all monitoring sites (2010-2012). While during the validation (2013-2014) the performance statistics found to be: R-2 : 0.59-0.72; NSE: 0.55-0.66; PBIAS: 10-22%. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed that pH is one of the most significant fate factors of E. coli. The modified SWAT-bacteria module provides an improved estimate of E. coli concentration from the river basin. This study contributes new insight to E. coli modelling. Therefore, the modified SWAT-bacteria model could be a powerful tool for the future regional to global scale model of E. coli concentrations thus significantly contribute for the application of effective river basin management.

AB In areas in which natural water resources are variable over time, tools that determine the probability distribution of hydrological variables are required to evaluate various management alternatives. In this article, a stochastic simulation framework of hydrological variables through atmospheric pressure modeling is proposed. This methodology employs the mean value of the atmospheric pressure in the winter to differentiate the wet, medium and dry years in terms of rainfall and flow at different temporal scales. Monthly mean and daily maximum rainfall and flow data series are stochastically replicated. To achieve this replication, a non-stationary parametric mixture distribution model that combines a Weibull and a Normal distribution is fitted to the univariate distribution of the atmospheric pressure. This model includes interannual variability through two covariables: extraterrestrial solar radiation and the NAO index. This model is applied to the Guadalete River Basin in southern Spain, in which the river flow regime is influenced by the highly seasonal precipitation regime typically found in the Mediterranean area. The non-stationary parametric mixture distribution model with the two covariables showed a good fit to the observed sea level pressure, displaying an important reduction on the BIC. A good correlation was obtained between the average sea level pressure in winter and the accumulated precipitation and flow (r = -0.8 for monthly values and -0.6 for maximum daily values). The statistical similarity indicated that the synthetic series of precipitation and flow preserved the distribution trends in the observed data. The identical methodology can be applied in other watersheds once the direct relationship between the mean atmospheric pressure and the hydrology of the area is known. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate warming is expected to have significant impacts on the global hydrologic cycle, including changes in precipitation-induced extremes such as droughts. Using 28 CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs), this study presents a global-scale analysis of the joint return periods (T) of meteorological drought characteristics (duration D, severity S, and peak P) at the 6- and 12-month scales under the Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The D, S, and P estimated based on the Runs theory are used to calculated from the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at the global 1 degrees x 1 degrees grids. Six marginal probability distributions are used to fit S, P and D, whereas three Archimedean copula functions (Clayton, GH and Frank) are used to estimate T for the paired drought characteristics (S-D, P-D and S-P). Large spatial variability is found globally in the best-fitted copulas for the paired drought characteristics, with the Frank (Frank and GH) of the largest global percentage for SPI6 (SPI12). Relative to the baseline (1971-2000), the T of the paired drought characteristics above the moderate drought (S > 1, P > 1 and D > 3) is projected to decrease mostly in North America and Asia (<0.22-year) during the 2021-2050 near-future (NF) period, and in South America and Australia (<0.47-year) during the 2071-2100 far-future (FF) period. In contrast, an increase in T is projected during NF (<3-year) mostly in South America and Australia, and during FF (<49-year) mostly in Asia, Europe and North America. Furthermore, a larger increase in T is projected under higher RCP and at longer timescales. Our results suggest a generally nonlinear response of the projected drought risk changes to anthropogenic forcing during the 21st century.

AB We have experimentally studied solute transport in a single fracture (SF) under non-Darcian flow condition which was found to closely follow the Forchheimer equation at Reynolds numbers around 12.2-86.0 when fracture apertures were between 4 mm and 9 mm. The measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) under the non-Darcian flow condition had some features that are difficult to explain using the Fickian type advection-dispersion equation (ADE). All the measured BTCs showed long tails, which might be caused by mass transfer between the boundary layer near the fracture wall and the mobile domain near the plane of symmetry, as supported by the boundary layer dispersion theories of Koch and Brady (1985, 1987). A mobile-immobile (MIM) model was used to simulate the measured BTCs. To show that the MIM model was doing a better job than the ADE model in describing the observed BTCs, we conducted statistical analysis on the goodness of fitting with these two models. The results showed that the correlation coefficients for the MIM model were greater than those for the ADE model and were close to unity, indicating a nearly perfect fit with the MIM. The mass transfer rate between the mobile domain and the boundary layer increased when the mobile water fraction became larger. The best fit dispersivity values using the MIM model varied between 1.05 mm and 9.29 mm whereas their counterparts using the ADE model varied between 245 mm and 462 mm for the experimental condition of this study. Several issues such as the possible bimodal concentration distribution and the scale-dependent transport in a SF were discussed and would be investigated in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Waterlogging is one of the most important agricultural disasters affecting rice. In this study, we developed a waterlogging analysis system for paddy fields in irrigation districts with 7 modules, including pretreatment, hydrological computations and waterlogging computations. The newly developed system can consider the effects of both landform features and human interventions in irrigation districts. Observational data from the Gaoyou Irrigation District during 2014 and 2015 were applied to calibrate and validate a waterlogging analysis system, respectively. The results indicated that the waterlogging analysis system could accurately predict the water levels in both the calibration (R-2 > 0.97) and validation (R-2 > 0.92) periods. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the yield reduction rate indicated that saturated soil moisture and shape parameters (a and n) were the dominant soil hydrodynamic parameters affecting the simulated yield reduction rates. The weighted mean yield reduction rate of field areas decreased with increasing shape parameters and increased with increasing soil moisture saturation. However, further analysis showed that the maximum yield reduction rate exhibited a trend similar to that of saturated soil moisture, which indicated that the backwater effects of the river and ditch water level changes had a greater influence than the soil hydrodynamic parameters on the yield reduction rate, especially in low-elevation fields. In addition, the relationship between the yield reduction rate and field elevation could be fitted by an exponential function (R-2 = 0.83), and the field pond depth decreased linearly with a reduction in field elevation in both 2014 (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.01) and 2015 (R-2 = 0.64, p < 0.01). The proposed waterlogging analysis system could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of waterlogging on rice production in the studied irrigation district or in other regions with similar climatic conditions.

This paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow. Taking the three tributaries of the Pearl River in South China as case study, five forecasting experiments, which forecast the average daily flow in the three-month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month, are devised to elucidate the different roles of base, fast, and total flow. The recursive digital filter (RDF) model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow; the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation; and the Schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow. Forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias, reliability, and skill, and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated. The results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments. Correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower. Forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient. Meanwhile, fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month, which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large. By contrast, base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill. The separation of base flow from fast flow, which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow, can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow.

AB Velocity and celerity in hydrologic systems are controlled by different mechanisms. Efforts were made through joint sample collection and the use of hydrographs and tracers to understand the rapidity of the subsurface flow response to rainstorms on hourly time scales. Three deep subsurface flows during four natural rainstorm events were monitored. The results show that (1) deeper discharge was observed early in responding rainfall events and yielded a high hydrograph amplitude; (2) a ratio index, k, reflecting the dynamic change of the rainfall perturbation intensity in subsurface flow, might reveal inner causal relationships between the flow index and the tracer signal index. Most values of It were larger than 1 at the perturbation stage but approximated 1 at the no-perturbation stage; and (3) for statistical analysis of tracer signals in subsurface flows, the total standard deviation was 17.2, 11.9, 7.4 and 3.5 at perturbation stages and 4.4, 2.5, 1.1, and 0.95 at the non-perturbation stage for observed events. These events were 37 times higher in the former rather than the later, reflecting that the variation of tracer signals primarily occurred under rainfall perturbation. Thus, we affirmed that the dynamic features of rainfall have a key effect on rapid processes because, besides the gravity, mechanical waves originating from dynamic rainfall features are another driving factor for conversion between different types of rainfall mechanical energy. A conceptual model for pressure wave propagation was proposed, in which virtual subsurface flow processes in a heterogeneous vadose zone under rainfall are analogous to the water hammer phenomenon in complex conduit systems. Such an analogy can allow pressure in a shallow vadose to increase and decrease and directly influence the velocity and celerity of the flow reflecting a mechanism for rapid subsurface hydrologic response processes in the shallow vadose zone.

AB The role of hydrogeology in mediating long-term changes in mountain streamflow, resulting from reduced snowfall in a potentially warmer climate, is currently not well understood. We explore this by simulating changes in stream discharge and evapotranspiration from a mid-elevation, 1-km(2) catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California (USA) in response to reduced snowfall under warmer conditions, for a plausible range in subsurface hydrologic properties. Simulations are performed using a numerical watershed model, the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), constrained by observations from a meteorological station, stream gauge, and eddy covariance tower. We predict that the fraction of precipitation occurring as snowfall would decrease from approximately 47% at current conditions to 25%, 12%, and 5% for air temperature changes of +2, +4, and +6 degrees C. For each of these warming scenarios, changes in mean annual discharge and evapotranspiration simulated by the different plausible soil models show large ranges relative to averages, with coefficients of variation ranging from -3 to 3 depending on warming scenario. With warming and reduced snowfall, substrates with greater storage capacity show less soil moisture limitation on evapotranspiration during the late spring and summer, resulting in greater reductions in annual stream discharge. These findings indicate that the hydrologic response of mountain catchments to atmospheric warming and reduced snowfall may substantially vary across elevations with differing soil and regolith properties, a relationship not typically accounted for in approaches relying on space-for-time substitution, An additional implication of our results is that model simulations of annual stream discharge in response to snowfall-to-rainfall transitions may be relatively uncertain for study areas where subsurface properties are not well constrained.

AB Daily streamflow information is critical for solving various hydrologic problems, though observations of continuous streamflow for model calibration are available at only a small fraction of the world's rivers. One approach to estimate daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to transfer rainfall-runoff model parameters calibrated at a gauged (donor) catchment to an ungauged (receiver) catchment of interest. Central to this approach is the selection of a hydrologically similar donor. No single metric or set of metrics of hydrologic similarity have been demonstrated to consistently select a suitable donor catchment. We design an experiment to diagnose the dominant controls on successful hydrologic model parameter transfer. We calibrate a lumped rainfall-runoff model to 83 stream gauges across the United States. All locations are USGS reference gauges with minimal human influence. Parameter sets from the calibrated models are then transferred to each of the other catchments and the performance of the transferred parameters is assessed. This transfer experiment is carried out both at the scale of the entire US and then for six geographic regions. We use classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the relationship between catchment similarity and performance of transferred parameters. Similarity is defined using physical/climatic catchment characteristics, as well as streamflow response characteristics (signatures such as baseflow index and runoff ratio). Across the entire US, successful parameter transfer is governed by similarity in elevation and climate, and high similarity in streamflow signatures. Controls vary for different geographic regions though. Geology followed by drainage, topography and climate constitute the dominant similarity metrics in forested eastern mountains and plateaus, whereas agricultural land use relates most strongly with successful parameter transfer in the humid plains.

AB A technique is presented for the identification of the areas subject to flooding hazard. Starting from remote sensed elevation data and existing flood hazard maps - usually available for limited areas the relationships between selected quantitative morphologic features and the flooding hazard are first identified and then used to extend the hazard information to the entire catchment. This is performed through techniques of pattern classification, such as linear classifiers based on quantitative morphologic features, and support vector machines with linear and Gaussian kernels. The experiment starts by discriminating between flood-prone areas and marginal hazard areas. Multiclass classifiers are subsequently used to graduate the hazard. Their designs amount to solving suitable optimization problems. Several performance measures are considered in comparing the different classifiers, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, and the sum of the false positive and false negative rates.
   The procedure has been validated for the Tanaro basin, a tributary to the major Italian river, the Po. Results show a high reliability: the classifier properly identifies 93% of flood-prone areas, and only 14% of the areas subject to a marginal hazard are improperly assigned. An increase of this latter value up to 19% is detected when the same structure is applied for hazard graduation. Results derived from the application to different catchments seem to qualitatively indicate the ability of the classifier to perform well also outside the calibration region.
   Pattern classification techniques should be considered when the identification of flood-prone areas and hazard grading is required for large regions (e.g., for civil protection or insurance purposes) or when a first identification is needed (e.g., to address further detailed flood-mapping activities).

AB In the construction of a radial basis function (RBF) network, the key learning strategy is to identify the configuration (i.e. to determine the parameters of radial basis functions), which has significant influence on model performance. To improve the performance of an RBF network, a two-step learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. Two learning algorithms, unsupervised and supervised, are combined to develop the two-step learning algorithm. In the first step, the self-organizing map (SUM) data analysis technique is developed to analyze the input data. Through the SUM data analysis technique, the topological relationships among input data are revealed, and the distribution of the input data in the input space is represented by the synaptic weights. Therefore, all synaptic weights of SUM are regarded as potential centers of hidden neurons of the RBF network. In the second step, each synaptic weight of SUM is examined one by one to judge whether the weight can be adopted as the center of hidden neurons of the RBF network or not. Hence, in a supervised manner, the optimal configuration of RBF network is determined. For evaluating the performance of the RBF-based model developed by the proposed two-step learning algorithm, an actual application is performed to forecast the hourly inflow during typhoons. The results show that the proposed model can successfully yield 1-6-h ahead forecasts of inflow. For comparison, two other neural networks, the well known back-propagation neural (BPN) network and the RBF network with the existing conventional learning algorithm, are also adopted to construct the hourly inflow forecasting models. The cross-validation results demonstrate that the proposed model provides more reliable and accurate inflow forecasts than the two other models. In conclusion, the proposed model is useful to improve the forecasts of inflow to the reservoir. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The stable isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen of precipitation from Debrecen, Eastern Hungary was analysed in event-based samples collected from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2009. During the monitoring period, the delta O-18 values varied between -22.3 parts per thousand and 6.64 parts per thousand and the delta H-2 values between -176.8 parts per thousand and 10.7 parts per thousand. The LMWL for the monthly based data is close to the GMWL, but shows the effect of secondary evaporation of falling raindrops with lower intercept and slope. LMWL of each year shows highly different parameters due to differences in precipitation amount and summer temperatures, especially in the extreme years of 2002 and 2003. On the basis of our data, deuterium excess is considered to be the best parameter to reveal the extremities of dry and warm periods. Deuterium excess also proved to be a useful tool to show the different formation histories of certain precipitation events. Good correlation of delta O-18 with temperature was obtained for the samples. The slope of the delta O-18-T functions for the whole sampling period was 0.32 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand/degrees C for the monthly samples, however, a slope of 0.37 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand/degrees C was obtained if monthly mean temperatures were replaced with the monthly mean temperatures of the rainy days. Considering the temperature dependency of the delta O-18 values in the past, it can be concluded that Delta delta O-18/Delta T relationship using monthly mean temperatures of the rainy days might be a better approach than monthly mean temperatures.

AB The systematic modes of spatial and temporal variation in 372-month records of streamflow in Turkey are defined using the principal components (PCs) analysis. The PCs were computed from a matrix of monthly records of 78 stations during the period 1964-1994. The analysis revealed not only basic streamflow anomaly patterns but described also the variation of those patterns through time. For this purpose, the map patterns and time series of each PC scores were obtained, but only the first five significant components were selected for further analysis. They accounted for more than 70% of the total variance of the original streamflow data set. Temporal variations of the five PC scores appeared to be fairly synchronous with regional precipitation anomaly patterns documented earlier. Seasonal correlations between the PC scores and the indices of large-scale atmospheric circulation (i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Southern Oscillation (SO)) were computed to infer the physical meaning of the components. For example, using annual and winter average series, the maximum correlation coefficients between the first PC and the NAO and SO indices were found as -0.491 and -0.506 (significant at the 99% level), respectively. This implies the sensibility of the Turkish streamflow climatology to the variations of the NAO. The fifth PC was also shown to be in a significant relation with the SO. Similar analysis was seasonally carried out for the series of precipitation-streamflow PC scores. As a result, the relationships between the series of precipitation-streamflow and precipitation-first PC were fairly strong with a correlation value of 0.657 and 0.596 at the 99.9% significance level, respectively.

AB Beihai wetland is a special type of alpine marsh in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with plants like a blanket floating on the water surface permanently. Long-term datasets with eddy covariance (EC) technique of evapotranspiration (ET) from the wetland ecosystem are still not too much. Based on EC measurements from 2016 to 2020, we investigated the variations of ET and its controlling factors over the Beihai wetland. Our results showed that ET was mostly influenced by the net radiation (Rn) from half-hourly to monthly timescales as a result of sufficient water supply at the observation site. In addition, the cloudiness was also a key factor con-trolling ET on daily scale by regulating radiation. On overcast and cloudy days, cloudiness suppressed ET primarily due to the decrease in the direct radiation (R-dir). While under sunny conditions, the increased diffuse radiation (R-dif) by cloudiness was conductive to increasing the canopy conductance (G(s)) and therefore ET. On annual scale, the annual ET ranged from 762.3 to 990.5 mm, and the annual precipitation was 1,210.4-1,780.2 mm during 2016-2020. The annual ET changed by around 30 %, while the annual precipitation changed by 47 %. There was a significant negative relationship between the annual ET and the annual precipitation. More annual precipitation in 2016 with more precipitation days and greater precipitation intensity than that in other four years resulted in less annual ET. Furthermore, the fraction of water surface was another factor controlling year-to-year variation of ET. There was a larger fraction of water cover in current site (37.3-38.4 % in 2017-2020) than that in the original site (29.7 % in 2016). Annual ET tended to increase as the fraction of water cover increased.

AB Semiarid grassland ecosystems play a crucial role in global carbon and water cycles. Considerable attention has been devoted to the effect of biometeorological parameters on ecosystem carbon exchanges in semiarid regions. However, a gap remains regarding carbon and water flux in the Chinese Loess Plateau. In this study, we describe 6 years (2007-2012) of eddy-covariance carbon fluxes (CO2) and water-use efficiency (WUE) over a semiarid grassland site and their biometeorological controls. Interannual CO2 flux variations were analyzed based on a correlation analysis with measured biometeorological factors. The annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was negative (mean net carbon sink) across the entire period, varying from -236.3 (2012) to - 114.2 g C m(-2) year(-1) (2011), with a mean value of - 168.9 g C m(-2) year(-1). The normalized differential vegetation index is the most highly correlated with gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) across several timescales. The effective precipitation frequency is an important factor influencing CO2 fluxes on an annual timescale, and soil water content was the second most important factor affecting CO2 fluxes on a monthly timescale. On an annual timescale, the semiarid grassland ecosystem WUE increased with the soil drought stress index, with ET decreasing more than GPP as soil drought increased. The monthly mean WUE varied from 0.44 to 2.51 g C kg(-1) H2O, and the monthly WUE plateaued in October. Summer drought-induced leaf senescence caused GPP reduction in weaker summer monsoon years, leading to a notable reduction in WUE. We found obvious transitional characteristics in the response of WUE to soil water stress. We also found a strong positive relationship between the annual NEE and the annual effective precipitation frequency at the study site.

AB Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable. Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular. However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable populations, which can be combined to achieve an Integrated Economic Vulnerability Index (IEVI). The methodology deployed here was conducted in Castilla y Leon (northwest Spain; 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis. Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the IEVI. Tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the IEVI, whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that IEVI scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.

AB Coastal tundra ecosystems are relatively flat, and yet display large spatial variability in ecosystem traits. The microtopographical differences in polygonal geomorphology produce heterogeneity in permafrost depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil geochemistry, and plant distribution. Few measurements have been made, however, of how water fluxes vary across polygonal tundra plant types, limiting our ability to understand and model these ecosystems. Our objective was to investigate how plant distribution and geomorphological location affect actual evapotranspiration (ET). These effects are especially critical in light of the rapid change polygonal tundra systems are experiencing with Arctic warming. At a field site near Barrow, Alaska, USA, we investigated the relationships between ET and plant cover in 2014 and 2015. ET was measured at a range of spatial and temporal scales using: (1) An eddy covariance flux tower for continuous landscape-scale monitoring; (2) An automated clear surface chamber over dry vegetation in a fixed location for continuous plot-scale monitoring; and (3) Manual measurements with a clear portable chamber in approximately 60 locations across the landscape. We found that variation in environmental conditions and plant community composition, driven by microtopographical features, has significant influence on ET. Among plant types, ET from moss-covered and inundated areas was more than twice that from other plant types. ET from troughs and low polygonal centers was significantly higher than from high polygonal centers. ET varied seasonally, with peak fluxes of 0.14 mm h(-1) in July. Despite 24 hours of daylight in summer, diurnal fluctuations in incoming solar radiation and plant processes produced a diurnal cycle in ET. Combining the patterns we observed with projections for the impact of permafrost degradation on polygonal structure suggests that microtopographic changes associated with permafrost thaw have the potential to alter tundra ecosystem ET.

AB Data driven models are very useful for river flow forecasting when the underlying physical relationships are not fully understand, but it is not clear whether these data driven models still have a good performance in the small river basin of semiarid mountain regions where have complicated topography. In this study, the potential of three different data driven methods, artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM) were used for forecasting river flow in the semiarid mountain region, northwestern China. The models analyzed different combinations of antecedent river flow values and the appropriate input vector has been selected based on the analysis of residuals. The performance of the ANN, ANFIS and SVM models in training and validation sets are compared with the observed data. The model which consists of three antecedent values of flow has been selected as the best fit model for river flow forecasting. To get more accurate evaluation of the results of ANN, ANFIS and SVM models, the four quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures, the coefficient of correlation (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) and mean absolute relative error (MARE), were employed to evaluate the performances of various models developed. The results indicate that the performance obtained by ANN, ANFIS and SVM in terms of different evaluation criteria during the training and validation period does not vary substantially; the performance of the ANN, ANFIS and SVM models in river flow forecasting was satisfactory. A detailed comparison of the overall performance indicated that the SVM model performed better than ANN and ANFIS in river flow forecasting for the validation data sets. The results also suggest that ANN, ANFIS and SVM method can be successfully applied to establish river flow with complicated topography forecasting models in the semiarid mountain regions.

AB Evaporation experiments are commonly used to derive hydraulic properties of soils. In the simplified evaporation method, as proposed by Schindler [Schindler, U., 1980. Ein Schnellverfahren zur Messung der Wasserleitfahigkeit im teilgesattigten Baden an Stechzytinderproben. Arch. Acker-u. Pflanzenbau u. Bodenkd. Berlin 24, 1-7], the weight of a soil sample and pressure heads at two height levels are recorded at consecutive times. The evaluation of these measurements relies on linearization assumptions with respect to time, space and the water content-pressure head relationship. In this article, we investigate the errors that result from the linearization assumptions, and show how systematic and stochastic measurement errors affect the calculation of water retention and hydraulic conductivity data and the resulting fits of soil hydraulic functions. We find that linearization errors with respect to time are negligible if cubic Hermite splines are used for data interpolation. Linearizations in space lead to minor errors, even in the late stage of evaporation where strongly non-linear pressure head profiles emerge. A bias in the estimated retention function results from the negligence of a non-tinear water content distribution in the sample at the begin of the evaporation process, and affects primarily coarse sands or soils with structured pore systems. This error can be avoided if an integral evaluation of the measurements is used. We introduce an applicable rejection criterion for unreliable hydraulic conductivity data near saturation, based on the error in the hydraulic gradient. Calibration errors of tensiometers lead to biased estimates of hydraulic properties in the wet range, whereas errors in tensiometer installation positions yield biases in the dry range. Random errors in data cause no significant bias, and parametric hydraulic functions can be estimated with small uncertainties, if water retention and conductivity functions are coupled and the underlying model structure is correct.

AB In many practical applications of hydrological models, a case-specific parameter optimisation is not feasible due to lack of data. Model parameters may then be derived through regionalisation, i.e. by linking model parameters to physical catchment descriptors. Most Studies reported in literature rely on linear regression techniques to establish the regionalisation scheme although it is well known that the underlying assumptions, e.g. the linearity of the relationship between physical catchment descriptors and model parameters, are often violated. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are distribution-independent non-linear model structures and are therefore potentially useful tools for regionalising model parameters. This paper compared linear regression analysis and ANNs for regionalising the most sensitive parameters of the semi-distributed hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) with an application in the Flemish part of the Scheidt river basin. The uncertainty on both regionalisation procedures was assessed with a non-parametric bootstrap method. ANNs delivered more accurate parameter estimates than linear regression equation,,; if the non-linearities simulated by the ANNs have a physical meaning and if the physical catchment descriptors of the catchment under study lie within the range of the descriptor values of the sites used for the construction of the ANN's. For extrapolations outside this range, regression analysis yielded a better result. The uncertainty on the regionalised parameters was generally higher for ANNs than for regression equations, however, intervals for stream flow predictions were only slightly broader. Finally, the results of previous analyses were interpreted in function of the parameterisation of virtual land use scenarios. Because five out of seven model parameters depend on land use, it call be expected that regionalisation can enhance the estimation of non-crop related parameters of virtual land use scenarios.

AB Operational use of hydrological models requires the transfer of calibrated parameters either in time (for streamflow forecasting) or space (for prediction at ungauged catchments) or both. Although the effects of spatial and temporal parameter transfer on catchment streamflow predictions have been well studied individually, a direct comparison of these approaches is much less documented. Here, we compare three different schemes of parameter transfer, viz., temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal, using a spatially lumped hydrological model called EXP-HYDRO at 294 catchments across the continental United States. Results show that the temporal parameter transfer scheme performs best, with lowest decline in prediction performance (median decline of 4.2%) as measured using the Kling-Gupta efficiency metric. More interestingly, negligible difference in prediction performance is observed between the spatial and spatiotemporal parameter transfer schemes (median decline of 12.4% and 13.9% respectively). We further demonstrate that the superiority of temporal parameter transfer scheme is preserved even when: (1) spatial distance between donor and receiver catchments is reduced, or (2) temporal lag between calibration and validation periods is increased. Nonetheless, increase in the temporal lag between calibration and validation periods reduces the overall performance gap between the three parameter transfer schemes. Results suggest that spatiotemporal transfer of hydrological model parameters has the potential to be a viable option for climate change related hydrological studies, as envisioned in the "trading space for time" framework. However, further research is still needed to explore the relationship between spatial and temporal aspects of catchment hydrological variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-physical approach developed for the hydrodynamic characterization of porous media using hydrogeophysical information is presented. Several pumping tests were performed in the Hydrogeosite Laboratory, a controlled full-scale site designed and constructed at the CNR-IMAA (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Istituto di Metodologia per l'Analisi Ambientale), in Marsico Nuovo (Basilicata Region, Southern Italy), in order to obtain an intermediate stage between laboratory experiments and field survey. The facility consists of a pool, used to study water infiltration processes, to simulate the space and time dynamics of subsurface contamination phenomena, to improve and to find new relationship between geophysical and hydrogeological parameters, to test and to calibrate new geophysical techniques and instruments. Therefore, the Hydrogeosite Laboratory has the advantage of carrying out controlled experiments, like in a flow cell or sandbox, but at field comparable scale. The data collected during the experiments have been used to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity k(s), [ms(-1)] using a coupled inversion model working in transient conditions, made up of the modified Richards equation describing the water flow in a variably saturated porous medium and the Poisson equation providing the self-potential phi [V], which naturally occurs at points of the soil surface owing to the presence of an electric field produced by the motion of underground electrolytic fluids through porous systems. The result obtained by this multi-physical numerical approach, which removes all the approximations adopted in previous works, makes a useful instrument for real heterogeneous aquifer characterization and for predictive analysis of its behavior.

AB To quantify the hydrological effects of disconnected impervious area is significant for urban planning and storm water management. Most relevant studies were event-based analysis and only focused on surface runoff. The accumulated impacts of disconnected imperviousness on both surface and subsurface runoff have not been fully understood yet. In this study, a physically based model coupling surface runoff, subsurface runoff and evapotranspiration was constructed for continuous simulation of the hydrological processes in an RPA (receiving pervious area)-DIA (disconnected impervious area) system at street block scale. Five RPA types with natural clay loam, compacted clay loam, natural sandy clay loam and depressed clay loam were considered. For each RPA type, urban development scenarios with varying disconnected impervious area ratios (DIRs) were designed. The results presented that both the annual total and averaged event-based surface runoff followed a generally Power form relationship with DIR for all the RPA types, which can be satisfactorily described by a concise and meaningful formula. Disconnected impervious surface can lead to higher event-based initial soil moistures, and it is much more significant when during dry months (autumn and winter) with less potential evapotranspiration intensity than during wet months (spring and summer). This results imply the importance to take the potential increased initial soil moisture of RPA and the corresponded increased runoff generation into consideration of storm water management when imperviousness disconnection is applied. At last, with the increase of DIR, the annual total groundwater recharge had a tendency to rise first and then decrease. This proves the possibility of improving underground water resource storage or maintain the groundwater recharge to the predeveloped level in the process of urban imperviousness expanding. Since this simulation work lacks on-ground validation, further studies based on the conclusions are still needed from the perspective of measured data analysis in urban RPADIA system.

AB The development of biocrusts and litter cover has been promoted by the vegetation restoration of karst mountainous lands in recent decades. However, the contribution of biocrust and litter to the karst terrestrial water cycle is still unclear. The interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were explored by inserting microlysimeters (20 cm radius and 35 cm height) into the karst mountainous lands to collect undisturbed soils. Four moss crust biomass levels (0, 0.32, 0.64 and 0.96 kg m(-2)) and three pine needle biomass levels (0, 0.32 and 0.64 kg m(-2)) were used to estimate the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures. In addition, the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed. The effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crusts. Moreover, the influences of moss crusts on the evaporation rate were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles, while the effects of pine needles on the evaporation rate were not highly affected by the moss crusts. Furthermore, thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature (pr = 0.50) compared to the effect of the moss crusts (pr = 0.17). There was a significant relationship between the value of Ebare-soil/E-0 and the mean soil water content SWCmean for bare soils. The predictive ability of the one-parameter concept (weighted average vegetation coefficient k(c)) was slightly better than that of the double-parameter concept (moss crust factor k(MC) and pine needle factor k(np)). The key ecohydrological role of ground cover in controlling evaporation cannot be neglected for karst mountainous land management and preventing rocky desertification.

AB Evaporative fraction (EF), which is known to exhibit variation in response to changes in crop species, soil and meteorologic conditions, plays an important role in interpreting the components of energy budget and estimating evapotranspiration (ET), while such information is scarce for humid rice fields. The present study discussed the variation of energy balance components and then examined the pattern of hourly, daytime and daily EF after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for water-saving irrigated (WSI) rice paddies of 2015 and 2016. Then the daily ET was estimated by an improved EF up-scaling method in the subtropical monsoon climate region of East China. Diurnally, hourly EF is deemed as an approximately concave-up shape in different growth stages of rice season. The seasonal average EF varies gently, with a minimum around 10:00-11:00 AM. Seasonally, the mean daytime EF for the whole growth stage is 0.86, 7% lower than the daily value. Daily EF exhibits mostly higher than 0.8 except later yellow ripening period, approaching 1.0 in the milk stage. EF over WSI rice exhibits obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops. In addition, differences are noted in the results with respect to the daily ET estimation by EF up-scaling method. The estimated daily ET (ETEF,d) from hourly EF during 10:00-11:00 h is highly correlated to the measured ET (ETtrue) by the weighed micro-lysimeters though the ETEF, d value is underestimated. Such a considerable gap serves in forming a relationship between ETEF, d and ETtrue,d, that is, by simply multiplying the representativeness ET value based on the EF up-scaling method by a correction procedure calibrated for this region. In conclusion, an improved EF up-scaling method is proposed for extrapolating remote sensing based ET estimates to daily values.

AB Various natural and anthropogenic factors affect the formation of gleyed soil. It is a major challenge to identify the key hazard factors and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization at a regional scale under future climate change. This study addressed this complex challenge based on regional groundwater modelling for a typical agriculture region located in the Ganjiang River Delta (GRD) of Poyang Lake Basin, China. We first implemented in-situ soil sampling analysis and column experiments under different water depths to examine the statistical relationship between groundwater depth (GD) and gleyization indexes including active reducing substance, ferrous iron content, and redox potential. Subsequently, a three-dimensional groundwater flow numerical model for the GRD was established to evaluate the impacts of the historical average level and future climate change on vadose saturation and soil gleyization (averaged over 2016-2050) in the irrigated farmland. Three climate change scenarios associated with carbon dioxide emission (A1B, A2, and B1) were predicted by the ECHAM5 global circulation model published in IPCC Assessment Report (2007). The ECHAM5 outputs were applied to quantify the variation of groundwater level and to identify the potential maximum gleyed zones affected by the changes of meteorological and hydrological conditions. The results of this study indicate that GD is an indirect indicator for predicting the gradation of soil gleyization at the regional scale, and that the GRD will suffer considerable soil gleyization by 2050 due to fluctuations of the water table induced by future climate changes. Compared with the annually average condition, the climate scenario B1 will probably exacerbate soil gleyization with an 8.8% increase in total gleyed area in GRD. On average, the highly gleyed areas will increase in area by 29.7 km(2), mainly on the riverside area, and the medium-slightly gleyed area will increase by 19.2 km(2) in the middle region.

AB Post-fire debris flows can have erosion rates up to three orders of magnitude higher than background rates. They are major sources of fine suspended sediment, which is critical to the safety of water supply from forested catchments. Fire can cover parts or all of these large catchments and burn severity is often heterogeneous. The probability of spatial and temporal overlap of fire disturbance and rainfall events, and the susceptibility of hillslopes to severe erosion determine the risk to water quality. Here we present a model to calculate recurrence intervals of high magnitude sediment delivery from runoff-generated debris flows to a reservoir in a large catchment (>100 km(2)) accounting for heterogeneous burn conditions. Debris flow initiation was modelled with indicators of surface runoff and soil surface erodibility. Debris flow volume was calculated with an empirical model, and fine sediment delivery was calculated using simple, expert-based assumptions. In a Monte-Carlo simulation, wildfire was modelled with a fire spread model using historic data on weather and ignition probabilities for a forested catchment in central Victoria, Australia. Multiple high intensity storms covering the study catchment were simulated using Intensity-Frequency-Duration relationships, and the runoff indicator calculated with a runoff model for hillslopes. A sensitivity analysis showed that fine sediment is most sensitive to variables related to the texture of the source material, debris flow volume estimation, and the proportion of fine sediment transported to the reservoir. As a measure of indirect validation, denudation rates of 4.6-28.5 mm ka(-1) were estimated and compared well to other studies in the region. From the results it was extrapolated that in the absence of fire management intervention the critical sediment concentrations in the studied reservoir could be exceeded in intervals of 18-124 years.

TI DISSOLVED MAJOR ELEMENTS EXPORTED BY THE CONGO AND THE UBANGI RIVERS
   DURING THE PERIOD 1987-1989
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GEOCHEMISTRY
AB On the basis of monthly sampling during the period 1987-1989, the geochemistry of the Congo and the Ubangi (second largest tributary of the Congo) rivers was studied in order (1) to understand the seasonal variations of the physico-chemical parameters of the waters and (2) to estimate the annual dissolved fluxes exported by the two rivers. The results presented here correspond to the first three years of measurements carried out for a scientific programme (Interdisciplinary Research Programme on Geodynamics of Peri-Atlantic Intertropical Environments, Operation 'Large River Basins' (PIRAT-GBF) undertaken jointly by Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU) and Institut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le Developpement en Cooperation (ORSTOM)) planned to run for at least ten years.
   The Congo River is more diluted than the Ubangi (34 mg l-1 vs. 42 mg l-1). For both rivers, the inorganic dissolved load is composed mainly of HCO3- and SiO2. The chemical composition of the water does not change with time. In the Ubangi River, because of the presence of Precambrian carbonate rocks in its catchment, the proportions of HCO3- and Ca2+ are higher. On a seasonal scale, the concentration of dissolved cations and anions varies inversely with discharge, except silica. The comparison of the discharge-concentration relationship with a theoretical 'zero dilution' shows that the evolution of the concentration of dissolved substances is a simple dilution by the surface waters, with, in the case of the Ubangi, a small supply of dissolved substances by the surface waters.
   Using three different methods of calculation, the estimated annual inorganic dissolved flux of the Congo ranges from 39 x 10(6) to 44 x 10(6) tons (according to the year), with about 10% of this coming from the Ubangi drainage basin.

AB Baseflow is an important component of streamflow in alpine permafrost basins and plays a significant role in maintaining ecosystem security and rational planning of water resources. Meanwhile, a holistic analysis of the runoff process and determination of low-flow components helps to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions. In this context, an approach for determining low-flow components is presented. As a support, daily flow data regarding the source regions of the Yangtze River (YARSR) and Yellow River (YERSR) from 1965 to 2014 were divided into three groups (wet, normal, and dry years) to analyze baseflow, recession curves, and flow duration curves (FDC). The results showed that low-flow components can be determined from the corre-sponding relationship between percentile flow (Qpi) in FDC, baseflow, and recession processes. Sub-permafrost groundwater is the main component of baseflow in the permafrost regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The multi-year average proportion of sub-permafrost groundwater in YARSR and YERSR at Q75, Q85, and Q94 ranged from 75.5% to 100%, suggesting the dominance of sub-permafrost groundwater in sustaining low-flows. In addition, river discharge in dry years was more dependent on deep groundwater. The sub-permafrost groundwater proportion in low-flows in dry years (76%-95%) was greater than that of wet years (64%-86%). We also found that sub-permafrost groundwater flows increased significantly with permafrost degradation. Sub -permafrost groundwater flows increased more rapidly than that of supra-permafrost groundwater flows over the past decades. Future climate change may further affect runoff composition in permafrost rivers; and our method has great potential to characterize it.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   Mediterranean Turkey
ID FLOW RECESSION; GROUNDWATER; STREAMFLOW; AQUIFERS; CURVES
AB Because of water transfers through fissures, cavities, caves and phreatic channels of various sizes and unknown directions, the topographic watersheds of karst catchments have little significance for their aquifers. Most of the flow in the Manavgat River in South Anatolia has its origin outside of the surface watershed and is transferred through karst pathways. Previous investigations found evidence for this by groundwater tracing techniques. In this study, flow recession analysis and baseflow separation are applied to the time series of daily flows 1992-2008 from three gauging stations. Flow recessions were found corresponding to the nonlinear storage-baseflow relationship S = a.Q(b), with b values around 0.5 as typical for unconfined groundwater, while the coefficient a showed marked seasonal variations with higher values in the rainy winter time and decreasing values towards the dry summer. For catchments which receive water transfers from other areas, the decrease of a is retarded. Flow recession is slower since more water is available. Baseflow separation by using the same nonlinear model revealed that direct flow, which is mainly surface flow, corresponds roughly to the surface catchments while baseflow, which accounts for most of the total flow, is highly influenced by transfers from karst sink areas outside the surface watersheds. The subsurface transfer was simulated by a nonlinear reservoir routing algorithm. Time series of monthly baseflow from catchments which receive transfer water were compared with those of sinkhole (loss) areas. The procedure allows inferring the origin area of the inflows and estimating the retention or lag time of the transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Even though karstic aquifers are important freshwater resources and frequently occur in mountainous areas, recharge processes related to snowmelt have received little attention thus far. Given the context of climate change, where alterations to seasonal snow patterns are anticipated, and the often-strong coupling between recharge and discharge in karst aquifers, this research area is of great importance. Therefore, we investigated how snowmelt water transits through the vadose and phreatic zone of a karst aquifer. This was accomplished by evaluating the relationships between meteorological data, soil water content, vadose zone flow in a cave 53 m below ground and aquifer discharge. Time series data indicate that the quantity and duration of meltwater input at the soil surface influences flow and storage within the soil and epikarst. Prolonged periods of snowmelt promote perched storage in surficial soils and encourage surficial, lateral flow to preferential flow paths. Thus, in karstic watersheds overlain by crystalline loess, a typical pedologic and lithologic pairing in central Europe and parts of North America, soils can serve as the dominant mechanism impeding infiltration and promoting shallow lateral flow. Further, hydrograph analysis of vadose zone flow and aquifer discharge, suggests that storage associated with shallow soils is the dominant source of discharge at time scales of up to several weeks after melt events, while phreatic storage becomes import during prolonged periods without input. Soils can moderate karst aquifer dynamics and play a more governing role on karst aquifer storage and discharge than previously credited. Overall, this signifies that a fundamental understanding of soil structure and distribution is critical when assessing recharge to karstic aquifers, particularly in cold regions.

AB Information about sources of recharge. distributions of flow paths, and the extent of water-rock reactions in karst aquifers commonly result from monitoring spring chemistry and discharge. To investigate the relationship between spring characteristics and the complexities of karst aquifers, we couple variations in surface- and groundwater chemistry to physical conditions including river stage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration (ET) within a sink-rise system through a 6-km portion of the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) in north-central Florida. Principal component analysis (PCA) of time series major-element compositions suggests that at least three sources of water affect spring discharge, including allogenic recharge into a swallet, diffuse recharge through a thin vadose zone, and water upwelling from deep within the aquifer. The deep-water source exerts the strongest influence on water chemistry by providing a majority of Na+, Mg+, K+, Cl-, and SO2- to the system. Anomalously high temperature at one of several monitoring wells reflects vertical flow of about 1 m/year. Mass-balance calculations suggest diffuse recharge and deep-water upwelling can provide up to 50% of the spring discharge; however, their contributions depend on head gradients between the conduit and surrounding aquifer matrix, which are influenced by variations in precipitation, ET, and river stage. Our results indicate that upwelling from deep flow paths may provide significant contributions of water to spring discharge, and that monitoring only springs limits interpretations of karst systems by masking critical components of the aquifer, such as water sources and flow paths. These results also suggest the matrix in eogenetic aquifers is a major pathway for flow even in a system dominated by conduits. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial and temporal measurements of shallow sub-surface soil physical properties were made within a 1 km(2) upland catchment. The surface soil layer of the catchment was organic rich (> 70% organic matter) with a corresponding total porosity of 81%. Monthly point observations of volumetric water content (theta) were combined with point estimates of total porosity (epsilon) and the porosity < 50 mu m (epsilon(residual)), to define the ratio of water filled pore volume:pore volume in pores < 50 mum (= theta/epsilon(residual)). Values of theta/epsilon(residual) were compared with discharge to test whether mass flow occurred when theta/epsilon(residual) > 1. A correlation between water content and discharge was found, with discharge increasing rapidly when theta/epsilon(residual) approached unity. Similar relationships between water content and catchment discharge were identified for soil units adjacent to the stream when theta/epsilon(residual) approached unity. These data suggest that soil pores >50 mum are of crucial importance in determining catchment discharge. Spatial and temporal variations in soil properties related to moisture content of the soil were also observed. Under dry conditions, a clear division based on aspect was noted, the west-facing side of the catchment being wettest. In wetter months, total porosity and soil water content were significantly affected by soil type and the spatial pattern of soil water content was more variable than in the dryer months. The physical quantification of soil properties in the shallow sub-surface layer proved important in explaining different initial changes in discharge from the catchment in response to a rainfall event.

AB Forest soils are often covered with a litter that influences the rate of mass and energy transfer between the soil and the air above, thereby modifying the temperature and moisture fields in the soil. The presence of a litter should therefore be accounted for in forest SVAT models, especially when long-term simulations are to be performed. A heat and moisture litter model has been developed by adding two dynamical equations to a force-restore type soil model. The experimental data used for the model validation was collected in a pine forest canopy in the South-West of France, that was part of the Euroflux network. The model is tested and validated over a two-year period. It is shown to provide a fairly good simulation of soil and litter moisture, soil and litter temperature and turbulent fluxes measured above the forest floor. It is also shown that simulations without the litter layer are unable to reproduce all these variables simultaneously. We then perform a sensitivity analysis to the parameters whose values are either uncertain or likely to be variable in time and space, such as the litter thickness, the rainfall fraction intercepted by the litter or the maximum value of the surface resistance. A threshold value of the litter moisture used in the surface resistance parameterisation turns out to be the most critical parameter. Further work is needed to investigate the possible relationships between the various parameters describing the litter, but the present litter model can already be used in combination with other forest SVAT models.

AB Most existing studies do not consider the effect that the deformability of submarine sediments may have on solute transport under the action of ocean waves. In this study a two-dimensional numerical model based on Biot's poro-elastic consolidation theory and an advection-dispersion equation is established to investigate the transport of non-reactive solute into a deformable porous seabed under the influence of ocean waves. The numerical model is then validated against experimental and analytical results in order to demonstrate its accuracy and robustness. The simulation results indicate that ignoring the deformability of seabed soil and associated seepage force due to ocean waves may lead to a significant underestimation of the rate of solute transport in shallow layers of marine sediment, particularly fine sand or silt. The effects of parameters such as the shear modulus, non-dimensional mechanical dispersion coefficient (related to particle size and permeability), dimensionless sediment thick-ness, wave steepness and the relative water depth have on solute transport into deformable sediments were investigated. The results indicate that the ratio of the longitudinal coefficient of mechanical dispersion between deformable and non-deformable sediments that can represent the enhancement of solute migration due to soil deformation may reach up to 85. This becomes more pronounced as the shear modulus and permeability of sediments decrease and the depth of water increases when the sediment thickness is less than 0.8 times the wavelength. The rate of solute transport in deformable sediments reaches its maximum when the sediment thickness is about 0.2 times the wavelength. In fact, as the relative water depth increases from 0.1 to 0.3, the enhancement of solute migration due to wave-induced soil deformation increases by about 60%-80%. In com-parison to linear waves, shallow water waves, e.g., the first-order cnoidal waves, can increase the transport of solute more due to its strong non-linear behaviour, particularly in deformable seabed.

AB The self-potential (SP) method is a passive geophysical technique, which may offer insights about water and ionic fluxes in the vadose zone. The main obstacles presently prohibiting its routine use in quantitative vadose zone hydrology are the superposition of signals arising from various source mechanisms, difficult-to-predict electrode polarization effects that depend on electrode design and age, as well as incomplete knowledge on water saturation, pore water chemistry, clay content, and temperature in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. We present a unique long-term SP monitoring experiment focusing on the first four years of data acquired at different depths in the vadose zone within the HOBE hydrological observatory in Denmark. Using state-of-the-art SP theory combined with flow and transport simulations, we attempt to replicate the observed data and suggest reasons for observed discrepancies. The predictions are overall satisfactory during the first six months of monitoring after which both the patterns and magnitudes of the observed data change drastically. Our main observations are (1) that predicted SP magnitudes are strongly sensitive to how the effective excess charge (or alternatively, the voltage coupling coefficient) scales with water saturation implying that continued research is needed to build more accurate models of electrokinetic phenomena in unsaturated conditions, (2) that significant changes in electrode polarization occur in the shallowest electrodes at time scales of a year, most likely due to desaturation by capillarity of the fluids filling the electrodes, suggesting that electrode effects cannot be ignored and that explicit electrode modeling should be considered in future monitoring studies, and (3) that multi-rate mass transfer and reactive transport modeling, with specific emphasis on fluid-mineral interactions, are needed to better predict salinity and pore water conductivity. We hope to stimulate other researchers to test new SP modeling approaches and interpretation strategies against these data by making the SP and complimentary (temperature, dielectric constant, potential/actual evapotranspiration, precipitation) data time-series available.

AB Reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products are important for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle, especially in water-limited arid regions. However, it is essential to assess the reliability of SM products before they are used. In this study, surface SM from the European Reanalysis-Interim v5 (ERA5), Essential Climate Variables (ECV), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were assessed based on in-situ data and the Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) approach in a typical arid region, Central Asia (CA). The validation based on in -situ data indicated that all three products underestimated the observed surface SM, except for ERA5. The ERA5 SM was closest to the in-situ observations, averaging a higher correlation coefficient of 0.59, followed by the GLDAS, ECV, and FLDAS. The TCH method revealed low uncertainties (<0.05 m3/m3) for all four SM products, and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes. For ERA5 and ECV SM products, the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and forests, respectively. FLDAS and GLDAS SM products performed better in terms of uncertainty compared to ERA5 and ECV, with an average uncertainty below 0.03 m3/m3, except for forests. The above assessment results indicate that, compared with the other three SM products, ERA5 has a better performance and more potential for application in CA. There was an upward trend in surface SM from 1982 to 2018 in CA. The relationship between the four SM products and aridity index and drought events showed that GLDAS could capture the hydrothermal conditions and drought events, followed by FLDAS, ERA5, and ECV. Our research is intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded SM products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions.

AB Interaction between meteorological and hydrologic processes is challenging to model owing to their high spatio-temporal variability. The understanding of their associations can help to ensure future fresh water security with changing climate. In this study, due to continuously evolving nature of these interactions, the hydrological and meteorological variables are studied on wavelet component level. Multi-Resolution Stationary Wavelet Transformation (MRSWT) is used to transform the independent (climatic variable) and dependent (hydrological variable) time series into their components. The components of the dependent time series are modeled using a kernel-based auto-regressive (AR) model for separating their memory part. The residuals are hypothesized to be the effect of interaction of predictor variables and thus, are modeled using the MRSWT components of meteorological variables in an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX). Finally, the predicted residuals (effect of climatic variables) are added to the component estimated by kernel-based AR estimator (memory of dependent series components) to obtain the predicted components of the dependent hydrologic variable, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain the predicted dependent hydrologic variable. The developed hybrid Wavelet-ARX is found to capture the information about relationship between synthetically generated data better than a simple ARX model. The model is then applied to predict total monthly rainfall over Upper Mahanadi Basin and is found to effectively extract the information from the poorly associated hydro meteorological variables. While the potential of Wavelet-ARX is found to be impressive for hydro meteorological applications, additionally, discarding some climatic inputs on the basis of their relative importance may lead to better prediction by the developed model. The developed model is suitable for extracting climatic forcings and is desirable in a changing climate.

AB Soil and water loss from farmland causes land degradation and water pollution, thus continued efforts are needed to establish mathematical model for quantitative analysis of relevant processes and mechanisms. In this study, an approximate analytical solution has been developed for overland flow model and sediment transport model, offering a simple and effective means to predict overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions. In the overland flow model, the flow regime was considered to be transitional with the value of parameter beta (in the kinematic wave model) approximately two. The change rate of unit discharge with distance was assumed to be constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane. The excess rainfall was considered to be constant under uniform rainfall conditions. The overland flow model developed can be further applied to natural rainfall conditions by treating excess rainfall intensity as constant over a small time interval. For the sediment model, the recommended values of the runoff erosion calibration constant (c(r)) and the splash erosion calibration constant (c(f)) have been given in this study so that it is easier to use the model. These recommended values are 0.15 and 0.12, respectively. Comparisons with observed results were carried out to validate the proposed analytical solution. The results showed that the approximate analytical solution developed in this paper closely matches the observed data, thus providing an alternative method of predicting runoff generation and sediment yield, and offering a more convenient method of analyzing the quantitative relationships between variables. Furthermore, the model developed in this study can be used as a theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation plays a major role in controlling the fate of contaminants in natural and constructed wetlands. Estimating the efficiency of contaminant removal of a wetland requires separate knowledge of the residence time statistics in the main flow channels, where the flow velocity is relatively higher, and in the more densely vegetated zones, where the velocity is smaller and most of the biochemical transformations occur. A conceptual wetland characterized by a main flow channel (MFC) and lateral vegetated zones (LVZs) is modeled here using a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion model. The effect of vegetation is described as a flow resistance represented in the hydrodynamic model as a function of the stem density. Simulations are performed for a given flow discharge and for increasing values of the ratio between the vegetation density in the LVZs and in the MFC. Residence time distributions (RTDs) of a nonreactive tracer are derived from numerical simulations of the solute breakthrough curves (BTCs) resulting from a continuous concentration input. Results show that increasing vegetation densities produce an increasingly pronounced bimodality of the RTDs. At longer times, the RTDs decrease exponentially, with different timescales depending on the stem density ratio and other system parameters. The overall residence time distribution can be decomposed into a first component associated with the relatively fast transport in the MFC, and a second component associated with the slower transport in the LVZs. The weight of each temporal component is related to the exchange flux at the MFC-LVZ interface. A one-dimensional transport model is proposed that is capable to reproduce the RTDs predicted by the depth-averaged model, and the relationship between model and system parameters is investigated using a combination of direct and inverse modeling approaches.

AB Groundwater from springs, test boreholes and domestic wells was investigated to assess the flow system of basaltic aquifers at base-flow conditions in the southwestern part of Jeju Island, South Korea. This study utilized hydrogeochemical parameters and environmental tracers of O-18, H-2, H-3 and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which showed that well-connected flow paths exist between coastal springs regardless of flow rates. In contrast, test boreholes near the coastal springs exhibited various flow paths. Nitrate concentrations were much higher than baseline values in mountainous groundwater while those decreased in coastal areas (<50 m asl) despite stronger anthropogenic land uses. CI- was seemingly contributed from nitrate contamination sources and seawater sources were minimal due to low-permeability layers near sea level. The water-stable isotopes indicated little evaporation and were comparable to the local meteoric water line during the rainy season, which was confirmed by deuterium excess values, demonstrating that effective infiltration primarily occurs during the rainy season. From the effects of altitude on delta O-18, the mean recharge altitudes for both mountainous and coastal springs were estimated as 300-400 m, which implies longer flow paths for the coastal springs. The relationship of CFC-12-CFC-113 and that of CFC-12-H-3 concordantly indicated that the groundwater consists mainly of binary mixtures composed of 15-25-year-old young water and old water with ages greater than 60 years. Lower nitrate levels in the coastal springs were well represented by the mixing models. Recharge altitudes for coastal springs increased up to 700 m, assuming that old water corresponds to high-altitude recharge, using the binary mixing model. Integration of hydrochemical and environmental tracer characteristics revealed that pahoehoe lava flows and hydrovolcanic tuffs play key roles in controlling the groundwater occurrence and quality.

AB The soil water retention curve represents the relationship between soil water content (theta) and matric potential (psi). The van Genuchten (vG) model is commonly used to characterize the shape of a theta(psi) curve. Based on the similarities between theta(psi) curves and soil thermal conductivity (lambda) versus theta curves, Lu and Dong proposed a unified conceptual lambda(theta) model (LD model) for estimating lambda(theta) curves from theta(psi) curves. Their work makes it possible to relate the shapes of lambda(theta) curves to theta(psi) curves. In this study, we present an empirical approach to estimate the vG model parameter m from the LD model shape parameter p based on a model calibration with theta(psi) and lambda(theta) datasets obtained from 10 soils. The saturated water content theta s and the vG model parameter alpha are estimated from selected soil properties (i.e., bulk density, particle density, particle size distribution and organic carbon content), and the residual water content theta r is estimated from the LD model parameter theta f. For model evaluation, the theta(psi) curves of six soils were estimated from measured lambda(theta) values and selected soil properties, and were compared to direct theta(psi) measurements. The proposed method performed well with root mean square errors of estimated theta values ranging from 0.015 to 0.052 cm3 cm-3 and bias ranging from -0.009 to 0.040 cm3 cm-3. We conclude that the proposed method accurately estimates theta(psi) curves from lambda(theta) curves and selected soil properties.

AB Rock dip angle plays a significant role in surface hydraulic characteristics and leads to different spatial distribution of water and soil loss in Karst Trough Valleys. In this study, the rock dip angle effect on the hydraulic characteristics and soil detachment rate on dip/anti-dip slopes was explored via rainfall simulations and a steel experimental flume. The rainfall intensities ranged from 30 to 90 mm.h(-1), and the rock dip angles varied from 10 degrees to 60 degrees. The results revealed that i) surface runoff on the dip slope was higher than that on the anti-dip slope, whereas underground runoff presented opposite results. The 30 degrees rock dip angle presented the critical flow velocity for the anti-dip slope, and the flow velocity reduced as the rock dip angle of the dip slope increased. ii) Laminar water flow occurred on the dip/anti-dip slope (Re was < 500 in all cases). For the anti-dip slope, the Re value reduced by 3.53-89.79%, the Fr value reduced by 34.13-73.04%, and the f value increased by 61.07-93.78% compared with that of the dip slope. iii) A linear function model can describe the relationship between the soil detachment rate and hydrodynamic parameters (tau, w and E). It was found that w was the best of the hydrodynamic parameters to describe the soil detachment rate. These results could provide valuable information for establishing a national-scale empirical soil erosion model for Karst Trough Valley.

AB The Lorenz Curve, a concept used in economic theory, is used to quantify spatial-temporal variability in the daily time series of precipitation concentrations. The Lorenz Curve provides a graphical view of the cumulative percentage of total yearly precipitation. In addition, further extraction of the data using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz asymmetry coefficient provides a two-parameter measure of precipitation concentration and an explanation of the basis for the underlying inequalities in precipitation distribution. Based on the calculation of the precipitation concentration index (CI) and the Lorenz asymmetry coefficient (S) values from 1960 to 2010, variations in the trends and periodic temporal-spatial patterns of precipitation at 31 stations across the Lancang River basin are discussed. The results are as follows: (1) highest precipitation CI values occurred in the southern Lancang River basin, whereas the lowest precipitation CI values were mainly observed in the upper reaches of the Lancang River basin, which features a more homogeneous temporal distribution of rainfall. S values throughout the entire basin were less than one, indicating that minor precipitation events have the highest contribution to overall precipitation inequality. (2) Application of the Mann-Kendall test revealed that a significant, decreasing trend in precipitation CI that exceeding the 95th percentile was detected in the upper and middle reaches of the Lancang River basin. However, there was only one significant (0.05) S value trend throughout the river. (3) Climate jumps in annual CI occurred during the early 1960s, 1970s and 1980s at Jinghong, Deqin and Zaduo stations, respectively. (4) Dominant periodic variations in precipitation CI, with periods of 4-17 years, were found. These results allow for an improved understanding of extreme climate events and improved river basin water resource management. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in frozen soil is essential for the selection of water resource management measures and determination of irrigation schemes for winters. However, the dy-namics of the groundwater level and temperature caused by freezing and thawing and their impact on soil water redistribution remain unclear. In this field study, the mechanisms of water migration and heat transfer in the soil during the freeze-thaw period under the combined action of the surface temperature change (upper boundary) and groundwater level fluctuation (lower boundary) were comprehensively considered with the theory and method of heat transfer, freeze-thaw characteristic curves of soil, and water balance model. The results showed that: (1) The soil temperature distribution and groundwater temperature dynamics can be interpreted intuitively by the soil temperature gradient and accumulated heat storage. (2) The freeze-thaw characteristic curves of soil indicated that the soil temperature dynamics caused a phase transition of the soil water. This further changed the soil water potential and permeability by 1-2 magnitudes and 1-5 magnitudes, respectively, which affected the direction and quantity of water migration. (3) The water balance quantitatively revealed the controlling effect of groundwater level changes caused by freezing and thawing on soil moisture dynamics. About 20% of the ice in the frozen layer was formed by the upward recharge of the groundwater during the freezing period. In the thawing period, most of this water returned to the groundwater (84%), while the rest (16%) increased the soil water content. These results systematically explain the mechanisms of heat transfer and water migration between the soil water and the groundwater during the freeze-thaw period, providing a theoretical reference for agri-cultural water management in seasonally frozen regions.

AB We study measures of the amount of time required for transient flow in heterogeneous porous media to effectively reach steady state, also known as the response time. Here, we develop a new approach that extends the concept of mean action time. Previous applications of the theory of mean action time to estimate the response time use the first two central moments of the probability density function associated with the transition from the initial condition, at t = 0, to the steady state condition that arises in the long time limit, as t -> infinity. This previous approach leads to a computationally convenient estimation of the response time, but the accuracy can be poor. Here, we outline a powerful extension using the first k raw moments, showing how to produce an extremely accurate estimate by making use of asymptotic properties of the cumulative distribution function. Results are validated using an existing laboratory scale data set describing flow in a homogeneous porous medium. In addition, we demonstrate how the results also apply to flow in heterogeneous porous media. Overall, the new method is: (i) extremely accurate; and (ii) computationally inexpensive. In fact, the computational cost of the new method is orders of magnitude less than the computational effort required to study the response time by solving the transient flow equation. Furthermore, the approach provides a rigorous mathematical connection with the heuristic argument that the response time for flow in a homogeneous porous medium is proportional to L-2/D, where L is a relevant length scale, and D is the aquifer diffusivity. Here, we extend such heuristic arguments by providing a clear mathematical definition of the proportionality constant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Significant changes are reported in extreme rainfall characteristics over India in recent studies though there are disagreements on the spatial uniformity and causes of trends. Based on recent theoretical advancements in the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), we analyze changes in extreme rainfall characteristics over India using a high-resolution daily gridded (1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude) dataset. Intensity, duration and frequency of excess rain over a high threshold in the summer monsoon season are modeled by non-stationary distributions whose parameters vary with physical covariates like the El-Nino Southern Oscillation index (ENSO-index) which is an indicator of large-scale natural variability, global average temperature which is an indicator of human-induced global warming and local mean temperatures which possibly indicate more localized changes. Each non-stationary model considers one physical covariate and the best chosen statistical model at each rainfall grid gives the most significant physical driver for each extreme rainfall characteristic at that grid. Intensity, duration and frequency of extreme rainfall exhibit non-stationarity due to different drivers and no spatially uniform pattern is observed in the changes in them across the country. At most of the locations, duration of extreme rainfall spells is found to be stationary, while non-stationary associations between intensity and frequency and local changes in temperature are detected at a large number of locations. This study presents the first application of nonstationary statistical modeling of intensity, duration and frequency of extreme rainfall over India. The developed models are further used for rainfall frequency analysis to show changes in the 100-year extreme rainfall event. Our findings indicate the varying nature of each extreme rainfall characteristic and their drivers and emphasize the necessity of a comprehensive framework to assess resulting risks of precipitation induced flooding.

AB Cloud model theory provides a reliable method to effectively solve the problem of uncertainty associated with lake water quality assessments. To accurately match water quality parameters obtained from water samples and water quality standards, water quality parameters from water samples and water quality class levels were used as inputs to a reverse cloud generator algorithm to derive corresponding sample and level clouds. A multidimensional shape-position similarity cloud model (MSPSCM) was then developed to accurately evaluate lake water quality by considering shape and position similarities between the sample and level clouds. Using monthly water quality monitoring data from 2017 to 2019, spatiotemporal variability of water quality parameters of Nansi Lake in Shandong Province was analyzed, and the MSPSCM was used to further study the spatiotemporal variability of water pollution in Nansi Lake. Results showed that total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the main sources of pollution in Nansi Lake. Except for the severe pollution of the upper lake and its inflow waters (Class V water quality standard) in November 2017 and September 2019, Nansi Lake waters meet Class III water quality standard, and are suitable for drinking after being treated by a sewage treatment plant. Concentration of residential areas and industries around the upper lake is relatively high; large quantities of pollutants are discharged into the upper lake, resulting in considerably severe pollution of the upper lake (Class IV). Difference between water quality of Nansi Lake and that of its inflow water indicates that the purification ability of Nansi Lake should not be underestimated. In addition, compared with the existing cloud model used to evaluate lake water quality, the MSPSCM can more accurately reflect lake water quality, and provides a more flexible and effective method for lake water quality evaluation.

AB Groundwater is an important resource for multiple uses in South Africa. Hence, setting limits to its sustainable abstraction while assuring basic human needs is required. Due to prevalent data scarcity related to groundwater replenishment, which is the traditional basis for estimating groundwater availability, the present article presents a novel method for determining allocatable groundwater in quaternary (fourth order) catchments through information on streamflow. Using established methodologies for assessing baseflow, recession flow, and instream ecological flow requirement, the methodology develops a combined stepwise methodology to determine annual available groundwater storage volume using linear reservoir theory, essentially linking low flows proportionally to upstream groundwater storages. The approach was trialled for twenty-one perennial and relatively undisturbed catchments with long-term and reliable streamflow records. Using, the Desktop Reserve Model, instream flow requirements necessary to meet the present ecological state of the streams were determined, and baseflows in excess of these flows were converted into a conservative estimates of allocatable groundwater storages on an annual basis. Results show that groundwater development potential exists in fourteen of the catchments, with upper limits to allocatable groundwater volumes (including present uses) ranging from 0.02 to 3.54 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1) (0.10-11.83 mm a(-1)) per catchment. With a secured availability of these volume 75% of the years, variability between years is assumed to be manageable. A significant (R-2 = 0.88) correlation between baseflow index and the drainage time scale for the catchments underscores the physical basis of the methodology and also enables the reduction of the procedure by one step, omitting recession flow analysis. The method serves as an important complementary tool for the assessment of the groundwater part of the Reserve and the Groundwater Resource Directed Measures in South Africa and could be adapted and applied elsewhere.

AB The water and sediment fluxes into the estuary from upstream highly influence the estuarine ecosystem. The lack of method to evaluate the impact of daily water and sediment fluxes on ecosystem has limited the ecological management of estuary. Therefore, it is important to find a quantitative method for analysing the response of estuarine ecosystem to daily water and sediment fluxes into the estuary. Based on long time sequenced data, we aim to determine the dynamic response of fish communities to the interannual and seasonal variations of water and sediment fluxes, providing a novel method for the regulation of water and sediment process in dammed rivers. We establish a functional regression model and improve Functional Linear Regression That is Interpretable (FLiRTI) method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between the annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the daily water and sediment fluxes into the Yellow River Estuary from 1980 to 2011. The results showed that the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary explained 56% of the variability in the CPUE. Low fluxes during the spawning period (April-May) and high fluxes during the dam discharge period (June-July) were not conducive to estuarine fisheries. By increasing freshwater inflow in spring to 3.1 or 4.3 billion m(3), the cumulative effect on estuarine fish communities can be increased by 20% and 44%, respectively. We propose a functional regression method to quantify the response of estuarine fish communities to water and sediment fluxes into the estuary. We suggest that advancing the discharge time of dam to spring, a suitable spawning environment for fish can be provided, thus effectively increasing fish production in the estuary. This study overcomes the limitation of number of species as well as the disunity of hydrological and ecological data on time scale, providing new idea for estuarine ecology research.

AB Modelling river water level (WL) of a coastal catchment is much complex due to the tidal influences on river WL. A hybrid machine learning model based on relevance vector machine (RVM) and improved grasshopper optimization (IGOA) is proposed in this study for modelling hourly WL in a catchment located in the east coast of tropical peninsular Malaysia. Considering the non-linear relationship between inputs and output, a recursive elimination filter based on support vector machine (SVM-RFE) was employed for the selection of the best combination of inputs from antecedent WL and rainfall data for the prediction of WL one hour ahead. The performance of IGOA was compared with classical GOA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. Besides, the performance of the hybrid RVM model was compared with the artificial neural network (ANN) models hybridized with the same optimization algorithms. The SVM-RFE selected 1-, 12- and 24-lags WL data and 1-lag rainfall data as the most potential inputs. The relative performance of the models revealed the reliability of RVM-IGOA in WL prediction of a coastal catchment. Significant improvement of model performance was noticed after optimization using IGOA with Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) of 0.986 and 0.981, and Kling-Gupta Efficient (KGE) of 0.981 and 0.974 for RVM-IGOA and ANN-IGOA respectively, compared to the models hybridized using other optimization algorithms with NSE between 0.969 and 0.971, and KGE between 0.890 and 0.908. The study indicates the selection of predictors based on their non-linear relations with WL and better optimization of model parameters can improve model performance in simulation of highly complex hydrological phenomena like tidal river WL in a tropical coastal catchment.

AB Soil moisture plays a critical role as an essential component of the global water resources by regulating mass and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Quantification of these exchange processes requires accurate characterization and simulation of soil water movement. Physically-based models (PBMs) and machine learning methods (MLMs) can both be used in soil moisture simulation. However, their performances in soil water simulation have only been compared in a limited number of cases. Moreover, almost all of them are conducted in field studies each with fixed soil, initial condition, and boundary condition. Here, we developed three artificial neural network (ANN) frameworks, and made clearer and more systematic comparisons between them and a PBM-Ross numerical model solving Richards equation and parameter estimation using a data assimilation approach (iterative ensemble smoother, Ross-IES) in synthetic and real-world conditions. Compared with the ANNs, Ross-IES is more significantly affected by physical model uncertainties such as soil heterogeneity, initial and boundary conditions, while both methods are affected by observation noise. For Ross-IES, the errors from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter conceptualization are found to be more prominent than that of observation noise and therefore are suggested to be identified first. Meanwhile, the ANNs have difficulty in simulating the peaks and troughs of the soil water time series as well as in situations where the soil moisture is constantly saturated. ANNs yield a superior simulation when the nonlinear relationship between the response variables and driving data is weak, while the performance of Ross-IES is governed by the prior soil hydraulic information. In addition, Ross-IES approach requires much higher computational cost than the ANNs. ANN-MS performs best among the three ANN-based machine learning models and demonstrates great data mining ability and robustness against overfitting.

AB In the current changing climate, the importance of temporal stability of hydrological models is increasing. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of the changing weight of snow (w(S)) in a multiple objective calibration of a conceptual hydrological model in terms of the temporal stability of runoff and snow model efficiency and hydrologic model parameters. The methodology was tested by a lumped conceptual hydrological model (the TUW model), which was calibrated and validated in 213 Austrian catchments in two climatically different decades (i.e., 1981-1990 and 2001-2010). The results indicate that the runoff and snow model efficiencies are almost insensitive to a large range of wS, i.e., from 0 to 0.9 for the runoff and from 0.75 to 1.0 for the snow. This relationship is similar in the two different decades; however, the calibration runoff model efficiency (i.e., Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) was about 5 to 10% greater in flatland catchments in the warmer decade (2001-2010). The main impact of wS on the snow model efficiency is the reduction of snow underestimation errors in the flatland catchments. The relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is greater in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45-60% compared to 13% and 31% in the alpine catchments. The evaluation of the temporal stability indicates that increasing the weight of the snow increases the temporal stability of the degree-day factor and the parameters of the snowfall and rainfall thresholds. A change in the weight of the snow has the greatest impact on glacerized catchments, which were the most sensitive to changes in the mean annual air temperature between the two decades.

AB Estimates of evaporation from an open shallow lake in tropical Africa (Lake Ziway, Main Ethiopian Rift) are made by using monthly hydrometeorological data available for the past three decades. On the one hand, annual average estimates are inferred from three climatic approaches, which can be applied in areas with limited meteorological data. The lake energy balance yields an evaporation rate of 1780 mm yr(-1), assuming a Bowen ratio of 0.15 (that of Lake Victoria). The Penman method gives an annual evaporation rate of 1870 mm. The complementary relationship lake evaporation model (CRLE) applied on monthly averaged values of air temperature, air humidity and sunshine duration gives 1730 mm yr-l. The sensitivity of each method to changes in input variables is analyzed in order to test the stability of the resulting estimates. This helps discuss uncertainties and possible inter-annual variations of the evaporation rate. On the other hand, the monthly lake level records together with precipitation and river discharge data between 1969 and 1990, allow us to estimate the water balance, providing an annual rate of 1937 mm for the combined evaporation and groundwater losses. The chloride budget is used to discriminate the groundwater from the evaporation loss. It gives us an annual evaporation rate of 1740 mm and a corresponding groundwater loss of 200 mm yr(-1). The groundwater loss estimate is of the same order of magnitude as the surface outflow, but the associated error in the former is significant because the result is sensitive to the poorly known chloride content of river inflows. Our results can be used to forecast the impact of increased water consumption in the basin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A marginal gas injection method was previously proposed based on two-dimensional (2-D) homogeneous porous media, and the feasibility of isolating the oil shale pyrolysis zone from the surrounding hydrological environment had been demonstrated. The gas-water flow characteristics and dynamics during gas injection in 2-D porous media with a high-permeability zone (HPZ) were studied further based on the presence of a HPZ after fracturing oil shale reservoirs. A series of experiments were performed when the gas-injection point was located outside, at the boundary, or inside the HPZ (Case1-3). The HPZ enriched the injected gas, and in Cases 2 and 3, the gas inside the HPZ permeated to the low-permeability zone (LPZ) on both sides, forming two wing tributaries. However, in Case 1, water flowed into the HPZ in the opposite direction. In Cases 2 and 3, the direction of the local pressure gradient on both sides of the HPZ was completely opposite, indicating that the distribution of the pressure field was the direct cause of the gas-water flow characteristics. Therefore, the water-stopping effect of gas injection is primarily reflected in the HPZ. Additionally, the effect was best when the gas-injection point was set at the boundary or inside of the HPZ. These results were verified using reservoir-scale simulations and tests, in which the water yield decreased to ~ 100 kg/d. Subsequently, we recommended the sites of gas-injection wells for water stopping. All results are expected to provide strategies and theories for dealing with the adverse hydrological environment in large-scale oil shale in situ exploitation.

AB This paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non-climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in South-East South Australia. We identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non-climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). The results showed: (1) Rainfall during April to October was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) In contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during December to February (DJF) and annual groundwater recharge was found. This suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during April to October and an increase during DJF) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) The length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. It demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) There is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) Spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. The findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.

AB A water-level meter installed in Changping well, China, recorded coseismic fluctuations and a step change induced by the M-w 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 11 March 2011. Here we analyse the correlation between water level in the well and vertical ground motions recorded at a nearby surface site, and we examine the relationship between the characteristics of these two datasets and the well-aquifer system parameters. During the arrival period of P- and S-waves, the water level provides information about the intensification of high-frequency ground motions. During the arrival period of the surface waves, the amplitude of water-level fluctuations was closely related to the velocity of vertical-component surface motions. The fluctuation periods of these two parameters are in the range 15-35 s, and the period of oscillation displays a large-to-small characteristic behaviour. The amplification effect on the water level in Changping well, driven by the pressure fluctuation induced by the surface wave, was relatively small, but a low-to-high characteristic is apparent during the coseismic period, related to the gradual enhancement of aquifer permeability due to the action of seismic waves. The coseismic step increase in water level was related to the enhancement of aquifer permeability under the action of seismic waves, and the results of an inversion of water-level tidal-response characteristics show that permeability increased by similar to 6.56 x 10(-14) m(2) in the vicinity of Changping well in response to the action of seismic waves emanating from the Tohoku earthquake.

AB An attempt has been made to delineate the temporal variability and factors governing the shallow groundwater chemistry using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis notably R-mode factor (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Subsequently, geostatistical isoplethic maps were applied to convey better understanding on the distribution of selected groundwater parameters. The Manukan Island's shallow aquifer with sedimentary setting that constantly abstracted for freshwater supply has been selected for this study. One-way ANOVA suggested that neither changes of tide level nor rainfall volume appeared to exert significant influence on the groundwater chemistry of the small island. Rather, the groundwater chemistry was greatly governed by influence from seawater intrusion, which characterized by considerable amount of Ca, Na, and Cl. Such condition was well explained by a Piper diagram, where most plots were situated at the middle diamond shaped diagram, indicating mixing condition. FA likewise revealed that the shallow groundwater receives marked influence from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering processes, especially boreholes located in the inland area. This can be clearly noted from the distinct groupings of relationships among different factors. HCA classified boreholes into three groups according to their locations in the coastal area, suggesting significant chemical variations between boreholes with distance from coast. Such distribution pattern was particularly evident in the isoplethic map. Overall, it appears that the shallow groundwater in the tropical island is not an appropriate source for drinking water in concern to its exceptionally high salinity and several elevated minor elements (Mn, Pb, and Se). For this, it is suggested that efforts in exploring other alternative sources should be performed outright. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

ID SURFACE-ENERGY BUDGET; MODEL
AB Sensible heat flux greatly influences the Indian monsoon. In this study, we calculated sensible heat flux time-series for 12 sites over the western Tibetan Plateau using Price and Dunne's formula and adjusting the stability function. The time-series were derived from the field observations from the GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME)/Tibet programme under the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX). This paper demonstrates that monthly sensible heat fluxes show strong correlations with corresponding precipitation, and that the correlation coefficients increase with precipitation amount. The preceding winter and spring solid precipitation (snowfall and resulting snowpack) can also influence sensible heat flux in May, but the situation is complex. The correlations between heat flux and snowfall at Arrido, Naqu, and Lhasa are negative, but they are positive at Gaize (also known as Gerze) and Dingri. There is a significant relationship between how the variations from the mean calculated heat fluxes at Amdo differ from those at Rikaze, or Dingri, Cuona and Longzi, and their respective June-September precipitation amounts. This phenomenon may result from changes in circulation. When the sensible heat fluxes are above average north of the influence of the Indian monsoon and below average to the south, the summer monsoon circulation develops early and with greater intensity and precipitation, and vice versa.

AB Researchers seek improved models for estimating baseflow in ungauged catchments as the statistical and process -based methods traditionally used are not easily transferable and do not give robust predictions, respectively. In this study, a process-based statistical hybrid model for estimating baseflow, known here as the Budyko-type baseflow regression (BBR) model, was developed by combining the linear storage-discharge relationship with the Budyko function, and applying multiple regression. The performance of the hybrid model was then evaluated using data from 671 near-natural catchments acquired from four large-sample hydrometeorological datasets. The results showed that the BBR model performed well in estimating baseflow on both national and regional scales; the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0.85 to 0.94 for the calibration catchments and from 0.71 to 0.96 for the validation catchments. The BBR model has more of a physical basis, is more transferable, and is less likely to produce unrealistic (negative) mean annual baseflows than traditional multiple regression models. It is also less complex than process-based models. The calibrated BBR models were used to estimate the mean annual baseflow and the elasticity of the baseflow to climate and catchment attributes at the national scale for the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Australia. The results showed that climate (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) had the most control on the baseflow, and that the soil sand content and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were also important catchment attributes. The BBR model developed in this study offers scientists a new and improved method for estimating baseflow. The results generated by the model in this study will improve our understanding of how climate and landscape control the baseflow.

AB Groundwater contaminant sources identification and parameter estimation using the simulation-optimization (S/O) approach require numerous runs of the computationally expensive simulation model through the optimization algorithm. The computational cost can be effectively reduced by using a surrogate model which can accurately approximate the simulation model. With the advent of deep learning, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are suitable to learn sequential data, are being increasingly applied to regression problems involving time dependencies. However, for the simultaneous contaminant source identification and parameter estimation problem, the surrogate model requires to establish a relationship between release histories at the source locations to concentration measurements at observation points subject to given values of aquifer parameters. In this study, a novel deep neural network framework Entity Aware Sequence to sequence learning using Long Short-Term Memory (EAS-LSTM) is proposed as a surrogate model which takes both sequential i.e., release histories at the source locations at different stress periods and static variables i.e., transport parameters as inputs to predict breakthrough curves (BTCs) at observation points. The proposed surrogate model is applied to a heterogeneous field scale aquifer with 4 zones. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) using EAS-LSTM is 0.0033 ppm(2) which is significantly better than that of Kriging and Support Vector Regression (SVR) which are 0.048 ppm(2) and 1.302 ppm(2) respectively. Comparison of EAS-LSTM model performance with Kriging and SVR based models demonstrates its higher accuracy. Further, the optimization algorithms for inverse modelling, the performances of Multiverse Optimizer (MVO), Grey wolf optimization (GWO) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) are investigated. It is observed that the combination of EAS-LSTM and MVO provides better results in comparison to other surrogate simulation optimization (SSO) models.

AB Alpine environments are particularly vulnerable to climatic warming, and long term observations suggest a shift of snow-influenced river discharge towards earlier periods of the year. For water resources management, the seasonal patterns of discharge in alpine areas are particularly relevant, as the shift to lower flows in summer and autumn combined with increased water demand could lead to water shortage in downstream catchments. The storage of groundwater in alpine catchments could significantly modulate how changing climatic conditions influence the annual streamflow regime. However, groundwater storage and its buffering capacity in alpine areas remain poorly understood. Moreover, studies on how climate change will impact water resources in alpine areas rarely consider the influence of geology.
   In this paper, catchment geology is used as a basis for the classification of future summer low flows behavior of several alpine catchments in Switzerland. Based on the analysis of the relationship between low-flow indicators and geology, the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits is explored. We show that quaternary deposits play a critical role in the seasonal storage of groundwater, which can contribute to rivers during lowflow periods. Three climate change simulations based on extreme RCP 8.5 scenarios are fed into a conceptual hydrological model to illustrate the buffering role of groundwater. Past and future low flows normalized by mean past and future streamflows appear correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits. These results highlight that catchments with high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to precipitation will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge. Therefore, we propose two indicators that can be used to anticipate the response of future summers low flows in alpine areas to climate change: the current winter low flows and the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits of the catchments.

AB To improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model, this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research, thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents' landscape decisions in an urban environment. The stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots - varying in size, turf variety, and aesthetic qualities. The discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement, and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice. We prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logic model estimated from the stated preference data, and then coupled it with a water resources model of the Okanagan Basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning System. We then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio-hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand. The results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site-specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs, along with a small subsidy, could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption. Under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment, the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the Okanagan, but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents. This study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use.

AB Climate change, land-use change and in-stream river engineering affect trends in river discharges and river stages, and distinguishing such overlapping contributions is a major challenge in hydrologic time-series analysis. In this study, a systematic investigation of river stages and discharges was carried out for 78 stream gauges of rivers in Germany. We analysed the available times series for trends in flood stages, flood discharges, flood frequency and in stage-discharge relationships over time. with respect to annual maximum discharges and flood frequencies, no significant trends could be identified consistently throughout the study area. Significant discharge trends were identified at a number of stations, however, and tended to be catchment-specific. In contrast, trends in flood stages tended to be gauge-dependent, as stages over time are influenced by changes in local rating curves and thus by local and reach-scale channel modifications. Specific gauge analysis is a suitable tool for analysing such changes. No significant trends in specific stages over time were identified at most of the investigated gauges, generally paralleling the trend-based stage results at the same sites. Nevertheless, we could identify several river gauges with significant decreasing specific-gauge trends (e.g.. Danube at Ingolstadt, Elbe at Magdeburg, Weser at Intschede) and others with significant increasing trends (e.g., Elbe at Dresden, Ems at Greven, Fulda at Grebenau, Leine at Herrenhausen). The identified trends were small compared with trends identified on heavily engineered rivers in the US driven by local changes in the channel (e.g., incision or wing dike groyne construction) or changes on the floodplain (e.g., dike displacement or changing land use in the flood plain). The trends in discharges and stages documented here have contributed to past changes in flood frequency and intensity on German rivers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrologic controls on the interaction between a shallow lake and a groundwater flow system have been determined for a coarse-textured landscape on the Boreal Plains of Canada. Lake-groundwater interactions were studied to provide an understanding of the near-surface hydrologic processes in a sub-humid climate, where annual precipitation is equal to, or less than potential evapotranspiration. This study was initiated to assess potential landscape impact from forestry and energy industrial activity, and future scenarios of climate change expected in the Western Boreal Forest. A 39 ha lake on outwash sediments was studied for two consecutive years. Hydrometric measurements and stable isotopic analyses indicated that evaporation was the dominant hydrologic flux during ice-free months, and was primarily responsible for a 0.2 in decline in lake level during this study. A combination of summer rain and consistent supply of groundwater discharge throughout each year were the dominant sources of water. The near equivalence of precipitation and evaporation, and relative dominance of each of these processes during the hydrologic year, resulted in the formation of a water table mound downgradient of the lake, and its disappearance each year. The presence of these humid (mound) and and (complete disappearance) phenomena at one location within the same year, reveal the sensitivity of hydrologic systems in this sub-humid region to small variations in climate. The onset and duration of evaporation from the lake surface was a major controlling factor on groundwater exchange, to such a degree that the shallow lakes are thought to be evaporation windows in this landscape, creating sub-surface capture zones that depend on lake size and landscape position. These findings indicate a very dynamic relationship between atmospheric water fluxes and groundwater interaction, which could potentially conceal anthropogenic impacts within natural variability.

AB We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving I I calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non-overlapping I I-year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large-scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefficients of determination of up to R-2 = 0.27, but usually the R-2 values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a significant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of simulating streamflow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the verification period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with overparameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the verification period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform significantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aquatic ecological rehabilitation is increasingly attracting considerable public and research attention. An effective method that requires less data and expertise would help in the assessment of rehabilitation potential and in the monitoring of rehabilitation activities as complicated theories and excessive data requirements on assemblage information make many current assessment models expensive and limit their wide use. This paper presents an assessment model for restoration potential which successfully links hydrologic, physical and chemical habitat factors to fish assemblage attributes drawn from monitoring datasets on hydrology, water quality and fish assemblages at a total of 144 sites, where 5084 fish were sampled and tested. In this model three newly developed sub-models, integrated habitat index (IHSI), integrated ecological niche breadth (INB) and integrated ecological niche overlap (INO), are established to study spatial heterogeneity of the restoration potential of fish assemblages based on gradient methods of habitat suitability index and ecological niche models. To reduce uncertainties in the model, as many fish species as possible, including important native fish, were selected as dominant species with monitoring occurring over several seasons to comprehensively select key habitat factors. Furthermore, a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was employed prior to a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of the data to avoid the "arc effect" in the selection of key habitat factors. Application of the model to data collected at Jinan City, China proved effective reveals that three lower potential regions that should be targeted in future aquatic ecosystem rehabilitation programs. They were well validated by the distribution of two habitat parameters: river width and transparency. River width positively influenced and transparency negatively influenced fish assemblages. The model can be applied for monitoring the effects of fish assemblage restoration. This has large ramifications for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems and spatial heterogeneity of fish assemblages all over the world. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of chemicals in solution by overland how from agricultural land has the potential to be a significant source of chemical loss where chemicals are applied to the soil surface, as in zero tillage and surface-mulched farming systems. Currently, we lack detailed understanding of the transfer mechanism between the soil solution and overland flow, particularly under field conditions. A model of solute transfer from soil solution to overland flow was developed. The model is based on the hypothesis that a solute is initially distributed uniformly throughout the soil pore space in a thin layer at the soil surface. A fundamental assumption of the model is that at the time runoff commences, any solute at the soil surface that could be transported into the soil with the infiltrating water will already have been convected away from the area of potential exchange. Solute remaining at the soil surface is therefore not subject to further infiltration and may be approximated as a layer of tracer on a plane impermeable surface. The model fitted experimental data very well in all but one trial. The model in its present form focuses on the exchange of solute between the soil solution and surface water after the commencement of runoff. Future model development requires the relationship between the mass transfer parameters of the model and the time to runoff: to be defined. This would enable the model to be used for extrapolation beyond the specific experimental results of this study. The close agreement between experimental results and model simulations shows that the simple transfer equation proposed in this study has promise for estimating solute loss to surface runoff.

AB Haloxylon ammodendron is one of the major dominant woody species in Central Asian desert, and the size dependent water use pattern of this species significantly affects the functioning of the local ecosystem. Here, we investigated the water-use responses of H. ammodendron to groundwater depth from seedling to mature tree in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China. Three sites were selected along a groundwater depth gradient, with 4.6 m, 7.4 m, and 11.0 m, respectively. Based on basal stem diameter, H. ammodendron plants were grouped into three development stages, namely seedling, sapling, and mature tree. Hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) and oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) were measured for xylem water at different basal stem diameter (BSD) values, soil water in different soil layers, and groundwater. The water sources used by the seedlings, saplings, and mature trees were determined by applying the IsoSource model. The relationship between delta O-18 value of xylem for H. ammodendron and basal stem diameter reflected changes in the water source from upper soil water to deeper soil water as H. ammodendron grows. With the decline in groundwater depth, seedlings decreased their water uptake depth, whereas saplings increased at mid depth but decreased at maximum depth. However, mature trees constantly increased their water absorption depth across sites. Tree height, crown width, and BSD presented a decreasing trend as the groundwater depth declined. The above study promotes the evaluation of the impact of groundwater retrogression on H. ammodendron population in its natural habitat.

AB Groundwater evapotranspiration (GE) is an essential component for regional water balance in areas with shallow water table. When the depth to water table (DWT) falls due to pumping in a well field, GE will decrease, which also influence the redistribution of water table. A mathematical model of steady radial flow is developed to investigate the problem. The well field is simplified by a circular area with uniformly distributed pumpage. Relationship between GE and DWT is described with a commonly used linear formula when DWT is less than an extinction depth. Analytical solutions for three cases with or without a zero-GE zone (no GE occurs in the zone) are obtained. The redistributions of GE and water table are controlled by three lumped parameters. The analytical model is applied in a case study of the Ordos well field in China, with 55 pumping wells. It sufficiently agrees with a numerical model based on MODFLOW except in the vicinity of individual wells where cones of water table falling appear. The result of GE is not influenced by the discrepancy in water table due to existing of the zero-GE zone. Runge-Kutta solutions of using nonlinear GE formulas are presented and also applied in the case study to compare with the analytical model. They predict almost the same water table distribution and similar redistribution patterns of GE. The analytical model can be applied to determine the protection zone of well fields located in places without strong heterogeneous in topography and initial water table. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years soft computing methods are being increasingly used to model complex hydrologic processes. These methods can simulate the real life processes without prior knowledge of the exact relationship between their components. The principal aim of this paper is perform hydrological regionalization based on soft computing concepts in the southern strip of the Caspian Sea basin, north of Iran. The basin with an area of 42,400 sq. km has been affected by severe floods in recent years that caused damages to human life and properties. Although some 61 hydrometric stations and 31 weather stations with 44 years of observed data (1961-2005) are operated in the study area, previous flood studies in this region have been hampered by insufficient and/or reliable observed rainfall-runoff records. In order to investigate the homogeneity (h) of catchments and overcome incompatibility that may occur on boundaries of cluster groups, a fuzzy expert system (FES) approach is used which incorporates physical and climatic characteristics, as well as flood seasonality and geographic location. Genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to adjust parameters of FES and optimize the system. In order to achieve the objective, a MATLAB programming code was developed which considers the heterogeneity criteria of less than I (H < 1) as the satisfying criteria. The adopted approach was found superior to the conventional hydrologic regionalization methods in the region because it employs greater number of homogeneity parameters and produces lower values of heterogeneity criteria.

AB Within the past few decades, Minnesota's land use change has responded rapidly to prevailing economic growth conditions, resulting in hydrologic characteristic alterations of the landscape and shifting the hydrologic balance of its watersheds. Regionalization using mean annual and mean monthly streamflow values was used to delineate hydrologic regimes with distinct temporal flow variations. By identifying hydrologic relationships between watersheds through an initial regionalization of mean annual streamflow time-series data, hydrologic regimes, each composed of watersheds with common hydrologic controlling variables, were identified. This paper summarizes how by applying factor analysis techniques to complete a statewide regionalization for Minnesota, hydrologic regimes were identified, each with a specific hydrologic signature: varying between three and four runoff periods of different durations. A geographic information system database was established to display the results of the regionalization and to identify hydrologic regime changes between the 1936-2008, 1936-1980, and 1950-2008 analysis intervals. Results delineated five hydrologic regimes for each of the three analysis periods. By focusing on each specific regime, further analyses were completed to identify significant increasing and decreasing trend characteristics. Review of the temporal variation for each regime using Kendall Tau trend analyses suggests that although variation in annual precipitation has an important influence on hydrologic variability, land cover and management proved to be a more direct controlling agent. Understanding the consequences of anthropogenic land use change on hydrologic processes within each defined regime should be the focus of future analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall-runoff relationships at the event scale were studied in a small sub-Mediterranean research catchment in the central Spanish Pyrenees (Arnas catchment, 2.84 km(2) in area). The strong non-linearity between these two variables evidenced the high variability in the hydrological response of the catchment, linked to seasonal dynamics of the water reserves. Both the magnitude of rainfall events and the baseflow at the start of each event had a pronounced influence on the hydrological response, while the rainfall intensity played a major role in terms of discharge increment. Water-table data suggested a strong topographic control on saturation patterns and showed high seasonal dynamics, with a dry period during summer and a wet period during winter. The transition between dry and wet periods was characterised by high spatial variability in the water-table pattern. An analysis of streamflow and water-table response during a series of four events revealed the complexity of the hydrological processes operating within the catchment. During dry conditions, infiltration excess over localised areas is likely to be the main runoff process, whereas during wet conditions both saturated excess runoff and subsurface flow are most likely to be the dominant runoff processes. During the wetting-up period, the hydrological response was variable, depending mainly on the depth of the water table before the event and rainfall depth and intensity. In these conditions, the interpretation of runoff processes is not straightforward and requires further research. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water isotopes (delta D, delta O-18) as well as electrical conductivity were employed to clarify hydrological relationships among precipitation, stream water, and groundwater in the Douliou Hills (DLH) of Taiwan. They are also used to evaluate the importance of groundwater recharge sources in the proximal fan of Choshui-chi alluvial plain (CSAP), which is connected to the eastern extreme of the DLH. Results indicate that the most important source of groundwater in the DLH comes from summer precipitation. In most cases the summer precipitation recharges stream water via base flow. Based on delta O-18 and EC values, groundwater in the proximal fan of the CSAP can be divided into groundwater from 5 wells nearby the DLH (near-DHL group) and groundwater from 6 wells nearby the Choshui Stream (near-CS group). Semi-quantitative results calculated by ternary end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) for delta O-18 and electrical conductivity values indicate that for the near-DLH group, precipitation in the CSAP contributes 40-50% of water to the proximal-fan groundwater while DLH groundwater donates 20-55% and Choshui Stream water, 0-29%. Precipitation in the CSAP is the most important recharge source. DLH groundwater's contribution is more notable in deep groundwater and Choshui Stream water's contribution decreases with distance from the Choshui Stream. For the near-CS group, anthropogenic pollution adds ions to the groundwater restricting the effectiveness of the ternary EMMA approach. This study provides new insights into groundwater recharge in the CSAP. It should be applicable to future studies of hill-and-plains' water connectivity in other regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; WATER-CONTENT; ACCURACY
AB Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection travel time data were used to estimate changes in soil water content under a range of soil saturation conditions throughout the growing season at a California winery. Data were collected during three data acquisition campaigns over an 80 by 180 m area using 100 MHz surface GPR antennas. GPR reflections were associated with a thin, low permeability clay layer located 0.8-1.3 m below the ground surface that was identified from borehole information and mapped across the study area. Field infiltration tests and neutron probe logs suggest that the thin clay layer inhibited vertical water flow, and was coincident with high volumetric water content (VWC) values. The GPR reflection two-way travel time and the depth of the reflector at the borehole locations were used to calculate an average dielectric constant for soils above the reflector. A site-specific relationship between the dielectric constant and VWC was then used to estimate the depth-averaged VWC of the soils above the reflector. Compared to average VWC measurements from calibrated neutron probe logs over the same depth interval, the average VWC estimates obtained from GPR reflections had an RMS error of 0.018 m(3) m(-3). These results suggested that the two-way travel time to a GPR reflection associated with a geological surface could be used under natural conditions to obtain estimates of average water content when borehole control is available and the reflection strength is sufficient. The GPR reflection method therefore, has potential for monitoring soil water content over large areas and under variable hydrological conditions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Transient modelling of water-table variation in a floodplain wetland,

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; HYDROLOGY; BALANCE; FLOW
AB This paper describes the application of a transient three-dimensional groundwater model to simulate water flux through a floodplain wetland, Narborough Bog, in Central England. The results of a programme of water-table monitoring are summarised to indicate the extent of water-table fluctuation, and experiments to determine hydraulic flow parameters are detailed. Hydraulic conductivities of deposits are highly variable; observations were in the range 1.16 x 10(-3)-4.63 x 10(-2) cm s(-1) for herbaceous peat, 1.16 10(-4) cm s(-1) for wood peat, and 9.14 x 10(-6)-3.36 x 10(-8) cm s(-1) for silty clay. A three-layer groundwater model of the wetland is developed using MODFLOW from these initial values, and with stratigraphic data obtained by hand augering. The model is calibrated using data for two periods of recharge from precipitation by adjusting specific yield and vertical hydraulic conductivity within prescribed limits. The accuracy of the model is then assessed by comparing daily model predictions of water-table response to potential evapotranspiration at specific monitoring points. Model results demonstrate the importance of variation in hydraulic characteristics with depth in wetlands, thus emphasizing the dependence of water-table response upon water-table position, and preceding moisture conditions. The resulting water-table configuration reflects the balance between horizontal and lateral water flow through the wetland, and its relationship to river stage. The success of the stratigraphic representation is considered and its general applicability evaluated. Finally, the use of the calibrated model for local hydrological management is considered, and the effects on the wetland water budget of varying river stage by specified amounts are examined.

AB Knowledge of atmospheric chloride deposition is a prerequisite for applying the chloride mass balance (CMB) method for groundwater recharge estimation. Compared to bare areas, vegetated areas can significantly enhance chloride deposition rates as the vegetation canopy provides a large surface onto which water droplets and aerosols settle. Although generally acknowledged, this effect has often been ignored in practical applications of the CMB method. This paper studies the variability of chloride deposition in a coastal basin characterised by a heterogeneous vegetation cover, and the implications of this variability for groundwater recharge estimation using observation wells in the saturated zone. The study area is located on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. The theory of the CMB method for groundwater recharge estimation is revised in the context of highly spatially variable chloride deposition. A GIS-based approach is developed for mapping the chloride deposition accounting for distance from the coast, distribution of vegetation and edge effects; the latter implying a lower chloride deposition inside a vegetation stand than at the edge. In order to quantify the significance of one or several of these effects for recharge estimation, different chloride deposition maps and corresponding recharge estimates are derived. Compared with the reference scenario that accounts for all effects, neglecting the coastal effect results in a 33-36% higher average recharge estimate, whereas neglecting the vegetation effect results in a 17-22% lower average recharge estimate. The latter numbers are likely to represent a lower bound of the impact of neglecting the vegetation effect. A critical factor for accurate determination of the influence of vegetation appears to be the edge effect, albeit its importance is subject to significant uncertainty that warrants further monitoring.

   drainage systems in landscapes vulnerable to sea level rise
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

AB The vulnerability of coastal landscapes to sea level rise is compounded by the existence of extensive artificial drainage networks initially built to lower water tables for agriculture, forestry, and human settlements. These drainage networks are found in landscapes with little topographic relief where channel flow is characterized by bi-directional movement across multiple time-scales and related to precipitation, wind, and tidal patterns. The current configuration of many artificial drainage networks exacerbates impacts associated with sea Level rise such as salt-intrusion and increased flooding. This suggests that in the short-term, drainage networks might be managed to mitigate sea level rise related impacts. The challenge, however, is that hydrologic processes in regions where channel flow direction is weakly related to slope and topography require extensive parameterization for numerical models which is Limited where network size is on the order of a hundred or more kilometers in total length. Here we present an application of graph theoretic algorithms to efficiently investigate network properties relevant to the management of a large artificial drainage system in coastal North Carolina, USA. We created a digital network model representing the observation network topology and four types of drainage features (canal, collector and field ditches, and streams). We applied between-ness-centrality concepts (using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm) to determine major hydrologic flowpaths based off of hydraulic resistance. Following this, we identified sub-networks that could be managed independently using a community structure and modularity approach. Lastly, a betweenness-centrality algorithm was applied to identify major shoreline entry points to the network that disproportionately control water movement in and out of the network. We demonstrate that graph theory can be applied to solving management and monitoring problems associated with sea level rise for poorly understood drainage networks in advance of numerical methods.

AB Many uncertainties are involved in flood control operation of a multi-reservoir system and result in risks for the system. Risk analysis for reservoir flood control operation is essential for decision making. Traditional flood control risk analysis only takes flood forecast error as the main risk source, ignoring the influence of dynamic control of flood-limited water level on reservoir initial water level for flood regulation. In this study, the spatial correlation of reservoir initial water level errors and the spatiotemporal correlation of flood forecast errors are identified via copula function. A risk analysis model considering both upstream and downstream is established for multi-objective flood control operation of a complex reservoir system, coupling multi-dimensional uncertainties of reservoir initial water levels, flood forecast errors, reservoir capacity curve errors, reservoir discharge curve errors and river flood routing errors. The impact of multiple risk sources with spatiotemporal correlations on reservoir flood control operation is then evaluated and the competitive tradeoff between flood control risks in upstream and downstream analyzed. The model is applied to a mixed four-reservoir system in Pi River Basin in China. Results indicated that 1) there is a strong correlation between the reservoir initial water level errors in space and also between the flood forecast errors in space and time, which can be effectively described by copula function, and ignoring the correlations will underestimate the flood control risk; 2) the two objective values of upstream and downstream show a clear competitive relationship, and the solution that prefers one objective has low risk marginal benefit, thus choosing a compromise solution can balance risks; 3) coupling the initial water level uncertainty reduces the flood control risk caused by the flood forecast errors to a certain extent, but also lead to the increase of extreme risk loss.

AB Understanding flood event-related risk in an interconnected river-lake system (IRLS) is a prerequisite for developing water resource management strategies and enhancing disaster resilience. Previous flood event-related risk assessments either hardly consider the context in which water diversion encounters flood events or hardly consider the physical process, stochastic analysis and multivariate interactions of flood event characteristics simultaneously, thereby resulting in a less reliable assessment of flood event-related risk. To resolve this limitation, a copula-coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model (CHRAM) is proposed to characterize the physical, multivariate, and stochastic nature of risk, improving the accuracy of risk assessment. In this study, CHRAM is capable of accurately quantifying flood event-related risks (i.e., flood risk and ecological risk) of the Nansi Lake Basin in the flood season under the operation of the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. Our findings revealed that the total flood volume (R-sum) and duration (T-d) of flood events were significantly sensitive characteristic indexes for flood risk and ecological risk. In addition, the security domains of flood risk (R-sum < 35 mm and T-d < 23 d) and ecological risk (R-sum < 50 mm and T-d < 27 d) were determined based on the analysis of the relationship between sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators. The results also showed that the impact of T-d on flood risk, ecological risk and flood-ecological combined risk was 3-14 times greater than the impact of R-sum. The occurrence probability of flood-ecological combined risk was smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk, with the corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11.2%, 36.5%, and 4.7%, respectively. This study extends the current knowledge about risk assessment in IRLS and is beneficial to instruct the management of projects for similar systems.

AB Thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes. Many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river-lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling. The current work presents a first attempt to use a 3D hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river-lake-floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China). The hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements. Simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of Poyang Lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons; however, the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn. It is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring. The thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake, while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels. Statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature, solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of Poyang Lake, whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature. The responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons, producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake. Additionally, the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of Poyang Lake. The findings of this study can support management of Poyang Lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes, by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession.

AB Determining groundwater discharge to streams using dissolved gases is known to be useful over a wide range of streamflow rates but the suitability of dissolved gas methods to determine discharge rates in high gradient mountain streams has not been sufficiently tested, even though headwater streams are critical as ecological habitats and water resources. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of using dissolved gases to determine groundwater discharge rates to high gradient streams by field experiments in a well-characterized, high gradient mountain stream and a literature review. At a reach scale (550 m) we combined stream and groundwater radon activity measurements with an in-stream SF6 tracer test. By means of numerical modeling we determined gas exchange velocities and derived very low groundwater discharge rates (similar to 15% of streamflow). These groundwater discharge rates are below the uncertainty range of physical streamflow measurements and consistent with temperature, specific conductance and streamflow measured at multiple locations along the reach. At a watershed-scale (4 km), we measured CFC-12 and delta O-18 concentrations and determined gas exchange velocities and groundwater discharge rates with the same numerical model. The groundwater discharge rates along the 4 km stream reach were highly variable, but were consistent with the values derived in the detailed study reach. Additionally, we synthesized literature values of gas exchange velocities for different stream gradients which show an empirical relationship that will be valuable in planning future dissolved gas studies on streams with various gradients. In sum, we show that multiple dissolved gas tracers can be used to determine groundwater discharge to high gradient mountain streams from reach to watershed scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The spatio-temporal variability of drought is presented by evaluating homogeneously distributed 250 station records from 1931 to 2010 for 80 years' duration in Turkey. The drought analysis is implemented using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in terms of SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-6, SPI-6As (SPI-6 April to September) and SPI-12. The principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to SPI time series to identify spatial and temporal drought patterns. SPI time series are classified into two groups (1st group: SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-6As; and 2nd group: SPI-6 and SPI-12) according to the similarity in spatial drought patterns. SPI-3 and SPI-12 are selected as representative members of each group for spatio-temporal analysis. A relationship among correlation area (An), correlation coefficient (CC), principle component numbers (FA) and total variances explained (V-exp) are investigated for identifying four well-defined drought vulnerable homogeneous regions over Turkey mainland. Mean percentages of extreme, severe, and moderate drought areas are calculated as 3.13% (2.81%), 3.75% (4.06%) and 7.19% (7.50%) for SPI-3 (SPI-12) based on 80 years in all drought vulnerable regions. Spectral characteristics of drought are also investigated based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. It is observed that while southeastern and western parts of Turkey are more stable due to the highly-correlated variances of spatial patterns; central parts and few pockets in northern areas of Turkey are less stable regions because of the low-correlated variance scores (below 10%). Furthermore, the impact of extreme phases of the ENSO (El Nino/La Nina) on droughts in four drought regions over Turkey is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conductivity of an aquifer is usually difficult to represent in a precise manner due to having both a high degree of spatial variability combined with a scarcity of information. As a result, the conductivity is commonly modeled as a spatial random field, defined by its expected value and a covariance function. This covariance is usually parameterized by fitting a model function to experimental data derived from point measurements of the conductivity.
   In this study, we investigated the two features that are often difficult to discern when using such classic characterization schemes: roughness and connectivity. These two features both share the fact that, based on point measurements of the conductivity alone, they are difficult to discern. It therefore stands to reason that the use of additional data could alleviate this problem.
   To that end, we used the Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD), which is a novel Bayesian tool for the inverse characterization of spatial random fields. MAD is versatile with respect to the used data, it has a modular structure and it does not assume any formal relationship between the target variable, i.e. the log hydraulic conductivity, and the data used for the inversion process, e.g. head measurements, draw-down from pumping tests or breakthrough curves. With respect to the characterization of the aforementioned features, we investigated the impact of several factors, such as different data types on the characterization process.
   Our findings suggest that both roughness and connectivity have only a limited impact on flow predictions, suggesting that the choice of such features is of lesser relevance if one is mainly interested in flow simulations. In case of roughness, this limited sensitivity was also seen for transport predictions if the solute had already travelled some distance. Connectivity however, can be a decisive factor for such simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Major ions, trace elements, and O, H and Sr isotopes have been determined for surface water and groundwater in the Somme catchment (northern France). The present study, using a coupled hydrological and geochemical (stable- and Sr isotopes) approach, focuses on the interactions between ground- and surface water. Stable water isotopes (5180, 82 H) show that all waters have a purely local origin from precipitation, without significant evaporation or water-rock interaction, as all points plot close to the general meteoric-water line. Water chemistry in the different catchments shows large variations in major-element contents. Plotting Na+ vs. Cl- contents and Mg2+, NO3-, K+, SO42-, Sr2+ concentrations reveals: (a) slight variations in groundwater composition, (b) agricultural input into surface waters, and (c) some similarities between ground- and surface waters suggesting the former to be responsible for the chemical signature of the dissolved river load. Strontium-isotope ratios measured in groundwater range from 0.70769 to 0.70808, clearly higher than that of Chalk matrix water (0.707337). Variations of Sr-isotope signatures in groundwater from the Chalk aquifer are significant and help identifying different groundwater bodies. The different signatures in groundwater are better explained by matrix heterogeneity, which can present lateral facies variations, than by a strong anthropogenic influence. The Sr-isotope compositional range in surface waters is very wide, varying from 0.70775 to 0.70816 and defining a trend towards a more radiogenic Sr-isotope signature with high Sr contents and high Mg/Sr ratios. The relationship between Sr-87/Sr-86 and the Mg/Sr ratios allows different end-members to be defined: the rivers are influenced by anthropogenic disturbance, even during flood periods, and river water has geochemical characteristics very similar to those of groundwater, indicating a strong influence from groundwater feeding the rivers.

AB Runoff volumes from held plots can be quite variable. but the reasons for this variability are not completely understood. Such variations can be important for understanding the hydrologic system, and for evaluating the effectiveness of infiltration, runoff and sediment models. In this study, we investigated the sources of variability among 40 replications in a previously reported experiment on fallow plots located on a claypan soil in Missouri, USA. A numerical model was calibrated using data from the experiment and from other published data on the variability of soil properties. The results describe qualitatively the trend in the observed relationship between the coefficient of variation (CV) and mean runoff volume per event, as well as the lack of stability in time of the relative differences in runoff volume among plots. Quantitatively, approximately 50% of the observed coefficients of variation among the replicated plots were explained by the spatial variability of K,, surface storage, and the depth to claypan. The remaining 50% may be due to the variability in rainfall among plots, measurement error in runoff, the fact that some published rather than site specific information was used in the analyses, and simplifications introduced in the modeling process. Our results suggested that changes in the relative differences in runoff volumes between plots during the season might be explained by the modification of the spatial distribution of K, and surface storage which occurs during tillage. The introduction of these sources of variability in the model formulation produced a realistic description of the variance of the observed values of runoff volume, as well as a relatively clear delineation between the explained and unexplained variability. The results may also serve as an index of model performance in predicting observed data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The early evolution of karst aquifers depends on a manifold of initial and boundary conditions such as geological setting, hydrologic properties of the initial aquifer, and petrologic properties of the rock. When all water entering at various inputs into the aquifer has equal chemical composition with respect to the system H2O-CO2-CaCO3 early evolution under conditions of constant head exhibits breakthrough (BT) behaviour. If the chemical compositions of the input waters are different, deep in the aquifer where the saturated solutions mix renewed aggressiveness occurs, and additional dissolutional widening of fractures by mixing corrosion (MC) changes the hydrologic properties of the aquifer. To study the impact of MC on the evolution of karst we have modelled a simple karst aquifer consisting of a confined limestone bed, with two symmetrically located inputs at constant head and open flow conditions along the entire width at base level. To calculate dissolutional widening of the fractures the well-known dissolution kinetics of limestone was used, which is linear up to 90% of saturation with respect to calcite and then switches to a nonlinear fourth order rate law. First, two extremes are modelled: (a) Both inputs receive aggressive water of equal chemical composition with [Ca2+] = 0.75[Ca2+](eq). In this case two channels migrate downstream with that from one input more competitive and reaching base level first, causing BT. (b) Water at both inputs is saturated with respect to calcite, but in equilibrium with different partial pressures Of CO2. Therefore, dissolution widening can occur only where these waters mix. A central channel starts to grow extending down-head until base level is reached. Flow rates through the aquifer first rise and become constant after the channel has reached base level. In the following runs these two extreme modes of karstification are combined. The waters entering have different chemical compositions and therefore different equilibrium concentrations [Ca2+](eq). This allows MC to be active. They are also undersaturated with the inflowing solutions at concentration [Ca2+](in) = f[Ca2+](eq) where f is the ratio of saturation. In comparison to the extreme limit (a) the action of MC now creates permeability where the solutions mix and diverts the evolution of conduits into this region. Finally one conduit reaches base level and causes BT. This behaviour is found for f = 0.7, 0.9, and 0.96.
   For solutions more close to equilibrium with respect to calcite (f = 0.99, 0.9925, and 0.995) BT behaviour is replaced by a steady increase in flow rates. In the early state as in the case of MC controlled evolution (case b) a central channel not connected to the input is created by MC and reaches base level. After this event, further increase in flow rates is caused by slow dissolutional widening by the slightly undersaturated input solutions flowing towards the central channel. Comparison of the various model aquifers at termination of the computer runs reveals significant differences in their properties caused solely by changes of the hydrochemical boundary conditions.

AB The lack of in-situ hydrological observations, especially in remote and developing areas, is one of the main challenges of drought monitoring. This paper proposes a novel drought index, the Standardized River Stage Index (SRSI), based on data retrieved from satellite altimetry missions. The novelties of the SRSI are that it can quantitatively monitor drought of river water deficits at multiple timescales and that it does not require in-situ observations. The Mekong River is used as the case study to demonstrate and validate the SRSI calculated from the multi-mission satellite altimetry data (Envisat and Jason-2/3). The log-logistic distribution is best fitted for SRSI calculation for the highest goodness-of-fit for river stages for the Mekong River. The comparison with the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) from the in-situ discharge observations shows that the SRSI can reasonably capture the drought of river water deficit. It is effective in identifying the timing and intensity of severe drought events, such as the 2019 Thailand drought. The SRSI is also compared with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index and the GRACE Drought Index in revealing drought features such that the river water deficit of Mekong River has time lags of 2 to 3 months for precipitation deficits and water storage deficits. Hence, the SRSI is more suitable for monitoring drought of river water deficit, because it directly links to the streamflow via physical stage-discharge relationship. Overall, the SRSI provides an effective indicator of drought of river water deficit when in-situ observations are unavailable. It can serve in the real-time drought early warning in remote and developing areas.

AB Groundwater recharge in fractured karstic aquifers is particularly difficult to quantify due to the rock mass's heterogeneity and complexity that include preferential flow paths along karst conduits. The present study's major goals were to assess how the changes in lithology, as well as the fractured karst systems, influence the flow mechanism in the unsaturated zone, and to define the spatial variation of the groundwater recharge at local scale. The study area is located within the fractured carbonate Western Mountain aquifer (Yarkon-Taninim), west of the city of Jerusalem at the Ein Karem (EK) production well field. Field monitoring included groundwater level observations in nine locations in the study area during years 1990-2014. The measured groundwater level series were analyzed with the aid of one-dimensional, dual permeability numerical model of water flow in variably saturated fractured-porous media, which was calibrated and used to estimate groundwater recharge at nine locations. The recharge values exhibit significant spatial and temporal variation with mean and standard deviation values of 216 and 113 mm/year, respectively. Based on simulations, relationships were established between precipitation and groundwater recharge in each of the nine studied sites and compared with similar ones obtained in earlier regional studies. Simulations show that fast and slow flow paths conditions also influence annual cumulative groundwater recharge dynamic. In areas where fast flow paths exist, most of the groundwater recharge occurs during the rainy season (60-80% from the total recharge for the tested years), while in locations with slow flow path conditions the recharge rate stays relatively constant with a close to linear pattern and continues during summer.

AB Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves are widely used in flood risk management because they provide an easy link between the characteristics of a rainfall event and the probability of its occurrence. Weather radars provide distributed rainfall estimates with high spatial and temporal resolutions and overcome the scarce representativeness of point-based rainfall for regions characterized by large gradients in rainfall climatology. This work explores the use of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) for the identification of IDF curves over a region with steep climatic transitions (Israel) using a unique radar data record (23 yr) and combined physical and empirical adjustment of the radar data. IDF relationships were derived by fitting a generalized extreme value distribution to the annual maximum series for durations of 20 min, 1 h and 4 h. Arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean climates were explored using 14 study cases. IDF curves derived from the study rain gauges were compared to those derived from radar and from nearby rain gauges characterized by similar climatology, taking into account the uncertainty linked with the fitting technique. Radar annual maxima and IDF curves were generally overestimated but in 70% of the cases (60% for a 100 yr return period), they lay within the rain gauge IDF confidence intervals. Overestimation tended to increase with return period, and this effect was enhanced in arid climates. This was mainly associated with radar estimation uncertainty, even if other effects, such as rain gauge temporal resolution, cannot be neglected. Climatological classification remained meaningful for the analysis of rainfall extremes and radar was able to discern climatology from rainfall frequency analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID SOIL-WATER DYNAMICS; MOJAVE DESERT; VARIABILITY; SHRUB
AB This work proposes an ecohydrology-based approach to study the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in dry areas. It is largely based on a concept that in dry areas, vegetation community can be divided into two different groups, shallow- and deep-rooted vegetation, with the growing-season average of root-zone soil water saturation tending to be at its optimum value for the growth of deep-rooted vegetation. The concept is supported by data sets collected from different dry areas. Analytical results of soil water dynamics developed in previous studies are adapted here for investigating the impact of climate change. Because the conceptual model allows deep-zone soil-water saturation, averaged over growing seasons, to remain fixed during different climate conditions, we can construct a relationship among groundwater recharge, the coverage of deep-rooted vegetation, and climate. As an illustrative example, we apply the developed approach to the Yucca Mountain area. Our estimated recharge value under the current climate and the vegetation coverage is generally consistent with results estimated from other methods or observed from the site. We also evaluate how the recharge will change under several assumed future climate scenarios. The results show that both groundwater recharge and deep-rooted vegetation coverage increase with decreasing rainfall frequency (for a given amount of annual rainfall), with increasing average rainfall depth per rainfall event (for a fixed frequency) and with increasing frequency (for a fixed rainfall depth per rainfall event). The latter indicates a relatively large degree of buffering effects of vegetation on changes in groundwater recharge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well documented that capacitance-based soil moisture sensor measurements are particularly influenced by particle size distribution, density, salinity, and temperature of a soil, in addition to its moisture content. Moreover, the equations provided by manufacturers of soil moisture sensors are often only applicable to a limited number of soil types, thus yielding significant errors when compared with gravimetric measurements for observations in real soils. This limitation makes site-specific calibrations of such sensors necessary. Consequently, development of a general equation provides the possibility to derive the needed parameters from information such as soil type or particle size distribution. This paper describes the development of a general equation for the Campbell Scientific CS616 Water Content Reflectometers using data from sensors installed throughout the Goulburn River experimental catchment. It is subsequently tested using monitoring sites in the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network, which were not part of the original development; both monitoring networks are located in south-eastern Australia. Previously developed equations for temperature correction and soil moisture estimation using the Campbell Scientific CS615 Water Content Reflectometer are adapted to the new CS616 sensor. Moreover, relationships between readily available soil properties and the parameters of the general equations are derived. It is shown that the general equations developed here can be applied to data collected in the field using only information on the soil particle size distribution with an RMSE of around 6% m(3)/m(3) (<1% m(3)/m(3) under laboratory conditions; which is a significant improvement in comparison to 14% m(3)/m(3) when using the manufacturer's equations).

The lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the required accuracy is a major impediment for such applications. This study investigates the feasibility of downscaling satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution. This study was undertaken in the semi-arid Goulbum River Catchment, located in south-eastern Australia. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Enhanced 9 km (L3SMP-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) 25 km gridded (SMOS CATDS L3 SM 3-DAY) radiometric products were compared with in-situ soil moisture observations and a regression tree model was developed for downscaling based on thermal inertia theory. Observations from a long-term soil moisture monitoring network were employed to develop a regression tree model between the diurnal temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture for soils with different clay content and vegetation greenness. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures were used to estimate the soil moisture at high spatial resolution by disaggregating the satellite soil moisture products through the regression model. The downscaled SMAP-Enhanced 9 km and SMOS 25 km gridded soil moisture products showed unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSE) of 0.07 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, against the in-situ data. These ubRMSEs include errors caused by measuring instrument and the scale mismatch between downscaled products and in-situ data. An RMSE of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) was observed when comparing the downscaled soil moisture against the passive airborne L-band retrievals. The findings here auger well for the use of satellite remote sensing for the assessment of high resolution soil moisture.

AB Hydraulic functions of soils may differ depending on the different measuring methods used. The performance of three different methods for measuring soil-hydraulic properties of a heterogeneous field were evaluated. The experiments were conducted using three different sizes of undisturbed soil cores collected systematically along a 31 m long transect of a well drained sandy loam soil having three soil horizons (Ap, 0-0.25 m; C1, 0.25-0.55 m; C2, 0.55-1.00 m). The laboratory studies involved: (1) detailed unsteady drainage-flux experiments performed on fifteen columns of 1 m length and 0.3 m diameter; (2) combined crust test and hot air methods applied to thirty columns of 0.2 m length and 0.2 m diameter and to a subset of sixty cylinders of 0.1 m length and 0.045 m diameter, respectively, taken from the Ap horizon; and (3) desorption experiments carried out on a total of one hundred eighty cores of 0.051 m length and 0.05 m diameter collected evenly from the three horizons, Mean soil hydraulic properties were inferred from experimental data characterizing either selected depths or the soil profile as a whole. The results revealed considerable differences among estimated mean soil properties as obtained with different measuring techniques. Although the application of scaling theory substantially reduced variation in the measured pressure heads (h) and conductivities (K), the results revealed that scaling parameters determined from soil pressure head were not identical to scaling factors determined from hydraulic conductivity. The results also show that K scaling factors in general were much more variable than h scaling factors, and that the observed variability in scaling factors also depend upon the measurement technique used.

AB The driving factors of water exchange in the Yangtze-Poyang river-lake system (YPRLS) which is vital to the water resource management of YPRLS still remain unclear. In this study, the impacts of three major factors on the water exchange in the YPRLS from 1989 to 2016 were distinguished. Our results revealed that the catchment inflow into Poyang Lake (CIPL) dominates the variations in Q(h) (the discharge of Poyang Lake's outflow), contributing nearly 100 % of the annual variation and evenly 120 % of the seasonal variations. The forcing of the Yangtze River, including the effect of operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and effects of other Yangtze-related factors in addition to it, stably explains approximately over 76 % of the annual and seasonal variations in Z(h) (water level at the junction of the river and lake). The sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal Q(h) to the CIPL and that of the seasonal Z(h) to the forcing of the Yangtze River, varying with the seasons, are 0.63 and 0.41, respectively. Furthermore, the CIPL-induced and the Yangtze-induced frequency of the backflow from the river to the lake (BRL) is 26 times and 7 times, respectively. Specifically, the frequency of BRL events with backflow discharge of <3000 m(3)/s and >3000 m(3)/s is mainly affected by the CIPL and the forcing of the Yangtze River, respectively. The variations in the seasonal Z(h) are speculated to be influenced by the water regime and the stage-discharge relationships, which may explain the stable dominate of the forcing of the Yangtze River on the seasonal Z(h), and may affect the timing of autumn drought in the Poyang Lake. Our results may help to capture the main causes of complex hydrological changes in the YPRLS.

TI The unscented Kalman filter (UKF)-based algorithm for regional frequency

   filter; Dynamic state estimation; Extreme rainfall events

AB In regional frequency analysis, extreme rainfall patterns in a nonstationary environment are characterized by the time-dependent regional growth curves, in which location and scale parameters are the weighted values of at-site estimates from the sites within a homogeneous group. However, under different climate change scenarios, the monotonic trend assumption about these two regional growth curve parameters can be questionable. To consider the non-monotonic change behavior of extreme rainfall events in regional frequency analysis, an unscented Kalman filter-based regional approach is proposed for location, scale and shape parameters estimation using the scaled datasets within a homogeneous group at different temporal states or periods. To consider nonlinear relationships for the parameters in state transition function (STF) and measurement function (MF) between sequential temporal periods, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied for the filtering of state estimates in the proposed methodology. To avoid the degradation of UKF performance which is caused by inaccurate state and measurement noise covariances, a Monte Carlo simulation-based procedure is proposed for their noise estimations. To reduce the parameter uncertainty associated with the distribution fitting process and consider the spatial correlations amongst the stations within a homogeneous group, balancing resamples are used to improve state estimates in regional frequency analysis. This UKF-based approach addresses the non-monotonic change behavior of the extreme rainfall events in a nonstationary environment, and fills the gap of considering spatial correlation for dynamic state estimation in regional frequency analysis. This proposed methodology was successfully applied to three homogeneous groups in Canada, and goodness-of-fit tests were used to validate the parameter estimates and prove the superiority over traditional covariate approach for providing effective rainfall quantile estimates in the upper tail of the distribution.

AB Septic systems are often cited as an important contributor to rural watershed nutrient loads despite limited quantitative evidence regarding their actual contribution. The measurement of the artificial sweetener acesulfame in streams to quantify upstream inputs of septic system effluent has recently been proposed. However, there is a lack of detailed study on this application, including temporal variability, influence of dry and wet weather conditions, and disentangling the contributions from functioning versus failing septic systems. Further, this approach has not been applied to assess the relative contribution of septic systems to nutrient watershed loads. Here we conducted artificial sweetener and nutrient stream measurements in three watersheds with no other identified sources of acesulfame (e.g., no municipal wastewater treatment plants, landfills) over a 10-month period. Measured acesulfame stream concentrations varied from below detection (< 2 ng/L) to 87 ng/L with acesulfame stream loads revealing that septic system inputs to streams vary considerably between low and high stream discharge conditions. Positive acesulfame concentration-stream discharge relationships for all three watersheds reveal the potentially important contributions from failing septic systems and surface flow pathways (i.e., effluent breakout from septic drain field) under high discharge conditions. Further they indicate that, contrary to conventional thinking, sampling under low discharge conditions may underestimate septic effluent delivery to streams. The estimated contribution of septic systems to measured total phosphorus stream loads on a given sampling day varied widely (< 1-36%, considering attenuation between the septic tank and stream), but typically septic system contributions to nitrate stream loads were low (< 2%). The findings provide guidance on the application of this new tool for managing septic effluent contributions of nutrients and other wastewater contaminants to rural watershed streams.

AB Eight years of daily rainfall data from WegenerNet were analyzed by comparison with data from Austrian national weather stations. WegenerNet includes 153 ground level weather stations in an area of about 15 km x 20 km in the Feldbach region in southeast Austria. Rainfall has been measured by tipping bucket gauges at 150 stations of the network since the beginning of 2007. Since rain gauge measurements are considered close to true rainfall, there are increasing needs for WegenerNet data for the validation of rainfall data products such as remote sensing based estimates or model outputs. Serving these needs, this paper aims at providing a clearer interpretation on WegenerNet rainfall data for users in hydro meteorological communities.
   Five clusters - a cluster consists of one national weather station and its four closest WegenerNet stations - allowed us close comparison of datasets between the stations. Linear regression analysis and error estimation with statistical indices were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the WegenerNet daily rainfall data. It was found that rainfall data between the stations show good linear relationships with an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.97, while WegenerNet sensors tend to underestimate rainfall according to the regression slope (0.87). For the five clusters investigated, the bias and relative bias were -0.97 mm d(-1) and -11.5% on average (except data from new sensors). The average of bias and relative bias, however, could be reduced by about 80% through a simple linear regression-slope correction, with the assumption that the underestimation in WegenerNet data was caused by systematic errors. The results from the study have been employed to improve WegenerNet data for user applications so that a new version of the data (v5) is now available at the WegenerNet data portal (www.wegenernet.org).

AB Soil preferential flow (PF) has important effects on rainfall infiltration, moisture distribution, and hydrological and ecological process; but it is very difficult to monitor and characterize on a slope. In this paper, soil water and soil temperature at 20, 40, 60, 80 cm depths in six positions were simultaneously monitored at high frequency to confirm the occurrence of PF at a typical Benggang slope underlain granite residual deposits, and to determine the interaction of soil moisture distribution and Benggang erosion. In the presence of PF, the soil temperature was first (half to one hour) governed by the rainwater temperature, then (more than one hour) governed by the upper soil temperature; in the absence of PF (only matrix flow, MF), the soil temperature was initially governed by the upper soil temperature, then by the rainwater temperature. The results confirmed the water replacement phenomenon in MF, thus it can be distinguished from PF by additional temperature monitoring. It indicates that high frequency moisture and temperature monitoring can determine the occurrence of PF and reveal the soil water movement. The distribution of soil water content and PF on the different positions of the slope showed that a higher frequency of PF resulted in a higher variation of average of water content. The frequency of PF at the lower position can be three times as that of the upper position, therefore, the variation coefficient of soil water content increased from 4.67% to 12.68% at the upper position to 8.18%-33.12% at the lower position, where the Benggang erosion (soil collapse) was more possible. The results suggest strong relationships between PF, soil water variation, and collapse activation near the Benggang wall. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall extremes exhibit temporal clustering at multi-decadal time scales, most probably as a result of persistence in large scale atmospheric circulation over such time scales. Analysis of a 107-year time series of 10 min rainfall intensities since 1898 at Uccle, Brussels, has shown that the 1960s and the 1990-2000s had a higher frequency and amplitude of high rainfall intensities at various time scales in the range between 10 min and 1 month. These periods are alternated with periods of lower rainfall quantiles, e.g. in the 1970-1980s.
   The climate oscillations have to be accounted for when calculating extreme rainfall statistics, e.g. IDE relationships and synthetic storms commonly applied on the basis of urban drainage systems design. The importance of this and how this climate oscillation accounting can be done is demonstrated in this paper based on the Uccle rainfall data. Old and new IDE statistics, based on, respectively, shorter and longer rainfall series have been compared. It is shown that recent increases in rainfall statistics should not necessarily be attributed to climate change but may also be due to a different positioning of the periods with available rainfall data in comparison with the climate oscillation high and low periods. Comparison of old IDE statistics based on the period 1967-1993 versus new statistics based on the full period 1898-2007 or the period 1970-2007 covering one climate oscillation cycle, shows 7.5% difference in extreme rainfall quantiles for return periods higher than 1 year. Adjustment with +7.5% is required to remove the bias in the old rainfall design values in comparison with the long-term statistics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture in the upper layer plays an important role in arid desert ecosystems. Dew as an additional source of fresh water, may have a positive impact upon the ecosystems in arid and semi-arid zones. Measurements on dew formation amount and duration were carried out in the whole October of 2008 at different condensing surface types (bare dune sands, physical soil crusts and biological soil crusts) associated with different inter-space positions between plants, and at the area under plant canopy in a revegetation-stabilized arid desert ecosystem in Shapotou area, China. The results indicated that there was a positive linear correlation between dew amounts and relative humidity, while mean temperature was negatively linearly related to dew amounts and no significant relationship was found between dew amounts and wind speed. Clear and foggy mornings were characterized by higher dew amounts and longer dew duration, whereas less dew was recorded during cloudy and especially windy mornings. Crusts, especially the biological soil crusts, obtained significantly higher amounts of dew than that of bare moving sand dunes. It was more difficult for dew to condense under the canopy of the plants than on the bare sand dunes. At the first stage of ecological engineering projects, dew can renew the moisture losing through the evaporation of soil and transpiration of leaves, and thus can supply important source of water for xerophytic shrubs. The higher dew amount at the inter-space of re-vegetated plants is an important driving factor for the growth of microorganisms and spore plants, which further accelerate the formation of biological soil crusts and stabilization of moving sand dunes. The presence of biological soil crusts, in turn, helps to facilitate the formation of dew. Therefore, a mutual enhanced effect exists between dew and artificially revegetation ecosystems.

AB Complex spatial and temporal flow patterns in alluvia( plain rivers can be caused by variation in groundwater surface-water exchange, channel planform, and climatic variation. Such complexity poses a challenge for developing relationships between runoff, groundwater recharge, and river flow, for predicting effects of water resource developments, and for understanding hydrologic effects on ecological processes. The Selwyn River of New Zealand is one such hydrologically complex river. To begin to understand the spatio-temporal flow patterns of the Selwyn River, we used linear and logistic models to reconstruct a 22-yr record of river flow across the alluvial Canterbury Plains. The 60 km - long model domain encompasses perennial, ephemeral, and intermittent reaches embedded within Larger effluent and influent sections. Flow at 18 cross-sections distributed along the river mainstem was modelled as a function of flow at stage recorders Located at each end of the domain with flow interpolated between cross-sections to generate a flow record continuous in space. Data from 38-months of flow-gauging at the cross-sections was used to calibrate model parameters. The reconstructed record indicates that white the central section of the river was dry during most of the 38-month observation period, it was not uncommon during the preceding two decades for the river to flow along its entire course for several months consecutively. The recent dry period may be part of a Longer trend: the mean annual simulated Length of dry river channel has increased by 0.6 km yr(-1) over the last two decades. Output metrics from the model can increase our understanding of hydrologic control of ecological processes in alluvial rivers. We provide several examples of potential model applications to ecological studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The variability of hydrologically induced mobilization of nitrate during sequences of hydrological events in different seasons was studied through high-frequency measurements of streamwater nitrate concentrations accompanied by a detailed hydro-meteorological monitoring system. The study was carried out in 2006, within the 42 km(2) forested Padez watershed in the southwestern part of Slovenia, which is characterized by distinctive flushing, an almost torrential hydrological regime influenced by impermeable flysch geological. settings. More than 15 recorded hydrographs which, in the hydrological and biogeochemical sense, differed substantially, disclosed a highly variable but at the same time a strong linkage between hydrological and biogeochemical controls of nitrate exports from the spatial perspective of a watershed. During most of the hydrographs, with the exception of early spring rainfall. events, a positive relationship between the nitrate concentration and discharge was observed with peak nitrate concentrations having a time delay in the order of a few hours after the hydrograph peaks. Peak nitrate concentrations in periods of rainfall events span from 3.5 mg/l-N in late spring to 14 mg/l-N in the case of the autumn hydrograph. However, the dilution effect as a consequence of high event water contributions was observed in certain events. The role of specific hydrological events on the nitrate mobilization proved to be important as the size of the accumulated nitrate pool available for mobilization was large throughout most of the hydrographs. The biogeochemical. environment of the forest soils presumably drastically alters the size of the available nitrate pool, at the studied watershed and, together with the specific hydrological conditions, shifts the watershed from the flush-limited state in the late spring, summer and autumn to the source-limited state in winter and early spring.

AB Water table response to rainfall was investigated at six sites in the Upper, Middle and Lower Chalk of southern England. Daily time series of rainfall and borehole water level were cross-corretated to investigate seasonal variations in groundwater-level response times, based on periods of 3-month duration. The time tags (in days) yielding significant correlations were compared with the average unsaturated zone thickness during each 3-month period. In general, for cases when the unsaturated zone was greater than 18 m thick, the time tag for a significant water-level response increased rapidly once the depth to the water table exceeded a critical value, which varied from site to site. For shallower water tables, a linear relationship between the depth to the water table and the water-level response time was evident. The observed variations in response time can only be partially accounted for using a diffusive model for propagation through the unsaturated matrix, suggesting that some fissure flow was occurring. The majority of rapid responses were observed during the winter/spring recharge period, when the unsaturated zone is thinnest and the unsaturated zone moisture content is highest, and were more likely to occur when the rainfall intensity exceeded 5 mm/day. At some sites, a very rapid response within 24 h of rainfall was observed in addition to the longer term responses even when the unsaturated zone was up to 64 m thick. This response was generally associated with the autumn period. The results of the cross-correlation analysis provide statistical support for the presence of fissure flow and for the contribution of multiple pathways through the unsaturated zone to groundwater recharge.

AB A geostatistical approach is presented for the inclusion of seismic tomography data and sonic log data into the estimation of hydraulic conductivity. The procedure accounts for the errors in seismic tomography inversion and for the correlation of such errors, The proposed methodology consists of two steps: (1) the cross-variogram inference is carried out using only the data at the wellbore (both hydraulic and seismic); (2) a co-kriging procedure takes the cross-well data into account to interpolate between boreholes. No postulated a-priori relationship is needed. In order to illustrate the methodology a synthetic data set is generated on the basis of evidence from published case studies and simplified physical considerations. The numerical experiments show that the choice of the excitation frequency is critical. A trade-off exists between the need for a high-resolution survey (asking for higher freqencies) and the need for a good correlation between hydraulic conductivity and seismic properties (asking for frequencies below the squirt frequency of the medium). In the simulation using seismic data with the best excitation frequency (1 kHz in this case), the mean squared error of the hydraulic conductivity estimate is two-thirds lower than using hydraulic data alone. It is important to note also that only a part of the interwell region is adequately sampled by the tomographic experiment, Such a region can be readily identified by calculating the energy of the quasi-null space, through singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix, In planning this type of experiments, it is necessary to carefully verify case by case whether the adopted range of high frequencies does not prevent the seismic energy from propagating effectively from sources to receivers.

AB The selection of future climate change scenarios may have issues in representing the full spectrum of climate projections in glacierized mountain regions, where glaciers play an important role in hydrology. Thus, the effect of glacier storage change must be considered in the selection approaches. Here, a multi-perspective approach was proposed to select climate models from CMIP6 database, considering the full spectrum of future climate change and effects of glaciers on hydrology. This approach combines the envelope-based approach (EA), past performance approach (PPA), and additional criteria to incorporate water-energy balance and glacier storage change based on the Turc-Budyko theory. The approach physically diagnoses GCMs by investigating their effects on glacier storage change compared to reference climate and observed mass balance data. A step-wise shortlisting and selection of appropriate climate models for the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) was made under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585, based on (a) range of projected changes in mean values for four extreme future projections (cold-dry, cold-wet, warm-dry, and warm-wet), (b) range of projected changes in climatic extremes, (c) representation of water-energy balance and storage change, and (d) skill in representing historical climate. The future projections indicate temperature and precipitation increase by 1.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C and 7 +/- 5%, 3.3 +/- 1.3 degrees C and 10 +/- 6%, and 6.3 +/- 2.6 degrees C and 22 +/- 13% under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 in 2071-2100 compared to 1985-2014, respectively. The glacier area, volume, and length are projected to decrease by 22-33%, 51-63%, and 13-22% under ensembled scenarios of full spectrum at selected glaciers. The proposed multi-perspective approach is advantageous in shortlisting a limited number of climate models, representing the full range of possible future climatic conditions, to assess the full range of expected impacts of climate changes on indigenous glacio-hydrology. Such selection eventually reduces the glacio-hydrological simulation task.

AB Heuristic or intuitive rules based on experience may-not be efficient when applied to the management of water supply systems that contain both surface and subsurface storage. In particular, rules that assign subsurface storage the role of a backup to surface storage do not recognize the different capabilities of surface and subsurface: storage. We demonstrate how to incorporate the different capabilities of surface and subsurface storage in appropriately cautious long-term control of conjunctive-use systems. We also demonstrate how these results may be used to evaluate the benefit of adding groundwater supplies to an existing surface water supply system.

AB The spatial distribution of rainfall in a watershed has an important impact on flood warning and forecasting. In this study, we used the K-means++ clustering method to classify the spatial characteristics of typhoon rainfall events in the Songtao reservoir watershed in the central region of Hainan Island, based on 63 typhoon rainfall event data from 1990 to 2020. Then, the relationship between the synoptic fields, spatial patterns of rainfall, and flood characteristics was explained based on tropical cyclone best-track datasets, atmospheric reanalysis data, and inflow flood series. The results showed that there are three types of cumulative rainfall patterns in the Songtao Reservoir watershed. The heavy rainfall region of pattern 1 is concentrated east of the watershed, whereas the heavy rainfall regions of pattern 2 are mainly concentrated southwest and east of the watersheds of many mountains. The heavy rainfall region of pattern 3, with a southwest-northeast orientation, is located on the west side of the watershed. The spatial coefficient of variation and index of rainfall location clearly distinguished among these three patterns. The composite analysis of typhoon tracks, wind fields, and moisture flux fields can be used to interpret the formation mechanism of these spatial patterns of rainfall events in the watershed. The spatial patterns of cumulative rainfall for each type were dominated by one or two types of hourly spatial rainfall patterns. Flood events resulting from cumulative rainfall patterns 1 and 2 have similar flood behavior metrics. Large floods in the watershed show an obvious seasonal variation, and the corresponding rainfall events mostly show the spatial characteristics of the cumulative rainfall pattern 3. These results can enhance the understanding of the linkage between typhoons, mountainous watershed rainfall, and flooding processes.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) and its components of soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T), as key variables for the water-energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, are widely used in hydrological and agricultural applications. The land surface temperature based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model can provide high accuracy E, T and ET, which are spatio-temporally discontinuous, whereas the spatio-temporally continuous daily ET is more helpful in water resources management. In this study, to improve the continuity of estimates from the TSEB model, we developed a new combined model coupling the TSEB model and deep neural network (DNN) (TSEB_DNN). First, spatio-temporally continuous reference data was prepared based on the remote sensing and meteorological data as input, and E from soil and T from vegetation were obtained from the TSEB model under clear-sky condition as outputs. Then, the DNN was trained under clear-sky condition to obtain the relationship between E and T estimates from TSEB and reference data. Finally, the trained DNN was driven by the spatio-temporally continuous reference data to obtain spatio-temporally continuous E, T and ET. Compared with the ET estimates from the original TSEB model, the continuity was significantly improved for the TSEB_DNN model. The TSEB_DNN model was well consistent with the in situ measurements and had the overall correlation coefficient (R), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and bias values of 0.88, 0.88 mm d(-1), and 0.37 mm d(-1), respectively. The ratio of T/ET estimates from the TSEB_DNN model had high accuracy against in situ measurements with RMSE and bias values of 7.49% and -2.22%, respectively. The combined model and the maps of E, T and ET will help improve water resource management.

AB Accurate gridded precipitation products with both finer tempo-spatial resolutions are critical for various scientific communities (e.g., hydrology, meteorology, climatology, and agriculture). Downscaling on coarse satellite-based rainfall estimates is an optimal approach to obtain such datasets. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrivals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) data provides the "best" satellite-based precipitation estimates at half-hourly/0.1 degrees scales, while its spatial resolution is still coarse for certain hydro-meteorology research. To acquire hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on IMERG, there are two great challenges: (1) limited rainfall-related environmental variables (0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees, hourly) used to downscale the IMERG data; and (2) far few rainfall pixels used for regressing traditional relationships between precipitation and environmental variables. In this case, most traditional or commonly-used regression/empirical models and the state-of-art machine learning algorithms are not suitable to cater these requirements. Therefore, we proposed a new strategy to obtain hourly downscaled precipitation estimates based on IMERG called Geographically Moving Window Weight Disaggregation Analysis (GMWWDA). Additionally, we explored multiple cloud properties, including cloud effective radius (CER), cloud top height (CTH), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud optical thickness (COT), as covariates to downscale IMERG using GMWWDA method, and concluded as follows: (1) the downscaled results (0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees hourly) based on the above mentioned cloud properties outperformed the original IMERG data; (2) the downscaled results based on CER performed better than those based on CTH, CTT and COT, respectively; (3) the accuracy of satellite-based precipitation products pose significant effects on those of the downscaled results. This study provides a great potential solution for generating satellite-based precipitation dataset with finer spatio-temporal resolutions.

AB This paper focuses on water allocation in an irrigation district considering water rights transaction. The relationship between the reservoir authority and the sub-area managers is explored based on a novel Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium model. In this framework, the reservoir authority has higher priority in allocating initial water rights to Sancha town, Danjing and Xinmin villages; after get the decisions from the reservoir authority, the sub-area managers decide water distribution to multi-crops planting areas and water rights transaction with the promise of Nash-Cournot equilibrium, then the reservoir authority can modify his decision by Stackelberg strategic interaction. To obtain the optimal irrigation strategy, fuzzy goal programming and genetic algorithm methods are applied. In this context, a Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium solution can be obtained. The proposed model is applied to Sancha irrigation area, and the results show that more available water can be distributed in Sancha town while guaranteeing the equity among the sub-areas in this irrigation district; more water was utilized for wheat and oilseed rape than paddy and bean, which matched the fact that wheat and oilseed rape grow in quarters with relatively less rainfall inflows. A changeable and uncertain environment, regarding inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient, take potential challenges to agricultural irrigation process. Hence, to cope with the challenges, cope with the future uncertainty and offer more information on the adjustment of agricultural irrigation patterns, scenario technique is applied by changing the three parameters inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient respectively. Finally, to highlight the superiority of the proposed model, a comparative analysis is conducted in a situation without considering the water market, which verifies the importance and effectiveness of water rights transaction.

ID TIBETAN PLATEAU; ELEVATION CHANGES; EXPANSION; DECADES; BASIN
AB The intensity and form of changes in closed lakes, upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the Third Pole (TP) differ based on their drainage mode. Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ( > 1 km(2)) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km(2), 7,378.82 km(2), and 3,382.29 km(2), respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.

AB From the perspective of engineering geology, loess has long been considered as a homogeneous and porous material. It is commonly believed that water penetrates loess via pores and in some cases causing mass movements. However, several researchers have expressed doubts about this mechanism as a cause of slope failures in loess, and moreover the actual hydrological processes operating in loess deposits and their effect on slope failures have not been fully investigated. Here we present the results of an electrical resistivity survey of the Heifangtai loess terrace in northwestern China, designed to characterize the hydrological processes in loess slopes and their relationship with slope failures. The Heifangtai loess terrace is located on the fourth terrace of the Yellow River and consists of 57-m-thickness of aeolian loess. 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to monitor the movement of ground water before and after irrigation and rainfall events and the evolution of a sink hole in the toe of the landslide deposits. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Based on the 2D ERT results, the depth of infiltration into the thick unsaturated loess is not more than 5 m in the profile at the top of the landslide. (2) Electrical resistivity decreased as a result of water infiltration through sinkholes, and this process can increase the soil water content and induce soil liquefaction which can eventually result in land sliding. (3) Landslide deposits block the groundwater drainage channels through the loess, which results in the concentration of water in the toe of the landslide. Consequently, groundwater together with rainfall, triggers the failure of sinkholes or cracks, which may induce a continuing process of new slope failures at the sites of past landslide.

AB This study explores the performance of soil moisture data from the global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA interim reanalysis datasets using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale numerical weather model coupled with the Noah Land surface model for hydrological applications. For evaluating the performance of WRF for soil moisture estimation, three domains are taken into account. The domain with best performance is used for estimating the soil moisture deficit (SMD). Further, several approaches are presented in this study to evaluate the efficiency of WRF simulated soil moisture for SMD estimation and compared against Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) downscaled and non-downscaled soil moisture. In this study, the first approach is based on the empirical relationship between WRF soil moisture and the SMD on a continuous time series basis, while the second approach is focused on the vegetation cover impact on SMD retrieval, depicted in terms of growing and non-growing seasons. The linear growing and non-growing seasonal model in combination performs well with the NSE = 0.79, RMSE = 0.011 m; Bias = 0.24 m, in comparison to linear model (NSE = 0.70, RMSE = 0.013 m; Bias = 0.01 m). The performance obtained using WRF soil moisture is comparable to SMOS level 2 product but lower than the downscaled SMOS datasets. The results indicate that methodologies could be useful for modelers working in the field of soil moisture information system and SMD estimation at a catchment scale. The study could be useful for ungauged basins that pose a challenge to hydrological modeling due to unavailability of datasets for proper model calibration and validation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ice processes that occur in steep (gravel bed) channels are completely different from those occurring in mild-gradient rivers. As such, the impact of ice on water level and discharge in steep streams is different than what is usually found documented for large channels. Whereas in large mild rivers, the development of a surface ice cover generates a nominal increase in stage in the order of 30%, in steep channels, the formation of series of ice dams caused the water level to rise by up to 500%. The increase in stage caused a maximum estimated ice-induced discharge depression of 50%. The ice-dam stage may represent the highest level of the year whereas the freezeup discharge may temporarily drop to its annual minimum. Ice formations significantly alter local channel hydraulic conditions (bed elevations, cross-sectional area, riffle-pool sequences, etc.) and both stage and discharge vary drastically in a short time.
   'Dynamic' ice processes (particularly the formation of ice dams) in steep channels depend on morphology and are driven by heat fluxes into and out of the system. Based on the authors observations of many steep channels over many winters, the inter-relationships (synchronicity) between air temperature fall (and rise), ice dam formation (and breaching), water level rise (and drop) and discharge depletion (and increase) are documented here. This paper presents air and water temperatures, water stages, discharges, and ice processes taking place on an hourly basis in four channels of increasing Strahler order. The data and hydro-crologic continuum analyses presented significantly improve our understanding and hence our ability to interpret freezeup water level signals. The paper also discusses how hydrographers may use this understanding and additional data to provide better estimates of discharge in steep channels at freezeup. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Land evapotranspiration (ET) is a key factor in the hydrological cycle and is particularly sensitive to climate change. In the past few decades, the Pan-Arctic region has witnessed a strong warming trend, causing substantial changes in ground surface conditions. However, it remains poorly understood how ET varies across such a region. Here, we investigated the spatial-temporal changes in ET over six large Pan-Arctic river basins using corrected ET estimates from GLEAM and ERA5-Land during 1981-2020. The 40-year mean annual ET in the Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie River basins were approximately 366 mm.yr(-1), 271 mm.yr(-1), 228 mm.yr(-1), 239 mm.yr(-1), 278 mm.yr(-1), and 295 mm.yr(-1), respectively. Climatologically, permafrost-dominated basins tend to have lower ET than those with less permafrost. Temporally, the annual ET in permafrost-dominated basins has increased faster than that in less permafrost-developed basins over the past four decades. This increase is particularly prominent in the Kolyma River basin (completely covered by permafrost), where the significant trend in ET (7.5 mm.decade(-1), p < 0.001) is the highest among the six basins. Further analyses show that intensified permafrost thawing is likely the key factor contributing to increased ET in permafrost-dominated basins, as seen from the positive relationship between the thickening in the active layer (ALT) and the change in ET. Under an amplified warming background, ET in permafrost-dominated regions is expected to continue to increase. The results reported in this study improve our understanding of the variations in ET and the associated mechanisms in the changing Arctic.

AB Residue cover is widely used in the Northeastern China Black Soil Region for soil erosion control due to the large annual production of crop residues. Quantitative evaluations of the residue cover effects on preventing soil loss and on the cumulative infiltration amount are thus desirable. Herein, rainfall simulation experiments were conducted using simulators and soil flumes to study the effects of residue cover on soil erosion and infiltration under various rainfall events, Laboratory experiments were designed utilizing five levels of residue cover (bare, 15%, 35%, 55% and 75%), four rainfall intensities (30 mm/h, 60 mm/h, 90 mm/h and 120 mm/h), two soil moistures (dry and wet run) and a fixed slope of 7%.
   The results indicated that residue cover strongly affects runoff, soil loss and infiltration. Equations for predicting the soil loss ratio and infiltration ratio (the ratio of residue cover soil to bare soil) are herein proposed based on nonlinear curve regression. An empirical approach presented as the infiltration ratios multiplied Philip's equation derived from bare soil was established for estimating the cumulative infiltration amounts under various residue covers. The equation was demonstrated to be suitable for infiltration prediction for black soil by the root mean square error value and 1:1 line method. In addition, the relationship between the residue cover and biomass of corn residues was provided in order to enable accurate measurement of the residue coverage. These derived equations could be used for soil erosion and infiltration prediction under no-till and residue cover management conditions in the black soil region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes the development and application of a new methodology to simulate riparian and wetland evapotranspiration (ET) in groundwater models. Traditional approaches for modeling ET are based on quasi-linear relationship between ET flux rate and hydraulic head (groundwater elevation). The approach presented here uses multiple non-linear, segmented flux curves that reflect the ecophysiology of the plant species in these systems. Five plant functional groups (PFGs) based on water tolerance ranges and rooting depths are used to elucidate the interactive processes of plant transpiration with groundwater conditions. ET flux rate curves set the extinction and saturation extinction depths and define the group's ET flux rate as a function of water table depth relative to the ground surface. The calculated ET loss from a riparian or wetland system is dependent on the contributing area of each plant functional subgroup present and water table conditions. The new methodology requires a fractional coverage for each of the PFGs present within the groundwater model cell and allows for more accurate assignment of land surface elevations. Model results for a case-study show significant differences in predicted ET and subsequent depth to groundwater between the new and the traditional approaches. The development of physiologically based transpiration curves combined with the traditional linear curve for bare soil/open water results in more accurate determinations of riparian ET and improved basin scale water budgets. The use of PFGs in combination with the new RIP-ET package provides an explicit link between groundwater and riparian/wetland habitat conditions and offers an opportunity to better manage and restore riparian and wetland systems.

AB Because of the occurrence of episodic blooms of toxic dinoflagellates, eutrophication of the Seine Bight is a subject of growing concern. In order to better understand the relationships between these processes and human activity in the Seine watershed, two models have been used in connection:
   A model describing nutrient (N, P, Si) transfer processes at the scale of the whole Seine Basin (RIVERSTRAHLER [Billen, G., Gamier, J., Ficht, A., Cun, C., 2001. Modelling the response of water quality in the Seine River Estuary in response to human activity in the watershed over the last 50 years. Estuaries 24, 977-993]), allowing human activity (agricultural practices, waterscape management, urban wastewater management, etc.) to be related to fluxes delivered to the sea.
   The models are validated by their ability to reproduce observed trends of interannual variations of nutrients delivered by the Seine during the last 50 years, as well as the response of the marine system in terms of diatoms and dinoflagellate development, for which data are available from 1976 to 1984 for the former and from 1987 to 1997 for the latter. The results show clearly that dry years, where silica inputs show a deficit with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus, are those where summer blooms of dinoflagellates are particularly pronounced.
   Various scenarios of human activity in the watershed are simulated by the two models, including a reconstitution of the 'pristine' state, a historical state corresponding to the situation at the end of the 18th century, as well as several scenarios corresponding to the present situation with alternative policies of wastewater nitrogen and/or phosphorus treatment.

AB The freshwater lens on small islands may easily be overexploited or polluted due to dense development combined with improper management. On small carbonate islands complexities in fresh groundwater distribution are most commonly driven by geologic heterogeneities and their attendant impact on permeability and effective recharge patterns. Siliciclastic islands (composed primarily of quartz sand and other silica-based minerals) have been less well studied, and fewer common patterns of lens development have emerged. On some siliciclastic islands correlations between geology and lens geometries are weak; on these islands the freshwater lens geometry may be largely determined by how vegetation and terrain elevation affect recharge. Other factors such as unequal sea level on opposite sides of an island and transient variability (natural island migration and climate variability) may also be locally significant. Two barrier islands in the northeast Gulf of Mexico fall into this category of siliciclastic islands. Relationships between lens morphology, geology, vegetation, terrain, and sea level and transient effects are documented on St George Island and Dog Island, FL. Patterns of fresh groundwater occurrence are deduced with electrical and electromagnetic geophysical methods. Although isolated cores show geologic layering that could potentially control freshwater lens development, ground penetrating radar and seismic surveys show no evidence of semi-continuous subhorizontal layering. Inferred lens thickness and geometry suggests that site geology plays a relatively minor role as a cause of complexity in lens formation. Lens geometry does appear to be related to terrain and vegetation variability, and further complicated by the continuous reforming of these islands by coastal processes and human development.

AB Soil water potential (SWP) gradients control water and energy fluxes in the Soil - Plant - Atmosphere Contin-uum. Exploring the spatial - temporal variability of SWP at the hillslope scale is an essential step towards developing ecohydrological models. In this study, SWP monitoring was carried out on two contrasting, alpine, humid forested hillslopes (i.e., coniferous and broadleaf forests) at three depths (10, 50, and 100 cm). The effects of static (soil properties and topography) and dynamic (precipitation dynamics and soil wetness conditions) factors on SWP dynamics and variability were investigated based on statistical methods, temporal stability, and variance decomposition analysis. The results showed that the SWP in the soil - root zone (10 and 50 cm depths) in the broadleaf forest exhibited higher variability and lower temporal stability than in the coniferous forest, likely because of the stronger evapotranspiration and more variable soil hydraulic conductivity. The relatively high SWP variability in the deeper soil layer (100 cm depth) of both forested hillslopes was due to the frequent lateral/preferential flow. Furthermore, topographic factors (i.e., distance of hillslope to stream and slope) and soil properties (clay and rock fragment contents) regulated the spatial patterns in SWP and influenced repre-sentative site selection in the coniferous and broadleaf forests, respectively. Decomposition of the spatial vari-ance showed that the time-invariant component was the dominant contributor to the total spatial variance. An exponentially increasing relationship between the time-invariant component and mean SWP and a concave-up parabolic shape between the contribution of the temporal anomalies and mean SWP were observed. Our re-sults provide an improved understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in terms of SWP in forested hillslopes.

AB Recession analysis of -dQ/dt similar to Q is popularly used for determining catchment storage-discharge relationship, estimating the aquifer hydraulic properties, and predicting low flow processes. However, there are uncertainties arising from the numerical approximation of -dQ/dt by the finite difference (Delta Q/Delta t) for individual recession and the fitting cloud-like data of -dQ/dt similar to Q for many recession events in a catchment. In this study, we proposed an improved variable time step increment method (IVTS) to minimize the effects of the noisy observations on estimating -dQ/dt, and a fitting method in terms of the binning-average of -dQ/dt similar to Q data points to determine the basin synthetic recession parameters. The proposed methods are validated by using numerical generation of recessions with different noises and recession behaviors and the observed hydrographs from twenty catchments in Huai River Basin in China. The results from our proposed method are compared with those from the other popularly used methods. The IVTS method is proven to be robust for approximation of -dQ/dt, which can significantly reduce errors of the estimated -dQ/dt and the recession slope (b). Combining with the IVTS method, the fitting method in terms of the binning average by splitting range of -dQ/dt, instead of Q, could overcome the shortage of traditional recession analysis methods that underestimate the recession slope. Our study indicates that the more accurate and reliable calculation of -dQ/dt similar to Q data and estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters could increase the objectivity in interpretation of recession behaviors and accuracy in perdition of low flow processes.

AB Tile drainage systems are pervasive in the Central U.S., significantly altering the hydrologic system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of tile drainage systems on streamflow. A physically based coupled hydrologic model was applied to a 45 km(2) agricultural Iowa watershed. Tile drainage was incorporated though an equivalent porous medium approach, calibrated though numerical experimentation. Experimental results indicated that a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity of the equivalent medium layer was needed to achieve agreement in total outflow with an explicit numerical representation of a tiled system. Watershed scale analysis derived the tile drainage contribution to stream flow (Q(T/)Q) from a numerical tracer driven analysis of instream surface water. During precipitation events tile drainage represented 30% of stream flow, whereas during intervals between precipitations events, 61% of stream flow originated from the tile system. A division of event and non-event periods produced strong correlations between Qr/Q and drainage area, positive for events, and negative for non-events. The addition of precipitation into the system acted to saturate near surface soils, increase lateral soil water movement, and dilute the relatively stable instream tile flow. Increased intensity precipitation translated the QT/Q. relationship downward in a consistent manner. In non-event durations, flat upland areas contributed large contributions of tile flow, diluted by larger groundwater (non-tile) contribution to stream flow in the downstream steeper portion of the watershed. Study results provide new insights on the spatiotemporal response of tile drainage to precipitation and contributions of tile drainage to streamflow at a watershed scale, with results having important implications for nitrate transport. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Groundwater is being now seriously considered as heat sources for space heating and cooling in Korea. This study evaluated groundwater temperature data obtained from 266 Korean national groundwater monitoring stations. Spatial distribution of the groundwater temperatures is mainly affected by geographical latitude, air temperature, and local topographic elevations. The distribution pattern for the groundwater temperatures is most similar to that of the air temperature. Annual variations of the groundwater temperatures were classified into four main patterns. The P (periodic) type representing periodic annual variation was mainly found in shallow groundwaters; (62.5%). Most peculiar is F (flat) type, in which the groundwater temperatures showed nearly no variation, and was mostly observed in deep wells (47.9%). Water levels are seemingly related to the classifications. Water levels of P or WP (weak periodic) types were shallowest white those of F type were deepest. Magnitude of annual temperature variation was within 8 degrees C for 76.6% of the shallow wells white 97.1% account for the variation within 8 degrees C in the deep wells. The highest groundwater temperatures mostly occurred in the coldest months (November-February) and the lowest temperatures in March-June, immediately before the hottest months (July-August). A simple exponential relationship between the amplitude and the phase difference with respect to the air temperature was found, which indicates propagation of the air temperature mainly due to conduction. Considering stability of groundwater temperatures, F type in bedrock aquifers appeared most suitable for the heat pumps in respect to efficient system design and maintenance. For practical application of the groundwater heat pumps, detailed investigation of hydrogeologic conditions and potential environmental changes is required. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB A knowledge of the evolution of isotopic composition of air masses humidity and precipitation in the Western Cordilleras of the Central Andes is still incomplete. This study contributes to a better understanding of the factors that control the delta O-18 and delta H-2 contents in precipitation water in the north of Chile, above 2000 m a.s.l.. This paper deals with: (1) the relevant effects and processes that control the spatial (longitude, latitude and altitude) distribution of stable isotope contents of precipitation events in northern Chile, (2) the influence of local meteorological variables: temperature, precipitation and relative humidity on the delta O-18 and delta H-2 of precipitation, and (3) the estimation of these meteorological and isotopic variables at specific sites. To achieve these objectives, the relationships between geospatial and meteorological values are identified and analysed, followed by the estimation with empirical models. These estimation models (linear and non-linear) are obtained after examining, validating and calibrating techniques to find the best fit. This results in models for temperature, relative humidity and precipitation for each month of the year. In the same way, three isotopic models are derived from the spatial and meteorological variables (summer, winter and annual). Temperature has been shown to be controlled to a greater extent by altitude and latitude, while relative humidity is by latitude and precipitation in summer is by altitude and latitude. Monthly meteorological variables have been estimated throughout the study area. Precipitation delta O-18 and delta H-2 are controlled mainly by temperature and altitude and to a lesser extent by latitude, longitude and precipitation. In the same way, three isotopic models are derived from the spatial and meteorological variables: summer, winter and annual. This opens a new perspective of precipitation and its isotopic contents, but also allows the calculation of runoff and aquifer recharge and the path for linking future precipitation and aquifer recharge through their isotopic composition.

AB Rigorous analysis of measured isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D) of 556 daily rainwater samples collected at four Indian stations viz., Jammu, Jorhat, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, is done in conjunction with satellite and model derived meteorological and isotopic parameters to discern prominent hydrometeorological processes and factors in four different climatic zones in the Indian subcontinent. A new Indian Meteoric Water Line (IMWL), better representing the different climatic zones, including the semi-arid western India, has been defined: [delta D = (7.6 +/- 0.1) delta O-18 + (8 +/- 1); R-2 = 0.96; P < 0.05; N = 556]. The lower slope of IMWL compared to the Global Meteoric Water Line signifies the role of evaporation from falling rain throughout the Indian subcontinent, though it is surrounded by large marine water body, and bordered by lofty Himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds. This study provides new quantitative insights about various hydrometeorological processes across the Indian subcontinent. Some of the important inferences drawn from this study are: (i) The estimated evaporative losses from falling raindrops for the four stations are [Jammu: Maximum 52% and Minimum 8%; Jorhat: Max 15% and Min 4%; Ahmedabad Min 8% and Hyderabad Max 29% and Min 15%]. (ii) Increased availability of surface waters due to flood in Brahmaputra River and high value (88%) of column averaged RH results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at Jorhat in Northeast. (iii) The high Cloud Liquid Water Content (CLWC) over a longer span of altitude facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapor and results in isotopically depleted rain. (iv) The observed inverse relationship between the evaporative loss from falling raindrop and the column averaged RH confirms that the post condensation kinetic processes are realistically accounted in this study. (v) Validation with measured isotope data of rain shows that the LMDZ-iso modelled rain fails to incorporate evaporative isotopic enrichment and generates negative bias.

AB Agricultural production in arid and semi-arid area faces a global problem of water resources shortage and land salinization. Irrigation and drainage are the important measure to enhance crop yield and control soil salinity. Generally, at field scale only irrigation is optimized to pursue the higher water use efficiency and crop yield, while drainage is difficult to optimize owing to controlled by dynamic groundwater levels. Here, we develop a new collaborative optimization model of irrigation and drainage to improve irrigation water use efficiency and to control soil salinity. The model is formulated by integrating simulation of physical processes of field water - salt balance and a genetic algorithm-based optimization model. The new model is to search optimized irrigation and drainage strategic decision for enhancing field economic benefit with the condition controlling salinity with limited water resources. Then, a case study on optimally allocating irrigation and drainage water to different growth stages of maize field in the Hetao Irrigation District, arid area of northwest China shows enhanced applicability of the developed model. Five groundwater depth levels (1 m, 1.5 m, 2 m, 2.5 m and 3 m) and five groundwater salinity levels (2 g/L, 2.25 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 2.75 g/L and 3 g/L) are provided to show and compare the solutions of the optimal irrigation and drainage water allocation. Results indicate the developed model can supply reasonable field monthly irrigation and drainage decision with considering field hydrology, especially contribution of groundwater to crop water demand and groundwater role to soil salt accumulation. The contrary relationship between system benefit and irrigation water use efficiency was described successfully by the developed model. And compared with traditional single irrigation optimization model, the developed irrigation-drainage collaborative optimization model can enhance drainage function to keep the optimal groundwater levels and improve the system benefit by 0-8%. Overall, the developed model can provide more applicable irrigation water and drainage strategies to the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture.

AB Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture. Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources.

AB The coupled role of organic matter (OM) and microbial activity is widely acknowledged in arsenic (As) biogeochemical cycling in sedimentary environments. However, little is known about OM characteristics particularly the dissolved fraction in the Bengal Delta Plain aquifers - one of the worst As impacted regions in the world. Ongoing investigations in As-rich aquifers in Nadia district (West Bengal, India) indicate presence of arsenite {As(III)} oxidizing bacterial communities in the Grey Sand Aquifers (GSA), but absent in Brown Sand Aquifers (BSA). In this study, we investigate the key differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics and its relationship with differences in elemental concentrations, distribution of biomarkers, and utilization of DOC by in situ microbial communities in BSA and GSA. We demonstrate a new approach using ENVITM C-18 DSK discs to pre-concentrate DOC from large volumes of water, and further extract the OM and separate it into different lipid fractions using the solid phase extraction technique. The aquifers show marked heterogeneity in terms of their DOC characteristics and elemental profiles irrespective of their grey or brown color. DOC indicates variable inputs of terrestrial derived OM sources, and OM derived from decomposition and/or microbial cellular components. DOC in the aquifers consist of predominantly n-alkanoic acids (similar to 80%) followed by n-alkanes and n-alcohols. The GSAs indicate high iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) concentrations, and presence of mature petroleum derived hydrocarbons in DOC. BSA has comparatively lower concentrations of Fe and Mn, and shows absence of mature hydrocarbons in DOC. Experiments in presence of indigenous bacteria from groundwater with DOC lipid extracts as the sole carbon source indicate higher growth in the GSA samples implying preferential use of DOC. The potential availability of DOC in these aquifers can influence the community composition of indigenous heterotrophic microbial flora, which in turn can affect elemental cycles including that of As.

AB The delivery mechanisms of labile nutrients (e.g. NO3, DON and DOC) to streams are Poorly understood. Recent work has quantified the relationship between storm DOC dynamics and the connectedness of catchment units and between pre-storm wetness and transient groundwater NO3 flushing potential. While several studies have shown N and C flushing during storm events as the important mechanism in the export of DOC and DON in small catchments, the actual mechanisms at the hillslope scale have remained equivocal. The difficulty in isolating cause and effect in field studies is made difficult due to the spatial variability of soil properties, the limited ability to detect flow pathways within the soil, and other unknowns. Some hillslopes show preferential flow behavior that may allow transmission of hillslope runoff and labile nutrients with little matrix interaction; others do not. Thus, field studies are only partially useful in equating C and N sources with water flow and transport. This paper presents a new approach to the study of hydrological controls on labile nutrient flushing at the hillslope scale. We present virtual experiments that focus oil quantifying the first-order controls on flow pathways and nutrient transport in hillslopes. We define virtual experiments as numerical experiments with a model driven by collective field intelligence. We present a new distributed model that describes the lateral saturated and vertical unsaturated water flow from hypothetical finite nutrient sources in the upper soil horizons. We describe how depth distributions of transmissivity and drainable porosity, soil depth variability, as well as mass exchange between the Saturated and unsaturated zone influence the mobilization, flushing and release of labile nutrients at the hillslope scale. We argue that this virtual experiment approach may provide a well-founded basis for defining the first-order controls and linkages between hydrology and biogeochemistry at the hillslope scale and perhaps form a basis for predicting flushing and transport of labile nutrients from upland to riparian zones.

AB Three phenomenological power law models for the permeability of porous media are derived from computational experiments with flow through explicit pore spaces. The pore spaces are represented by three-dimensional pore networks in 63 virtual porous media along with 15 physical pore networks. The power laws relate permeability to (i) porosity, (ii) squared mean hydraulic radius of pores, and (iii) their product. Their performance is compared to estimates derived via the Kozeny equation, which also uses the product of porosity with squared mean hydraulic pore radius to estimate permeability. The power laws provide tighter estimates than the Kozeny equation even after adjusting for the extra parameter they each require. The best fit is with the power law based on the Kozeny predictor, that is, the product of porosity with the square of mean hydraulic pore radius.

AB To understand the water, energy, and carbon cycles in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), it is essential to estimate seasonal and inter-annual variations in energy fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET) for alpine meadow ecosystems. The multiyear (2014-2019) energy fluxes and ET, for a typical alpine meadow at Arou station (northeastern TP), and their environmental and biophysical controls were evaluated using the eddy covariance method in this study. Latent heat flux (LE) was the dominant component of energy consumption during the growing season, whereas sensible heat flux (H) dominated energy partitioning during the non-growing season. H showed the opposite trend to LE, while the seasonal variation of soil heat flux (G) was small. The daily ET was primarily controlled by the available energy on the seasonal scale. Soil water content (SWC) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) displayed secondary effects on ET during the non-growing and growing seasons, respectively. The inter-annual ET was relatively stable, ranging from 562.6 to 661.9 mm (coefficient of variation; CV = 7.4 %); this was slightly higher than the annual precipitation despite large variations in inter-annual precipitation (CV = 19.9 %) and was most likely due to snow and frozen ground melting. The cumulative ET in the growing season was about 77 % of the annual ET. There was a nonlinear increase in the daily Priestley-Taylor coefficient (alpha = ET/ETeq, where ETeq is the equilibrium evaporation) with an increase in bulk surface conductance (g(c)), which was insensitive to increases in g(c) that exceeded 15 mm s(-1). There was a good relationship between gc and NDVI. This study provides insights into the driving mechanisms of long-term variations in the energy partitioning and biophysical controls on ET in alpine meadow ecosystems.

AB Water stress can cause the structural and physiological changes of plants to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. CO2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance in a mixed plantation during a 4-year period. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) was obtained by the Shuttleworth-Wallace model. Evapotranspiration (ET) versus PET was used to determine the plant water stress index (PWSI). The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of PWSI on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE). The relationship between PWSI and soil water content in sunny and cloudy skies was examined. Mean seasonal PWSI values varied substantially among years. The average annual value of PWSI was 0.49 +/- 0.07. PWSI was strongly correlated with vapor pressure deficit, illustrating that the moisture limitation through high evaporative demand was more remarkable than water supply limitation. Water stress can substantially reduce canopy conductance and leaf area index, and hence decreasing photosynthesis. Water stress suppressed GPP while having little influence on ecosystem respiration, resulting in the increase of net carbon uptake. NEP decreased as a reaction to water stress when PWSI was more than 0.4, whereas WUE was enhanced under moderate and severe water stress (PWSI > 0.6). Compared to NEP, the difference of ET between cloudy and sunny sky conditions was more evident at the same PWSI value. Therefore, cloudy sky conditions were beneficial to enhancing WUE. Water stress restricted the mixed plantation in the period of spring-early summer. At the annual scale, the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress. The PWSI approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in forest ecosystems.

AB Understanding and managing impacts from mining on groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) and other groundwater users requires development of defensible science supported by adequate field data. This usually leads to the creation of predictive models and analysis of the likely impacts of mining and their accompanying uncertainties. The identification, monitoring and management of impacts on GDEs are often a key component of mine approvals, which need to consider and attempt to minimise the risks that negative impacts may arise. Here we examine a case study where approval for a large mining project in Australia (Carmichael Coal Mine) was challenged in court on the basis that it may result in more extensive impacts on a GDE (Doongmabulla Springs) of high ecological and cultural significance than predicted by the proponent. We show that throughout the environmental assessment and approval process, significant data gaps and scientific uncertainties remained unresolved. Evidence shows that the assumed conceptual hydrogeological model for the springs could be incorrect, and that at least one alternative conceptualisation (that the springs are dependent on a deep fault) is consistent with the available field data. Assumptions made about changes to spring flow as a consequence of mine-induced drawdown also appear problematic, with significant implications for the spring-fed wetlands. Despite the large scale of the project, it appears that critical scientific data required to resolve uncertainties and construct robust models of the springs' relationship to the groundwater system were lacking at the time of approval, contributing to uncertainty and conflict. For this reason, we recommend changes to the approval process that would require a higher standard of scientific information to be collected and reviewed, particularly in relation to key environmental assets during the environmental impact assessment process in future projects.

AB Groundwater-vegetation-atmosphere fluxes were monitored for a subtropical coastal conifer forest in South-East Queensland, Australia. Observations were used to quantify seasonal changes in transpiration rates with respect to temporal fluctuations of the local water table depth. The applicability of a Modified Jarvis-Stewart transpiration model (MJS), which requires soil-water content data, was assessed for this system. The influence of single depth values compared to use of vertically averaged soil-water content data on MJS-modelled transpiration was assessed over both a wet and a dry season, where the water table depth varied from the surface to a depth of 1.4 m below the surface.
   Data for tree transpiration rates relative to water table depth showed that trees transpire when the water table was above a threshold depth of 0.8 m below the ground surface (water availability is non limiting). When the water table reached the ground surface (i.e., surface flooding) transpiration was found to be limited. When the water table is below this threshold depth, a linear relationship between water table depth and the transpiration rate was observed. MJS modelling results show that the influence of different choices for soil-water content on transpiration predictions was insignificant in the wet season. However, during the dry season, inclusion of deeper soil-water content data improved the model performance (except for days after isolated rainfall events, here a shallower soil-water representation was better). This study demonstrated that, to improve MJS simulation results, appropriate selection of soil water measurement depths based on the dynamic behaviour of soil water profiles through the root zone was required in a shallow unconfined aquifer system.

AB Understanding the main controls on stable isotope variations in precipitation is fundamental for the interpretation of the hydrological cycle. However, spatio-temporal variations in delta O-18(p) are poorly known in Morocco. Herein, we explore the relative influence of meteorological variables, spatial and orographic (attitudinal) effects, atmospheric circulation and moisture sources on precipitation stable isotopes in Morocco. Precipitation events and two-years-long monthly records from 17 rain-gauge stations in Morocco are investigated and compared in this study to global gridded records of monthly and annual stable isotopes in precipitation. We highlight that the main spatial controls on precipitation stable isotopes are the topography and the distance from marine source. The most depleted mean annual isotopes are located in the High Atlas Mountains (delta O-18(p) = -9.56 parts per thousand and delta H-2(p) = -59.3 parts per thousand), while the most enriched isotope ratios exist in southwestern Morocco (delta O-18(p) = -2.35 parts per thousand and delta H-2(p) = -7.47 parts per thousand). The well-constrained relationship between delta O-18(p) and altitude describes a gradient of 0.11-0.18 parts per thousand, per 100 m. The seasonal variation is expressed by a general enrichment that reaches -4.8 parts per thousand during the dry season, related to the recycled vapor contained within the summer precipitation. Notwithstanding the scarcity of temperature and precipitation measurements, the amount effect is observed in multiple stations during several rain events and precipitation seems to have more influence on delta O-18(p) than temperature. Backward moisture trajectories indicate a distinct depletion in delta O-18(p) in extreme events originating from the Atlantic Ocean. The presence of a rain shadow effect is also revealed on the lee side of High Atlas Mountains, southeastern Morocco. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Without a realistic assessment of parameter uncertainty, decision makers may encounter difficulties in accurately describing hydrologic processes and assessing relationships between model parameters and watershed characteristics. In this study, a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-based multilevel-factorial analysis (MCMC-MFA) method is developed, which can not only generate samples of parameters from a well constructed Markov chain and assess parameter uncertainties with straightforward Bayesian inference, but also investigate the individual and interactive effects of multiple parameters on model output through measuring the specific variations of hydrological responses. A case study is conducted for addressing parameter uncertainties in the Kaidu watershed of northwest China. Effects of multiple parameters and their interactions are quantitatively investigated using the MCMC-MFA with a three level factorial experiment (totally 81 runs). A variance-based sensitivity analysis method is used to validate the results of parameters' effects. Results disclose that (i) soil conservation service runoff curve number for moisture condition II (CN2) and fraction of snow volume corresponding to 50% snow cover (SNO50COV) are the most significant factors to hydrological responses, implying that infiltration excess overland flow and snow water equivalent represent important water input to the hydrological system of the Kaidu watershed; (ii) saturate hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K) and soil evaporation compensation factor (ESCO) have obvious effects on hydrological responses; this implies that the processes of percolation and evaporation would impact hydrological process in this watershed; (iii) the interactions of ESCO and SNO50COV as well as CN2 and SNO50COV have an obvious effect, implying that snow cover can impact the generation of runoff on land surface and the extraction of soil evaporative demand in lower soil layers. These findings can help enhance the hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-scale temporal variability of precipitation has an established relationship with floods and droughts. In this paper, we present the diagnostics on the ability of 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from Bias Corrected and Downscaled (BCSD) World Climate Research Program's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) projections and 10 Regional Climate Models (RCMs) that participated in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to represent multi-scale temporal variability determined from the observed station data. Four regions (Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Tucson, and Cimarron) in the Southwest United States are selected as they represent four different precipitation regions classified by clustering method. We investigate how storm properties and seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal precipitation variabilities differed between GCMs/RCMs and observed records in these regions. We find that current GCMs/RCMs tend to simulate longer storm duration and lower storm intensity compared to those from observed records. Most GCMs/RCMs fail to produce the high-intensity summer storms caused by local convective heat transport associated with the summer monsoon. Both inter-annual and decadal bands are present in the GCM/RCM-simulated precipitation time series; however, these do not line up to the patterns of large-scale ocean oscillations such as El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decade! Oscillation (PDO). Our results show that the studied GCMs/RCMs can capture long-term monthly mean as the examined data is bias-corrected and downscaled, but fail to simulate the multi-scale precipitation variability including flood generating extreme events, which suggests their inadequacy for studies on floods and droughts that are strongly associated with multi-scale temporal precipitation variability.

In this study, the non-synchronization of water and salt movement in the frozen layer (0-1 m) was analyzed from the perspective of soil salt composition combining with the convection-diffusion theory. Field experiments were carried out during two freezing-thawing periods from 2017 to 2019 in Yonglian experimental station of Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia, China. The contents of soil moisture, salt and its components (Na, K, Ca, Mg, CO3, HCO3, Cl and SO4) were measured. The correlation analysis between storage increments of total salt and its components was carried out and the FREZCHEM model was used to calculate the soluble and solid salt components. During the freezing period, the soil water storage increased by 5.42% on average, while the soil salt storage decreased by 18.69%, showing the different migration directions of soil water and salt. The migration direction of each component of salt was not exactly the same with that of the total salt. The main components causing the storage increment of soil salt were different in the three saline soils. The solute concentration gradient of soluble salt reached 3.07 mol/(L.m), which caused stronger diffusion effect to result in downward salt migration, while the convection effect drove the soil water and salt to move upwards. This is the major reason for the non-synchronization movement of soil water and salt during the freezing-thawing period. This study provides new data and perspective to understand the soil water and salt movement during the freezing-thawing period in agricultural areas with shallow groundwater table depth.

AB Drought impact is closely related to water deficit phases within the hydrological cycle, and to drought propagation (the complex evolutions from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and to soil moisture drought). Besides the qualitative description, the quantitative analysis of drought propagation is still limited so far. Therefore, in this study, the propagation from meteorological to hydrological and to soil moisture droughts have been quantitatively analyzed. In particular, run theory has been utilized for quantifying key drought features including its duration and magnitude. The two available land assimilation datasets from 1981-2018 were selected for comparison purpose in Northern China Plain. Our results showed that although drought events identified by two datasets were not the same, both datasets revealed that meteorological drought occurred more frequently than hydrological and soil moisture droughts. And both demonstrated meteorological drought, hydrological drought and soil moisture drought were not synchronous. In particular, more than 91.89% of meteorological droughts led to hydrological droughts, and more than 87.10% of hydrological droughts caused soil moisture droughts. Furthermore, linear models showed the best for drought duration and magnitude. We found when meteorological drought was prolonged or shortened by one month, more than 91.89% probability it would lead to the extension or shortening of hydrological drought by 0.992 months with 1.687 unit in magnitude. And if the duration of hydrological drought changed by one month, more than 80.56% probability of the soil moisture drought duration would change by 1.006 months with 0.992 unit in magnitude. The results of duration and magnitude fitted well across the whole study area. Building on the above drought evolution information, practical drought mitigation measures and early warning system could be established.

AB Because of groundwater conceptualization uncertainty, multi-model methods are usually used and the corresponding uncertainties are estimated by integrating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) methods. Generally, the variance method is used to measure the uncertainties of BMA prediction. The total variance of ensemble prediction is decomposed into within-model and between-model variances, which represent the uncertainties derived from parameter and conceptual model, respectively. However, the uncertainty of a probability distribution couldn't be comprehensively quantified by variance solely. A new measuring method based on information entropy theory is proposed in this study. Due to actual BMA process hard to meet the ideal mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive condition, BMA predictive uncertainty could be decomposed into parameter, conceptual model, and overlapped uncertainties, respectively. Overlapped uncertainty is induced by the combination of predictions from correlated model structures. In this paper, five simple analytical functions are firstly used to illustrate the feasibility of the variance and information entropy methods. A discrete distribution example shows that information entropy could be more appropriate to describe between-model uncertainty than variance. Two continuous distribution examples show that the two methods are consistent in measuring normal distribution, and information entropy is more appropriate to describe bimodal distribution than variance. The two examples of BMA uncertainty decomposition demonstrate that the two methods are relatively consistent in assessing the uncertainty of unimodal BMA prediction. Information entropy is more informative in describing the uncertainty decomposition of bimodal BMA prediction. Then, based on a synthetical groundwater model, the variance and information entropy methods are used to assess the BMA uncertainty of groundwater modeling. The uncertainty assessments of groundwater BMA prediction are consistent with that of analytical function examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a novel flash flood susceptibility prediction framework with a particular emphasis on the extent of imbalance between the number of flooding and non-flooding events as majority of the events result in non-flooding. The class imbalance issue and the magnitude of the imbalance was explored in this study to highlight the uncertain nature of the flooding phenomenon. Therefore, the Random Forest (RF) was initially adopted to evaluate five imbalance class distribution scenarios (i.e., 1x, 10x, 25x, 50x, 100x non-flood events, for each x flood event). Parameter configurations of developed models were determined with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic, the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. The CS-RF model showed the highest (0.8455) prediction capability with regards to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) once the extent of imbalance was set as 50x. The CS-RF model was then benchmarked with another bagging, i.e., Extra Trees, and two boosting, i.e., Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, all integrated with the CS technique. Analysis results showed that the CS-RF is the most promising tree-based machine learning technique in flash flood susceptibility projection for the selected study area. According to the predictions, a flash flood susceptibility map was generated, where 9.35% of the basin was under very high flash flood risk. A recently developed model-agnostic game-theoretical method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was used for anatomizing the flash flood conditioning factors to highlight the contribution of each feature on the incident outcome prediction ensuring the transparency of the model findings. Overall, this study contributes to both theory and practice with particular focus on the model interpretability and existence of imbalance in the occurrence of flash flood events, assisting decision-makers in enhancing strategies to combat hazardous impacts of floods.

AB To optimize irrigation amount and date, and water allocation target across spatially distributed crops under uncertainties and risks, the framework of the distributed ANN-bi level two-stage stochastic fuzzy possibilistic programming with Bayesian (distributed ANN-BLTSFPPB) model was established by integrating bi-level programming, two stochastic programming (TSP), fuzzy possibilistic programming, Bayesian, downside risk with the distributed ANN model. Decisions making of distributed crops were conducted by building distributed model to optimize decisions at several spatially heterogeneous units. The risks of economic benefit and water productivity were considered and measured by the downside risk approach, and uncertainties of runoff were presented as fuzzy normal distribution numbers to reduce uncertainties and improve robustness of decisions. Besides, tradeoffs between economic benefit and risks in the upper layers, and contradictory relationships across objectives at the upper and lower layers were balanced by the BLTSFPPB model. Moreover, effects of water right trading on economic benefit with considerations of subjectivities of managers under different hydrological years were quantified by Bayesian approach. Calculation efficiencies of the distributed AquaCrop-optimization model were effectively improved by establishing the distributed ANN-BLTSFPPB, making it easy-to-use and expanding its applications. The developed model was applied to Yingke district to verify its application. The results disclosed that economic benefit and yield enlarged, and water productivity and risks lessened when the water right trading was considered. The results could offer insight into how to establish the distributed ANN model to replace distributed simulation model and further couple with optimization model to conduct spatially distributed decisions and improve calculation efficiencies for managers. They can reach key tradeoffs across economic benefit, yield and risks, and support in-depth analysis about how water right trading affects system outcomes.

AB The authors present a detailed procedure for modelling of mean monthly flow time-series using records of the Great Morava River (Serbia). The proposed procedure overcomes a major challenge of other available methods by disaggregating the time series in order to capture the main properties of the hydrologic process in both long-run and short-run, The main assumption of the conducted research is that a time series of monthly flow rates represents a stochastic process comprised of deterministic, stochastic and random components, the former of which can be further decomposed into a composite trend and two periodic components (short-term or seasonal periodicity and long-term or multi-annual periodicity). In the present paper, the deterministic component of a monthly flow time-series is assessed by spectral analysis, whereas its stochastic component is modelled using cross-correlation transfer functions, artificial neural networks and polynomial regression. The results suggest that the deterministic component can be expressed solely as a function of time, whereas the stochastic component changes as a nonlinear function of climatic factors (rainfall and temperature). For the calibration period, the results of the analysis infers a lower value of Kling-Gupta Efficiency in the case of transfer functions (0.736), whereas artificial neural networks and polynomial regression suggest a significantly better match between the observed and simulated values, 0.841 and 0.891, respectively. It seems that transfer functions fail to capture high monthly flow rates, whereas the model based on polynomial regression reproduces high monthly flows much better because it is able to successfully capture a highly nonlinear relationship between the inputs and the output. The proposed methodology that uses a combination of artificial neural networks, spectral analysis and polynomial regression for deterministic and stochastic components can be applied to forecast monthly or seasonal flow rates.

AB The concept of tightly bound water, in which a reservoir of soil water is bound tightly within small soil pores but is still available for evapotranspiration, is parameterised for the first time within the land surface scheme of a fully-coupled regional-scale atmosphere-land surface model. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model and the NOAH land surface scheme are selected and a case study is performed on the Olifants River Basin in the Limpopo region of South Africa. Accurate knowledge of water availability in this water-stressed region is of great importance for adaptation and future water policy. Results of a simulation forced by ERA40 re-analysis show that the standard land surface scheme is unable to reproduce the observed runoff despite rainfall and atmospheric conditions similar to observed. This version of the model over-estimates mean annual runoff by 120%. The tightly bound water scheme shows a significant improvement, reducing the bias to 22%.
   The inclusion of the tightly bound water scheme has little effect on the basin average annual rainfall despite increasing annual evapotranspiration. The tightly bound water physics dampens the response of runoff to precipitation and provides additional de-coupling between precipitation and runoff, increasing the variability in this relationship. Simulations with the WRF model forced with both 1980s and 2040s CCSM3 data show that the tightly bound water scheme significantly reduces runoff in different climates and projects a greater relative future decrease in runoff, from 4% to 10% for the same precipitation decrease of 2.5%. The scheme also affects the projected changes in spatially averaged 100-year return precipitation and runoff with significance at the 0.9 confidence level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WATER-QUALITY; RUNOFF; NETWORKS
AB Environmental flow estimation in regulated rivers has become a major issue for watershed management in Mediterranean countries. There are many methodologies for environmental flow computation, but they usually require accurate hydrological long-term flow records, which sometimes are unavailable, and/or extensive field measurement campaigns, which can be very costly especially when the environmental flows must be determined at many locations in large basins. We analyzed the potential of neural network models for the estimation of environmental flow values in gauging sections and reaches under a natural flow regime in the watershed of the Ebro River, Spain, with a view to a future application in both ungauged and/or regime-attered sections. Non-linear multilayer feed-forward cascade-correlation neural networks were developed to mode( the relationships between known environmental flows (Qb calculated) and two sets of independent variables related to physical and hydrological watershed characteristics or to the general flow regime. Three models were found capable of good estimations of environmental flows, based on variables such as the 10-year average of the tower monthly flows, the mean value of the length of the period in days with flows continually below the 40% of the mean annual flow (spell duration), and the flow equated or exceeded 270 days per year (Q270). Correlation coefficients (r) between calculated and estimated values were high (>0.90), and average absolute errors were Low (<0.44 m(3)/S) for the three models. The limited number of variables in the models (just two) was considered very promising for operational application of the model to ungauged or regime-altered sections. Results suggest that artificial neural network models can be simple, robust, reliable and cost-efficient toots for environmental flow determination at the watershed level. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

ID WATER-QUALITY; URBANIZATION; AREA; ATLANTA; RUNOFF
AB As urbanization infiltrates into rural areas, stream water quality is expected to decline as a result from increased impervious surface and greater sources for pollutants. Consequently, West Georgia's water quality is threatened by extensive development as well as other land uses such as livestock grazing and silvicultural activity. Maintenance of stream water quality, as land development occurs, is critical for the protection of drinking water and biotic integrity. A 2-phase, watershed-scale study was established to develop relationships among land cover and water quality within western Georgia. During phase 1, nutrient and fecal coliform data were collected within 18 mixed land use watersheds, ranging in size from 500 to 2500 ha. Regression models were developed that related land cover to stream water nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations. Nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations within watersheds having > 24% impervious surface (IS) were often higher than those in nonurban watersheds (i.e., < 5% IS) during both base flow (N: 1.64 mg/L versus 0.61 mg/L, and FC: 430 versus 120 MPN/100 ml) and storm flow (N: 1.93 mg/L versus 0.36 mg/L, and FC: 1600 versus 167 MPN/100 ml). Fecal coliform bacteria in urbanized areas consistently exceeded the US EPA's review criterion for recreational waters during both base flow and to a greater extent storm flow. During phase 2, regression models were tested based on data from six newly chosen watersheds with similar land use/cover patterns. Lastly, theoretical watersheds, based on land use percentages, were created to illustrate trends in water quality impairment as land development occurs. The models developed from this research could be used to forecast water quality changes under various land use scenarios in the developing Piedmont region of the US. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ID IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS
AB A regionalised relationship to estimate flood magnitudes for ungauged and poorly gauged catchments can be established using regional flood frequency analysis. The geographical approach (Residuals method), Ward's cluster method, the Fuzzy c-means method and a Kohonen neural network were applied to 86 sites in the Gan River Basin of Jiangxi Province and the Ming River Basin of Fujian Province in the southeast of China to delineate homogeneous regions based on site characteristics. Similar groupings of sites into sub-regions were obtained from all but the Residuals method. Since the Kohonen neural network can be employed to identify the number of sub-regions as well as the allocation of sites to sub-regions, this method is to be preferred over Ward's method and the Fuzzy c-means approach. For each sub-region, growth curves must be constructed and the value of an index flood must be related to catchment characteristics. The regional L-moment algorithm may be used to advantage both to identify an appropriate underlying frequency distribution and to construct sub-regional growth curves. However, the membership levels produced by the Fuzzy c-means method may also be used as weights to derive a regional at-site growth curve from those of all the sub-regions. The latter method is likely to be most useful where the sub-regional growth curves are of strongly contrasting shape. An index flood may be related to catchment characteristics using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, but application to the Gan-Ming data demonstrates that estimates with lower standard errors of estimate can be produced using an artificial neural network (ANN). However, in order to apply such ANNs, sufficient sites must be available so that enough processing elements can be employed without impairing the ability of the network to generalise outside the training data set.

AB Concern over the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on flooding has led to a proliferation of studies examining past flood trends. Many studies have analysed annual-maximum flow trends but few have quantified changes in major (25-100 year return period) floods, i.e. those that have the greatest societal impacts. Existing major-flood studies used a limited number of very large catchments affected to varying degrees by alterations such as reservoirs and urbanisation. In the current study, trends in major flood occurrence from 1961 to 2010 and from 1931 to 2010 were assessed using a very large dataset (>1200 gauges) of diverse catchments from North America and Europe; only minimally altered catchments were used, to focus on climate-driven changes rather than changes due to catchment alterations. Trend testing of major floods was based on counting the number of exceedances of a given flood threshold within a group of gauges. Evidence for significant trends varied between groups of gauges that were defined by catchment size, location, climate, flood threshold and period of record, indicating that generalizations about flood trends across large domains or a diversity of catchment types are ungrounded. Overall, the number of significant trends in major-flood occurrence across North America and Europe was approximately the number expected due to chance alone. Changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were dominated by multidecadal variability rather than by long-term trends. There were more than three times as many significant relationships between major-flood occurrence and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation than significant long-term trends.

AB Stream sediment loads (both bedload and suspended sediment) are problematic to measure due to the time and equipment needed. There is a dearth of such data sets globally let alone for Australia. However, such data are needed to quantify sediment transport type and rates, landscape evolution, effect of human disturbance as well as patterns and temporal response. Here we present the findings from 8 steepslope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams (size range 15-100 ha) in southeastern Australia where both bedload and suspended load have been measured over multiple years. The results demonstrate that suspended load is the dominant component and there is no consistent suspended to bedload ratio for the catchments. The suspended sediment to bedload ratio appears to be catchment specific. There was no relationship between total load (or bedload/suspended load) and average catchment slope, stream length, shape or any geomorphic descriptor. However catchment total load was found to be significantly related to catchment area. Of the 8 catchments examined here, 6 had been harvested for timber in previous decades (with large areas of forest removed) while 2 catchments had minimal disturbance (Control catchments). There was no difference in sediment loads from the harvested and Control catchments. The results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term. This provides confidence that the forest harvesting and subsequent management do not produce detrimental effects in the medium to long term. An assessment of erosion rates and likely soil production rates suggests that the catchments are eroding soil at the rate it is being produced. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It is crucial to determine the factors affecting the carbon use efficiency (CUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) of vegetation in ecosystems. However, the relationships between climate changes and CUE and WUE by karst vegetation in China are still unclear. The response of the CUE and WUE to regional climate change was studied by using trend analysis and partial derivative method. In addition, the distribution characteristics of the CUE and WUE of different land use types were analyzed. The following results were found. (1). From 2000 to 2018, the average of CUE in karst areas of China was 0.557, and the average value of WUE was 1.237g C kg -1 H2O. (2) The CUE of grassland was higher than that of forest land (0.051), whereas the WUE value of grassland was far lower than that of forest land (1.415 g C kg -1 H2O). (3) CUE was affected by precipitation (P), exhibiting an increasing trend (5.5 x 10-3 yr -1), and the most obvious increase occurred in the grassland (7.2 x 10-3 yr -1). Under the influence of solar radiation (SR), the WUE decreased (-1.5 x 10-3 g C kg -1 H2O yr -1), and the largest decrease occurred in the shrub land (-8.4 x 10-3 g C kg -1 H2O yr -1). (4) 90.31 % CUE increase depended on P and SR, while 78.32 % of the decrease in the WUE was due to P and SR. This study makes important contributions to clarifying the responses of the CUE and WUE of ecosystems to climate changes in karst areas, optimizing the management of regional water and soil resources, and promoting healthy development of the ecological environment.

TI Induced polarization as a tool to characterize shallow landslides

AB The development of shallow landslides is strongly connected to the changes in the water content of soils on hillslopes, their clay content and permeability distribution, which, in turn, are playing an important role regarding their hydro-mechanical properties. A non-intrusive geophysical method able to map these properties would be very helpful. The most common geoelectrical method, DC (Direct Current) resistivity, cannot be used as a stand-alone technique for this purpose since it depends on two contributions (bulk and surface conductivities), which depend on the water content and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the material. Induced polarization is a geophysical method that can be now used to complement DC resistivity in providing key material properties that can be used to diagnose potential risks for failure. We first recall the basic principles behind the induced polarization method from laboratory to field scales and key findings in the underlying petrophysics needed to jointly interpret electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms. Then, we apply these relationships to a field survey carried out over a shallow landslide at Claix (Isere, France), close to Grenoble. A 3D induced polarization survey was carried out and interpreted in terms of the clay content, water content, and permeability distributions. We demonstrate that the landslide is associated with a channel of high water content corresponding with the presence of travertine, a flow-path, and a permeability barrier downslope corresponding to the presence of plastic clays. This study demonstrates that induced polarization can be used to characterize the impacted volume and therefore might have been useful to map the area before the landslide to assess the possible risk of failure. This methodology could play a key role in mitigation planning.

AB Sediment size distribution greatly affects sediment transport and deposition. A better understanding of sediment sorting will improve understanding of erosion and sedimentation processes, which in turn will improve erosion modeling. To address this issue, a total of 12 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in a 1 m by 5 m box with varying steep slopes (10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees), and the simulated rainfall lasted for 1 h at a rate of 90 mm h(-1). For each simulated event, runoff and sediment were sampled at 3-min intervals, which were performed to study in detail the temporal change in size distribution of the eroded materials. These data were used to interpret the real-time sequence of transport mechanisms acting in response to the simulated rainfall. Total soil loss is the sum of suspended, saltating and contact loads. The proportion of sediment <0.002 mm showed little temporal fluctuation (generally 12-14%), although it was highly correlated to instantaneous rain power (R-2 = 0.452, P < 0.01, n = 120). Suspension-saltation transports the finer than 0.054 mm size sediment was the most important erosion mechanism during interrill erosion processes. However, after rill development on hillslopes, bed-load transport by rolling of medium to large-sized sediment particles (coarser than 0.152 mm) became an increasingly important transport mechanism, and it were also enhanced by increased slope. Overall, the study supports a strong relationship between the sediment transport of contact (rolling) load and stream power. The partition of soil loss into these more meaningful components appears to be essential both for initial data interpretation and for subsequent use of such data for soil loss prediction.

AB The physically-based surface-subsurface HydroGeoSphere model is used to examine the hydrologic budget of the 286.6 km(2) Duffins Creek watershed, located 10 km northeast of metropolitan Toronto. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of the model to simulate the three-dimensional hydrologic response of the surface and subsurface flow systems in a large-scale watershed driven by multi-season precipitation events. The hydrologic model was calibrated to a consecutive sequence of hydrographs resulting from all precipitation events between the months of April and December 1986, white hydrographs from 1987 were used to test the model's ability for prediction. Results demonstrate that a physically-based modeling approach which treats the surface and subsurface flow systems as an integrated continuum can capture the dynamic response of a large heterogeneous watershed as driven by transient precipitation events over a multi-season period. It was also revealed that full coupling of plant transpiration and surface-subsurface evaporation processes into the governing flow equations was critical for the successful, calibration of the hydrographs. However, the ability of the model to predict the shape of individual. hydrographs in the following year, during which the annual average precipitation rate decreased significantly, was diminished even though the annual, average stream flows were closely replicated. We identify a number of data gaps that contribute to the decline in the predictive capacity of the model., including difficulty in establishing an appropriate initial condition, vertical mesh refinement issues within the root zone, and the reliance on a largely empirical relationship that distributes the net capacity for plant transpiration among various factors that may change from one year to the next.

AB Rivers draining the sedimentary platform of northern Xinjiang (the center of Asian continent) are characterized by low discharge under a temperate and arid climate. The influence of rock mineralogy, climate, relief and human activity on natural water composition and export as a result of weathering is a major scientific concern both at the local and the global scale. While comprehensive work on the controlling mechanism of chemical weathering has been less carried out in the sedimentary platform of northern Xinjiang. Thus, the effects of climate and rock weathering on the inorganic hydrogeochemical processes are not well quantified at this climatic extreme. To remedy this lack a comprehensive survey has been carried out of the geochemistry of the large, pristine rivers in northern Xinjiang, the Erlqis, Yili, Wulungu, Jingou and numerous lesser streams which has not experienced the pervasive effects of glaciation and subsequent anthropogenic impacts. The scale of the terrain sampled, in terms of area, is comparable to that of the Huanghe and includes a diverse range of geologic and climatic environments. In this paper the chemical fluxes from the stable sedimentary basin of the northern Xinjiang platform will be presented and compared to published results from analogous terrains in the monsoon basins of China and world. Overall, the fluvial geochemistry of northern Xinjiang in westerly climate is similar to that of the Chinese rivers (Huanghe and Yangtze) in the East-Asian monsoon Climate, both in property-property relationships and concentration magnitudes. The range in the chemical signatures of the various tributaries is large; this reflects that lithology exerts the dominant influence in determining the weathering yield from the sedimentary terrains rather than the weathering environment. The effect of different rock weathering ranges from rivers dominated by aluminosilicate weathering, mainly of granites, sandstones and shales, to those bearing the signatures of dissolution of carbonates and evaporites and of continental playa deposits. Carbonates are the general predominant lithology undergoing dissolution particularly within the lesser arid areas. The pCO(2) in the study rivers is out of equilibrium with respect to atmospheric pCO(2), about up to similar to 20 times supersaturated relative to the atmosphere but not to such an extent as the Amazon in the floodplain. A roughly positive relationship is observed between solute concentrations and the drought index (DI) for natural waters in the region, indicating a coupled mountain-basin climate has a direct effect. The relative contributions of end-member solute sources to the total dissolved cations from each watershed have been quantitatively estimated using dissolved load balance models, showing the results as evaporite dissolution > carbonate weathering > silicate weathering > atmospheric input for the whole catchment. The areal total dissolved fluxes range from 0.05 to 2.53 x 10(6) mol/km(2)/yr, 0.02-2.09 x 10(6) mol/km(2)/yr and 0.01-1.04 x 10(6) molt km(2)/yr in the Yili, Zhungarer and Erlqis, respectively, comparable to those of Chinese and Siberia rivers draining sedimentary platforms, even though they are in drastically different climatic regimes. In general, the fluxes from rivers in sedimentary basins are comparable to those from orogenic zones, but are much higher than in the shield regions. The CO2 consumption by aluminosilicate weathering (0.
   2-284 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr) is much smaller than in active orogenic belts (19-1750 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr in similar latitudes and 143-1000 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr in the tropical basins), but comparable to those of the Chinese (7-106 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr) and Siberia (16-112 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr) rivers.

AB Agriculture is one of the sectors most directly and severely affected by droughts. Therefore, information regarding the water required (WR) to recover from agricultural drought and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios is of great importance for drought risk management. In this study, we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate the WR of agricultural drought event recovery and a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the copula function to calculate the proba-bilities of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios. The developed method and framework were demonstrated in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) using the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index (ISMAPI). The average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the YRB was 28 d. The difference in soil moisture persistence was the main factor affecting the spatial pattern of the grid mean drought recovery characteristics. For individual drought events, precipitation was the most important factor affecting drought recovery, followed by drought development intensity. There is a clear nonlinear rela-tionship between the PCP value (percentage of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corre-sponding climatological mean) and the drought recovery duration. In most grids, the three-parameter power function can be used to characterize this relationship and further estimate the WR to recover from an agricultural drought event under different expected recovery durations. We estimated the probabilities of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 d based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework. For example, when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d, the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0.59. These findings are important for decision-making in water and drought management.

AB An integrated Bayesian least-squares-support-vector-machine factorial-analysis (B-LSVM-FA) method is developed through integrating techniques of Bayesian inference, least squares support vector machine (LSVM), and factorial analysis (FA) into a general framework. B-LSVM-FA has advantages in: (i) capturing the complicated nonlinear relationship between input factors and streamflow, (ii) optimizing the key parameters of LSVM through a maximum posterior density estimation, and (iii) quantifying the contributions of individual and interactive effects of multiple factors to streamflow variation. B-LSVM-FA is then applied to inferring the changes in inflow from the Amu Darya to the Aral Sea (named as IATA). Results obtained cannot only identify the key impact factors reducing IATA during the period of 1960-2015, but also predict future trends in IATA for 2020-2050. Comparing to the conventional ANN, SVM and LSVM, the proposed method performs better in describing the IATA changes with anthropogenic, hydrometeorological, and ecological factors in terms of NSE, RMSE, and PBS. Results disclose that the major factors affecting IATA at annual/seasonal scale are upstream streamflow, agricultural water use in Uzbekistan, reservoir water storage, and evapotranspiration. The significant differences in the contributions of main factors to IATA at seasonal scale are observed because each season has unique characteristics of human activities, meteorological conditions, and vegetation coverages. In order to seek the feasible strategies of recovering the IATA level in the future, 162 scenarios based on ensemble prediction are analyzed. Results indicate that the IATA would restore to its 1970s condition if the drip irrigation rate reaches 50% at the end of 2050, and the reservoir water storage level reduces to the average value of 1960-1970. The findings can provide valuable suggestions for decision makers to increase IATA, and thus ameliorating the ecological crisis within the Aral Sea Basin.

AB In this study, a Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis (BMFA) method is developed to assess parameter uncertainties and their effects on hydrological model responses. In BMFA, Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of model parameters with Bayesian inference; factorial analysis (FA) technique is used for measuring the specific variations of hydrological responses in terms of posterior distributions to investigate the individual and interactive effects of parameters on model outputs. BMFA is then applied to a case study of the Jinghe River watershed in the Loess Plateau of China to display its validity and applicability. The uncertainties of four sensitive parameters, including soil conservation service runoff curve number to moisture condition II (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), plant available water capacity (SOL_AWC), and soil depth (SOL_Z), are investigated. Results reveal that (i) CN2 has positive effect on peak flow, implying that the concentrated rainfall during rainy season can cause infiltration-excess surface flow, which is an considerable contributor to peak flow in this watershed; (ii) SOL_K has positive effect on average flow, implying that the widely distributed cambisols can lead to medium percolation capacity; (iii) the interaction between SOLAWC and SOL_Z has noticeable effect on the peak flow and their effects are dependent upon each other, which discloses that soil depth can significant influence the processes of plant uptake of soil water in this watershed. Based on the above findings, the significant parameters and the relationship among uncertain parameters can be specified, such that hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources of the Jinghe River watershed can be improved.

AB This paper describes an algorithm for disaggregating daily rainfall into sub-daily rainfall 'fragments' (fine-resolution rainfall sequences) under a future, warmer climate. The algorithm uses a combined generalised additive model (GAM) and method of fragments (MoFs) framework to resample sub-daily rainfall fragments from the historical record conditional on daily rainfall amount and a range of atmospheric covariates. The rationale is that as the atmosphere warms, future rainfall patterns will be more reflective of historical rainfall patterns corresponding to warmer days at the same location, or to locations which have an atmospheric profile more reflective of expected future climate.
   It was found that the daily to sub-daily scaling relationship varied significantly by season and by location, with rainfall patterns on warmer seasons or at warmer locations typically showing more intense rainfall occurring over shorter periods compared with cooler seasons and stations. Importantly, by regressing against atmospheric covariates such as temperature, this effect was substantially reduced, suggesting that the approach may also be valid when extrapolating to a future climate. The GAM-MoF algorithm was then applied to nine stations around Australia, with the results showing that relative to the daily rainfall amount, the maximum intensity of short duration rainfall increased by between 4.1% and 13.4% per degree change in temperature for the maximum six minute burst, and by between 3.1% and 6.8% for the maximum 1 h burst. The fraction of each wet day with no rainfall also increased by between 1.5% and 3.5%. This highlights that a significant proportion of the change to the distribution of rainfall is likely to occur at sub-daily timescales, with important implications for many hydrological systems.

AB Streamflow model including rainfall-runoff and river flow models play an important role in water resources management, especially in arid inland area. Traditional conceptual models have disadvantage of requirement of spatial variations parameters about physical characteristics of the catchments. To overcome this difficult, in this study, several integrated Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were presented to estimate monthly river flow and the models include the semi-distribute forms of ANNs which can explore spatial variation in hydrological process (such as rainfall distribution and evaporation distribution) and no requirement of physical characteristic parameters of the catchments. An arid inland basin of Northwest as a case, integrated ANNs were developed using hydrological and agricultural data and its performance were compared with that of lumped ANN and local linear regression model (LLR). Results showed that the integrated ANNs perform well to estimate the monthly streamflow at outlet of mountain with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.36 x 10(7) m(3) and Relative Error (RE) of 9%. Similarly, the integrated ANNs can also accurately estimate the monthly river flow in down-stream of the basin with RMSE of 0.35-0.38 x 10(7) m(3) and RE of 22-27%. Comparing to integrated ANNs, the lumped ANN and LLR models have lower precision to simulate monthly streamflow in aird inland basin. Presented integrated ANNs models retain advantages of the semi-distributed models considering the heterogeneity and spatial variation of hydrological factors and nature character in the catchment, while taking advantage of the potential of ANNs as an effective tool in nonlinear mapping or functional relationship establishment. In contrast to traditional models either in the lumped ANN or in empirical regression forms, the new approach of integration of Artificial Neural Networks has shown great potential in streamflow modeling.

AB Multispectral satellite data have great potential for study of factors affecting eco-hydrology. Hydrologic response of vegetation is often evaluated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) that contains significant non-systematic variation arising from atmospheric and soil factors that mask hydrologic response. Relative magnitudes of these influences were quantified using mid-summer Landsat TM data assembled for the San Luis Valley, Colorado, encompassing 14 years of a 17-year span (1986-2002). Spectra[ data were processed to reflectance and corrected for atmospheric variation. Data for calculating NDVI were extracted from 2953 pixels contained in 180 131-m-diameter circles of homogeneous native phreatophyte alkali scrub chosen from the region of homeostatic reference wells, outside influence from drainages, roadways or obvious disturbance. NDVI of these pixel values were pooled and then averaged for each year for comparison of three processing steps: (i) correcting non-systematic variation by calculating NDVI*; (ii) subtracting antecedent precipitation effects; and (iii) correcting phenology for satellite overpass date relative to expected mid-summer peak vegetation. Little change was expected from year to year due homeostatic water table and ecology. This afforded the opportunity to judge improvements in NDVI processing by the extent to which an underlying ecological relationship for vegetation promotion by antecedent precipitation was revealed, and by reduction of standard deviation for the 14-year dataset mean. NDVI* improved the predictive power of antecedent precipitation from r(2) = 0.37 to r(2) = 0.77. Detrending for antecedent precipitation cut standard deviation in half. No improvement was noted for application of a polynomial seasonal model to further correct for the effect of data-collection time within a two-month mid-summer window. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The spatial variability of landscape features such as topography, soils and vegetation defines the spatial pattern of hydrological state variables like soil moisture. Spatial variability thereby controls the functional behaviour of the landscape in terms of its runoff response. A consequence of spatial variability is that exchange processes between landscape patches can occur at various spatial scales ranging from the plot to the basin scale. In semi-arid areas, the lateral redistribution of surface runoff between adjacent landscape patches is an important process. For applications to large river basins of 10(4)-10(5) km(2) in size, a multi-scale landscape discretization scheme is presented in this paper. The landscape is sub-divided into modelling units within a hierarchy of spatial scale levels. By delineating areas characterized by a typical toposequence, organised and random variability of landscape characteristics is captured in the model. Using runoff-runon relationships with transition frequencies based on areal fractions of modelling units, lateral surface and subsurface water fluxes between modelling units at the hillslope scale are represented. Thus, the new approach allows for a manageable description of interactions between fine-scale landscape features for inclusion in coarse-scale models. Model applications for the State of Ceara (148,000 km(2)) in the north-east of Brazil demonstrate the importance of taking into account landscape variability and interactions between landscape patches in a semi-arid environment. Using mean landscape characteristics leads to a considerable underestimation of infiltration-excess surface runoff and total simulated runoff. Re-infiltration of surface runoff and lateral redistribution processes between landscape patches cause a reduction of runoff volumes at the basin scale and contribute to the amplification of variations in runoff volumes relative to variations in rainfall volumes for semi-arid areas.

AB Different indicators such as precipitation, surface and groundwater availability, vegetation, and soil types are indispensable in developing land management plans for detecting, monitoring, and evaluating drought impacts at the watershed scale. Because of the complex interactions among these indicators, it is well known that one single hydrometeorological variable would be unable to capture all the aspects of drought characteristics. In this study, a methodology based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-Copula was proposed to assess the fre-quency of different drought events and improve mitigation in watersheds. A comprehensive approach for an Integrated Drought Indicator (IDI) was proposed using a combination of three hydrometeorological variables (precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture) based on PCA and tested for the upstream Nanpan river in China. IDI confirmed the cumulative contribution rate of the first and second principal components (85%), and its design included simulation of monthly average soil moisture content (from 0 to 0.4-meter soil layer) using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The parameters were calibrated using the SUFI-2 optimization algorithm in SWAT-CUP. Then, the IDI relative anomaly characterization was used to identify drought processes based on the Run theory. Two major drought characteristics, duration, and severity were abstracted from the observed drought events. Finally, two-dimensional copulas were applied for analyzing comprehensive drought charac-teristics in the region. Our results showed that significant differences in drought duration periods could be identified. Drought duration, predicted by runoff and soil moisture, were found longer than those assessed using the precipitation index. IDI suggest our proposed model was suitable to identify comprehensive drought events and describe the overall drought characteristics of the region. In the same way, PCA-Copula methodology was found with high potential for drought analysis in areas where no previous studies have been performed.

AB Conventional theory for homogeneous aquifers states that pressure propagates more rapidly into aquifers than solutes following river stage rise. We demonstrate through numerical simulations of two-dimensional aquifer slices that the relative timing of pressure and solute responses in alluvial aquifers is a function of subsurface structures. Two generic conceptual models of heterogeneity are investigated, a vertical clogging layer and a horizontal sand string. Independent of the conceptual model, the hydraulic conductivity contrast is the primary controlling variable on the rates of pressure and solute transport from a river to an observation point. Conceptual models are compared using metrics for pressure and solute travel time that represent propagation of 50% change in each variable from river to observation point. While not possible in a homogeneous system, a solute travel time less than a pressure travel time can occur in the presence of both types of heterogeneity, and indicates that heterogeneity is controlling propagation from the river to the aquifer. Less than one order of magnitude contrast in hydraulic conductivities is sufficient to create a travel time ratio less than one. Contrasts of this magnitude are often exceeded in alluvial environments and thus simultaneous measurement of solute and pressure has the potential to constrain estimates of exchange flux in a way not possible with pressure measurements alone. In general, flux estimates derived from solute travel times provide more accurate estimates than those derived from pressure responses in heterogeneous environments. The magnitude of error in estimates derived from pressure responses is proportional to the hydraulic conductivity contrast. Travel times calculated from time series pressure and EC data collected in the Mitchell River in northern Australia are used to demonstrate application of this combined approach.

TI Simple method for estimating well yield potential through geostatistical

   tomography; Tanzania
AB In inland Tanzania, because of the low annual rainfall and poor surface water runoff, increasing the supply of safe drinking water is a major issue. To solve the issue and to design for the drinking water supply at region of fractured zones in crystalline rocks, the simple method is applied to find the relationships between the pumping discharge of drilling wells and the field survey data in the Tabora Region, Tanzania. The field data used included results of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey, electric resistivity borehole logging, the geological column (as geological information) and size of lineaments (as spatial information). A multiple correlation equation developed in this study demonstrates that the pumping discharge of a drilling well can be determined from two surface data sets: ERT survey results and lengths of topographic lineaments. This study also demonstrates that surface hydro-geophysical surveys are highly effective for exploration of groundwater resources in Tabora Region, and thus assist in locating potential drilling sites where water resources are scarce. Application of this equation enables prediction of the well yield potential in developing areas and is expected to increase the water supply in the Tabora Region, where water resource surveys are being conducted. Areas suitable for residential use, which are identified as regions on the application map where the well yield potential exceeds 5 m(3)hr(-1), are found at the northern part of the Tabora Urban and Tabora Rural east and north from Tabora Urban. From the case study in the Tabora Region, this proposed simple method has possibilities to be able to apply for other regions in Tanzania and surrounding countries of Tanzania where are under similar conditions and environments to the Tabora Region.

AB Soil detachment processes are greatly impacted by vegetation recovery. However, the understanding of these relationships on bengggang alluvial fans in southeast China is limited. In this research, the impacts of near soil surface factors (litter stems, biological crusts, and roots) on soil detachment is quantitated by overland flow with two introduced grass species (Paspalum mandiocanum and Pennisetum giganteum) in the alluvial fans. Flow scouring was performed on soil samples obtained from two grasslands under nine forms of shear stress ranging from 2.70 to 10.51 Pa. Paspalum mandiocanum and Pennisetum giganteum significantly reduced the soil detachment capacity of alluvial fans by 94% and 98%, respectively. The roots of the two kinds of grass were most effective in reducing soil detachment (48% and 63%), the situation of > 80% was caused by root binding; besides, the contribution of biological crusts (37% and 20%) was higher than that of litter-stems (9% and 15%). Compared with bare land, roots and biological crusts under Paspalum mandiocanum and Pennisetum giganteum decreased rill erodibility by 43% and 40%, 60% and 20%, respectively; meanwhile, they increased the critical shear stress by 0.92- to 3.02-fold, 1.15- to 3.34-fold, respectively. Roots of the two plants increased soil resistance more than the biological crusts mainly by root binding. Overall, Pennisetum giganteum (a deep roots plant) showed a slightly better performance in controlling soil detachment than Paspalum mandiocanum (a shallow roots plant); among them, the roles of roots and litter-stems of Pennisetum giganteum were greater than those of Paspalum mandiocanum while the role of biological crusts of Paspalum mandiocanum was greater than that of Pennisetum giganteum. These findings highlight the significance of litter-stems, biological crusts and roots in controlling soil erosion and are helpful for selecting suitable grasses for vegetation recovery in alluvial fans of benggang.

AB Traditional methods for characterizing horizontally anisotropic aquifers are all based on pumping tests. In this paper, we present a new method for the identification of horizontal anisotropy using cross-hole slug tests, which is much more easily accessible comparing to pumping tests. Through scaler transform, an anisotropic medium was converted into an equivalent isotropic medium. When applying the analytical solutions derived for isotropic media to interpret cross-hole slug tests performed in anisotropic media, the estimated transmissivity is the geometrical mean of the anisotropic transmissivity tensor, regardless of sampling direction. However, the apparent storativity calculated from different observation wells, is equal to the true storativity scaled by a factor defined by the formation anisotropy. Thus, anisotropy can be resolved through apparent storativity that bears directional information. The proposed method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to field data. It was found that the tensor results obtained by this new method with cross-hole slug tests are consistent with that obtained by applying the classical Papadopulos' method with cross-hole pumping tests conducted in the same wells. When applied to heterogeneous media, tensor results produced by the new method may be subject to considerable errors. This is because the results are strongly sensitive to the connectivity between measurement boreholes and the formation medium. To reduce the error level, responses from a large number of observation wells located in various directions around the source well are needed. In addition to the adopted KGS solution for confined aquifers, the proposed methodology can be applied to incorporate other analytical methods for a variety of aquifer types, as long as the characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity can be established.

AB Temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s. Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents. Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions. Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s < 256 h, while k at -10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h < s < 724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s > 724 h. Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted.

AB There are serious concerns between forest and water quantity, Chinese extensive land area makes the relationship more complicated, thus, the effects of forest structure on hydrological processes in China were not fully comprehended. In this research, forest's hydrological functions, including rainfall partitioning, litter interception, evapotranspiration (ET), were analyzed in China. The results showed that throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69.3 +/- 8.8% and 84.4 +/- 5.6%. Then was canopy interception which varied from 14.6 +/- 1.4% to 29.1 +/- 3.3%. Throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation, canopy thickness and canopy density. Canopy interception was correlated with gross precipitation, LAI, canopy density, biomass, mixed degree, uniform angle index, aggregation index. Stemflow accounted for only 1.2 +/- 0.32% of gross precipitation, with the greatest fraction of 2.1 +/- 0.2% in XBH site and the least fraction of 0.3 +/- 0.1% in DB site. Gross precipitation was the main factor in determining stemflow. DB site had the greatest litter interception (7.7 +/- 0.8 mm) and HB site had the least (0.9 +/- 0.3 mm). Litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass (0.66) than total litter mass (0.46). Path-coefficient analysis showed that stand density, Shannon-Wiener index, litter mass, size ratio had greater impact on litter interception than other factors. ET was mainly influenced by precipitation, and it also correlated with LAI, canopy density and biomass. In north China, ET percentage (the ratio of ET and precipitation) was 82.7-109.5%, while it decreased to 63.1-88.5% in south China, ET demand in XBS site was larger than precipitation. ET percentage increased with increasing latitude and elevation, decreased with increasing temperature.

AB Trends in monthly evapotranspiration (ET) rates across Nebraska, the most intensely irrigated state within the US, were calculated by the calibration-free version of the nonlinear complementary relationship of evaporation over the 1979-2015 period utilizing North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) net radiation, 10-m wind velocity, as well as Parameter Regression Independent Slope Model (PRISM) air and dew-point temperature data. State-averaged modeled ET rates rose by 5.5 mm decade(-1) due to the presence of wide-spread large-scale irrigation projects in accordance with a 2.4 mm decade(-1) increase in PRISM precipitation (P) and a simultaneous -2.8 mm decade(-1) drop in United States Geological Survey's state-averaged annual streamflow rates, raising the state-wide ET to P ratio from 0.89 to 0.91 over the modeled time-period. ET rates over irrigated crops increased by 7 mm decade(-1) despite a -4.4 mm decade(-1) drop in precipitation rates. A similar increase in ET rates (6 mm decade(-1)) required 8.1 mm decade(-1) increase in precipitation rates across the non-irrigated Sand Hills of Nebraska. Published NARR ET rates are unable to pick up this unusual regional trend. Since an increase in precipitation rates should normally decrease the ET ratio, as predicted by the Budyko curve, this study yields evidence on how dramatically sustained large-scale irrigation can alter the regional hydrologic cycle not only through a) trivially depleting streamflow rates and/or lowering groundwater table levels; b) suppressing precipitation locally (while enhancing it a long distance downwind), but also; c) reversing the trajectory of the regional ET ratio under generally increasing trends of precipitation.

AB Despite its importance as a major element of the global hydrologic cycle, runoff remains poorly constrained except at the largest spatial scales due to limitations of the global stream gauge network and inadequate data sharing. Efforts using remote sensing to infer runoff from discharge estimates are limited by characteristics of present-day sensors. The proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, a joint project between the United States and France, aims to substantially improve space-based estimates of river discharge. However, the extent of rivers observable by SWOT, likely limited to those wider than 50-100 m, remains unknown. Here, we estimate the extent of SWOT river observability globally using a downstream hydraulic geometry (DHG) approach combining basin areas from the Hydrol k and Hydrosheds elevation products, discharge from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), and width estimates from a global width-discharge relationship. We do not explicitly consider SWOT-specific errors associated with layover and other phenomena in this analysis, although they have been considered in formulation of the 50-100 m width thresholds. We compare the extent of SWOT-observable rivers with GRDC and USGS gauge datasets, the most complete datasets freely available to the global scientific community. In the continental US, SWOT would match USGS river basin coverage only at large scales (>25,000 km(2)). Globally, SWOT would substantially improve on GRDC observation extent: SWOT observation of 100 m (50 m) rivers will allow discharge estimation in >60% of 50,000 km(2) (10,000 km(2)) river basins. In contrast, the GRDC observes fewer than 30% (15%) of these basins. SWOT could improve characterization of global runoff processes, especially with a 50 m observability threshold, but in situ gauge data remains essential and must be shared more freely with the international scientific community.

AB A series of rising and falling head slug tests with different initial applied head differentials (Delta H-o) were conducted in open fractured dolostone and sandstone boreholes using straddle packers isolating specific depth intervals (1.5 m length) to examine the influence of non-Darcian flow. The open holes were developed and inspected using video and acoustic televiewing (ATV) to ensure that evidence of skin effects due to drilling were absent. The transmissivity (T) values obtained from both the rising and falling head slug tests were very similar at low initial applied head; however, the T values were progressively smaller at larger Delta H-o, suggesting error due to non-Darcian flow. Non-Darcian flow behavior was confirmed by constant head step tests conducted in the same test intervals where the injection rate (Q) vs. applied head (dH) relationship became non-linear at relatively low injection rates, and the non-Darcian data also resulted in lower T values. For a series of slug tests conducted at different Delta H-o, non-Darcian flow effects gradually increased as Delta H-o increased, consistent with the trends for constant head step tests conducted in the same test intervals. To maintain Darcian flow conditions in the fractured dolostone and sandstone tested in this study, Delta H-o must be kept small, generally less than 0.2 m. This study demonstrates that by conducting both "stepped" slug tests and constant head step tests, the Darcian flow assumption for both types of tests can be rigorously validated. However, when only slug tests are conducted, it is necessary to conduct a series of "stepped" slug tests, including tests with small applied head differentials, to avoid errors due to non-Darcian flow.

AB The Sacramento Model (SAC-SMA) was calibrated to 12 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) river basins using a combination of manual and automatic (SCE-UA) calibration. Two sets of parameters were developed for each basin: those based on calibration (CAB) and those derived from soil-based algorithms (SoiB). Split-sample tests (20 years for calibration and 19 years for Testing or validation) of simulated hydrographs using CAB based parameters and SoiB based parameters were made to judge model effectiveness. Generally, simulations based on CAB parameters were superior to SoiB based simulations, though neither was satisfactory. To test for calibrated model parameter transferability, CAB parameters of each MOPEX basin were applied to the other 11 river basins (IntCAB). In terms of Bias the 144 sets of IntCAB results obtained were similar to SoiB parameters, but slightly interior in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-f). In an attempt to enhance parameter transferability, CAB parameters of basin j applied to basin i were re-scaled (IntCABSoiB), but the end results were similar to IntCAB, except the Bias statistics were marginally improved. Finally, IntCAB results in terms of the median Ef were regressed against basin simple hydrologic similarity measures computed in terms of the median Euclidean distance derived from: (a) three annual water budget measures (HED1, HED2, HED3), (b) monthly greenness fractions (GFED), and (c) physical arc distance (ArcDist). A simple regression between the median Ef and the median HED1, HED2, HED3 has a R-2 of 0.5, 0.48, and 0.47, respectively, which shows that RED is a limited indicator of hydrologic similarity. R 2 drops to about 0.3 when GFED is used to represent the hydrologic similarity. There was no predictive relationship between the median Ef and the median ArcDist. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Soil-water-climate-vegetation interactions jointly determine the ability of landscapes to provide ecosystem functions and services. In particular, spatio-temporal patterns in soil moisture underpin landscape ecohydrology. Though these patterns have been of interest to researchers for some time, there is new interest in the topic today as city managers engineer green infrastructure (GI) into urban landscapes. This paper presents soil moisture data collected from 2012 to 2014, and weighing lysimeter observations continuing through 2016, in two urban GI systems. Relationships between precipitation history, season, soil depth, hydraulic loading ratio (HLR) on the frequency and magnitude of soil moisture responses are described quantitatively. A logistic regression model is used to quantify the odds that each of these variables triggers a detectable soil moisture response. The results suggest that the higher HLR site (Site 2, HLR = 3.8) had 129.7% higher odds of a soil moisture response than Site 1 (HLR = 1). The results also indicate that there are 82.9% lower odds of a response in summer than in winter. Moreover, the odds of a response decrease with increasing soil depth. The linkage between GI siting and design decisions that impact soil moisture and ecosystem services is illustrated by also reporting evapotranspiration (ET) rates at the sites as determined by the lysimeter. Higher ET observed during wetter conditions supports the hypothesis that GI siting and design factors that lead to higher moisture content can engender greater ecosystem services associated with this hydrologic process. Indeed, the higher HLR of Site 2 sustained higher soil moisture levels during the summer compared to Site 1.

AB Among the four types of drought, socioeconomic drought, which has a direct impact on human production and daily life, is the least understood. The current socioeconomic drought index proposed by Mehran et al. (2015) is the Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI), which combines information on inflowdemand reliability and water storage resilience. The MSRRI resolves the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought. However, the MSRRI also has some flaws such as ignoring reservoir dispatching regulations and the relationship between water supply and water demand. Therefore, this study aims to improve the MSRRI through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand and proposing an improved MSRRI (IMSRRI). The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study, and comparison between the MSRRI and IMSRRI was conducted. The evolution characteristics of the IMSRRI series in the UYRB were examined. Additionally, cross-wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the associations between the IMSRRI series and climate factors. Results indicated that: (1) compared with the MSRRI, the IMSRRI could capture the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably due to the fusion of reservoir scheduling characteristics at a smaller timescale; (2) the socioeconomic drought in the UYRB had dramatically changed during the past few decades (the IMSRRI series showed a significantly decreasing trend and two change points (1995 and 1975) were captured); and (3) the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Oscillation (AO) showed significant influences on the short period (the influences of ENSO were stronger than AO), while sunspots had the strongest impacts on the long period.

AB Low flow conditions are governed by short-to-medium term weather conditions or long term climate conditions. This prorripts the question: given climate scenarios, is it possible to assess future extreme low flow conditions from climate data indices (CDIs)? Or should we rely on the conventional approach of using outputs of climate models as inputs to a hydrological model? Several CDIs were computed using 42 climate scenarios over the years 1961-2100 for two watersheds located in Quebec, Canada. The relationship between the CDIs and hydrological data indices (HDIs; 7- and 30-day low flows for two hydrological seasons) were examined through correlation analysis to identify the indices governing low flows. Results of the Mann-Kendall test, with a modification for autocorrelated data, clearly identified trends. A partial correlation analysis allowed attributing the observed trends in HD's to trends in specific CDIs. Furthermore, results showed that, even during the spatial validation process, the methodological framework was able to assess trends in low flow series from: (i) trends in the effective drought index (EDI) computed from rainfall plus snowmelt minus PET amounts over ten to twelve months of the hydrological snow cover season or (ii) the cumulative difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration over five months of the snow free season. For 80% of the climate scenarios, trends in HDIs were successfully attributed to trends in CDIs. Overall, this paper introduces an efficient methodological framework to assess future trends in low flows given climate scenarios. The outcome may prove useful to municipalities concerned with source water management under changing climate conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   INTERCEPTION
AB Stemflow is an important subcanopy flux that delivers enriched rainfall to soils immediately surrounding a tree. Stemflow volume represents the quantity of this hydrologic flux while funneling ratio (FR) represents the efficiency with which individual trees scavenge water during rainfall events. Stemflow hydrology and storm meteorological characteristics were monitored from 2007 through 2012 to determine the interspecific differences in stemflow flux with a focus on FR efficiency. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of tree species and size on stemflow FR, determine how seasonality affects stemflow FR, and quantify the role of storm meteorological conditions on stemflow FR. The results presented in this paper build upon 2 years of previous hydrologic research from the Fair Hill, MD field site, which strengthen previous findings via larger storm sample size and highlight more complex stemflow hydrologic relationships than originally assumed. Specifically, this study has demonstrated (1) the efficiency with which smaller trees gain access to rainfall via higher FR than larger trees, (2) the FR variability of F. grandifolia induced by the species' ease of generating stemflow under many storm conditions, and (3) the necessity of many years of hydrometeorological sampling to capture long-term rainfall characteristics and trends. The efficiency of smaller trees to preferentially funnel water to their tree base has implications for forests undergoing change. Forest disturbance and subsequent regrowth is dominated by smaller trees, but additional research is necessary to understand how saplings compete among one another to gain access to stemflow and how this may be influenced by changing climates and forest composition.

We employ the concepts of "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" and "catchment scale storm velocity" to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall variability and basin geomorphology on flood response. A calibrated distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the relevance of these statistics in describing the degree of spatial rainfall organization, which is important for runoff modeling. Furthermore, the Tar River Basin is divided into four nested sub-basins ranging from 1106 km(2) to 5654 km(2), in order to investigate the scale dependence of results. The rainfall spatio-temporal distribution represented in the analytical framework is shown to describe well the differences in hydrograph timing (less so in terms of magnitude of the simulated hydrographs) determined from forcing the hydrologic model with lumped vs. distributed rainfall. Specifically, the first moment exhibits a linear relationship with the difference in timing between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing. The analysis shows that the catchment scale storm velocity is scale dependent in terms of variability and rainfall dependent in terms of its value, assuming typically small values. Accordingly, the error in dispersion of simulated hydrographs between lumped and distributed rainfall forcing is relatively insensitive to the catchment scale storm velocity, which is attributed to the spatial variability of routing and hillslope velocities that is not accounted by the conceptual framework used in this study.

AB Hydrophobic soils, which form naturally in arid regions or after forest fires, can be problematic for land managers and engineers as they are often associated with impeded or preferential flow paths, increased surface runoff and soil erosion. However, the reduced rainwater infiltration capacity of water-repellent soils can also result in the improvement of the stability of slopes, landfills and capillary barrier cover systems, amongst others. Understanding the hydraulic conditions within these materials is critical if issues of stability and seepage are to become tractable.
   Traditional understanding of unsaturated hydrophobic soils suggests that convex water menisci, and so positive water pressures, should form between soil particles. However, the limited experimental results presented in the literature do not support this theory. In this work, the effect of particle shape on the formation and evolution of water meniscus structures is investigated at the macro (multiple particles) and particle scales, contrasting meniscus behaviours between spherical glass beads and angular sand grains. The spreading of a sessile drop in the macro-scale is examined and found that the angularity of the sand grains has a significant effect on the apparent contact angle of a sessile drop when deposited on a mono-layer of particles. At the particle scale, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to investigate the formation and evolution of capillary bridges and the water retention hysteresis during two wetting and drying cycles. Again, it is shown that the shape and surface roughness of the particles are controlling factors in both the formation and evolution of liquid bridges and that stable convex and concave menisci can co-exist simultaneously between hydrophobic particle surfaces. Additionally, it was found that the hydrophobic nature of the particles allowed menisci to form across much larger separation distances than could be achieved through film coalescence between hydrophilic surfaces, with possible consequences for infiltration and imbibition modelling and, more broadly, manufacturing processes relying on hydrophobic substrates. Lastly, the hydrophobic soils qualitatively exhibited overall much less hysteresis of the water retention curve than their hydrophilic counterparts.

AB Although previous studies have estimated the effects of human regulations on hydrological drought, few studies have examined the impacts from the perspective of the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. This study uses the Dongjiang River Basin in south China as an example and focuses on the influence of reservoir operation on hydrological drought. The Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and run theory were applied to determine the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. A semi-distributed hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate long time series (> 30 years) monthly streamflow data; the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using the monthly streamflow data from periods with less human regulations. Streamflow was then simulated and compared by using the same model parameters, as well as the sub-surface features, to simulate the streamflow during the human regulation periods. The "simulated-observed" comparative approach (i.e., a comparison of the characteristics of the hydrological drought obtained from the simulation-based SSI and observation-based SSI) was used to assess the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The results showed that the 'simulated-observed' comparison approach based on the SWAT model exhibited a good ability to ascertain the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The reservoir operation was the dominant factor affecting the hydrological drought propagation in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River basin and had mostly a short-term effect by decreasing the duration and severity of drought development (or recovery). However, the reservoirs tended to release water during the development process and to store water during the recovery process during a long-term hydrological drought in the study area, leading to an increase in average recovery duration and severity. The results of this study may further optimize water resources management system during drought for effective drought prevention and mitigation.

AB The implementation of best management practices (BMPs) is crucial for protecting and restoring watersheds from nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. BMP placement plans with a high pollution reduction to cost ratio are highly desired by decision makers. Nevertheless, few studies tackled such a ratio optimization problem in their efforts to identify BMP placement plans. BMP planning also faces challenges in handling inherent uncertainties and esti-mating NPS pollution loads. To address these gaps, a simulation-based inexact credibility-constrained mixed -integer fractional programming (SICMFP) model was proposed for supporting the placement of BMPs. This model was developed by integrating the export coefficient model (ECM), compound topographic index (CTI), inexact programming, and mixed-integer programming within a fractional programming framework. SICMFP extends the capability of previous BMP placement models by optimizing the ratio of conflicting objectives and handling uncertain parameters based on interval theory and credibility measure. It can also conveniently simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution loads through the ECM, and efficiently identify potential wetland sites using CTI. SICMFP was applied to plan BMP placement in the Luan River Basin, located in northern China. The results showed that SICMFP could provide BMP placement plans with the optimal system efficiency between pollution reductions and cost savings under different credibility levels. These plans could help decision makers gain in-depth insights into the tradeoffs between expected system efficiency and the risk of constraint violation. As the credibility level rises from 0.6 to 0.9, the optimal ratio between pollution reduction and cost declined from [0.88, 1.66] kg/103 yuan to [0.70, 1.15] kg/103yuan, whereas the costs and pollution reductions increased. Compared with the least-cost single-objective model, SICMFP could lead to more pollution reductions and higher system efficiency. The developed SICMFP approach can also be extended to address the ratio optimization problems of water pollution management in other watersheds.

AB Understanding the trend and variability in hydroclimatic extremes as well as drought characteristics in the context of changing climate is of paramount importance in the management of watershed and rain-fed farming systems. This study focuses on understanding the variations in rainfall patterns & drought types with 3 regions of the agro-climatic zone, in the Mahi River basin, India. The basin is surrounded by three states i.e. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat which is known for its substantial drought occurrences. Very limited studies have been carried out using agroclimatic indices. A 50 years of daily rainfall data (gridded, 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees spatial resolution) from 1970 to 2019 has been taken from India Meteorological Department (IMD) to compute extreme precipitation indices using ClimPACT2 package and time series trend was tested by Mann-Kendall. Further, 51 grid points are divided into three regions (region 1, region 2, and region 3) as per the agro-climatic zones over the Mahi River basin. The region-wise agroclimatic rainfall variability has been analyzed using monthly standard deviation and anomaly index. The run theory was applied for the characterization of drought assessment. Standardized precipitation index (SPI) was performed for 3, 6, 12, and 24-months. The result found a Consecutive dry day (CDD) with increasing trend significantly and Consecutive wet days (CWD) with decreasing trend may cause a possible impact on agriculture. Findings revealed that region 2 recorded consequent frequent and maximum droughts events over the basin. Hence, the regional topography and moisture availability perform a major role in regional precipitation variability. The output of the current study would be utilized in a better understanding of the drought condition and give a better climate change indication at a regional-basin level. This finding may be valuable for researchers to find out the crucial agro-climatic regions in the basin for preparedness for effective management and planning of water resources.

AB Flow connectivity in the hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) system describes the hydrological linkage between upland water and the channel network. However, the time and form of the establishment of HRS connectivity are not adequately understood. Herein, we examined how hillslope structure (topography and soil) and rainfall influence HRS connectivity in a steep, forested, zero-order catchment at the Hemuqiao Hydrological Experimental Station in Southeast China, from July 2016 to November 2017. To this end, surface and subsurface flow, soil moisture, and soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were observed, and soil dye staining experiments were conducted. Two patterns of HRS connectivity, namely saturation connectivity that initiates at the soil-bedrock interface (SCSB) and saturation connectivity at different soil horizons (SCSH), were identified. The persistence time of SCSH connectivity was short ( < 1 h), and the contribution of the perched interflow in different soil horizons to the total runoff was relatively small (0.6-3.0%). Instead, we found that the soil-bedrock interface acted as an important impeding layer that established HRS connectivity. That is, among the rainfall events during which HRS connectivity was established, 90% were established through SCSB connectivity and only 10% were established through SCSH connectivity. We further evaluated the time required to established HRS connectivity and found that SCSB connectivity required more time (4.6-67.4 h) than SCSH connectivity (< 1 h). We further found that rainfall intensity determined the initiation of connectivity and that the time required for HRS connectivity decreased exponentially with increasing rainfall intensity (R-2 = 0.67). Finally, we found that subsurface saturation excess flow, rather than Hortonian overland flow, was the main contributor to the flood peak during large events. In these events, the total volume of the runoff and flood peak were five and eight times higher than that of subsurface outflow, respectively. These results provide a clearer understanding of runoff generation and can narrow the gap between experiments and models for further development of hydrological theories and methods.

AB Stormwater detentions basins are designed to capture stormwater to reduce and delay peak flows and to improve water quality. A novel technology proposed to improve basin performance is real-time, active control of the basin outflow, in so-called "smart" stormwater systems. Existing studies demonstrate the performance of active controls that respond in real-time to basin water level, detention time, and rainfall forecast for one or a small number of rainfall events. We hypothesize that the performance of these active controls can be improved by incorporating real-time water quality data into the control algorithm. In addition, we hypothesize that active control performance depends on hydrologic variability, specifically the frequency and intensity of runoff inputs. In this paper, we test these hypotheses using a numerical modeling framework for systems-level reliability analysis of active and passive stormwater basin outflow control using a Monte Carlo method. The analysis is performed using the urban hydrology model EPA-SWMM driven by stochastic rainfall time-series generated from the Modified Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model. Water quality-informed real-time active control algorithms are developed, tested, and shown to display an improvement over traditional, passive (no control) systems and other storage-based active controls for water and pollutant capture. Seasonal and duration curve analysis showed that water level- and water quality- informed control performance varied for different storm return periods and this variability could partly be attributed to the fraction of time the valve is closed. In addition, control performance was sensitive to rainfall variability, generally decreasing as storms become less frequent and more intense. Therefore, control system performance may depend on seasonal and longer time scale variability in climate and rainfall-runoff processes. We anticipate this study to be a starting point to incorporate theories of reliability to assess detention basin and conveyance network performance under more complex real-time control algorithms and failure modes.

ID UNIT-HYDROGRAPH; RESIDUE MULCH; WATER; HEAT
AB Water balance of agricultural field are strongly modified by mulching techniques with crop residues as they act upon the production function (formation of the excess rainfall) and the transfer function (transport of the excess rainfall to the plot outlet). The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of crop residues on the production and the transfer functions at the plot scale. Previous experiments conducted on runoff plots (20 m(2)) were analyzed using the first differenced transfer function (FDTF) model which is based on the unit hydrograph theory. Four treatments were analyzed: bare soil (T0), no till and no plant with 1.5 t ha(-1) of residue mulch (T1), direct drilling of corn with 1.5 and 4.5 t ha(-1) of residue mulch (T2 and T3, respectively). Hyetographs and runoff hydrographs were collected at a 20 s time step. Transfer functions and implicit production functions were estimated on each plot using an iterative algorithm for the calibration. Then, model precision was tested (i) by stochastic simulations to estimate the local uncertainty due to experimental errors, and (ii) by performing a bootstrap analysis to assess the global uncertainty due to the effect of rainfall event sampling. The calibrated functions were consistent with experimental data: for T0, the large amount of runoff and the small time to peak of the experimental hydrographs was represented by a sharp and narrow transfer function, whereas for T3 the small and delayed amount of runoff was represented by a broader and more spread transfer function. Also, model precision was slightly affected by measurement errors on experimental data, whereas rainfall event sampling generated substantial uncertainties on the transfer functions. The FDTF model proved powerful in analyzing the effect of mulch covers when runoff data is available. The model was able to separate the effect of predicting rainfall excess and the transport of the excess rainfall over the plot. Also, the bootstrap methodology appeared useful to assess uncertainties on model parameters due to rainfall event sampling. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently a new theory of random self-similar river networks, called the RSN model, was introduced to explain empirical observations regarding the scaling properties of distributions of various topologic and geometric variables in natural basins. The RSN model predicts that such variables exhibit statistical simple scaling, when indexed by Horton-Strahler order. The average side tributary structure of RSN networks also exhibits Tokunaga-type self-similarity which is widely observed in nature. We examine the scaling structure of distributions of the maximum of the width function for RSNs for nested, complete Strahler basins by performing ensemble simulations. The maximum of the width function exhibits distributional simple scaling, when indexed by Horton-Strahler order, for both RSNs and natural river networks extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs). We also test a powerlaw relationship between Horton ratios for the maximum of the width function and drainage areas. These results represent first steps in formulating a comprehensive physical statistical theory of floods at multiple space-time scales for RSNs as discrete hierarchical branching structures.

ID PREDICTION; MODEL
AB Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear spatiotemporal prediction problem. However, few studies have considered the spatial characteristics of rainfall-runoff relationship in runoff forecasts based on machine learning. With the emergence of high-resolution Satellite-based Precipitation Products (SPPs) and the continuous improvement of rainfall estimation accuracy, the shortcoming of sparse spatial information for in-situ rainfall monitoring has been made up. Therefore, this study developed a large scale spatiotemporal deep learning rainfall-runoff (SDLRR) forecasting model for hydrological stations in the upper Yangtze River, and evaluated the positive impact of utilizing spatial information of three SPPs on reducing errors of runoff forecasts. The adopted remote sensing precipitation products are bias-corrected Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement data (IMERG) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis data (TMPA). For runoff fore-casting at the Luoduxi (LDX) hydrological station, compared to regular Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) model, the proposed SDLRR model that utilizing IMERG data as precipitation input (IMERG_SDLRR) improved 15% in terms of Coefficient of Determination (R2) and improved 25% in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compared to the best performance model among models using area-averaged precipitation as input, IMERG_SDLRR improved 5% in terms of R2 and 11% in terms of RMSE. Good performance was also ac-quired in the other hydrological stations. For extreme flood forecasts, IMERG_SDLRR decreased Mean Relative Error (MRE) by 0.29 and increased Qualified Rate (QR) by 53% compared to LSTM, and decreased MRE by 0.08 and increased QR by 6% compared to the best performance model using area-averaged precipitation as input. The utilization of IMERG or TMPA spatial information improved the accuracy of runoff forecasting. The accuracy evaluation of SPPs based on the results of spatiotemporal rainfall-runoff forecasts method was also demonstrated. The research is of great significance for developing runoff forecasting methods and optimizing water resources management.

AB In this study, we focus on the behavior of geogenic, toxic trace elements, particularly As, Cs, Cd, and Pb, during their transportation in two rivers for irrigation commonly used in monsoon Asia; one river originates from an active volcano, Mt. Asama, and the other originates from a currently inactive volcano, Yatsugatake Mountains in Nagano, Japan. These rivers were investigated to understand the role of river water as a pollutant of rice and other aquatic plants (via irrigation) and aquatic animals. The results indicated that the behavior of toxic trace elements in river water are likely controlled by their interactions with particulate Fe, Al, and Ti compounds. The majority of Pb and Cd is transported as particulate matter with Fe, Al, and Ti, while the majority of As is transported in the dissolved form, predominantly as arsenate, with low abundance of particulate matter. Cs is transported either as the dissolved form or as particulate matter in both rivers. The investigated elements are transported in the rivers as particulate and dissolved forms, and the ratio of these forms is controlled by the pH and presence of particulate Fe, Al, and Ti phases in the river water. With respect to Cs in both rivers, the parameter governing the concentration and transportation of Cs, in the bimodal form (i.e., particulate and dissolved forms), through the river possibly shifts from sorption to pH by particulate Fe-Al-Ti, according to the abrupt increase in the concentration of Cs in the river. The chemical attraction of particulate Fe-Al-Ti for Cs is weaker than that for Pb and Cd, indicating that the lower electronegativity of Cs weakens the chemical attraction on a colloid for the competitive sorption with the other trace elements. The different relationships between As and Fe in the river and in the irrigation water and soil water, as well as those in paddy rice, suggested that As in paddy rice is not directly derived from As in the irrigation water from the river under flooding.

AB Urbanisation alters the hydrological response of catchments to storm events and spatial measures of urban extent and imperviousness are routinely used in hydrological modelling and attribution of runoff response to land use changes. This study evaluates whether a measure of catchment urban extent can account for differences in runoff generation from storm events along an rural-urban gradient. We employed a high-resolution monitoring network across 8 catchments in the south of the UK-ranging from predominantly rural to heavily urbanised - over a four year period, and from this selected 336 storm events. Hydrological response was compared using volume-and scaled time-based hydrograph metrics within a statistical framework that considered the effect of antecedent soil moisture. Clear differences were found between rural and urban catchments, however above a certain threshold of urban extent runoff volume was relatively unaffected by changes and runoff response times were highly variable between catchments due to additional hydraulic controls. Results indicate a spatial measure of urbanisation can generally explain differences in the hydrological response between rural and urban catchments but is insufficient to explain differences between urban catchments along an urban gradient. Antecedent soil moisture alters the volume and timing of runoff generated in catchments with large rural areas, but was not found to affect the runoff response where developed areas are much greater. The results of this study suggest some generalised relationships between urbanisation and storm runoff are not represented in observed storm events and point to limitations in using a simplified representations of the urban environment for attribution of storm runoff in small urban catchments. The study points to the need for enhanced hydrologically relevant catchment descriptors specific to small urban catchments and more focused research on the role of urban soils and soil moisture in storm runoff generation in mixed land use catchments.

ID DISAGGREGATION; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; VARIABILITY
AB Downscaling site rainfall from daily to sub-daily resolution is often approached using the multiplicative discrete random cascade (MDRC) class of models, with mixed success. Questions in any application- for MDRCs or indeed other classes of downscaling model- is to what extent and in what way are model parameters functions of rainfall event type and/or large scale climate controls. These questions underlie the applicability of downscaling models for analysing rainfall and hydrological extremes, in particular for synthesising long-term historical or future sub-daily extremes conditional on historic or projected daily data. Using fine resolution data from two gauges in central Brisbane, Australia, covering the period 19082015, microcanonical MDRC models are fitted using data from 1 day to 11.25 min resolutions in seven cascade levels, each level dividing the time interval and its rainfall volume into two sub-intervals. Each cascade level involves estimating: the probabilities that all the rainfall observed in a time interval is concentrated in the first and the second of the two sub-intervals; and also two Beta distribution parameters that define the probability of a given division of the rainfall into both sub-intervals. These parameters are found to vary systematically with time of day, month of year, decade, rainfall volume, event temporal structure and ENSO anomaly. Reasonable downscaling performance is achieved in an evaluation period- in terms of replicating extreme values and autocorrelation structure of 11.25-min rainfall given the observed daily data- by including the parameter dependence on the rainfall volume and event structure, which involves 16 parameters per cascade level. Using only a volume dependence and assuming symmetrical probability distributions reduces the number of parameters to two per level with only a small loss of performance; and empirical relationships between parameter values and cascade level reduces the total number of parameters to four, with indetectable further loss of performance. Improving the parameterisation of the volume dependence is considered the most promising opportunity for improving at-site performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lowest reaches of a large-scale basin could be the discharge area of local, intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems with different travel distances and travel times. However, little research has been devoted to identify the flow systems in such a site. In this study, 44 groundwater samples were collected from wells with different depths in the discharge area of the Dosit River Watershed in the Ordos Cretaceous Basin. Using the major ions and pH as the input, hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted, which leads to five clusters (from Cl to C5) with distinct geochemical compositions. The relationship between delta D and delta O-18 shows that clusters Cl and C2 were recharged during the cold time while clusters C3, C4 and C5 were recharged recently. According to the Gibbs scheme, groundwater samples in all clusters except for C5 were controlled by rock-water interaction. Both hydraulic and geochemical perspectives were considered to identify the mechanisms of groundwater evolution. Both hydrochemistry and isotopes versus depth show a three-part structure with boundaries around depths of 200 m and 600750 m, which were assumed to be associated with the circulation depths of local and intermediate flow systems. After excluding C4 with highly variable water-types, three geochemical indicators (Cr, SO, and the slope of (Ca2+ + Mg2+) - (SO42- + HCO3-) versus (Na+ - Cl-) imply that the processes of water-rock interaction for clusters Cl, C2 and C3 include dissolution of halite and gypsum, weathering of feldspar, and ion-exchange. Moreover, it was found that C3 from local flow system, Cl from intermediate flow system, and C2 from regional flow system has increasingly higher concentrations of Cl- and lower values of Chloro-Alkaline index, which indicate increasingly higher degrees of dissolution and ion-exchange. This study not only reveals the mechanisms of groundwater evolution in the study area, but also provides a method to identify nested flow systems using hydrochemistry and isotopes.

AB A detailed characterization of vegetation structure is fundamental for physically-based hydrologic models to simulate various processes that determine rates of snow accumulation and ablation, evapotranspiration and water dynamics. However, major efforts focused on developing complex equations to describe hydrologic processes as a function of vegetation structure at the plot level have not been accompanied by corresponding attempts to adequately extrapolate these metrics over the wider landscape in order to parameterize fully-distributed models. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies offer alternatives to overcome these difficulties and therefore improve our capacity to monitor vegetation and hydrologic processes extensively. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) stands out as the most promising tool to provide detailed, 3-dimensional representations of vegetation from which a wide array of structural metrics can be estimated. On the other hand, moderate scale optical remote sensing imagery such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) offers the capacity to extrapolate these metrics across the landscape by virtue of its spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we correlate ALS-derived forest cover (FC), tree height (H), leaf area index (LAI) and sky view-factor (SVF) - the four main structural parameters used by hydrologic models - with a suite of spectral indices obtained from six spectral bands of a Landsat 5 TM image. Despite numerous sources of variation that affect the relationships between 2-dimensional spectral indices and three-dimensional structural metrics, models to predict FC, H, LAI and SVF with reasonable accuracy were developed. The extrapolation of these variables across a watershed in British Columbia severely affected by insect disturbance resulted in highly-detailed 30 m spatial resolution maps and frequency distributions consistent with the natural variation ranges of each metric - a major improvement compared to traditional approaches that use coarse, discrete vegetation classes in fully-distributed models. This article fits well with repeated calls from researchers to maximize the use of remote sensing tools in hydrologic studies, especially for larger catchments where satellite-derived data might be the only alternative to properly initialize models.

AB Rainfall erosivity (R factor) has been used as a primary input parameter for soil erosion, sediment yield and water quality modeling. At least 20 years of continuous high resolution rainfall data for the study area are required to compute original rainfall erosivity in (R)USLE, but such data are not available for many locations. Some simplified methods for estimating rainfall erosivity using readily available data have been presented to overcome this problem and are used in many countries. In Asia, annual precipitation is often used to estimate the R factor for (R)USLE modeling. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate models for estimating rainfall erosivity based on annual precipitation and to identify the most applicable model for Korea. Over 20 years of actual rainfall erosivity data for 33 Korean weather stations calculated by high resolution precipitation data were used in this study. Correlation analyses between actual rainfall erosivity and eight rainfall parameters were investigated to identify appropriate estimators of rainfall erosivity. We found that 31 of the 33 stations indicated a strong positive relationship (r > 0.5) between annual rainfall erosivity and annual precipitation with a 99% confidence level, but two stations indicated no correlation between the two variables. Twelve types of linear and nonlinear regression models were statistically evaluated for each weather station. Some parameters proved more useful to predict R factors for particular stations than annual precipitation. Nevertheless, the simplified estimation methods based on annual precipitation are still useful to predict long-term annual rainfall erosivity for the majority of locations in Korea. Finally, new simple regression models appropriate for each rain-gauge station were determined. Rainfall erosivities estimated by regression models for specific locations had limitations when used to predict actual rainfall erosivity in other locations due to site-specific conditions. Thus, simplified methods for estimating rainfall erosivity should be used with caution depending on location or period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Distributed information on land use and vegetation parameters is important for the correct predictions of evapotranspiration rate and soil water balance while, in turn, the growth and function of vegetation are also highly dependent on the soil water availability. In this study, the relationship between the soil water balance and the vegetation growth is represented by coupling a hydrological model (MIKE SHE) and a vegetation-SVAT model (Daisy) which simulates the interactions between soil, vegetation and atmosphere including the seasonal variation in plant structure and function. Because the. coupling of process models is accompanied by increasing difficulties in obtaining values for the numerous parameters required, the utility of satellite data to set up, verify and update such a model system is the focus of the present paper.
   To achieve spatially distributed information on surface conditions, field data of leaf area index (L) and eddy covariance fluxes were collected, and high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data were acquired to produce maps of land cover, leaf area index and evapotranspiration rates (E). The land cover map is used to set up the model which is run throughout 1998 for a Danish agricultural area with a time step of I It. In May, the spatial heterogeneity of the leaf area index is at its largest, and the model performance is evaluated in time and space using the field measurements and the RS-based maps of L and E. Finally, the effect of adjusting the simulated L to match the RS-based L is investigated. The adjustment strategy includes synchronization of all vegetation parameters to maintain congruity of the model canopy representation. While the predicted crop yields were improved, a large micro-scale spatial heterogeneity in L within the operational modelling units restricted improvements in the simulated E. The delineation of modelling units that are homogeneous with respect to the assimilated variable, L, requires separation of land use classes with respect to the temporal development in vegetation cover.

AB Our previous study summarized published data on dry-canopy evaporation in coniferous forests during the growing season and found a decrease in the Priestley-Taylor coefficient alpha with canopy height. We speculated that the decrease in alpha was caused by a decrease in stomatal, conductance with tree height. However, the decrease in alpha may also be explained by changes in leaf area index (LAI) and/or stem density with canopy height. We found no clear relationship between LAI and a in our previous study. Here, we examined the relationship between stem density and alpha and found no clear relationship, indicating that the decrease in alpha with increasing canopy height is not explained by changes in stem density. Thus, our results support the previous speculation that decrease in alpha was caused by a decrease in stomatal conductance with tree height. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WILLAMETTE RIVER; OREGON; EXCHANGE; SOLUTES; STREAM; ZONE
AB Field-calibrated models of hyporheic flow have emphasized low-order headwater systems. In many cases, however, hyporheic flow in large lowland river floodplains may be an important contributor to ecosystem services such as maintenance of water quality and habitat. In this study, we used a network of shallow monitoring wells, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and continuous monitoring to parameterize and calibrate stochastic three-dimensional ground water models for a 9.7 km(2) (2400 acres) area along a naturally-meandering section of the Willamette River floodplain in Oregon. This large river floodplain is representative of other similar systems. Steady-state simulations were done representing the wet winter and dry summer seasons. During the dry season, hyporheic flow was oriented along the floodplain elevation gradient and median steady-state residence times in small islands and bars were on the order of months. In the larger islands steady-state residence times were on the order of years. In the wet season, flow was oriented laterally away from the river and quickly intercepted and returned to the surface water system in alcoves and cutoffs connected to the river, and recharge due to infiltration of precipitation prevented hyporheic flow through older island areas. In the younger islands, median steady-state residence times ranged from about 6.1 x 10(1) to 1.6 x 10(2) days. In the model domain overall, the steady-state dry season median pathline length was about 8.2 x 10(2) with a maximum length of about 5.7 x 10(3) m. For the wet season, the median was about 2.0 x 10(2) m with a maximum length of about 3.5 x 10(3) m. Wet season hyporheic water penetrated deeper into the lower permeability geologic units by an order of magnitude, as compared to the dry season. This was likely due to the absence of precipitation infiltration during the dry season. We used particle tracking in order to characterize residence time distributions for hyporheic water. We found two behaviors: lognormal decay with shorter distributions of residence times, and heavy tailing, following power-law behavior. Interestingly, we found the heavy tailing behavior more during the wet season when mean residence times were short. This result implies that even though some rates of hyporheic flow were relatively fast, there were also zones of relatively stagnant water causing this large variation in residence time. Observed slopes for log-log plots of the histograms fell in the range of 2.3-5.6. This behavior appeared to be restricted to regions affected by natural river meandering, where avulsions create isolated islands. In some areas, land managers may consider revetment removal as a means to convert channelized systems to more natural systems with shallower depths in the main channel, meander scrolls, and alcoves that can enhance hyporheic flow. The results of this study provide information on how such decisions may affect the extent of hyporheic flow that may occur as a large river returns to its natural geomorphological dynamics.

AB Surrogate-assisted simulation-optimization technique is an effective approach for identifying aquifer remediation strategies. Using surrogate models to replace high-fidelity groundwater simulation models is key to reduce computing time. Inevitably, uncertainties persist in surrogate model structure and parameters and may lead to poor accuracy in prediction. However, past studies often adopt one surrogate to capture the original model response and rarely investigate uncertainties and approximation accuracy of surrogate models. In this study, we present an ensemble surrogate modeling approach to address uncertainty in surrogate model predictions for saltwater intrusion mitigation designs using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well. Firstly, polynomial response surface surrogate models are constructed to capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates of a horizontal well. Secondly, a stochastic optimization model that includes multiple ensemble surrogates is developed to determine the optimal saltwater extraction schedule. Chance-constrained (CC) programming is used to account for model selection uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear concentration constraints. Akaike information criterion correction (AICc) based Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method is adopted to determine required statistics of concentrations in the chance constraints. Finally, a set of saltwater intrusion mitigation strategies are obtained through an interior point optimization algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied to the saltwater intrusion problem in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A high-fidelity flow and solute transport model is developed, but requires 16 h for one model run. The study shows that the developed surrogate models perform well and have strong predictive capabilities with respect to the solute transport model response, while considerably reducing computation time. Including model selection uncertainty through multimodel inference and model averaging provides more reliable remediation strategies compared with the single surrogate assisted approach.

AB In this study, we aim to characterise natural variability of water temperature in surface waters of the Tatra Mts. and determine the dominant factors controlling its spatial diversity and seasonal patterns. For this purpose, a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes, vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The periodicity analysis were conducted with the Morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering a period of 5 years. The principal components analysis (PCA) has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability. The results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs. Wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns. The lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters. Temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations. Streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low, medium and high frequency behaviour. The PCA analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions, catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88.97% of the total variability in the data. The results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long-term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series. The study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature, and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters.

AB Spatial and temporal influences on the winter (December-March) stormflow characteristics of fifteen United States Geological Survey (USGS)-gaged watersheds in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains are identified: (1) watershed-scale differences in geomorphology; (2) continental-scale teleconnections during periods of wetness/dryness (based on the relative amount of winter precipitation over a consistent 20 year dataset); and (3) land cover in the context of soil parent material (e.g., development on alluvium/colluvium). Multiple regression was used to determine how much variance could be explained in five hydrologic variables describing the flashiness of peak flow (three original metrics), total seasonal flashiness (Richards Baker flashiness index), and the ratio of total winter stormflow to total discharge (the stormflow index). Models were constrained to three uncorrelated (vertical bar 0.65 vertical bar) variables to prevent overfitting to the dataset. Average-, dry-, and wet-years were subset using the z-scores for winter precipitation derived from the 4 km monthly PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) dataset, for the period of 1986-2006. Relief, slope, and landscape connectivity explain the majority of explained variance in all five of the hydrologic variables during all time periods. During dry-, average-, and wet-years, atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific/North American Pattern) explain more variance than total seasonal precipitation (PRISM), which is not true in the majority of the all-years models. Land cover explains only a small portion of the variance in regional stormflow and only when sub-divided based on soil parent material. Results provide a framework for connecting watershed-scale characteristics to regional- and continental-scale processes.

AB Modern water resources management has adopted natural flow regimes as reasonable targets for river restoration and conservation. The characterization of a natural flow regime begins with the development of hydrologic statistics from flow records. However, little guidance exists for defining the period of record needed for regime determination. In Taiwan, the Taiwan Eco-hydrological Indicator System (TEIS), a group of hydrologic statistics selected for fisheries relevance, is being used to evaluate ecological flows. The TEIS consists of a group of hydrologic statistics selected to characterize the relationships between flow and the life history of indigenous species. Using the TEIS and biosurvey data for Taiwan, this paper identifies the length of hydrologic record sufficient for natural flow regime characterization. To define the ecological hydrology of fish communities, this study connected hydrologic statistics to fish communities by using methods to define antecedent conditions that influence existing community composition. A moving average method was applied to TEIS statistics to reflect the effects of antecedent flow condition and a point-biserial correlation method was used to relate fisheries collections with TEIS statistics. The resulting fish species-TEIS (FISH-TEIS) hydrologic statistics matrix takes full advantage of historical flows and fisheries data. The analysis indicates that, in the watersheds analyzed, averaging TEIS statistics for the present year and 3 years prior to the sampling date, termed MA(4), is sufficient to develop a natural flow regime. This result suggests that flow regimes based on hydrologic statistics for the period of record can be replaced by regimes developed for sampled fish communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents the findings of a study aimed at decomposing a flow hydrograph into different segments based oil physical concepts in a catchment, and modelling different segments using different technique viz. conceptual and artificial neural networks (ANNs). An integrated modelling framework is proposed capable of modelling infiltration, base flow, evapotranspiration, soil moisture accounting, and certain segments of the decomposed flow hydrograph using conceptual techniques and the complex, non-linear, and dynamic rainfall-runoff process using ANN technique. Specifically, five different multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and two self-organizing map (SOM) models have been developed. The rainfall and streamflow data derived from the Kentucky River catchment were employed to test the proposed methodology and develop all the models. The performance of all the models was evaluated using seven different standard statistical measures. The results obtained in this study indicate that (a) the rainfall-runoff relationship in a large catchment consists of at least three or four different mappings corresponding to different dynamics of the underlying physical processes, (b) an integrated approach that models the different segments of the decomposed flow hydrogaph using different techniques is better than a single ANN in modelling the complex, dynamic, non-linear, and fragmented rainfall runoff process, (c) a simple model based on the concept of flow recession is better than an ANN to model the falling limb of a flow hydrograph, and (d) decomposing a flow hydrograph into the different segments corresponding to the different dynamics based on the physical concepts is better than using the soft decomposition employed using SOM.

AB Quantifying groundwater fluxes to and from deep aquifers or shallow sediment is a critical task faced by researchers and practitioners from many environmental science disciplines including hydrology, hydrogeology, ecology, climatology, and oceanography. Groundwater discharge to inland and coastal water bodies influences their water budgets, thermal regimes, and biogeochemistry. Conversely, downward water flow from the land surface or from surface water bodies to underlying aquifers represents an important water flux that must be quantified for sustainable groundwater management. Because these vertical subsurface flows are slow and typically diffuse, they cannot be measured directly and must rather be estimated using groundwater tracers. Heat is a naturally occurring groundwater tracer that is ubiquitous in the subsurface and readily measured. Most of the academic literature has focused on groundwater temperature tracing methods capitalizing on the propagation of diel temperature sine waves into sediment beneath surface water bodies. Such methods rely on temperature-time series to infer groundwater fluxes and are typically only viable in the shallow subsurface and in locations with focused groundwater fluxes. Alternative methods that utilize temperature-depth profiles are applicable across a broader range of hydrologic environments, and point-in-time measurements can be quickly taken to cover larger spatial scales. Applications of these methods have been impeded due in part to the lack of understanding regarding their potential applications and limitations. Herein, we highlight relevant theory, thermal data collection techniques, and recent diverse field applications to stimulate further multidisciplinary uptake of thermal groundwater tracing methods that rely on temperature-depth profiles.

AB The construction of cascade reservoirs upstream of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has been greatly intensified in the 21st century. While research attention is dedicated to the downstream effects of the TGR, few studies have been focused on the radical change of upstream inflows to the TGR. In this study, we reveal the impact of upstream cascade reservoirs on the annual runoff and sediment load inflows to the TGR based on the data in 1956-2016. The measured sediment load at control hydrological stations shows a drastic decrease (59%) while the runoff only had a slight decrease (6%). The similarity of these characteristics for that measured at Yichang indicates the leading effects of TGR inflows on its outflow. We develop a macroscopic quantification method utilizing double mass curves to separate the contribution from climate effects and human activities. Results show that precipitation (climate factors) dominated the runoff change, while human activities were the main driving factors for sediment load reduction in the studied area. In the four sub-basins upstream of the TGR, the sediment retention induced by large reservoirs was the major reason for sediment load reduction, especially in the Jinsha River Basin and the Jialing River Basin, which contributed 70% (or 347 Mt/yr) of the total sediment retention in the whole upper Yangtze River Basin (YRB) since 2015, much larger than that of the TGR (19% or 94 Mt/yr). As the total storage capacity of the cascade reservoirs increased to more than twice the TGR's capacity in the 2010s, the regression relationship between runoff and sediment load broke down. The unprecedented situation in the upper YRB may have profound impacts on the morphology and ecology of the TGR as well as the downstream Yangtze River including its delta.

AB Springs and hot spas have been used worldwide since ancient times as sources of potable, medicinal and bathing water, as well as for industrial purposes. They also sustain spring-dependent ecosystems and provide water flow to downstream ecosystems. We investigated the major element hydrogeochemistry of traditional springs, CO2-rich waters, and hot spas in South Korea and their relationships with features of bedrock geology and structural settings at the national scale to classify water types and identify the major factors controlling the occurrence of each water type. Three criteria-mineral content, CO2(aq), and water temperature-defined six major water types. Alkaline mineral water in carbonate rocks and sedimentary rocks result from readily weatherable lithology. The majority of mineralized waters are CO2-rich or thermal waters with a wide range of mineral contents. Their occurrence was found to be mainly concentrated near faults and boundaries between Early to Middle Jurassic granitic rocks and other rocks of much older ages, and this pattern was quantitatively identified through proximity analysis. This finding indicates that younger granitic rocks provide sources of heat and deep-seated CO2, and faults link these deep sources to groundwater flow. Hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals, including feldspar and biotite, is likely to supply major and minor solutes including Mg2+, F-, and Fe to CO2-rich and thermal waters. F- concentration appears to be regulated by the saturation states of calcite and fluorite, and Mg2+ concentration in alkaline thermal water is driven by the formation of Mg-bearing secondary silicates. We demonstrated that natural mineral water in tectonically stable regions has diverse thermal and hydrogeochemical properties that are mainly controlled by their lithological and structural settings at the regional scale. These results may help elucidate the generation processes of natural mineral waters with high cultural and ecological values, leading to their sustainable use and protection.

AB Permeability is an important physical characteristic of shales. A lot of researches have been made by scholars to study permeability of shales, but the study of permeability for moisturized shales are insufficient. Water exist in natural shales, therefore, the difference of permeability for dry and moisturized shales and the reasons causing the difference need to be studied carefully. The permeability of dry and wet crushed carboniferous shale samples from the eastern Qaidam Basin, China were calculated by the dynamic process data of methane adsorption equilibrium. To obtain moisturized samples under different water saturation, a portion of the samples was moisturized at relative humidity (RH) values of 65%, 85% and 95%. In addition, the thickness of water in pores of the samples of different RH were calculated. The permeability was reduced by almost one order of magnitude after samples were wetted, and the relationship between permeability and water saturation (S) fit the exponential equation well. By calculating the porosity of dry and moisturized samples, the porosity reduction and connectivity loss accounted for the permeability reduction. Clay minerals and specific surface areas were considered to have a positive effect on permeability reduction. The permeability of moisturized samples were not declined with the water saturation as expectation. The permeability values for each moisturized sample under different RH only fluctuated in a small range. Correspondingly, the biggest water film thickness of moisturized samples under different RH was also almost the same. The difference of the water film thickness between RH = 65% and RH = 95% for each sample is only about 1.8 nm. The small difference in water film thickness under different RH is regarded as the reason for the low permeability difference of moisturized samples.

AB Nitrate accumulation due to anthropogenic input in highly urbanized rivers is a general recognition. The excess anthropogenic nitrogen (N) can alter N transformations and would further accelerate nitrate accumulation. However, there is lack of direct evidence to reveal the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized river. In this study, multi isotopes of nitrate (delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-), ammonium (delta N-15-NH4+) and suspended particulate nitrogen (delta N-15-PN) were obtained to investigate mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in typical highly urbanization rivers in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Firstly, source apportionment revealed sewage was the dominant source of nitrate and ammonium, evidenced by higher delta N-15 values ( > +5 parts per thousand). Secondly, in the dry season, a significant correlation between the delta N-15-NO3- and delta N-15-NH4+ values, an increasing trend of delta N-15-NO3- with NO3--N concentration, and lower delta O-18-NO3- values provided isotopic evidence of nitrate accumulation that NO3- was increased by enhanced nitrification of sewage effluent NH4+. Thirdly, in the wet season, the relationships between the delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-, and lower isotope enrichment factor of denitrification indicated that denitrification in soils or riparian zones was weakened due to urbanization, which increased NO3- fluxes to the river water. Fourthly, the delta N-15-PN was significantly correlated with delta N-15-NH4+ rather than delta N-15-NO3-, revealing the preference of NH4+ uptake by phytoplankton. The NH4+ preferred assimilation repressed NO3- removal and consequently result in nitrate accumulation. This study provided direct lines of evidence by multi isotopes to understand the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers, which deepens our understanding of roles of isotopes in the study of N biogeochemical processes and has important implication for regional and global N cycling.

AB A rapid method for in-situ elemental composition analysis of metal-laden water would be indispensable for studying polluted water. Current analytical lab methods to determine water quality include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. However only two field methods, colorimetry and absorptiometry, exist for elemental analysis of water. Portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry is an effective method for elemental analysis of soil, sediment, and other matrices. However, the accuracy of PXRF is known to be affected while scanning moisture-laden soil samples. This study sought to statistically establish PXRF's predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A total of 390 metal-laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in South Africa were analyzed via PXRF and ICP-AES. The PXRF showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification. For the collected water samples, the best relationships between ICP and PXRF elemental data were obtained for K and Cu (R-2 = 0.92). However, when scanning ICP calibration solutions with elements in isolation, PXRF results indicated near perfect agreement; Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Pb produced an R-2 of 0.99 while Zn and Mn produced an R-2 of 1.00. The utilization of multiple PXRF (stacked) beams produced stronger correlation to ICP relative to the use of a single beam in isolation. The results of this study demonstrated the PXRF's ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal-laden water as reported by ICP for several elements. Additionally this study indicated the need for a "Water Mode" calibration for the PXRF and demonstrates the potential of PXRF for future study of polluted or contaminated waters.

AB The widely used design storms in urban drainage networks has different drawbacks. One of them is that the shape of the rainfall temporal pattern is fixed regardless of climate change. However, previous studies have shown that the temporal pattern may scale with temperature due to climate change, which consequently affects peak flow. Thus, in addition to the scaling of the rainfall volume, the scaling relationship for the rainfall temporal pattern with temperature needs to be investigated by deriving the scaling values for each fraction within storm events, which is lacking in many parts of the world including the UK. Therefore, this study analysed rainfall data from 28 gauges close to the study area with a 15-min resolution as well as the daily temperature data. It was found that, at warmer temperatures, the rainfall temporal pattern becomes less uniform, with more intensive peak rainfall during higher intensive times and weaker rainfall during less intensive times. This is the case for storms with and without seasonal separations. In addition, the scaling values for both the rainfall volume and the rainfall fractions (i.e. each segment of rainfall temporal pattern) for the summer season were found to be higher than the corresponding results for the winter season. Applying the derived scaling values for the temporal pattern of the summer season in a hydrodynamic sewer network model produced high percentage change of peak flow between the current and future climate. This study on the scaling of rainfall fractions is the first in the UK, and its findings are of importance to modellers and designers of sewer systems because it can provide more robust scenarios for flooding mitigation in urban areas.

AB Pre-excavation dewatering (PED) is an important construction stage in deep excavation. Field measurements show that retaining walls can develop obvious deflections during PED, which has been rarely considered in the past. The characteristics of PED-induced wall deflection, and the relationship of this deflection to surrounding ground deformation are still unclear. In this study, a PED test is simulated by a numerical model. The model is verified by field observations and used to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to PED. Results indicate that the maximum wall defection (delta(hm)) and surface settlement (delta(vm)) can all reach centimeter level under common conditions of PED. The ratio of delta(vm) to delta(hm) varies at the range of 0.45-0.67. Wall and soil deformations will be more obvious if the soils within the dewatering depth (H-d) have better permeability. The relative positions between H-d and strata (i.e., aquifer or aquitard) have great influence on the PED-induced deformations. If an aquifer appears below H-d, further increasing H-d can induce a rapid growth of wall and soil deformations. If thick aquitard appears below H-d, the deformation increments by further increasing H-d are not apparent. However, once H-d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard and reaches a thick confined aquifer, the wall deflections and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly. Meanwhile, a large bending moment in the retaining wall will arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer. The designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there, preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using monthly streamflow data from the 1960-2000 period and annual streamflow data from the 20012014 period, and also meteorological data from the 1960 to 2014 period from 815 meteorological stations across China, the Budyko-based hydrothermal balance model was used to quantitatively evaluate the fractional contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes in ten river basins across China. Particular importance was attached to human activities, such as population density and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and also water reservoirs in terms of their relationship with streamflow changes. Results indicated that: (1) streamflow changes of river basins in northern China were more sensitive to climate change than those of river basins in southern China. Based on the degree of sensitivity, the influencing factors to which streamflow changes are sensitive included: precipitation > human activities > relative humidity > solar radiation > maximum temperature > wind speed > minimum temperature. Hence, it can be argued that hydrological systems in northern China are more fragile and more sensitive to changing environment than those in southern China and hence water resources management in northern China is more challenging; (2) during 1980-2000, climate change tended to increase stream flow changes across China and have a dominant role in streamflow variation. However, climate change tends to decrease streamflow in river basins of northern China. Generally, human activities cause a decrease of streamflow across China; (3) In recent years such as a period of 2001-2014, human activities tend to have increasing or enhancing impacts on instream flow changes, and fractional contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes are, respectively, 53.5% and 46.5%. Increasing human-induced impacts on streamflow changes have the potential to add more uncertainty in the management of water resources at different spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are defined as wetlands that are completely surrounded by uplands. While GIWs are therefore spatially isolated, field-based studies have observed a continuum of hydrologic connections between these systems and other surface waters. Yet few studies have quantified the watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on downstream hydrology. Further, existing modeling approaches to evaluate GIW effects at a watershed scale have utilized conceptual or spatially disaggregated wetland representations. Working towards wetland model representations that use spatially explicit approaches may improve current scientific understanding concerning GIW effects on the downstream hydrograph. The objective of this study was to quantify the watershed-scale aggregate effects of GIWs on downstream hydrology while emphasizing a spatially explicit representation of GIWs and GIW connectivity relationships. We constructed a hydrologic model for a similar to 202 km(2) watershed in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, a watershed with a substantial population of GIWs, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We applied a novel representation of GIWs within the model, facilitated by an alternative hydrologic response unit (HRU) definition and modifications to the SWAT source code that extended the model's "pothole" representation. We then executed a series of scenarios to assess the downstream hydrologic effect of various distributions of GIWs within the watershed. Results suggest that: (1) GIWs have seasonally dependent effects on baseflow; (2) GIWs mitigate peak flows; and (3) The presence of GIWs on the landscape impacts the watershed water balance. This work demonstrates a means of GIW simulation with improved spatial detail while showing that GIWs, in-aggregate, have a substantial effect on downstream hydrology in the studied watershed.

AB A mathematical model has been produced to examine the impact of sewage sludge and fertilizer application to arable land and the effect of different crop regimes on the amount of nitrate leached to chalk groundwater. Previous work on nitrate leaching has concentrated on either a soil science or a hydrogeological approach with little overlap between the two, This study considered both fields to obtain an overall picture of the nitrate leaching process, IMPACT is a layered deterministic N-leaching model which predicts the nitrogen loads entering groundwater daily from arable land, and can be used as a management tool in development of sludge application and agricultural policy. The model relates nitrogen species movement resulting from the application of sewage sludge and fertilizer to differing vegetation-soil-hydrogeological conditions. Field data collected at three sites on the unconfined chalk aquifer of East Anglia, England over a two and a half year period was used to produce an initial conceptual model and to constrain the mathematical model during development. IMPACT simulates nitrogen and transport processes in the soil and unsaturated zone of the chalk. The nitrogen processes include: mineralisation of soil organic-N and sewage sludge organic-N, nitrification; crop uptake; volatilization; denitrification; and N inputs from fertilizers and precipitation. A mixing cell method is used to model solute transport in both the soil and chalk. Matrix flow and combined fissure-matrix Bow are considered for the chalk. The model enables examination of the relationship between the arable/hydrogeological systems and the environmental implications of sludge application and of different arable regimes. Results are of use in developing strategies for arable farming and sludge application in areas sensitive to nitrate leaching. This Part 1 paper describes the model development approach. Results of associated modelling scenarios are presented separately in the associated Part 2 paper. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Rain gauge networks' limitations and the implications to hydrological

AB Precipitation risk and water management is a key challenge for densely populated urban areas. Applications derived from high spatio-temporal resolution observation of precipitations are to make our cities more weatherready. Finer resolution data available from dual polarised X-band radar measurements enhance engineering tools as used for urban planning policies as well as protection (mitigation/adaptation) strategies to tackle climate-change related weather events. For decades engineering tools have been developed to work conveniently either with very local rain gauge networks, or with mainly C-band radars that have gradually been set up for space-time remote sensing of precipitation. Most of the time, the C-band radars continue to be calibrated by the existing rain gauge networks. Inhomogeneous distributions of these networks lead to only a partial information on the rainfall fields. Here we show that the statistics of measured rainfall is strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks and that this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields, in spite of the radar data calibration. In this work, we use the semi-distributed hydrological modelling over the Bievre catchment to generate a virtual rain gauges' network. And, firstly, performing a fractal analysis of this network distribution, we demonstrate that the semi-distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the distributed (weather radar) rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges. Then, with the help of the Intersection Theorem and multifractal theory, we statistically compare the virtual rain gauges' data with the rainfall data measured by the dual-polarimetric X-band radar operated at Ecole des Ponts with a spatial resolution of 250 m, providing pre-factors that indicate the need of a proper renormalisation of rain gauge rainfall data when comparing (or calibrating) with radar data and the possible counter productivity of this conditioning.
