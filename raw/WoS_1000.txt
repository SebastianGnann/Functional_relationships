AB Water operating rules have been universally used to operate single reservoirs because of their practicability, but the efficiency of operating rules for multi-reservoir systems is unsatisfactory in practice. For better performance, the combination of water and power operating rules is proposed and developed in this paper. The framework of deriving operating rules for multi-reservoirs consists of three modules. First, a deterministic optimal operation module is used to determine the optimal reservoir storage strategies. Second, a fitting module is used to identify and estimate the operating rules using a multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) approach. Last, a testing module is used to test the fitting operating rules with observed inflows. The Three Gorges and Qing River cascade reservoirs in the Changjiang River basin, China, are selected for a case study. It is shown that the combination of water and power operating rules can improve not only the assurance probability of output power, but also annual average hydropower generation when compared with designed operating rules. It is indicated that the characteristics of flood and non-flood seasons, as well as sample input (water or power), should be considered if the operating rules are developed for multi-reservoirs.

AB Many practical problems in water resources require knowledge of the sediment load carried by the rivers, or of the load the rivers can carry without danger of aggragadation or degradation. Hence, the measurement of sediments being transported by a river is of vital interest for planning and designing of various water resources projects. The conventional methods available for sediment load estimation are largely empirical, with sediment rating curves being the most widely used. The rating relationships baked on regression techniques are generally not adequate in view of the inherent complexity of the problem. In this Study, a fuzzy logic technique is applied to model the stage-discharge-sediment concentration relationship. The technique has been applied to two gauging sites in the Narmada basin in India. Performance of the conventional sediment rating curves, neural networks and fuzzy rule-based models was evaluated using the coefficient of correlation, root mean square error and pooled average relative (underestimation and overestimation) errors (PARE) of sediment concentration. Comparison of results showed that the fuzzy rule-based model could be successfully applied for sediment concentration prediction as it significantly improves the magnitude of prediction accuracy.

AB In order to provide more accurate reservoir-operating policies, this study attempts to implement effective monthly forecasting models. Seven inflow forecasting schemes, applying discrete wavelet transformation and artificial neural networks are proposed and provided to forecast the monthly inflow of Dez Reservoir. Based on some different performance indicators the best scheme is achieved comparing to the observed data. The best forecasting model is coupled with a simulation-optimization framework, in which the performance of five different reservoir rule curves can be compared. Three applied rules are based on conventional Standard operation policy, Regression rules, and Hedging rule, and two others are forecasting-based regression and hedging rules. The results indicate that forecasting-based operating rule curves are superior to the conventional rules if the forecasting scheme provides results accurately. Moreover, it can be concluded that the time series decomposition of the observed data enhances the accuracy of the forecasting results efficiently.

AB Flood forecasting is an important non-structural means of flood mitigation. An updating technique is a tool to update the forecasts of mathematical flood forecasting model based on data observed in real time, and is an important element in a flood forecasting model. An error prediction model based on a fuzzy rule-based method was proposed as the updating technique in this work to improve one- to four-hour-ahead flood forecasts by a model that is composed of the grey rainfall model, the grey rainfall-runoff model and the modified Muskingum flow routing model. The coefficient of efficiency with respect to a benchmark is applied to test the applicability of the proposed fuzzy rule-based method. The analysis reveals that the fuzzy rule-based method can improve flood forecasts one to four hours ahead. The proposed updating technique can mitigate the problem of the phase lag in forecast hydrographs, and especially in forecast hydrographs with longer lead times.

AB The use of power law forms to describe hydraulic geometry is a classic subject with a history of over 70 years. Two distinct forms of power laws have been proposed: at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) and downstream hydraulic geometry (DHG). Although the utility of these semiempirical expressions is widely recognized, they remain poorly understood in terms of the mechanisms underlying the differences between AHG and DHG, as well as the variability among different systems. In this study, we attempt to address these basic issues. Two hypotheses are proposed: (a) the different geomorphic relationships represented by AHG and DHG result from the control of lateral adjustment of the bank and flow turbulence over short and long timescales, respectively; and (b) the systematic variability of the AHG and DHG exponents is related to the description of the frictional resistance. These two hypotheses are embedded in our theoretical models and lead to explicit functional forms for AHG and DHG. The verification of our hypotheses is based on a large data set consisting of over 550 b-f-m exponents and 120 power law hydraulic relations. The analysis highlights the role of uncertainties in data acquisition and theoretical/statistical explanations. In addition, the theoretical expressions of AHG also provide an explanation of at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) in a physical sense. Overall, our work provides new insights into the fundamental theory of power laws and hydraulic geometry.

AB The relationship between the longitudinal dispersion (D-L) and Peclet number (Pe) is crucial for predicting and simulating tracer through the variable-aperture fracture. In this study, the roughness of the self-affine fracture wall was decomposed into primary roughness (relatively large-scale waviness) and secondary roughness (relatively small-scale waviness) by a multiscaled wavelet analysis technique. Based on the complete dispersion mechanism (diffusion, macrodispersion, and Taylor dispersion) in the variable-aperture fracture, three relationships (second-order, power-law, and linear relationships) between the D-L and Pe were investigated at large and small scales, respectively. Our results showed that the primary roughness mostly controlled the Taylor dispersion mechanism, whereas the secondary roughness was a dominant factor for the macrodispersion mechanism. Increasing the Hurst exponent and removing the secondary roughness led to the decreasing range of Pe where macrodispersion mechanism dominated the solute transport. It was found that estimating the D-L from the power-law relationship based on Taylor dispersion theory resulted in considerable errors, even in the range of Pe where the Taylor dispersion mechanism dominated. The exponent of the power-law relationship increased as the secondary roughness was removed. Analysing the linear relationship between the D-L and Pe revealed that the longitudinal dispersivity alpha(L) increased linearly. However, this linear increase became weak as the Taylor dispersion mechanism dominated. In the range of Pe where the macrodispersion mechanism dominated, increasing the Hurst exponent caused the increase of alpha(L) and the secondary roughness played a significant role in enhancing the alpha(L). As the Taylor dispersion mechanism dominated, the alpha(L) was insensitive to the influence of multiscale roughness in variable-aperture fractures.

TI FUZZY RULE-BASED MODELS FOR INFILTRATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUATION; SOILS
AB Modeling water movement in the unsaturated zone requires a great number of parameters, such as the initial water content, the saturated moisture content, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, which can relatively easily be assessed. Other functions such as the suction head and the relative hydraulic conductivity, which are highly nonlinear functions of the actual water content are more difficult to find. Furthermore, infiltration experiments carried out at a few locations can only define these parameters at selected locations, and a reasonable interpolation of these parameters is extremely difficult. In this paper, two fuzzy logic-based models are presented for the infiltration process. Basic definitions of fuzzy sets are given, and basic operations are explained. Principles of the rule-based infiltration models are presented. The rules for the first model are based on the moisture content of the adjacent layers and the depth of the wetting front. Using these rules, the flows can be calculated as exact quantities. The rules are derived from a training set which was obtained from several test runs of a Green and Ampt (GA) infiltration model. Separate rules are derived for the flow dynamics in the upper layer (runoff and infiltration), and for water flow between the layers. Examples of the application of the model are given. The model performs with similar accuracy as the GA model, using only 40% of its parameters and running 2 orders of magnitude faster. A training set obtained by numerical solution of the Richards equation was used to create a second fuzzy rule-based model. Here the rules are based on the moisture content of the adjacent layers. Results obtained by the use of the models are compared with measured values, showing a very accurate reproduction of the values.

AB This paper reviews socio-hydrology and hydrosocial research, finding a sophisticated relationship with emergent syntheses. We examined 419 papers by topic, region of study, theories implemented, journal, and year published to ascertain trends in both subfields. We found important overlap and considerable difference between subfields. Whereas hydrosocial research took years to develop, socio-hydrology commenced with an inaugural paper in 2012. While the former focuses on power and scale in studying water demand, the latter concentrates on practical responses to climate extremes. Hydrosocial research usually relies on qualitative methods, and socio-hydrology research the quantitative. In the geographic regions where the former does not focus, the latter does. The former often relies on post-structuralist theory, whereas the latter uses positivist approaches. Our review concludes that socio-hydrology and hydrosocial research exist in a complex epistemological relationship, offering fertile grounds for lively discussions from which both will continue to benefit.

AB Hydraulic properties of natural fractures are essential parameters for the modeling of fluid flow and transport in subsurface fractured porous media. The cubic law, based on the parallel-plate concept, has been traditionally used to estimate the hydraulic properties of individual fractures. This upscaling approach, however, is known to overestimate the fractures hydraulic properties. Dozens of methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the accuracy of the cubic law. The relative performance of these various methods is not well understood. In this work, a comprehensive review and benchmark of almost all commonly used cubic law-based approaches in the literature, covering 43 methods is provided. We propose a new corrected cubic law for incompressible, singlephase laminar flow through rough-walled fractures. The proposed model incorporates corrections to the hydraulic fracture aperture based on the flow tortuosity and local roughness of the fracture walls. We identify geometric rules relative to the local characteristic of the fracture and apply an efficient algorithm to subdivide the fracture into segments, accordingly. High-resolution simulations for Navier-Stokes equations, computed in parallel, for synthetic fractures with various ranges of surface roughness and apertures are then performed. The numerical solutions are used to assess the accuracy of the proposed model and compare it with the other 43 approaches, where we demonstrate its superior accuracy. The proposed model retains the simplicity and efficiency of the cubic law but with pronounced improvement to its accuracy. The data set used in the benchmark, including more than 7500 fractures, is provided in open-access.

AB Quantifying distributional behavior of extreme events is crucial in hydrologic designs. Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) relationships are used extensively in engineering especially in urban hydrology, to obtain return level of extreme rainfall event for a specified return period and duration. Major sources of uncertainty in the IDF relationships are due to insufficient quantity and quality of data leading to parameter uncertainty due to the distribution fitted to the data and uncertainty as a result of using multiple GCMs. It is important to study these uncertainties and propagate them to future for accurate assessment of return levels for future. The objective of this study is to quantify the uncertainties arising from parameters of the distribution fitted to data and the multiple GCM models using Bayesian approach. Posterior distribution of parameters is obtained from Bayes rule and the parameters are transformed to obtain return levels for a specified return period. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using Metropolis Hastings algorithm is used to obtain the posterior distribution of parameters. Twenty six CMIP5 GCMs along with four RCP scenarios are considered for studying the effects of climate change and to obtain projected IDF relationships for the case study of Bangalore city in India. GCM uncertainty due to the use of multiple GCMs is treated using Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) technique along with the parameter uncertainty. Scale invariance theory is employed for obtaining short duration return levels from daily data. It is observed that the uncertainty in short duration rainfall return levels is high when compared to the longer durations. Further it is observed that parameter uncertainty is large compared to the model uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coefficient (k) of the (-dQ/dt) - Q (discharge at time t) power-law relationship is typically computed after fixing the value of the exponent (alpha). However, recession analysis poses the challenge of finding a suitable alpha for a basin. Although many recent studies have suggested considering the median of the alpha distribution as the representative value, a purely logical reasoning for this has not been yet provided. In this study, we argue that there is no perfect approach to estimate alpha and that it should depend on the final objective. Recession flow prediction is considered the objective in this study. We employ a model to predict recession discharge for 408 USGS (United States Geological Survey), basins for a wide range of alpha values. Considering Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency as the indicator of model performance, we observed that the optimum value of alpha is substantially lower than the alpha median for most of the basins. Overall, our study establishes that there is no single value of alpha preferable for all practical purposes.

TI A fuzzy rule-based approach to drought assessment
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; PRESSURE; MODEL; MAPS
AB A methodology for predicting regional droughts from atmospheric pressure patterns is presented. Drought characteristics are strongly related to general circulation patterns (CP). CPs are determined from daily atmospheric pressure data. The link between large-scale CPs and regional scale droughts is modeled using a fuzzy rule-based approach. A fuzzy rule-based model operates on an ''if'' --> ''then'' principle, where ''if'' corresponds to a vector of fuzzy inputs and ''then'' corresponds to some fuzzy consequences. The rules are derived from a so-called training set which includes a daily time series of CP classes and a corresponding monthly sequence of Palmer Drought Severity Indices (PDSI). Split sampling of historical data available for a 35-year time period is used to derive and then to validate the rules. Then, these fuzzy rules may be applied to predict droughts in terms of atmospheric circulation patterns. The occurrence and persistence of CPs are expected to vary under global climate change. Thus the approach may also be useful in estimating the potential impact of climatic change (e.g., 2 x CO2 scenario) on droughts. The methodology is illustrated using drought index data from New Mexico and atmospheric pressure data over the western United States.

ID SUBSURFACE STORMFLOW PARAMETERS; DOMINANT PROCESSES CONCEPT
AB Recession flows of a basin provide valuable information about its storage-discharge relationship as during recession periods discharge occurs due to depletion of storage. Storage-discharge analysis is generally performed by plotting -dQ/ dt against Q, where Q is discharge at time t. For most real world catchments, -dQ/ dt versus Q show a power-law relationship of the type: -dQ/ dt = kQa. Because the coefficient k varies across recession events significantly, the exponent a needs to be computed separately for individual recession events. The median a can then be considered as the representative a for the basin. The question that arises here is what are the basin characteristics that influence the value of a? Studies based on a small number of basins (up to 50 basins) reveal that a has good relationship with several basin characteristics. However, whether such a relationship is universal remains an important question, because a universal relationship would allow prediction of the value of a for any ungauged basin. To test this hypothesis, here, we study data collected from a relatively large number of basins (358 basins) in USA and examine the influence of 35 different physio-climatic characteristics on a. We divide the basins into 2 groups based on their longitudes and test the relationship between a and basin characteristics separately for the two groups. The results indicate that a is not identically influenced by different basin characteristics for the two datasets. This may suggest that the power-law exponent a of a region is determined by the way local physio-climatic forces have shaped the landscape.

AB Computational pore-scale network models describe two-phase porous media flow systems by resolving individual interfaces at the pore scale, and tracking these interfaces through the pore network. Coupled with volume averaging techniques, these models can reproduce relationships between measured variables like capillary pressure, saturation, and relative permeability. In addition, these models allow nontraditional porous media variables to be quantified, such as interfacial areas and common line lengths. They also allow explorations of possible relationships between these variables, as well as testing of new theoretical conjectures. Herein we compute relationships between capillary pressure, saturation, interfacial areas, and common line lengths using a pore-scale network model. We then consider a conjecture that definition of an extended constitutive relationship between capillary pressure, saturation, and interfacial area eliminates hysteresis between drainage and imbibition; such hysteresis is commonly seen in the traditional relationship between capillary pressure and saturation. For the sample pore network under consideration, we find that hysteresis can essentially be eliminated using a specific choice of displacement rules; these rules are within the range of experimental observations for interface displacements and therefore are considered to be physically plausible. We find that macroscopic measures of common line lengths behave similarly to fluid-fluid interfacial areas, although the functional dependencies on capillary pressure and saturation differ to some extent.

AB Although it is well known that the vast majority of the time only a portion of any watershed contributes run-off to the outlet, this extent is rarely documented. Also, the power law form of the streamflow and contributing area (Q-A(c)) relationship has been known for a half century, but it is uncommon for it to be quantified, and time series of contributing area extensive enough to calculate its frequency distribution are almost non-existent. Data from the Canadian Prairies, where there are extensive estimates of contributing area during the median annual flood, imply that the power law coefficient for any Q-A(c) curve is a function of flow magnitude and return period. These data also suggest that regional flood frequency curves are a construct of Q-A(c) curves from individual basins. This paper will discuss research that attempted to reproduce the Q-A(c) curves for the La Salle River Watershed with a semidistributed numerical hydrological model, MESH-PDMROF. The model simulated streamflow reasonably well (Nash Sutcliffe values = 0.62) compared with published examples of comparable models applied in the region. Estimates of the coefficient and exponent of the Q-A(c) power law function ranged from 0.08-0.14 and 0.9-1.12, respectively. These exponent values were lower than those of regional flood frequency curves and support the theory that regional flood frequency curves are a construct of Q-A(c) curves. Simulations of the area contributing to the median annual flood were lower (0.3) than those derived from independent topographic analysis (0.9) described in earlier literature though there is uncertainty in both these estimates. This uncertainty was extended across the flood frequency distribution and may be too large to definitively verify the study hypothesis.

DE estuary process prediction
ID SALINITY INTRUSION; ALLUVIAL ESTUARIES; POWER; MODEL
AB Many estuaries in the world are ungauged. The International Association of Hydrological Sciences completed its science decade on Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) in 2012 (Hrachowitz et al., ). Prediction on the basis of limited data is a challenge in hydrology, but not less so in estuaries, where data on fundamental processes are often lacking. In this paper, relatively simple, but science-based, methods are presented that allow researchers, engineers, and water managers to obtain first-order estimates of essential process parameters in estuaries, such as the estuary depth, the tidal amplitude, the tidal excursion, the phase lag, and the salt water intrusion, on the basis of readily obtainable information, such as topographical maps and tidal tables. These apparently simple relationships are assumed to result from the capacity of freely erodible water bodies to adjust themselves to external drivers and to dissipate the free energy from these drivers as efficiently as possible. Thus, it is assumed that these systems operate close to their thermodynamic limit, resulting in predictable patterns that can be described by relatively simple equations. Although still much has to be done to develop an overall physics-based theory, this does not prevent us from making use of the empirical laws that we observe in alluvial estuaries.

AB Current understanding of nitrate export from catchments indicates that the transport dynamics are mainly driven by hydrological processes characterised by complex nonlinear relationships. The aim of this paper is to develop a hybrid deterministic-fuzzy rule based model capable of simulating catchment scale nitrate transport on the basis of the relationships between driving and resultant variables. The deterministic water balance model WaSiM-ETH is used for the simulation of hydrological flow components. The simulated flow components from the WaSiM-ETH model together with observations are used to develop a fuzzy rule based nitrate transport model. The fuzzy rules are derived using a simulated annealing optimisation procedure supplemented by knowledge about data relationships. The study is undertaken using daily time step data from the Weida catchment. in the North-Eastern Germany, which is a 100 km(2) subcatchment of the Weisse Elster river in the Elbe river basin. The models show reasonable performance with regards to the magnitude and dynamics of the streamflow, and nitrate-N concentration and load. The superior performance of the fuzzy rule based model in comparison to a multiple linear regression model indicates a complex nonlinear relationship between driving and resultant variables. The assessment of the rules provides explicit insights on the qualitative and quantitative relationships between different variables and their relative importance. The subsurface flow is found to be the most important variable which corresponds to the prevailing understanding that the nitrate transport processes are mainly driven by it. The relative importance of temperature as an input variable indicates the effect of seasonal. variability. The hybrid model is valid for present land use characteristics and management practices, which can be extended to include additional variables that affect nitrate entry to subsurface flow.

AB The purpose of this paper is to derive the general optimality conditions of the commonly used operating policies for reservoirs in parallel with joint water demand, which are defined in terms of system-wide release rules and individual reservoir storage balancing functions. Following that, a new set of release rules for individual reservoirs are proposed in analytical forms by considering the optimality conditions for the balance of total water delivery utility and carryover storage value of individual reservoirs. Theoretical analysis indicates that the commonly used operating policies are a special case of the newly derived rules. The derived release rules are then applied to simulating the operation of a parallel reservoir system in northeastern China. Compared to the performance of the commonly used policies, some advantages of the proposed operation rules are illustrated. Most notably, less water shortage occurrence and higher water supply reliability are obtained from the proposed operation rules.

AB Over the range of fracture spatial densities commonly observed in the field, existing effective medium models for network connectivity yield inconsistent results because the connectivity depends on both the density and length distribution of the joints. Field observations indicate that joint lengths often follow a power law length distribution. Requiring the frequency of joint lengths to decrease with increasing length and the total area of the joints to be finite suggests approximate upper and lower bounds on the power law exponent which are consistent with observed distributions. The appropriate relationship between connectivity and density is investigated numerically. Results motivate a new measure of fracture intensity, the effective fracture density, and the development of a new approach toward a closed-form prediction of connectivity using measurable parameters. Although limited, model predictions compare favorably to the conductivities of networks simulated using a geomechanical model and observed in the field.

AB Operating rules are important in the long-term operation of reservoirs for its capability of coping with inflow uncertainty. The characteristics of inflow vary as a result of climate change and human activities, and using stationary operating rules would lead to inefficient reservoir operation. This study focuses on identifying changing patterns of operating rules under various inflow alteration scenarios. Two simulation methods, the simple adjustment method (SAM) and the stochastic reconstruction method (SRM), are used to generate three inflow alteration scenarios: shifts of mean, coefficient of variation (C-V), and seasonality. A deterministic reservoir optimization model is established and then resolved using discrete differential dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, the operating rules under each scenario are derived using the linear fitting method. China's Three Gorges Reservoir is used as a case study. The results show that the SAM and SRM produce similar operating rules, which are sensitive to inflow changes during refill and drawdown periods. It is shown that (1) the increase (decrease) of inflow mean changes the operating rules, resulting in the increase (decrease) of the water releases while the shift of C-V has little impact on operating rules; (2) the seasonality changes operating rules in opposite directions during refill and drawdown periods; (3) the changing patterns of operating rules would be superimposed by the superposition of various inflow alteration scenarios whereas the effects might be not obvious. These findings are helpful for adaptive operation of reservoirs under changing environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hedging rules of reservoir operations decide the timing and magnitude of current water delivery reduction and consequent carryover water storage conservation based on the tradeoff between the utility of current and future water use. Different forms of hedging can be used for reservoir release decision. This study presents general optimality conditions for hedging with convex, concave, and linear relationships between reservoir water availability and release, using criteria based on the relative value of marginal value of risk tolerance (MVRT) with respect to current reservoir release versus carryover storage. MVRT is quantified to measure reservoir operators' risk tolerance change (sensitivity) to the change of reservoir release or carryover storage, reflecting their attitudes to the risk with current release and that with the carryover storage (i.e., future release), as well as their perception of future water availability uncertainty. Higher, equal, or lower MVRT with current release than that with carryover storage for future release corresponds to convex, linear or concave hedging. Various levels of risk tolerance toward hydrologic uncertainty underlie different hedging types for reservoir release decisions. Specifically, negative, positive, and null risk premiums (or risk seeking, risk aversion, and risk neutrality) result from convex, concave, and linear hedging rules, respectively. In general, high uncertainty will move the convex or concave curve closer to the linear curve. The MVRT-based criteria for optimal hedging policies are illustrated through a real-world case study.

AB Operating rules play an important role in enhancing the water utilization of reservoirs. Previous studies on hedging investigated the operating rules between water release (R) and available water (AW) based on minimizing the normalized shortage index, and applied the rules to optimization. However, seldom considered a realistic economic objective function to form a more general "supply-demand" relationship. To address this issue, this study formulated a theoretical function by a two-period reservoir operation model with the goal of minimizing the sum of economic loss from the current release and carryover storage targets. The derived function that guides the water supply was numerically validated to obtain the optimal time-varying hedging rules by nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The water-supply system of Dongwushi Reservoir in Hebei Province, China was selected as a case study. The results show that (1) The derived function depicts the relationship between "R-AW ratio" and "D-AW ratio", which is consistent with the Budyko "supply-demand" framework. (2) The optimized results using the derived Budyko hedging function outperform those using two-point hedging rule (TPH) and standard operating policy (SOP). (3) The derived function depicts a general non-linear "supply-demand" relationship rather than the linear one contained in commonly-used TPH. The derived function could be used for varied demands, indicating broader applications than TPH.

AB Decision rules provide an intuitive framework for water resources planning. Having adopted a rule-based plan, decision makers can monitor critical variables to trigger timely adaptation actions when the variables pass their predetermined thresholds. However, establishing a strategy that is comprised of a set of decision rules raises methodological challenges: (i) to identify observable indicators that provide reliable information about current and future change, (ii) to choose suitable statistics to characterize nonstationary time series that are germane to system performance, and (iii) to optimize threshold levels that trigger interventions. We propose a methodology that addresses these methodological challenges whilst explicitly balancing expected risks of water shortages with the costs of intervention in the water supply system. The four-step framework uses a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to search for and to identify the combinations of indicator-informed decision rules that govern if, when, and what supply options should be included in the water resource system. The rule-based strategies are dynamically tested against an extensive ensemble of future climate and demand scenarios to examine the trade-offs between strategy cost and level of service. The framework is applied to the London water system (England) using regional climate simulations to identify strategic rules for a 60-year planning period. The results demonstrate the utility of the framework, identifying observable indicators and decision thresholds that are used in optimal rule-based planning strategies. In key areas of the solution space, rule-based strategies reduce expected restriction costs on average by 13.1%, and as much as 24.1%, for a given intervention cost.

AB Dealing with uncertainty in water resource planning is problematic because insufficient or underused infrastructure can have social and environmental costs. Multistage stochastic optimisation provides a mechanism to deal with this challenge in water supply capacity expansion planning. However, for real systems it can be mathematically hard and computationally expensive. The 'Decision-rule' formulation represents an attempt to remedy this by approximating the multistage problem where decisions at each stage are a function of the uncertainty and the state of the system. We introduce a family of rules to show how they approximate the multistage problem and investigate the implications of the approximation for adaptive water resources planning.

AB Operating rules have been used widely to decide reservoir operations because of their capacity for coping with uncertain inflow. However, stationary operating rules lack adaptability; thus, under changing environmental conditions, they cause inefficient reservoir operation. This paper derives adaptive operating rules based on time-varying parameters generated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). A deterministic optimization model is established to obtain optimal water releases, which are further taken as observations of the reservoir simulation model. The EnKF is formulated to update the operating rules sequentially, providing a series of time-varying parameters. To identify the index that dominates the variations of the operating rules, three hydrologic factors are selected: the reservoir inflow, ratio of future inflow to current available water, and available water. Finally, adaptive operating rules are derived by fitting the time-varying parameters with the identified dominant hydrologic factor. China's Three Gorges Reservoir was selected as a case study. Results show that (1) the EnKF has the capability of capturing the variations of the operating rules, (2) reservoir inflow is the factor that dominates the variations of the operating rules, and (3) the derived adaptive operating rules are effective in improving hydropower benefits compared with stationary operating rules. The insightful findings of this study could be used to help adapt reservoir operations to mitigate the effects of changing environmental conditions.

AB Accurate quantification of formation resistivity factor F (also called formation factor) provides useful insight into connectivity and pore space topology in fully saturated porous media. In particular the formation factor has been extensively used to estimate permeability in reservoir rocks. One of the widely applied models to estimate F is Archie's law (F = phi(-m) in which phi is total porosity and m is cementation exponent) that is known to be valid in rocks with negligible clay content, such as clean sandstones. In this study we compare formation factors determined by percolation and effective-medium theories as well as Archie's law with numerical simulations of electrical resistivity on digital rock models. These digital models represent Bentheimer and Fontainebleau sandstones and are derived either by reconstruction or directly from micro-tomographic images. Results show that the universal quadratic power law from percolation theory accurately estimates the calculated formation factor values in network models over the entire range of porosity. However, it crosses over to the linear scaling from the effective-medium approximation at the porosity of 0.75 in grid models. We also show that the effect of critical porosity, disregarded in Archie's law, is nontrivial, and the Archie model inaccurately estimates the formation factor in low-porosity homogeneous sandstones.

AB This paper develops alternative strategies for European call options for water purchase under hydrological uncertainties that can be used by water resources managers for decision making. Each alternative strategy maximizes its own objective over a selected sequence of future hydrology that is characterized by exceedance probability. Water trade provides flexibility and enhances water distribution system reliability. However, water trade between two parties in a regional water distribution system involves many issues, such as delivery network, reservoir operation rules, storage space, demand, water availability, uncertainty, and any existing contracts. An option is a security giving the right to buy or sell an asset; in our case, the asset is water. We extend a flow path-based water distribution model to include reservoir operation rules. The model simultaneously considers both the physical distribution network as well as the relationships between water sellers and buyers. We first test the model extension. Then we apply the proposed optimization model for European call options to the Tainan water distribution system in southern Taiwan. The formulation lends itself to a mixed integer linear programming model. We use the weighing method to formulate a composite function for a multiobjective problem. The proposed methodology provides water resources managers with an overall picture of water trade strategies and the consequence of each strategy. The results from the case study indicate that the strategy associated with a streamflow exceedence probability of 50% or smaller should be adopted as the reference strategy for the Tainan water distribution system.

ID CHANNEL DISCHARGE MEASUREMENT; SITU QUALITY-CONTROL; VARIANCE; MODEL
AB A theoretical and a semi-empirical model are presented for estimating the uncertainty of streamflow measurements made with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted on a moving platform. Both models are based on the statistical analysis of ADCP ensemble discharge time series collected during a transect; therefore, they account for all random error sources associated with the measurement at a site. The theoretical model is developed based on the law of propagation of variance; it explores the theoretical relationship between the variables involved in the problem. The semi-empirical model is developed based on the theory of dimensional analysis; it explores the empirical relationship between the variables. The semi-empirical model is calibrated using 205 transect datasets and verified with an additional 382 transect datasets. It provides a useful tool for the uncertainty analysis and uncertainty-based measurement quality control of moving-boat ADCP streamflow measurements.

ID MISCIBLE DISPLACEMENT; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS
AB A series of careful laboratory soil column experiments was carried out for the purpose of providing data for testing recently presented theories of miscible density-dependent flow and transport. In particular, modifications to the standard theory involve extensions to both Darcy's (for flow) and Fick's laws (for diffusive/dispersive solute flux). Both coarse- and medium-grained sands were used in the experiments. All experiments concerned upward (i.e., stable) displacement of fresh water within the soil by a brine solution, under either constant head or constant volume flux conditions. The experimental data were analysed using accurate numerical solutions of the standard governing flow and transport model, as well as models with modified Darcy's and Fick's laws. Model parameters were determined by a step-wise fitting procedure based on the least-squares criterion. The results show clearly that, for large density contrasts, an extended Darcy's law was not necessary. On the other hand, an extension to Fick's Law was needed to model the experimental data accurately. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In a world with water resources severely impacted by technology, science must actively contribute to water law. To this end, this paper is an earth scientist's attempt to comprehend essential elements of water law, and to examine their connections to science. Science and law share a common logical framework of starting with a priori prescribed tenets, and drawing consistent inferences. In science, observationally established physical laws constitute the tenets, while in law, they stem from social values. The foundations of modern water law in Europe and the New World were formulated nearly two thousand years ago by Roman jurists who were inspired by Greek philosophy of reason. Recognizing that vital natural elements such as water, air, and the sea were governed by immutable natural laws, they reasoned that these elements belonged to all humans, and therefore cannot be owned as private property. Legally, such public property was to be governed by jus gentium, the law of all people or the taw of all nations. In contrast, jus civile or civil law governed private property. Remarkably, jus gentium continues to be relevant in our contemporary society in which science plays a pivotal rote in exploiting vital resources common to all. This paper examines the historical roots of modern water law, follows their evolution through the centuries, and examines how the spirit of science inherent in jus gentium is profoundly influencing evolving water and environmental laws in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. In a technological world, scientific knowledge has to tie at the core of water law. Yet, science cannot formulate law. It is hoped that a philosophical understanding of the relationships between science and law will contribute to their constructively coming together in the service of society. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   sustainable development
AB Wetlands perform functions that are both hydrological and ecosystemic. Both humans and the natural environment benefit from these. However, wetlands need to be managed in a sustainable way to ensure that, not only the present, but also the future benefits continue to accrue. Sustainable management techniques will almost necessarily require a degree of legal involvement. Although the law can be used to control what humans do, it cannot control how the natural environment behaves; it can only control what humans do in relation to the natural environment. As human populations grow and water resources dwindle, this continuing dilemma will become increasingly severe. To address this issue, the challenge is to construct a set of legal arrangements that successfully integrate both the natural and human processes relating to wetlands. This may include, for example, consideration of: (a) the legal arrangements relating to water in wetlands; (b) how sustainability is to be achieved in the context of wetland management; (c) how to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of humans and those of the natural environment; (d) how the interests of the natural environment are to be protected; and (e) who has the power to control activities in relation to wetlands. By reviewing the structure of laws relating to wetlands at a variety of scales, these issues are addressed from a legal perspective, and a broad overview is provided of how wetlands may be recognized within a selection of legal frameworks. By using examples from international law and also from other regional and local jurisdictions, we demonstrate, from a legal perspective, how it is possible to achieve the integration of natural and human processes.

AB Transpiration in water-limited ecosystems is controlled by the availability of soil moisture. Rain events in these natural environments may only partially wet the root zone, leading to a heterogeneous distribution of available water. This spatial variability coupled with the non-linearity of the function relating local uptake to local saturation produces a non-unique relationship when these quantities are scaled up. This work proposes a simple multi-valued relationship between plant transpiration and average root-zone saturation predicated on the distinct spatial patterns of wetting and drying. Predictions of daily transpiration from an upscaled model that uses this relationship match closely those from a vertically resolved model that employs an Ohm's law analogy for plant uptake.

AB Power law recession behavior has typically been attributed to the hydraulics of subsurface flows in the landscape (e.g., the Boussinesq equation). Many catchments exhibit enormous heterogeneity in their characteristics, such as the permeability of soils, hillslope length and gradient, and soil mantle thickness. In the paper we demonstrate using a simple linear flow model that the between-hillslope heterogeneity alone can give rise to observed apparently nonlinear recession slope curves. The degree of nonlinearity (represented by the exponent fitted to the recession slope curve) is shown to increase with the degree of heterogeneity of catchment hydraulic properties. In sufficiently heterogeneous catchments, the recession is also sensitive to the history of recharge events, tending to increase when the past events have built up a storage of water in the 'slow' parts of the catchment. The models based on the catchment heterogeneity were fitted to data from the Panola Mountain Research watershed, yielding a good fit, and allowing us to infer how the heterogeneity in catchment properties varies with scale. The range of exponents explained by this theory overlaps with the range explained by the hydraulics of subsurface flow, which raises doubts about our ability to extract catchment hydraulic parameters on the basis of recession curves so long as the heterogeneity is not accounted for. In general the results presented here have enabled us to show how the heterogeneity of landscape characteristics is upscaled and manifested in the apparent nonlinear relationship at the catchment scale.

AB The international legal principle of 'no-harm', as a customary international law, lies at the heart of numerous international transboundary water conventions, rules, and agreements. The current study identifies and examines the three most common categories of harm, namely health, environmental, and economic, in an integrated framework. Exploitation of the Kamal Khan dam over the Hirmand/Helmand Transboundary River internationally shared between Iran and Afghanistan has been selected as a case study. For this aim, an integrated modeling approach that links Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), dust storm events (DST) and crop production is developed to simulate the indicators and their parameters under historical conditions and future exploitation of the dam. Effects on the three types of harm are classified as being low, moderate or high. The results showed that the effects of the dam diversion for economic harm would be high. For instance, it could reduce the wheat production of the Iranian side of Sistan plain up to 70%. The hydrological alteration of the river is also significant, up to 80% during the winter and spring months. This can result in health and environmental harms. The region's health and environment are already in a critical situation mainly due to the drying of Hamoun wetlands, which rely on the inflows of the Helmand River and are the major sources of dust storms. Notably, these issues would affect the entire plain in both Iran and Afghanistan. The scope of this study was the principle of 'no-harm' but the methodology with some additional modifications could be considered for other principles like "equitable and reasonable utilization" in transboundary river basins.

From a case study of Hanjiang cascade reservoirs in China, we derive reservoir operating rules based on the combination of CIS and Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) methods and optimize the rules through Pareto-archived dynamically dimensioned search (PA-DDS) with two objectives: to maximize both power generation and water supply. We select the most effective input variables and evaluate their impacts on cascade reservoir operations. From the simulated trajectories of reservoir water level, power generation, and water supply, we analyze the multiobjective operating rules with several input variables. The results demonstrate that the CIS method performs well in the selection of input variables for the cascade reservoir operation, and the RBFs method can fully express the nonlinear operating rules for cascade reservoirs. We conclude that the CIS method is an effective and stable approach to identifying the most valuable information from a large number of candidate input variables. While the reservoir storage state is the most valuable information for the Hanjiang cascade reservoir multiobjective operation, the reservoir inflow is the most effective input variable for the single-objective operation of Danjiangkou.

AB We consider the problem of water usage, developing a model to analyze the optimal pricing of water within a second-best economy. A benevolent supplier provides water to multiple user groups and chooses sectoral prices to maximize social welfare subject revenue and resource constraints. We first analyze the optimal pricing rule in a static setup, and examine when it is optimal to deviate from the inverse elasticity rule. Then, we investigate the effects of both revenue and resource constraints in the dynamic model. We find that it could be possible to for the supplier to charge a higher price to the more elastic demand, when water gets scarce.

AB Fuzzy rule-based modeling is applied to the prediction of regional droughts (characterized by the modified Palmer index, PMDI) using two forcing inputs, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns (CPs) in a typical Great Plains state, Nebraska. Although, there is significant relationship between simultaneous monthly CP, lagged Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and PMDI in Nebraska, the weakness of the correlations, the dependence between CP and SOI and the relatively short data set limit the applicability of statistical modeling for prediction. Due to the above difficulties, a fuzzy rule-based approach is presented to predict PMDI from monthly frequencies of daily CP types and lagged prior SOIs. The fuzzy rules are defined and calibrated using a subset called the learning set of the observed time series of premises and PMDI response. Then, another subset, the validation set is used to check how the application of fuzzy rules reproduces the observed PMDI. In all its eight climate divisions and Nebraska itself the fuzzy rule-based technique using the joint forcing of CP and SOI, is able to learn the high variability and persistence of PMDI and results in almost perfect reproduction of the empirical frequency distributions.

AB This article paves a way for assessing flood risk by the use of two-parameter distributions, for the intervals between threshold exceedences rather than by the traditional exponential distribution. In a case study, the apparent properties of intervals between exceedences of runoff events differ from those anticipated for exponentially distributed series. A procedure is proposed to relate two statistical parameters of the intervals to threshold discharges. It considers partial duration series (PDS) with thresholds equal to all high enough observed discharges. To avoid unnecessary assumptions on the behaviour of those parameters and effects of dependence between parameters for different PDS, a non-parametric trend-free pre-whitened scheme is applied. It leads to power-law relationships between a discharge and the mean and standard deviation of the intervals between its exceedences. Predicted mean inter-exceedence intervals, for the highest observed discharges at the stations, are closer to the observational periods than those predicted by GEV distributions fitted to AMS, and by GP distributions to fitted PDS. In the present case, the latter predictions are longer than the observational periods whereas some of the predicted mean inter-exceedences are shorter than the corresponding observational periods and some others are longer.

AB Power-law spectral scaling violates assumptions of standard analyses such as statistical change detection. However, hydroclimatic data sets may be too short to differentiate the spectra of 1/f (alpha) vs low-order linear memory processes, an ambiguity exacerbated by the ubiquity of both process types. We explore this non-uniqueness problem by applying a heuristic tool to four examples from each of four hydroclimatic data types: circulation indices, station climate, river and aquifer conditions, and glacier mass balance. This selection spans much of the globe and includes some of the longest instrumental data sets available. The most common outcome is that power-law scaling is apparent, but the record is insufficiently long to discriminate between underlying mechanisms. The use of palaeoclimatic data to extend the instrumental record was investigated, but produced mixed results. Conversely, a balance-of-evidence approach, additionally incorporating physical process considerations, may help us recognize variate classes for which 1/f (alpha) scaling can be concluded. Practical recommendations are offered.

AB A fuzzy rule-based technique is used for modelling the relationship between climatic forcing and droughts in a Central/Eastern European country, Hungary. Two types of climatic forcing-called premises-are considered: atmospheric circulation patterns (CP) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Both the Hess-Brezowsky CP types and ENSO events influence the occurrence of droughts, but the ENSO signal is relatively weak in a statistical sense. The fuzzy rule-based approach is able to learn the high space-time variability of monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and results in a proper reproduction of the empirical frequency distributions. The "engine" of the approach, the fuzzy rules, are ascertained from a subset called the learning set of the observed time series of premises (monthly CP frequencies and Southern Oscillation Index) and PDSI response. Then an independent subset, the validation set, is used to check how the application of fuzzy rules reproduces the observed PDSI.

AB The basic aim of this paper is to formulate rigorous conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy for a watershed organized around the channel network. The approach adopted is based on the subdivision of the whole watershed into smaller discrete units, called representative elementary watersheds (REW), and the formulation of conservation equations for these REWs. The REW as a spatial domain is divided into five different subregions: (1) unsaturated zone; (2) saturated zone; (3) concentrated overland how; (4) saturated overland flow; and (5) channel reach. These subregions all occupy separate volumina. Within the REW, the subregions interact with each other, with the atmosphere on top and with the groundwater or impermeable strata at the bottom, and are characterized by typical flow time scales.
   The balance equations are derived for water, solid and air phases in the unsaturated zone, water and solid phases in the saturated zone and only the waterphase in the two overland flow zones and the channel. In this way REW-scale balance equations, and respective exchange terms for mass, momentum, energy and entropy between neighbouring subregions and phases, are obtained Averaging of the balance equations over time allows to keep the theory general such that the hydrologic system can be studied over a range of time scales. Finally, the entropy inequality for the entire watershed as an ensemble of subregions is derived as constraint-type relationship for the development of constitutive relationships, which are necessary for the closure of the problem. The exploitation of the second law and the derivation of constitutive equations for specific types of watersheds will be the subject of a subsequent paper. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

ID REAL-TIME OPERATION; OPTIMIZATION; MODEL
AB Flood water conservation can be beneficial for water uses especially in areas with water stress but also can pose additional flood risk. The potential of flood water conservation is affected by many factors, especially decision makers' preference for water conservation and reservoir inflow forecast uncertainty. This paper discusses the individual and joint effects of these two factors on the trade-off between flood control and water conservation, using a multiobjective, two-stage reservoir optimal operation model. It is shown that hedging between current water conservation and future flood control exists only when forecast uncertainty or decision makers' preference is within a certain range, beyond which, hedging is trivial and the multiobjective optimization problem is reduced to a single objective problem with either flood control or water conservation. Different types of hedging rules are identified with different levels of flood water conservation preference, forecast uncertainties, acceptable flood risk, and reservoir storage capacity. Critical values of decision preference (represented by a weight) and inflow forecast uncertainty (represented by standard deviation) are identified. These inform reservoir managers with a feasible range of their preference to water conservation and thresholds of forecast uncertainty, specifying possible water conservation within the thresholds. The analysis also provides inputs for setting up an optimization model by providing the range of objective weights and the choice of hedging rule types. A case study is conducted to illustrate the concepts and analyses.

AB Gauging stations where the stage-discharge relationship is affected by hysteresis due to unsteady flow represent a challenge in hydrometry. In such situations, the standard hydrometric practice of fitting a single-valued rating curve to the available stage-discharge measurements is inappropriate. As a solution to this problem, this study provides a method based on the Jones formula and nonlinear regression, which requires no further data beyond the available stage-discharge measurements, given that either the stages before and after each measurement are known along with the duration of each measurement, or a stage hydrograph is available. The regression model based on the Jones formula rating curve is developed by applying the monoclinal rising wave approximation and the generalized friction law for uniform flow, along with simplifying assumptions about the hydraulic and geometric properties of the river channel in conjunction with the gauging station. Methods for obtaining the nonlinear least-squares rating-curve estimates, while factoring in approximated uncertainty, are discussed. The broad practical applicability and appropriateness of the method are demonstrated by applying the model to: (a) an accurate, comprehensive and detailed database from a hydropower-generated highly dynamic flow in the Chattahoochee River, Georgia, USA; and (b) data from gauging stations in two large rivers in the USA affected by hysteresis. It is also shown that the model is especially suitable for post-modelling hydraulic and statistical validation and assessment.

AB For agent-based modeling, the major challenges in deriving agents' behavioral rules arise from agents' bounded rationality and data scarcity. This study proposes a "gray box" approach to address the challenge by incorporating expert domain knowledge (i.e., human intelligence) with machine learning techniques (i.e., machine intelligence). Specifically, we propose using directed information graph (DIG), boosted regression trees (BRT), and domain knowledge to infer causal factors and identify behavioral rules from data. A case study is conducted to investigate farmers' pumping behavior in the Midwest, U.S.A. Results show that four factors identified by the DIG algorithm-corn price, underlying groundwater level, monthly mean temperature and precipitation-have main causal influences on agents' decisions on monthly groundwater irrigation depth. The agent-based model is then developed based on the behavioral rules represented by three DIGs and modeled by BRTs, and coupled with a physically-based groundwater model to investigate the impacts of agents' pumping behavior on the underlying groundwater system in the context of coupled human and environmental systems.

AB The occurrence of sufficiently energetic flow events characterized by impulses of varying magnitude is treated as a point process. It is hypothesized that the rare but extreme magnitude impulses are responsible for the removal of coarse grains from the bed matrix. This conjecture is investigated utilizing distributions from extreme value theory and a series of incipient motion experiments. The application of extreme value distributions is demonstrated for both the entire sets of impulses and the maxima above a sufficiently high impulse quantile. In particular, the Frechet distribution is associated with a power law relationship between the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of impulses. It provides a good fit to the flow impulses, having comparable performance to other distributions. Next, a more accurate modeling of the tail of the distribution of impulses is pursued, consistent with the observation that the majority of impulses above a critical value are directly linked to grain entrainments. The peaks over threshold method is implemented to extract conditional impulses in excess of a sufficiently high impulse level. The generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the excess impulses, and parameters are estimated for various impulse thresholds and methods of estimation for all the experimental runs. Finally, the episodic character of individual grain mobilization is viewed as a survival process, interlinked to the extremal character of occurrence of impulses. The interarrival time of particle entrainment events is successfully modeled by the Weibull and exponential distributions, which belong to the family of extreme value distributions.

AB This study theoretically and experimentally explores the behaviour of axisymmetric gravity currents of Newtonian and power-law fluids in inhomogeneous porous media. Systematic heterogeneity along the vertical is represented by a power-law permeability variation governed by the parameter omega, mimicking trends in natural media. A self-similar solution describing (i) the rate of propagation and (ii) the profile of the current is derived by considering a current of volume proportional to time raised to a non-negative power alpha. Four critical values of alpha are determined: the first two affect the time dependency of the radius, height and average gradient of the current on flow behaviour index n and omega; the third one dictates if the current accelerates or decelerates; the fourth one governs the asymptotic validity of the thin current approximation. Experimental validation is performed using shear-thinning suspensions and Newtonian mixtures in constant- and variable-flux regimes. A stratified porous medium composed of four uniform strata of glass beads with different diameters is used for this purpose. The experimental results for the radius and profile of the current agree well with the self-similar solution except at the beginning of the process, due to the limitations of the 1-D assumption and to boundary effects near the injection zone. An uncertainty analysis indicates that the rheological fluid behaviour and the variation in permeability significantly affect the propagation of the current. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI An Ensemble Optimization Framework for Coupled Design of Hydropower
   Contracts and Real-Time Reservoir Operating Rules
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; MANAGEMENT; NETWORK
AB Revenues from hydropower generation often depend on the operator's ability to provide firm power in the presence of uncertain inflows. The primary options available for optimizing revenue are negotiation of a firm power contract before operations begin and adjustment of the reservoir release during operations. Contract and release strategy optimization are closely coupled and most appropriately analyzed with stochastic real-time control methods. Here we use an ensemble-based approach to stochastic optimization that provides a convenient way to construct nonparametric revenue probability distributions to explore the implications of uncertainty. The firm power contract is a simplified bilateral fixed price agreement that partially insulates operator and buyer from price fluctuations. The release control laws and firm energy target are jointly optimized to maximize the operator's expected revenue. Revenue probability distributions and related spill performance statistics indicate that predictive operating strategies such as stochastic dynamic programming and model predictive control can give significantly better performance than standard deterministic operating rules. The performance obtained from batch optimization with perfect inflow information establishes a convenient upper bound on potential revenue and provides a baseline for assessing the significance of differences between real-time operating strategies. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the benefits of predictive operational strategies are greatest for reservoirs with medium nondimensional residence times and less important for reservoirs with large residence times. Overall, probabilistic analysis of the coupled hydropower contract-operations problem provides a realistic way to assess revenue and risk for reservoirs that must provide firm power when inflows are uncertain.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are poorly known for tropical watersheds, even though the tropics contribute a disproportionate amount of solutes to the global ocean. The Luquillo Mountains in Puerto Rico offer an ideal environment to examine C-Q relationships across a heterogeneous tropical landscape. We use 10-30 years of weekly stream chemistry data across 10 watersheds to examine C-Q relationships for weathering products (SiO2(aq), Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) and biologically controlled solutes (dissolved organic carbon [DO[], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH4+, NO3, Po-4(3), K, and SO42+). We analyze C-Q relationships using power law equations and a solute production model and use principal component analysis to test hypotheses regarding how the structure of the critical zone controls solute generation. Volcaniclastic watersheds had higher concentrations of weathering solutes and smaller tributaries were approximately threefold more efficient at generating these solutes than larger rivers. Lithology and vegetation explained a significant amount of variation in the theoretical maximum concentrations of weathering solutes (r(2) = 0.43-0.48) and in the C-Q relationships of PO43 (r(2) = 0.63) and SiO2(aq) (r(2) = 0.47). However, the direction and magnitude of these relationships varied. Across watersheds, various forms of N and P displayed variable C-Q relationships, while DOC was consistently enriched with increasing discharge. Results suggest that PO43 may be a useful indicator of watershed function. Relationships between C-Q and landscape characteristics indicate the extent to which the structure and function of the Critical zone controls watershed solute fluxes.

AB Accurate prediction of the relative permeability to water under partially saturated condition has broad applications and has been studied intensively since the 1940s by petroleum, chemical, and civil engineers, as well as hydrologists and soil scientists. Many models have been developed for this purpose, ranging from those that represent the pore space as a bundle of capillary tubes, to those that utilize complex networks of interconnected pore bodies and pore throats with various cross-section shapes. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the effective-medium approximation (EMA) and percolation theory in order to predict the water relative permeability. The approach is general and applicable to any type of porous media. We use the method to compute the water relative permeability in porous media whose pore-size distribution follows a power law. The EMA is invoked to predict the relative permeability from the fully saturated pore space to some intermediate water saturation that represents a crossover from the EMA to what we refer to as the "critical region.'' In the critical region below the crossover water saturation S-wx, but still above the critical water saturation S-wc (the residual saturation or the percolation threshold of the water phase), the universal power law predicted by percolation theory is used to compute the relative permeability. To evaluate the accuracy of the approach, data for 21 sets of undisturbed laboratory samples were selected from the UNSODA database. For 14 cases, the predicted relative permeabilities are in good agreement with the data. For the remaining seven samples, however, the theory underestimates the relative permeabilities. Some plausible sources of the discrepancy are discussed.

AB The random topology model approximately predicts all orientation-free empirical laws of channel network planform. Explanation of the model's success has crucial significance for research direction. Shreve [1975] proposed the explanation that random factors dominate network development. An alternative explanation is that these geomorphologic laws are insensitive to topologic variability. Kirchner [1993] tested the sensitivity of the Horton ratios to particular types of topologic distribution. We extend the work of Kirchner to all orientation-free empirical laws of channel network planform. We test the sensitivity of the topologic analog of each law using non-topologically random network test samples. One type of sample is obtained with the stochastic variable-parameter ''Q model'' of network growth, used as a test example, where the probability of tributary development on interior and exterior links is allowed to vary. We show that the coefficients of all channel network planform laws vary with model parameter Q. It is possible that these laws are sensitive also to other models of network growth. We conclude that the success of the random model in approximately predicting geomorphologic laws may not be due to the insensitivity of these laws and is a result that remains unexplained.

AB A two-phase Euler-Lagrangian framework was implemented to investigate the flocculation dynamics of cohesive sediment in isotropic turbulence. The primary particles are modeled as sticky soft spheres using the discrete element method (DEM). The attractive van der Waals forces are modeled by the DLVO theory and the JKR adhesive contact theory. The near steady state equilibrium floc size distribution (FSD) strongly depends on the ratio of the turbulent shear to the floc strength (or particle stickiness). When turbulence is strong, a single peak around the Kolmogorov length scale appears in the FSD, and the distribution fits the Weibull distribution well. A power-law floc size distribution develops when the floc strength is greater than the destabilizing effect of turbulent shear. Sediment concentration does not significantly affect the shape of FSD or the average floc size. The average apparent floc settling velocity W-s increases with the average floc size. Fractal dimension of flocs decreases with the floc size following a power-law relation for large flocs. Settling velocity of flocs as a function of floc size also follows a power-law relation. Deviation from the power-law relationship is found for large flocs because of their porous nature. At equilibrium stage, the construction by aggregation is balanced with the destruction by breakup, and the construction by breakup is balanced with the destruction by aggregation. The aggregation kernel by turbulent shear and power-law breakup kernel can describe the dynamics reasonably well for the flocculation of cohesive sediment in homogeneous isotropic turbulence.

AB Hydrologic metrics have been used widely to quantify flow-ecology relationships; however, there are several challenges associated with their use, including the selection from a large number of available metrics and the limitation that metrics are a synthetic measure of a multi-dimensional flow regime. Using two case studies of fish species density and community composition, we illustrate the use of functional linear models to provide new insights into flow-ecology relationships and predict the expected impact of environmental flow scenarios, without relying on hydrologic metrics. The models identified statistically significant relationships to river flow over the 12 months prior to sampling (r(2) range 36-67%) and an environmental flow scenario that may enhance native species' densities while controlling a non-native species. Hydrologic metrics continue to play an important role in ecohydrology and environmental flow management; however, functional linear models provide an approach that overcomes some of the limitations associated with their use.

TI Hydraulic properties of two-dimensional random fracture networks
   following a power law length distribution 1. Effective connectivity
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PERCOLATION; PERMEABILITY; TRANSPORT; MODEL; FLOW
AB Natural fracture networks involve a very broad range of fractures of variable lengths and apertures, modeled, in general, by a power law length distribution and a lognormal aperture distribution. The objective of this two-part paper is to characterize the permeability variations as well as the relevant flow structure of two-dimensional isotropic models of fracture networks as determined by the fracture length and aperture distributions and by the other parameters of the model (such as density and scale). In this paper we study the sole influence of the fracture length distribution on permeability by assigning the same aperture to all fractures. In the following paper [de Dreuzy et al., this issue] we study the more general case of networks in which fractures have both length and aperture distributions. Theoretical and numerical studies show that the hydraulic properties of power law length fracture networks can be classified into three types of simplified model. If a power law length distribution n(l) similar to l(-a) is used in the network design, the classical percolation model based on a population of small fractures is applicable for a power law exponent a higher than 3. For a lower than 2, on the contrary, the applicable model is the one made up of the largest fractures of the network. Between these two limits, i.e., for a in the range 2-3, neither of the previous simplified models can be applied so that a simplified two-scale structure is proposed. For this latter model the crossover scale is the classical correlation length, defined in the percolation theory, above which networks can be homogenized and below which networks have a multipath, multisegment structure. Moreover, the determination of the effective fracture length range, within which fractures significantly contribute to flow, corroborates the relevance of the previous models and clarifies their geometrical characteristics. Finally, whatever the exponent a, the sole significant scale effect is a decrease of the equivalent permeability for networks below or at percolation threshold.

   ALLOCATION; STREAMFLOW; DIVERSION; ALGORITHM
AB Environmental flow schemes may be implemented through active or restrictive strategies. The former may be applied via reservoir releases, and the latter can be executed by reducing water demands. We present a dual active-restrictive approach to devising the optimal reservoir operation rules that aim to secure off-stream water supplies while maximizing environmental benefits. For the active part, a multicomponent environmental flow target (including the minimum and monthly flows) is incorporated in the operation rules. For the restrictive counterpart, we use a novel demands partitioning and prioritizing (DPP) approach to reallocating the demands of various sectors. The DPP approach partitions the existing off-stream demand and newly incorporated environmental demand and reassembles the two as the first-and second-priority demands. Water is reallocated to each demand according to the ratios derived from the prioritized demands. The proposed approach is coupled with a multicriteria optimization framework to seek the optimal operation rules for the existing Feitsui Reservoir system (Taiwan) under various scenarios. The best overall performance is achieved by an optimal dual strategy whose operational parameters are all determined by optimization. The optimal environmental flow target may well be a top-priority constant base flow rather than the variable quantities. The active strategy would outperform the restrictive one. For the former, a top-priority base flow target is essential; for the latter, the off-stream demand can become vanishingly small in compensation for the eliminated base flow target, thus promoting the monthly flow target as nearly the top-priority demand. For either the active or restrictive strategy, a prioritized environmental flow demand would provide a path toward the optimal overall performance. A significantly improved overall performance over the existing operation rules is unlikely if the active and restrictive parameters are both favorable to the off-stream demand.

AB Water age has become an important variable for the characterization of hydrologic systems. The goal of this paper is to analyze the role of multiple outflows, spatial components, and nonlinearities in age theory. We first extend the theory to linear systems with multiple outflows, including the relationship between age distribution at death and survival time distribution at birth. We further show that for each outflow there is a survival time distribution at birth, which normalized corresponds to the impulse-response function for the specific outflow. We also analyze how the impulse-response function affects both the amplitude gain and time delay of the outflow and the long-term average partitioning. With regard to linear spatially extended systems, we link the impulse-response function to the Green's function. This allows us to easily compute the loss function and the age distribution for the system. Finally, we focus on nonlinear systems to analyze the effects of storage-dependent and age distribution-dependent loss functions. By considering the Burgers' equation, we show how the relationships between spatial dynamics and the age distribution are complicated by nonlinearities.

AB An alternative procedure for assessment of reservoir Operation Rules (ORs) under drought situations is proposed. The definition of ORs for multi-reservoir water resources systems (WRSs) is a topic that has been widely studied by means of optimization and simulation techniques. A traditional approach is to link optimization methods with simulation models. Thus the objective here is to obtain drought ORs for a real and complex WRS: the Jucar River basin in Spain, in which one of the main issues is the resource allocation among agricultural demands in periods of drought. To deal with this problem, a method based on the combined use of genetic algorithms (GA) and network flow optimization (NFO) is presented. The GA used was PIKAIA, which has previously been used in other water resources related fields. This algorithm was linked to the SIMGES simulation model, a part of the AQUATOOL decision support system (DSS). Several tests were developed for defining the parameters of the GA. The optimization of various ORs was analysed with the objective of minimizing short-term and long-term water deficits. The results show that simple ORs produce similar results to more sophisticated ones. The usefulness of this approach in the assessment of ORs for complex multi-reservoir systems is demonstrated.

AB [1] A variety of surface roughness characterizations have emerged from nineteenth and twentieth century studies of channel hydraulics. When the water depth h is much larger than the characteristic roughness height k(s), roughness formulations such as Manning's n and the friction factor f can be explicitly related to the momentum roughness height z(o) in the log-law formulation for turbulent boundary layers, thereby unifying roughness definitions for a given surface. However, when h is comparable to (or even smaller than) k(s), the log-law need not be valid. Using a newly proposed mixing layer analogy for the inflectional velocity profile within and just above the roughness layer, a model for the flow resistance in shallow flows is developed. The key model parameter is the characteristic length scale describing the depth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave instability. It is shown that the new theory, originally developed for canopy turbulence, recovers much of the earlier roughness results for flume experiments and shallow gravel streams. This study is the first to provide such a unifying framework between canopy atmospheric turbulence and shallow gravel stream roughness characterization. The broader implication of this study is to support the merger of a wealth of surface roughness characterizations independently developed in nineteenth and twentieth century hydraulics and atmospheric sciences and to establish a connection between roughness formulations across traditionally distinct boundary layer types.

AB An overview of problems and errors arising when fitting parametric distributions and applying goodness of fit tests on samples containing roughly rounded off measurements is first illustrated. The paper then presents the rounding-off rule estimator (RRE), an original method that allows the estimation of the percentages of rainfall measurements that have been rounded at some potential resolutions. The efficiency of the RRE is evaluated using a wide set of samples drawn by different distributions and rounded off according to different rounding rules. Finally, the RRE is applied on 340 daily rainfall time series collected by the rain gauge network of the Sardinian Hydrological Survey (Italy). In most stations, results revealed the presence of significant percentages of roughly rounded-off measurements, even at 1 and 5 mm resolutions, rather than at the standard 0.1 or 0.2 mm discretization. The application of the proposed RRE may give important support to perform quality data analyses, to assess and discriminate methods to fit parametric distributions on rounded-off samples, and to detect if and how the precision of recorded measurements might have changed in long time series used for climatic change studies.

AB This article shows how to consistently and accurately manage the Lagrangian formulation of chemical reaction equations coupled with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by Quintard and Whitaker. Lagrangian methods prove very helpful in problems in which transport effects are strong or dominant, but they need to be periodically put back in a regular lattice, a process called remeshing. In the context of digital rock physics, we need to ensure positive concentrations and regularity to accurately handle stagnation point neighborhoods. These two conditions lead to the use of kernels resulting in extra-diffusion, which can be prohibitively high when the diffusion coefficient is small. This is the case especially for reactive porous media, and the phenomenon is reinforced in porous rock matrices due to Archie's law. This article shows how to overcome this difficulty in the context of a two-scale porosity model applied in the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes equations, and how to obtain simultaneous sign preservation, regularity and accurate diffusion, and apply it to dissolution processes at the pore scale of actual rocks.

AB A large number of complex fluids commonly used in industry exhibit yield stress, e.g., concentrated polymer solutions, waxy crude oils, emulsions, colloid suspensions and foams. Yield stress fluids are frequently injected through unconsolidated porous media in many fields such as soil remediation and reservoir engineering, so modelling their flow through this type of media is of great economic importance. However, obtaining macroscopic laws to model non-Newtonian flow poses a considerable challenge given the dependence of the viscosity of the fluid on pore velocity. For this reason, no macroscopic equation is currently available to predict the relationship between injection flow rate and the pressure drop generated during the flow of a yield stress fluid without using any adjustable parameter. In this work, a method to extend Darcy's equation to the flow of yield stress fluids through model unconsolidated porous media consisting of packs of spherical beads is presented. Then, the method is experimentally validated through comparison with a total of 572 experimental measurements obtained during the flow of a concentrated aqueous polymer solution through different packs of glass spheres with uniform size. An improved prediction of the pressure drop-flow rate relationship is achieved by taking into account the non-linear relationship between apparent shear rate and average pore velocity.

ID UNCERTAINTY; DESIGN
AB The present paper focuses on the governing equations for the sensitivity of the variables to the parameters in flow models that can be described by one-dimensional scalar, hyperbolic conservation laws. The sensitivity is shown to obey a hyperbolic, scalar conservation law. The sensitivity is a conserved scalar except in the case of discontinuous flow solutions, where an extra, point source term must be added to the equations in order to enforce conservation. The propagation speed of the sensitivity waves being identical to that of the conserved variable in the original conservation law, the system of conservation laws formed by the original hyperbolic equation and the equation satisfied by the sensitivity is linearly degenerate. A consequence on the solution of the Riemann problem is that rarefaction waves for the variable of the original equation result in vacuum regions for the sensitivity. The numerical solution of the hyperbolic conservation law for the sensitivity by finite volume methods requires the implementation of a specific shock detection procedure. A set of necessary conditions is defined for the discretisation of the source term in the sensitivity equation. An application to the one-dimensional kinematic wave equation shows that the proposed numerical technique allows analytical solutions to be reproduced correctly. The computational examples show that first-order numerical schemes do not yield satisfactory numerical solutions in the neighbourhood of moving shocks and that higher-order schemes, such as the MUSCL scheme, should be used for sharp transients.

AB The analysis of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships from low-frequency observations is commonly used to assess solute sources, mobilization, and reactive transport processes at the catchment scale. High-frequency concentration measurements are increasingly available and offer additional insights into event-scale export dynamics. However, only few studies have integrated inter-annual and event-scale C-Q relationships. Here, we analyze high-frequency measurements of specific conductance (EC), nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations and spectral absorbance at 254 nm (SAC(254), as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon) over a two year period for four neighboring catchments in Germany ranging from more pristine forested to agriculturally managed settings. We apply an integrated method that adds a hysteresis term to the established power law C-Q model so that concentration intercept, C-Q slope and hysteresis can be characterized simultaneously. We found that inter-event variability in C-Q hysteresis and slope were most pronounced for SAC(254) in all catchments and for NO3-N in forested catchments. SAC(254) and NO3-N event responses in the smallest forested catchment were closely coupled and explainable by antecedent conditions that hint to a common near-stream source. In contrast, the event-scale C-Q patterns of EC in all catchments and of NO3-N in the agricultural catchment without buffer zones around streams were less variable and similar to the inter-annual C-Q relationship indicating a homogeneity of mobilization processes over time. Event-scale C-Q analysis thus added key insights into catchment functioning whenever the inter-annual C-Q relationship contrasted with event-scale responses. Analyzing long-term and event-scale behavior in one coherent framework helps to disentangle these scattered C-Q patterns.

AB This study concerns the relationship between the power law recession coefficient k (in - dQ/dt = kQ(alpha), Q being discharge at the basin outlet) and past average discharge Q(N) (where N is the temporal distance from the center of the selected time span in the past to the recession peak), which serves as a proxy for past storage state of the basin. The strength of the k-Q(N) relationship is characterized by the coefficient of determination R-N(2), which is expected to indicate the basin's ability to hold water for N days. The main objective of this study is to examine how R-N(2) value of a basin is related with its physical characteristics. For this purpose, we use streamflow data from 358 basins in the United States and selected 18 physical parameters for each basin. First, we transform the physical parameters into mutually independent principal components. Then we employ multiple linear regression method to construct a model of R-N(2) in terms of the principal components. Furthermore, we employ step-wise multiple linear regression method to identify the dominant catchment characteristics that influence R-N(2) and their directions of influence. Our results indicate that R-N(2) is appreciably related to catchment characteristics. Particularly, it is noteworthy that the coefficient of determination of the relationship between R-N(2) and the catchment characteristics is 0.643 for N = 45. We found that topographical characteristics of a basin are the most dominant factors in controlling the value of R-N(2). Our results may be suggesting that it is possible to tell about the water holding capacity of a basin by just knowing about a few of its physical characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We characterize how different fracture size-transmissivity relationships influence flow and transport simulations through sparse three-dimensional discrete fracture networks. Although it is generally accepted that there is a positive correlation between a fracture's size and its transmissivity/aperture, the functional form of that relationship remains a matter of debate. Relationships that assume perfect correlation, semicorrelation, and noncorrelation between the two have been proposed. To study the impact that adopting one of these relationships has on transport properties, we generate multiple sparse fracture networks composed of circular fractures whose radii follow a truncated power law distribution. The distribution of transmissivities are selected so that the mean transmissivity of the fracture networks are the same and the distributions of aperture and transmissivity in models that include a stochastic term are also the same. We observe that adopting a correlation between a fracture size and its transmissivity leads to earlier breakthrough times and higher effective permeability when compared to networks where no correlation is used. While fracture network geometry plays the principal role in determining where transport occurs within the network, the relationship between size and transmissivity controls the flow speed. These observations indicate DFN modelers should be aware that breakthrough times and effective permeabilities can be strongly influenced by such a relationship in addition to fracture and network statistics.

AB Understanding the effect of sample size on hydraulic characteristics of porous media and estimating their scale dependent properties have been challenging in subsurface hydrology. An empirical power-law relationship has been widely applied to link permeability, k, to sample volume. However, due to its empiricism, accurately estimating the scale dependence of permeability, k(L), in soils and rocks has remained unanswered. In this paper, we combine concepts of percolation theory and finite-size effect, develop a theoretical relationship to model k(L), and evaluate the proposed model using various types of porous media. To estimate k(L), one requires porosity, critical porosity, critical scaling exponent, a fundamental length scale, system length, and permeability determined at the smallest scale. Comparison with numerical simulations shows that incorporating effects of porosity and finite size results in accurate estimates of k(L). We find reasonable agreement between the theory and the simulations with average relative error ranged between-27.5% and 10.2%.

AB Advances in Water Resources has been a prime archival source for implementation of averaging theories in changing the scale at which processes of importance in environmental modeling are described. Thus in celebration of the 35th year of this journal, it seems appropriate to assess what has been learned about these theories and about their utility in describing systems of interest. We review advances in understanding and use of averaging theories to describe porous medium flow and transport at the macroscale, an averaged scale that models spatial variability, and at the megascale, an integral scale that only considers time variation of system properties. We detail physical insights gained from the development and application of averaging theory for flow through porous medium systems and for the behavior of solids at the macroscale. We show the relationship between standard models that are typically applied and more rigorous models that are derived using modern averaging theory. We discuss how the results derived from averaging theory that are available can be built upon and applied broadly within the community.

AB We present a physics-informed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flows governed by Darcy's law. For saturated flow, we approximate hydraulic conductivity and head with two DNNs and use Darcy's law in addition to measurements of hydraulic conductivity and head to train these DNNs. For unsaturated flow, we approximate unsaturated conductivity function and capillary pressure with DNNs and train these DNNs using measurements of capillary pressure and the Richards equation. Because it is difficult to measure unsaturated conductivity in the field, we assume that no measurements of unsaturated conductivity are available. The proposed approach enforces the partial differential equation (PDE) (Darcy or Richards equation) constraints by minimizing the PDE residual at select points in the simulation domain. We demonstrate that physics constraints increase the accuracy of DNN approximations of sparsely observed functions and allow for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. For the saturated conductivity estimation problem, we show that the physics-informed DNN method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art maximum a posteriori probability method. For the unsaturated flow in homogeneous porous media, we find that the proposed method can accurately estimate the pressure-conductivity relationship based on the capillary pressure measurements only, even in the presence of measurement noise.

AB The adaptation of water resource systems to the potential impacts of climate change requires mixed portfolios of supply and demand adaptation measures. The issue is not only to select efficient, robust, and flexible adaptation portfolios but also to find equitable strategies of cost allocation among the stakeholders. Our work addresses such cost allocation problems by applying two different theoretical approaches: social justice and cooperative game theory in a real case study. First of all, a cost-effective portfolio of adaptation measures at the basin scale is selected using a least-cost optimization model. Cost allocation solutions are then defined based on economic rationality concepts from cooperative game theory (the Core). Second, interviews are conducted to characterize stakeholders' perceptions of social justice principles associated with the definition of alternatives cost allocation rules. The comparison of the cost allocation scenarios leads to contrasted insights in order to inform the decision-making process at the river basin scale and potentially reap the efficiency gains from cooperation in the design of river basin adaptation portfolios.

TI Solute transport across an interface: A Fickian theory for skewness in
   breakthrough curves
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID POROUS-MEDIA; DIFFUSION-PROCESSES
AB This paper provides a mathematical treatment of solute transport when the mean velocity is perpendicular to a sharp interface. For this case, the resident and flux-averaged concentrations can be derived from Fickian laws of convection-dispersion. In a recently reported approach to (deterministic) Fickian convection-dispersion equations it was shown that the concentration field describing solute transport parallel to a sharp interface could be equivalently expressed in terms of the distribution of a particular skew Brownian motion. The present paper is an extension of this theory to the case of Fickian convection-dispersion for solute transport in the direction of flow orthogonal to a sharp interface. Just as in the case of parallel interface, this is significant in that it leads to an explicit formula for the concentration field as well as providing some guidance to the further development of particle tracking methods for representing solute transport in discontinuous media. As an application of this theory we obtain specific results to explain the interesting types of symmetries and asymmetries in the breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer across an sharp interface recently reported by Berkowitz et al. (2009).

ID RASTER-BASED MODEL; HYDROLOGIC MODEL; RIVER; SPEED; PARAMETERS
AB An accurate comprehension of celerity (flood wave speed) dynamics is a key step for understanding flood wave propagation in rivers. We present the results of empirically estimated celerity values in 12 Brazilian rivers, and analyse the behaviour of celerity-discharge relationships (CxQ). Celerity was estimated with a reach-scale (RS) method, based on the peak travel time between stations; and with a local-scale (LS) method, based on the derivative of discharge-cross-section area relationships surveyed at gauging stations. The results indicate that the magnitudes of celerity values obtained by the methods are reasonably comparable, and can rarely be considered constant, varying with river discharge. Three reaches presented differing CxQ relationships at local and reach scales, which suggests that in situ cross-sections at gauging stations should not be extrapolated as representative of the whole reach for flood routing studies, and that CxQ relationship assessments might provide relevant insights for hydrological modelling.

ID PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; EXCEL SOLVER
AB Muskingum models are a type of hydrological flood routing approach and vary only in the form of storage relationship. The storage relationship was first established based on the weighted arithmetic mean. The weighted arithmetic averaging used in the classical linear Muskingum models is not the only way to express the storage in the river reach. This study proposes a generalized Muskingum model by establishing the storage using the weighted power mean between the storage volumes due to the inflow and outflow. All traditional models are special cases of the proposed model. The proposed model reduces to four novel storage equations that have not been reported before. The results show the proposed models (a) effectively capture the characteristics of the flood wave, (b) lead to results with higher efficiency compared to the traditional Muskingum models and (c) make it possible to select the most efficient model for a given river.

AB We present a theoretical and numerical study of the connectivity of fault networks following power law fault length distributions, n(l) similar to alpha l(-a) as expected for natural fault networks. Different regimes of connectivity are identified depending on a. For a > 3, faults smaller than the system size rule the network connectivity and classical laws of percolation theory apply. On the opposite, for a < 1, the connectivity is ruled by the largest fault in the system. For 1 < a < 3, both small and large faults control the connectivity in a ratio which depends on a. The geometrical properties of the fault network and of its connected parts (density, scaling properties) are established at the percolation threshold. Finally, implications are discussed in the case of fault networks with constant density. In particular, we predict the existence of a critical scale at which fault networks are always connected, whatever a smaller than 3, and whatever their fault density.

AB In Mediterranean areas, groundwater contributions are fundamental to maintain stream flow, especially during dry periods. Since groundwater withdrawal may affect stream discharge, understanding the hydraulic connectivity between streams and aquifers is critical to preserve stream runoff. However, assessing stream-aquifer interactions is often complex, due to spatial and temporal heterogeneities and the effect of diverse human pressures on the river system. Potential methods used to estimate this interaction work at different scales. All of them, however, offer complementary results which, in some cases, are difficult to integrate in a conceptual model for the stream hydrological dynamics that becomes useful to assess future water resources management actions.
   In this study we compare different Darcy's law and mass balance methodologies to analyze their effectiveness in determining these relationships: piezometers drilled in the stream bed were used to qualitatively describe the stream-aquifer relationship and potentiometric maps at small and large scales, respectively; the incremental flow methodology and end member mixing analysis quantified the magnitude and the proportion of surface water, waste water and groundwater contributions to the stream flow; and hydrochemical analysis using Piper diagrams, Cl-/Br- ratios, and delta O-18 and delta D-2 identified the main origin of stream water. Finally, principal component analysis satisfactorily describes the hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the stream and aquifer interface and it can be used as a valid approach to support estimations derived from the above mentioned procedures. Different seasonal behaviors, including the effect of bank storage in the stream runoff, could be only recognized by the comprehensive use of all these methods. In this sense, this paper illustrates the need of combining distinct methodologies to achieve an appropriate knowledge on the stream-aquifer interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Distributional analysis of river discharge time series is an important task in many areas of hydrological engineering, including optimal design of water storage and drainage networks, management of extreme events, risk assessment for water supply, and environmental flow management, among many others. Having diverging moments, heavy-tailed power law distributions have attracted widespread attention, especially for the modeling of the likelihood of extreme events such as floods and droughts. However, straightforward distributional analysis does not connect well with the complicated dynamics of river flows, including fractal and multifractal behavior, chaos-like dynamics, and seasonality. To better reflect river flow dynamics, we propose to carry out distributional analysis of river flow time series according to three "flow seasons": dry, wet, and transitional. We present a concrete statistical procedure to partition river flow data into three such seasons and fit data in these seasons using two types of distributions, power law and lognormal. The latter distribution is a salient property of the cascade multiplicative multifractal model, which is among the best models for turbulence and rainfall. We show that while both power law and lognormal distributions are relevant to dry seasons, river flow data in wet seasons are typically better fitted by lognormal distributions than by power law distributions.

AB Given increasing demands on finite water supplies, accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (LE) from arid shrublands of the Southwestern United States are needed to develop or refine basin water budgets. In this work, a novel approach to estimating the equilibrium (or wet environment) surface temperature (T-e) and LE from regionally extensive phreatophyte shrublands is tested using complementary theory and micrometeorological data collected from five eddy correlation stations located in eastern Nevada. A symmetric complementary relationship between the potential LE (LEp) and actual LE is extremely attractive because it is based on general feedback mechanisms where detailed knowledge of the complex processes and interactions between soil, vegetation, and the near-surface boundary layer can be avoided. Analysis of computed LEp and eddy correlation-derived LE indicates that there is unequivocal evidence of a complementary relationship between LEp and LE, where the measured and normalized complementary relationship is symmetric when T-e is utilized to compute the wet environment LE (LEw). Application of a modified Brutsaert and Stricker advection-aridity (AA) model, where T-e is utilized to compute LEw as opposed to the measured air temperature, indicates an improvement in prediction accuracy over the standard Brutsaert and Stricker AA model. Monthly and annual predictions of LE using the modified AA model are within the uncertainty of the measurement accuracy, making the application of this approach potentially useful for estimating regional LE in arid shrubland environments. Our observational evidence supports the idea of a symmetric complementary relationship yielding an approach with standard parameters, making it simple to apply with satisfactory accuracy. To our knowledge, this work presents the first application and evaluation of the complementary relationship in phreatophyte shrublands while utilizing the T-e with comparisons to actual LE via flux measurements.

AB This study examines relationships between model parameters and urbanization variables for evaluating urbanization effects in a watershed. Rainfall-runoff simulation using the Nash model is the main basis of the study. Mean rainfall and excesses resulting from time-variant losses were completed using the kriging and nonlinear programming methods, respectively. Calibrated parameters of 47 events were related to urbanized variables, change of shape parameter responds more sensitively than that of scale parameter based on comparisons between annual average and optimal interval methods. Regression equations were used to obtain four continuous correlations for linking shape parameter with urbanization variables. Verification of 10 events demonstrates that shape parameter responds more strongly to imperviousness than to population, and a power relationship is suitable. Therefore, an imperviousness variable is a major reference for analysing urbanization changes to a watershed. This study found that time to peak of IUH was reduced from 11.76 to 3.97 h, whereas peak discharge increased from 44.79 to 74.92 m(3)/s.

AB Overland flow, sediments, and nutrients transported in runoff are important processes involved in soil erosion and water pollution. Modelling transport of sediments and chemicals requires accurate estimates of hydraulic resistance, which is one of the key variables characterizing runoff water depth and velocity. In this paper, a new theoretical power-velocity profile, originally deduced neglecting the impact effect of rainfall, was initially modified for taking into account the effect of rainfall intensity. Then a theoretical flow resistance law was obtained by integration of the new flow velocity distribution. This flow resistance law was tested using field measurements by Nearing for the condition of overland flow under simulated rainfall. Measurements of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, corresponding to flow Reynolds number ranging from 48 to 194, were obtained for simulated rainfall with two different rainfall intensity values (59 and 178 mm hr(-1)). The database, including measurements of flow velocity, water depth, cross-sectional area, wetted perimeter, and bed slope, allowed for calibration of the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Gamma, the slope steepness s, and the flow Froude number F, taking also into account the influence of rainfall intensity i. Results yielded the following conclusions: (a) The proposed theoretical flow resistance equation accurately estimated the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for overland flow under simulated rainfall, (b) the flow resistance increased with rainfall intensity for laminar overland flow, and (c) the mean flow velocity was quasi-independent of the slope gradient.

AB Occam's Razor is a bedrock principle of science philosophy, stating that the simplest hypothesis (or model) is preferred, at any given level of model predictive performance. A modern restatement often attributed to Einstein explains, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Using principles from (algorithmic) information theory, both model descriptive performance and model complexity can be quantified in bits. This quantification yields a Pareto-style trade-off between model complexity (length of the model program in bits) and model performance (information loss in bits, or the missing information, needed to describe the original observations). Model complexity and performance can be collapsed to one single measure of lossless model size, which, when minimized, leads to optimal model complexity versus loss trade-off for generalization and prediction. Our view puts both simple data-driven and complex physical-process-based models on a continuum, in the sense that both describe patterns in observed data in compressed form, with different degrees of generality, model complexity, and descriptive performance. Information theory-based assessment of compression performance with fair and meaningful accounting for model complexity will enable us to best compare and combine the strengths of physics knowledge and data-driven modeling for a given problem, given the availability of data. "Suppose we draw a set of points on paper in a totally random manner" ..."I am saying it is possible to find a geometric line whose notation is constant and uniform, following a certain law, that will pass through all points, and in the sameorder they were drawn." ...

AB Hydrological studies focused on Hortonian rainfall-run-off scaling have found that the run-off depth generally declines with the plot length in power-law scaling. Both the power-law proportional coefficient and the scaling exponent show great variability for specific conditions, but why and how they vary remain unclear. In the present study, the scaling of hillslope Hortonian rainfall-run-off processes is investigated for different rainfall, soil infiltration, and hillslope surface characteristics using the physically based cell-based rainfall-infiltration-run-off model. The results show that both temporally intermittent and steady rainfalls can result in prominent power-law scaling at the initial stage of run-off generation. Then, the magnitude of the power-law scaling decreases gradually due to the decreasing run-on effect. The power-law scaling is most sensitive to the rainfall and soil infiltration parameters. When the ratio of rainfall to infiltration exceeds a critical value, the magnitude of the power-law scaling tends to decrease notably. For different intermittent rainfall patterns, the power-law exponent varies in the range of -1.0 to -0.113, which shows an approximately logarithmic increasing trend for the proportional coefficient as a function of the run-off coefficient. The scaling is also sensitive to the surface roughness, soil sealing, slope angle, and hillslope geometry because these factors control the run-off routing and run-on infiltration processes. These results provide insights into the variable scaling of the Hortonian rainfall-run-off process, which are expected to benefit modelling of large-scale hydrological and ecological processes.

AB The paper develops an efficient macro-evolutionary multiobjective genetic algorithm (MMGA) for optimizing the rule curves of a multi-purpose reservoir system in Taiwan. Macro-evolution is a new kind of high-level species evolution that can avoid premature convergence that may arise during the selection process of conventional GAs. MMGA enriches the capabilities of GA to handle multiobjective problems by diversifying the solution set. Simulation results using a benchmark test problem indicate that the proposed MMGA yields better-spread solutions and converges closer to the true Pareto frontier than the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). When applied to a real case study, MMGA is able to generate uniformly spread solutions for a two-objective problem involving water supply and hydropower generation. Results of this work indicate that the proposed MMGA is highly competitive and provides a viable alternative to solve multiobjective optimization problems for water resources planning and management.

AB [1] An integrated, largely nonprobabilistic, calibration-free approach is proposed to identify, estimate, evaluate, and attribute conceptual components of a streamflow time series. We assess its gross functional aggregation from the signal structure alone by consistently exploiting elementary constraints. Starting from the separability concept of linear operator theory, cross connections are revealed of such a blind functional streamflow disaggregation to qualitative dynamics. The algorithm is initialized by a first guess of regular behavior using singular-system analysis (SSA). To approach the regular/singular borderline of the data and to separate a fast flow from total runoff, this (probabilistic) SSA mode is transformed into a lower envelope to the series via iterative cubic spline interpolation (CSI). Repeated CSI yields a hierarchy of lower envelopes that piles up part of a transient component and converges into a slow one. A lower bound is constructed as an instantaneous low flow using the leading SSA eigenvector. We demonstrate the method for highlands river stations, compare its results with those from distributed hydrologic models, and discuss attributions to overland flow, interflow, and base flow. For independent evaluation we resort to singularity-based multifractal analyses.

AB We present a data-guided framework to explore the hydrological basis of the Budyko curve, focusing on the role of soil moisture in mediating the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evaporation and the role of climate in this partitioning. The conceptual framework for the derivation of the Budyko curve builds on empirically based power law relationships for long-term average scaled runoff (Q/P) and scaled evaporation (E/E-p), both as functions of long-term average (equilibrium) soil moisture. A second component of the framework is an empirical power law relationship between equilibrium soil moisture and the aridity index, E-p/P. Combinations of these empirical power law relationships with the long-term water balance equation give rise to a form of the Budyko curve, which is a close approximation to Budyko's original relationship and is mathematically similar to the Turc-Pike equation, thus supporting the role of equilibrium soil moisture in giving rise to the Budyko curve. In the remainder of the paper, for special cases of the parameter values of the power law relationships, we independently derive both the soil moisture dependence on E-p/P as well as the Budyko curve itself that not only reproduces a new Budyko-type curve, but can also explain the spread of the empirical data points away from the mean curve. The paper also raises fresh questions about how the empirical power law relationships that govern the soil-mediated precipitation partitioning may have emerged and the role of vegetation in that mediation.

AB Contrary to common belief, Fisher-Tippett's extreme value (EV) theory does not typically apply to annual rainfall maxima. Similarly, Pickands' extreme excess (EE) theory does not typically apply to rainfall excesses above thresholds on the order of the annual maximum. This is true not just for long-averaging durations d but also for short d and in the high-resolution limit as d -> 0. We reach these conclusions by applying large-deviation theory to multiplicative rainfall models with scale-invariant structure. We derive several asymptotic results. One is that, as d -> 0, the annual maximum rainfall intensity in d, I-yr,I-d, has generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with a shape parameter k that is significantly higher than that predicted by EV theory and is always in the EV2 range. The value of k depends not on the upper tail of the marginal distribution but on regions closer to the body. Under the same conditions, the excesses above levels close to the annual maximum have generalized Pareto distribution with parameter k that is always higher than that predicted by Pickands' EE theory. For finite d, the distribution of I-yr,I-d is not GEV, but in accordance with empirical evidence is well approximated by a GEV distribution with shape parameter k that increases as d decreases. We propose a way to estimate k under preasymptotic conditions from the scaling properties of rainfall and suggest a near-universal k(d) relationship. The new estimator promises to be more accurate and robust than conventional estimators. These developments represent a significant conceptual change in the way rainfall extremes are viewed and evaluated.

AB In practice, the rational operation rule derived from historical information and real-time working condition can help the operators make the quasi-optimal scheduling plan of hydropower reservoirs, leading to significant improvements in the generation benefit. As an emerging artificial intelligence method, the extreme learning machine (ELM) provides a new effective tool to derivate the reservoir operation rule. However, it is difficult for the standard ELM method to avoid falling into local optima due to the random determination of both input-hidden weights and hidden bias. To enhance the ELM performance, this research develops a novel class-based evolutionary extreme learning machine (CEELM) to determine the appropriate operation rule of hydropower reservoir. In CEELM, the k-means clustering method is firstly adopted to divide all the influential factors into several disjointed sub-regions with simpler patterns; and then ELM optimized by particle swarm intelligence is applied to identify the complex input-output relationship in each cluster. The results from two reservoirs of China show that our method can obtain satisfying performance in deriving operation rules of hydropower reservoir. Thus, it can be concluded that the model's generalization capability can be improved by isolating each subclass composed of similar dataset.

AB [1] The identification of general relationships linking statistical properties of rainfall aggregated at different temporal and spatial scales possesses clear theoretical and practical relevance. Among other properties it is important to characterize the scale dependence of rainfall variability, which may, for many purposes, be summarized by its variance. This paper presents theoretical results and observational analyses connecting the variance of temporal and spatial rainfall to the scale of observation under an assumption of second-order stationarity. Previous results regarding the theoretical form of the temporal variance as a function of aggregation are refined and extended to the spatial case. It is shown that the variance of aggregated rainfall exhibits an overall nonscaling form within the range of scales of usual hydrological interest. It is further shown that the theoretically derived form of the variance as a function of scale is incompatible with power law relations usually assumed for the second-order statistical moment within multiscaling approaches to rainfall modeling. Predictions of the theoretical derivations are validated by use of observations representing a wide variety of resolutions ( from 2 s to 1 hour in time and 4 km in space), climates, and measurement instruments. The validation shows a good agreement between observations and the theoretically predicted forms of the variance as a function of aggregation. The proposed theoretical framework thus provides a useful context for rainfall analysis, modeling, and downscaling in space and time and suggests careful reexaminations of usual multiscaling assumptions.

AB To understand capillary trapping mechanism, we conduct a real Monte-Carlo experiment by using packed glass beads with nearly the same pore size distribution, but different stochastic realizations. We study gas phase trapping during imbibition for capillary numbers from 2 x 10(-7) to 10(-6) using X-ray micro tomography and compare the experimental results with predictions from percolation theory. We found excellent agreement. Percolation theory explains (i) that the capillary desaturation curves are not dependent on flow rate, (ii) the linear dependence of the total gas surface on gas saturation that is a direct consequence of the linear relationship between cluster surface area and cluster volume, which is a prediction from percolation theory for large finite clusters, (iii) the power-like cluster size distribution with an exponent tau(exp) = 2.15 that only deviates by 2% from the theoretical one (tau(theor) = 2.19), and (iv) that the maximal z-extension of trapped large gas cluster is described by the cut-off correlation length zeta B (B - bond number).

AB Accurate assessment of stage-discharge relationships in open channel flows is important to the design and management of hydraulic structures and engineering. Flow junctions commonly occur at the confluence of natural rivers or streams. The effect of flow junctions on the stage-discharge relationship at mountain river confluences was found by measuring velocity fields and water levels in experimental models. The results show that the backwater and accumulation-separation at flow junctions affect the flow structures and patterns in the channel; also, flow confluences may induce complex flow characteristics of backwater and flow separation at river junctions, indicating potential submerged flooding disasters within the confluence zone. The impacts of flow junctions on the stage-discharge relationship are investigated for two physical confluence models built from river confluence prototype systems in southwest China. The results show that the presence of tributary river inflows tends to increase the water level of the main river. This is important for flood control, flood-risk evaluation and engineering (e.g. hydropower station construction) in mountain rivers. Finally, a comparative quantitative analysis based on flow motion equations is conducted to evaluate the stage-discharge relationship in both uniform and regular confluence systems. The results indicate that more accurate prediction can be made when taking into account the flow non-uniformity induced by flow separation, backwater and distorted bed in the junction region.

AB Modeling dispersion in homogeneous porous media with the convection-dispersion equation commonly requires computing effective transport coefficients. In this work, we investigate longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients arising from the method of volume averaging, for a variety of periodic, homogeneous porous media over a range of particle Peclet (Pe(p)) numbers. Our objective is to validate the upscaled transverse dispersion coefficients and concentration profiles by comparison to experimental data reported in the literature, and to compare the upscaling approach to the more common approach of inverse modeling, which relies on fitting the dispersion coefficients to measured data. This work is unique in that the exact microscale geometry is available; thus, no simplifying assumptions regarding the geometry are required to predict the effective dispersion coefficients directly from theory. Transport of both an inert tracer and non-chemotactic bacteria is investigated for an experimental system that was designed to promote transverse dispersion. We highlight the occurrence of transverse dispersion coefficients that (1) depart from power-law behavior at relatively low P-ep values and (2) are greater than their longitudinal counterparts for a specific range of P-ep values. The upscaling theory provides values for the transverse dispersion coefficient that are within the 98% confidence interval of the values obtained from inverse modeling. The mean absolute error between experimental and upscaled concentration profiles was very similar to that between the experiments and inverse modeling. In all cases the mean absolute error did not exceed 12%. Overall, this work suggests that volume averaging can potentially be used as an alternative to inverse modeling for dispersion in homogeneous porous media. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motivated by the need to understand the dynamics of motile particles in porous media, our team has applied renormalization group techniques to both upscale and classify anomalous dispersive/diffusive behavior. Central limit theorems, which lead to a specific type of renormalization group, are employed in several cases to upscale transport of motile particles in porous media that display a specific type of fractal character. The old standby classification for diffusion (which we use interchangeably with dispersion) says a particle is anomalous if its mean square displacement is not linear in time. This physically intuitive concept, is shown to be inadequate, and so is replaced by a scheme that relies on the fixed points of specific renormalization group operators. Various asymptotic limits are examined, and scaling laws for the limits are derived. A random renormalization operator is introduced for processes with multiple asymptotes and unknown self-similarity index, and a Bayesian tool is employed to obtain scaling laws that are weighted averages of power laws.

AB This work deals with the problem of the use of remote sensing data derived from NOAA/AVHRR observations for monitoring the West African Sahel climatic variability. NDVI is widely used in hydrological and climatological research, and in the study of global climatic changes. The relationships between NDVI and climatic parameters are not well established yet and are the focus of many studies. The relationships between NDVI and rainfall were studied at a 10-day time step in the Nakambe River basin in Burkina Faso in the Sahelo-Sudanian area over the years 1982-1999. Good correlations were found in the annual evolution of these two variables. The statistical analysis shows a significant relationship between NDVI and the sum of the annual rainfall with determination coefficients greater than 0.80. At the spatial scale of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, the determination coefficient ranges from 0.91 to 0.96. It was also found that the NDVI is a good indicator of the determination of the beginning and the end of the rainy season. It gives reasonably good results in comparison with the other methods commonly used in the study region.

AB Relationships between watershed characteristics and mean wadi flood peaks in arid regions are investigated. Mean flood peak discharge was derived for 12 watersheds ranging from 64 to 1730 km(2) in Oman using 270 flood events from 10 years of record. Fourteen watershed characteristics were automatically extracted from a digital elevation model, and multiple regression was used to investigate the effect of these characteristics on wadi mean peak flow (QMPF) and 5-, 10-, 20-, 50- and 100-year return period flood peaks. Drainage area (DA), wadi slope (WS), watershed mean elevation (BE) and agricultural/farm area (FR) were found to be the key variables affecting flood flows. As return period increased, the influence of BE on flood-peak estimation decreased. In addition, urbanization is increasing alongside increasing agricultural areas, and the inclusion of FR in the relationship improved the variance explanation by 11% over models using only traditional variables such as DA and BE.

AB Decay or rise of the water table from a disturbed (mound or trough) position to a quiescent flat state is studied by a linear potential theory that does not rely on the Dupuit-Forchheimer vertical averaging but is a solution to the full Laplace equation. We consider an unconfined aquifer of high (infinite) thickness disturbed by a linear or point hydrodynamic dipole and assemblies of dipoles, which generate two-and three-dimensional seepage. Hydrologically, the dipoles mimic a channel (or circular-recharge basin), which generates the mound. The dipole ascends (descends) and the corresponding free surface, on which the isobaricity and kinematic conditions hold, slumps. A solvability condition, which stipulates no singularities in the seepage domain, is explicitly presented. The mound signal is defined as the time peak of the water table at any piezometer located away from the original recharge area. The flow net and isotachs prove the Bouwer caveat that the Dupuit-Forchheimer theory is specious if applied to high-thickness aquifers accommodating mounds originating from short infiltration events. The analytical value of the water table peak and the time of its arrival are compared with piezometric observations in recharge experiments conducted in a coastal aquifer of the United Arab Emirates, where the hydraulic conductivity is assessed from hydrographs. The inversely determined hydraulic conductivity fits well with those found from infiltration double-ring experiments and MODFLOW simulation.

DE rainfall-runoff relationships; laboratory experimentation; linear
   hydrological models; summation of hydrographs; unit hydrograph; time of

AB Certain rainfall-runoff models, e.g. the unit hydrograph, assume linear relationships between the variables. These are proportionality of runoff discharges to (net) rainfall depth and linear summations of discharges resulting from (net) rainfalls during different time intervals or over different sectors of a watershed. This study examines the validity of these assumptions by use of an extensive two-dimensional laboratory experimentation. The results indicate that proportionality would be found under high rainfall intensity through a long duration. Spatial summations would more likely yield correct discharges in cases where rainfall duration is equal to, or is longer than, the time of concentration. Temporal summations may yield correct discharges when rainfall duration is longer than one half of the time of concentration. Here, the time of concentration is determined at the beginning of gradual approach of the discharge towards the equilibrium state.

AB We used the frameworks of queuing theory and connectivity to study the runoff generated under constant rainfall on a one-dimensional slope with randomly distributed infiltrability. The equivalence between the stationary runoff-runon equation and the customers waiting time in a single server queue provides a theoretical link between the statistical description of infiltrability and that of runoff flow rate. Five distributions of infiltrability, representing soil heterogeneities at different scales, are considered: four uncorrelated (exponential, bimodal, lognormal, uniform) and one autocorrelated (lognormal, with or without a nugget). The existing theoretical results are adapted to the hydrological framework for the exponential case, and new theoretical developments are proposed for the bimodal law. Numerical simulations validate these results and improve our understanding of runoff-runon for all of the distributions. The quantities describing runoff generation (runoff one-point statistics) and its organization into patterns (patterns statistics and connectivity) are studied as functions of rainfall rate. The variables describing the wet areas are also compared to those describing the rainfall excess areas, i.e., the areas where rainfall exceeds infiltrability. Preliminary results concerning the structural and functional connectivity functions are provided, as well as a discussion about the origin of scale effects in such a system. We suggest that the upslope no-flow boundary condition may be responsible for the dependence of the runoff coefficient on the scale of observation. Queuing theory appears to be a promising framework for runoff-runon modeling and hydrological connectivity problems.

AB Modelling and prediction of hydrological processes (e.g. rainfall-runoff) can be influenced by discontinuities in observed data, and one particular case may arise when the time scale (i.e. resolution) is coarse (e.g. monthly). This study investigates the application of catastrophe theory to examine its suitability to identify possible discontinuities in the rainfall-runoff process. A stochastic cusp catastrophe model is used to study possible discontinuities in the monthly rainfall-runoff process at the Aji River basin in Azerbaijan, Iran. Monthly-averaged rainfall and flow data observed over a period of 20 years (1981-2000) are analysed using the Cuspfit program. In this model, rainfall serves as a control variable and runoff as a behavioural variable. The performance of this model is evaluated using four measures: correlation coefficient, log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The results indicate the presence of discontinuities in the rainfall-runoff process, with a significant sudden jump in flow (cusp signal) when rainfall reaches a threshold value. The performance of the model is also found to be better than that of linear and logistic models. The present results, though preliminary, are promising in the sense that catastrophe theory can play a possible role in the study of hydrological systems and processes, especially when the data are noisy.

AB This article tests the association between streamflow alteration and the alteration of ecologically significant hydraulic environments. There has been a recent shift in environmental flow assessments to develop rapid desktop-based approaches that are applicable in a regional context. Streamflow statistics (e.g. minimum monthly flow) are often chosen to predict the impact of streamflow alteration on aquatic ecosystems. The assumption that the flow-biota relationship will be obscured by the effect of how streamflow interacts with channel morphology is often acknowledged, but not quantified. In this study, streamflow statistics are derived for 19 reaches in four river systems in Victoria, Australia. Hydraulic metrics were used to quantify ecologically significant surface flow conditions (Froude number) and the area of bench inundation, shallow and deep water. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the correlation between streamflow statistics altered with regulation and the hydraulic metrics. It was found that streamflow statistics have a weak correlation to surface flow condition and the area of shallow water under natural streamflow conditions. The results show that hydrologic statistics have limited utility in quantifying changes in hydraulic environments. A similar magnitude of flow alteration can produce diverse hydraulic results. The confounding influence of channel morphology prevents streamflow statistics being an adequate surrogate for the assessment of hydraulic alteration. Modelling flow-biota relationships in a regional context is limited by the inadequacy of streamflow statistics to model ecologically significant hydraulic function. Improving knowledge of ecohydraulically significant hydrologic statistics will improve the effectiveness of environmental flow planning to sustain instream habitat conditions. A probabilistic approach is required to enable a risk-based approach to desktop generalization of flow-biota relations.

AB Pseudo-plastic fluids exhibit a non-linear stress-strain relationship which can provoke large, localized viscosity gradients. For the flow of such fluids in porous media the consequence is a strong variability of the effective permeability with porosity, angle of the macroscopic pressure gradient, and rheological parameters of the fluid. Such a variability is investigated on the basis of adjoint homogenization theory for a Carreau fluid in an idealized porous medium geometry, highlighting differences with respect to the Newtonian case. It is shown in particular that the more we depart from Newtonian conditions, the more the (often used) hypothesis of an effective viscosity in Darcy's law is a poor approximation, for the effective permeability tensor becomes strongly anisotropic.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the streamflow variability of Argentinean Andean basins (22 degrees-52 degrees S). Trends and step changes of seven hydrological variables were analysed. In addition, relationships between the hydrological variables and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Nino 3.4, and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) indices were analysed. Most streamflow variables showed upward trends in the northwest and central-western basins, while downward trends were identified in the Patagonia (southwestern) region. Streamflow of the central-western and Patagonian basins was positively correlated with the Nino 3.4 index. Moreover, an inverse relationship with the SAM was found in watersheds south of 37 degrees S. Positive step changes associated with the PDO phases in the north and central-western basins in the mid-1970s were detected, while negative step changes resulted in Patagonia between 1970 and 2000. This research provides new evidence of the influence of major climate modes on streamflow variability in the western rivers of Argentina.

AB This study examined the hysteresis exhibited in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in the runoff from four hydrologically separated fields (catchments) at an intensively managed grassland. The objectives were to examine C-Q relationships constructed from high-resolution time series of flow, temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate and turbidity, and their implications for hydrological processes. High-resolution datasets from the quality assured records of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform in the UK were examined using a graphical method and cross-correlation statistics. The study found that storm events based C-Q hysteresis reflects the cross-correlation that is generally hidden in time series analysis of large datasets, and that although Q and water quality variables can be effectively influenced by catchment size, the C-Q relationship is less significantly influenced. The dominant C-Q relationships of the water variables in the study area reflect that saturated overland flow was prevalent during the study period in the catchments, while the CCF results indicate coupled transfer of sediments and solute in the area at lag 0.<disp-quote>EDITOR D.

AB In this work we develop a multiscale model for flow and transport problem in CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery. The coalbed methane reservoir is characterized by two levels of porosity associated with nanopores in the matrix and cleat network. Mass conservation equations for fluid mixture (CH4 and CO2) in the matrix at the microscale are rigorously derived by using the formal homogenization technique taking into account the gas mixture adsorption in the nanopores. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used to compute the gas adsorption isotherms and the solvation force acting on the nanopore wall, showing a much more pronounced adsorption capacity of CO2 compared to CH4. The average transport equations in the matrix together with the multiphase flow problem in fracture network (gas mixture and water) are homogenized giving rise to a macroscopic model ruled by the effective conductivities, partition and transfer coefficients. The cleat permeability evolution due to deformation is taken into account through a three-scale poromechanical model reported in a previous work. Computational simulations illustrate the macroscopic laws underlying the gas pressure distributions, cleat closure phenomena and CH4 production curve enhanced by CO2 injection.

AB We propose a physics-based, macroscale formulation of multiphase porous-media flows that both honors the validity of Darcy's law in steady or near-steady flows and accommodates the effects of heterogeneities and nonlinearities in unsteady flows. The new formulation recognizes that parameters characterizing the system operate at different length-scales. In particular, the use of Darcy's law, predicated on the assumption of near-steady flows, requires dynamic length scales, owing to the possibility of rapid fluctuations in rock properties and fluid saturations attributable to heterogeneity and nonlinearity. We accommodate these dynamic length-scales through dynamic spatial averaging. The length and position of the averaging window are characterized by the length of the mixing zone and the direction of propagation of information in the transport process. We validate the proposed formulation by comparing highly accurate, two-dimensional numerical solutions against core-scale displacement experiments. The proposed paradigm is consistent with the classical multiphase Darcy formulation, in the sense that the latter also represents the results of an averaging approach.

AB The flow of shear-thinning fluids through unconsolidated porous media is present in a number of important industrial applications such as soil depollution, Enhanced Oil Recovery or filtration of polymeric liquids. Therefore, predicting the pressure drop-flow rate relationship in model porous media has been the scope of major research efforts during the last decades. Although the flow of Newtonian fluids through packs of spherical particles is well understood in most cases, much less is known regarding the flow of shear-thinning fluids as high molecular weight polymer aqueous solutions. In particular, the experimental data for the non-Darcian flow of shear-thinning fluids are scarce and so are the current approaches for their prediction. Given the relevance of non-Darcian shear-thinning flow, the scope of this work is to perform an experimental study to systematically evaluate the effects of fluid shear rheology on the flow rate-pressure drop relationships for the non-Darcian flow through different packs of glass spheres. To do so, xanthan gum aqueous solutions with different polymer concentrations are injected through four packs of glass spheres with uniform size under Darcian and inertial flow regimes. A total of 1560 experimental data are then compared with predictions coming from different methods based on the extension of widely used Ergun's equation and Forchheimer's law to the case of shear thinning fluids, determining the accuracy of these predictions. The use of a proper definition for Reynolds number and a realistic model to represent the rheology of the injected fluids results in the porous media are shown to be key aspects to successfully predict pressure drop-flow rate relationships for the inertial shear-thinning flow in packed beads.

AB Modeling injection-induced earthquakes requires coupling porous media flow, rock mechanics, and fault friction. Highly nonlinear laboratory-derived constitutive laws for fault friction pose a major challenge for computational models that couple flow and geomechanics. We present a finite element formulation to simulate injection-induced earthquake sequences in rate-and-state faults embedded in poroelastic media. We simulate all phases of the stick-slip cycle: from fault reactivation as pressure accumulates near the fault, to earthquake nucleation phase, coseismic rupture propagation and interseismic periods. Our simulations are quasi-dynamic: we neglect inertia, and adopt the so-called radiation damping approximation. We perform validation and verification tests based on a simple spring-block analog that allows straightforward comparison between our 2-D finite element model and the single-degree-of-freedom dynamics. We also verify our frictional contact algorithm by simulating injection-induced earthquakes on a slip-weakening strike-slip fault. We finally study the impact of different rate-and-state laws (aging and slip laws), as well as the role of the degree of poroelastic coupling, by varying the Biot coefficient. We characterize the undrained pressure response triggered by the fast propagation of rupture fronts. Undrained pressure changes during rupture act as an additional coseismic weakening mechanism, controlling the propagation or arrest of the rupture fronts. We find that this feedback between pore pressure and slip propagation, which is absent in uncoupled simulations, leads to distinctively asymmetric rupture patterns in induced earthquakes in poroelastic media. Our results show that capturing the coupling between fault frictional processes and rock poroelastic behavior requires well-resolved and fully coupled simulations.

AB Riverine solute versus discharge (C-Q) relationships provide information about the magnitude and dynamics of material fluxes from landscapes. We analysed long-term patterns of C-Q relationships for 44 rivers in Florida across a suite of geogenic, nutrient, and organic solutes and investigated land cover, watershed size, and surficial geology as controls on these patterns. Solute concentrations generally exhibited far less variability than did discharge, with coherent solute-specific behaviours repeated across watersheds. Geogenic solutes generally diluted with increasing discharge, whereas organic solutes generally enriched; patterns for nutrients were highly variable across watersheds, but on average exhibited chemostasis. Despite strong evidence of both geologic and land cover controls on solute flow-weighted concentrations, these variables were poor predictors of C-Q slopes () or relative coefficients of variation (CVC:CVQ). CVC:CVQ generally increased with watershed size, and wetland area appeared to influence C-Q patterns for base cations and organic solutes. Perhaps most importantly, we observed significant slope breaks in C-Q association in approximately half of our observations, challenging the generality of using single power functions to describe catchment solute export patterns. For all solutes except phosphorus (P), C-Q slopes decreased above statistically identified breaks (slopes for P increased), with breaks consistently at or near median flow (i.e., 50% flow exceedance probability). This common pattern significantly impacts solute load estimates; failing to account for slope breaks overestimates nitrate and total organic carbon loads as much as 125% and underestimates P loads as much as 35%. In addition to challenging generic power-law characterization of C-Q relationships for these coastal plain rivers, and exploring the load estimate consequences thereof, our study supports emerging insights about watershed hydrochemical behaviours across a wide array of solutes.

AB Because the intrinsic dynamics among optimal decision making, inflow processes and reservoir characteristics are complex, functional forms of reservoir operating rules are always determined subjectively. As a result, the uncertainty of selecting form and/or model involved in reservoir operating rules must be analyzed and evaluated. In this study, we analyze the uncertainty of reservoir operating rules using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) model. Three popular operating rules, namely piecewise linear regression, surface fitting and a least-squares support vector machine, are established based on the optimal deterministic reservoir operation. These individual models provide three-member decisions for the BMA combination, enabling the 90% release interval to be estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. A case study of China's the Baise reservoir shows that: (1) the optimal deterministic reservoir operation, superior to any reservoir operating rules, is used as the samples to derive the rules; (2) the least-squares support vector machine model is more effective than both piecewise linear regression and surface fitting; (3) BMA outperforms any individual model of operating rules based on the optimal trajectories. It is revealed that the proposed model can reduce the uncertainty of operating rules, which is of great potential benefit in evaluating the confidence interval of decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships can provide insight into how catchments store and transport solutes, but analysis is often limited to long-term behaviour assessed from infrequent grab samples. Increasing availability of high-frequency sensor data has shown that C-Q relationships can vary substantially across temporal scales, and in response to different hydrologic drivers. Here, we present 4 years of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) sensor data from a snowmelt- dominated catchment in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We assessed both the direction (enrichment vs. dilution) and hysteresis in C-Q relationships across a range of time scales, from interannual to sub-daily. Both solutes exhibited a seasonal flushing response, with concentrations initially increasing as solute stores are mobilized by the melt pulse, but then declining as these stores are depleted. The high-frequency data revealed that the seasonal melt pulse was composed of numerous individual daily melt pulses. The solute response to daily melt pulses was relatively chemostatic, suggesting mobilization and depletion to be progressive rather than episodic processes. In contrast, rainfall-induced pulses produced short-lived but substantial enrichment responses, suggesting they may activate alternative solute sources or transport pathways. Finally, we observed low-level diel variation during summer baseflow following the melt pulse, likely driven by effects of daily evapotranspiration cycles. Additional contributions from in-stream metabolic cycles, independent from but covarying with diel streamflow cycles, could not be ruled out. The results clearly demonstrate that solute responses to daily cycles and individual events may differ significantly from the longer-term seasonal behaviour they combine to generate.

AB Reservoir operating rules are often derived using either a fitting or a simulation-based optimization method in the context of implicit stochastic optimization. Analysis of the parameter uncertainty in reservoir operating rules and their impact is necessary for robust solutions. In the present study, parameter uncertainty for reservoir operating rules is analyzed using two statistical methods, linear regression (LR) and Bayesian simulation (BS). LR estimates the confidence interval based on fitting the operating rules to the optimal deterministic solution. BS deals with the operating rule parameters as stochastic variables and treats the goodness-of-fit to the optimal deterministic solution or the operation profits as the likelihood measure. Two alternative techniques, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), are implemented for the BS uncertainty analysis. These methods were applied to the operating rules of China's Three Gorges Reservoir. The LR performed less than the BS, and the MCMC outperformed the GLUE. Even for the BS methods, the operation profits criterion was better than the goodness-of-fit criterion for deriving the reservoir operating rules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Australian water allocation plans and the sustainability
   objective-conflicts and conflict-resolution measures
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
DE Australian water law; water plans; sustainable development; water
   policy; Australia
AB The dominant legal discourse in Australian water law and policy since 2004 has been about incorporating several definitions of Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) rules into freshwater management. The strategy selected to achieve this has been the Regional Water Allocation Plan (RWAP), which is based on hydrological and biological information about the impact of water use. Several aims of the ESD policy reflect the three pillars (environmental, economic, and social outcomes) common to the use of the term in international instruments, such as the 1987 UN Declaration; all ESD formulations in several state laws and the recent Federal Water Act 2007 look at the integration of the three pillars. The State Acts and the Federal Act insist on the adoption of the precautionary principle and achievement of intra-and inter-generational equity-a stunning reversal of previous policies, where the economic use and social aspects of water use were the primary concern. The ESD policy is not without its critics, especially from the farming communities, hard hit by new water plans that have reduced the amount of water able to be allocated by up to 52%. City dwellers have also been critical of water restrictions in urban areas and the higher cost for water supplied through desalination plants where the groundwater is severely depleted. The RWAP is the tool that must bear the brunt of these conflicts; at present, there are 190 such plans. This paper outlines a research agenda, but also makes preliminary comments on the types of conflicts that have existed, and the potential future conflict types. This is based on legal case analysis and some field work, reports of other authors, as well as observations and discussions with key informants in the several jurisdictions. It finds that there are conflicts between users, between the environment and users, as well as several conflicts related to processes used to consult the community, the science used to reduce allocations and the way the water reductions have been administered. The social capital of the community, the extent of the water allocation reductions and the level of trust in the science are key determinants of how many conflicts will exist in any given WAP region. The paper suggests a law reform that could reduce conflicts, i.e. that a duty to co-operate be added to state laws to require persons working on water plans to work cooperatively in the region and with others in the next water plan region. Such a duty would go some way to increasing the achievement of ESD and overcome the fragmentation and introspective approach of some of the early regional water plans.

TI Derived operating rules for a reservoir operation system: Comparison of

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; NETWORK; INDUCTION; MODEL
AB This article compares the decision-tree algorithm (C5.0), neural decision-tree algorithm (NDT) and fuzzy decision-tree algorithm (FIDs) for addressing reservoir operations regarding water supply during normal periods. The conventional decision-tree algorithm, such as ID3 and C5.0, executes rapidly and can easily be translated into if-then-else rules. However, the C5.0 algorithm cannot discover dependencies among attributes and cannot treat the non-axis-parallel class boundaries of data. The basic concepts of the two algorithms presented are: (1) NDT algorithm combines the neural network technologies and conventional decision-tree algorithm capabilities, and (2) FIDs algorithm extends to apply fuzzy sets for all attributes with membership function grades and generates a fuzzy decision tree. In order to obtain higher classification rates in FIDs, the flexible trapezoid fuzzy sets are employed to define membership functions. Furthermore, an intelligent genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the large number of variables in fuzzy decision-tree design. The applicability of the presented algorithms is demonstrated through a case study of the Shihmen Reservoir system. A network flow optimization model for analyzing long-term supply demand is employed to generate the input-output patterns. Findings show superior performance of the FIDs model in contrast with C5.0, NDT and current reservoir operating rules.

AB A major use of DFN models for industrial applications is to evaluate permeability and flow structure in hardrock aquifers from geological observations of fracture networks. The relationship between the statistical fracture density distributions and permeability has been extensively studied, but there has been little interest in the spatial structure of DFN models, which is generally assumed to be spatially random (i.e., Poisson). In this paper, we compare the predictions of Poisson DFNs to new DFN models where fractures result from a growth process defined by simplified kinematic rules for nucleation, growth, and fracture arrest. This so-called "kinematic fracture model'' is characterized by a large proportion of T intersections, and a smaller number of intersections per fracture. Several kinematic models were tested and compared with Poisson DFN models with the same density, length, and orientation distributions. Connectivity, permeability, and flow distribution were calculated for 3-D networks with a self-similar power law fracture length distribution. For the same statistical properties in orientation and density, the permeability is systematically and significantly smaller by a factor of 1.5-10 for kinematic than for Poisson models. In both cases, the permeability is well described by a linear relationship with the areal density rho(32), but the threshold of kinematic models is 50% larger than of Poisson models. Flow channeling is also enhanced in kinematic DFN models. This analysis demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate DFN organization for predicting flow properties from fracture network parameters.

AB During a storm event, rainfall intensity rarely remains uniform but rather shows radical temporal variation. Given the time window w within a storm, the maximum rainfall intensity over w, namely i(w) decreases as w increases. Our analysis of individual storm events using ground measurements of 1-minute temporal resolution reveals that the i(w)-w relationship follows either a single or broken power law. Such scale-invariance is likely associated with known fractal or multi-fractal characteristics of rainfall structure. In broken power-law events, two power-law exponents of beta(m) (at minute time scale) and beta(h) (at hourly time scale) are fitted for segments separated by the characteristic time tau. Mostly beta(m) < beta(h), implying the persistence of high rainfall concentration prior to tau. This reflects the characteristics of convective storms, and the range of beta agrees with the known time span of convective storm duration. The more concentrated storm event exhibits the stronger persistence (a smallerp beta(m)) prior to tau and the faster moisture depletion (a greater beta(h)) thereafter. The knowledge gained from this study provides important implications to the existing design storm formula, often called the Mononobe formula: observed scale-free infra-storm variability is in accordance with this formula while the scaling transition at subhourly time scale explains the known limitations of its practical applications.

TI Simple approach to characterizing a pollution event return period in
   urban hydrology, by means of hydrological parameters
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA French
DT Article
AB The constant concern for reduction of impact of urban discharges during rainy episodes has led to the investigation of pollution induced by urban runoff. Many studies have shown that pollution is a function of several climatological factors. The main factor is related to the rainy episode and to the dry episode preceding the rain. To evaluate better the natural link existing between pollution and the couple of variables studied (duration of dry episode, intensity of subsequent rain), a statistical study has been conducted in the urban catchment of Entzheim (France). A first step consisted of the separate study of the behaviour of each random variable: rain and dry period, using Gauss, Galton, Gumbel, Fuller and Weibull laws. Fitting was made using data sampled over a period of 124 months. The second step of this research consisted of processing pollution data based on 38 events. The statistical analysis made it possible to define the most efficient descriptive parameters of the couple of variables studied for the prediction of pollution and to establish linear regressions. The fitting of a global model on pollution data compared to the regression models should apply to several catchments. It is now possible to determine the occurrence of each event knowing only a few parameters. The third step consisted of the formulation of a frequency law for the couple of variables studied and comparing it to the law obtained in the second step. The objective is to formulate a simple relationship between the frequencies so as to rapidly predict the order of magnitude of the pollution event return period.

AB Sustainable water resource developments require reservoir operations that provide environmental flows (e-flows) to support the downstream riverine ecosystem by minimizing the degree of hydrologic alteration under given water supply constraints. The effective management of e-flows below dams was explored by combining three e-flow management strategies for "normal,'' wet, and dry year situations, delivering a range of e-flow regimes for different reservoir storage levels and different natural flow (reservoir inflow) conditions. We combined these into a single combined e-flow strategy and coupled this with reservoir operating rule curves to form a reservoir operating approach that optimized e-flow provision under given water supply constraints. We also explored constraints imposed by the dam's valve release capacity. To investigate the capability of the approach to minimize the degree of hydrologic alteration downstream from a reservoir, we presented a case study of the Tanghe Reservoir in China's Tang river basin. The approach triggered a preferred e-flow strategy when the reservoir water level was high to better maintain the ecological functions within downstream riverine ecosystems, a basic e-flow strategy when the water level was low to reduce the water supply risk, and an acceptable strategy under intermediate conditions. The approach effectively balanced human and ecosystem needs and demonstrated the minimum levels of flow regime alteration achievable within the regulated river.

AB Turbidity behavior in streams is a complex and dynamic function of both source material supply and event-driven transport. While the primary controls on turbidity behavior across time and space are still not fully understood, recent increases in the availability of high temporal resolution, colocated stream turbidity, and discharge data provide an opportunity for more detailed analysis. Here we examine methods to quantitatively characterize event responses by modeling the shape of turbidity-discharge hysteresis loops. A total of 1559 events from 20 gages in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. were modeled using both previously reported models and new models combining elements of existing models. The results suggest that a more general power law-based model, utilizing both a discharge rate of change term and a supply term, allows characterization of a wide range of simple and complex events. Additionally, this study explores a decorrelation approach to address the strong correlation frequently observed between the power law model coefficient ( a) and exponent ( b), with the goal of exposing the underlying behavior of each parameter individually. An examination of seasonal parameter behavior suggests that this approach may facilitate greater physically based interpretation of the power law coefficient. The power law parameter decorrelation strategy and the loop models examined here provide a step toward the larger goal of understanding the physical controls on turbidity-discharge hysteretic behavior.

AB A computational model was developed for simulating capillary pressure-saturation relationships for porous media systems containing two or three mobile fluids. The model is based on describing fluid displacement on a pore-by-pore basis over a large number of pores to produce bulk saturations in the medium. The computational approach utilizes percolation and network theories to describe fluid movement within the pore space. Percolation theory calls for a set of displacement rules to determine the movement of the fluids under capillary-driven transport. A comprehensive set of rules appropriate for either two-fluid or three-fluid systems is described. These rules account for a variety of processes affecting displacement, such as wetting films, hysteresis, trapping of fluids, and gravity. The model is shown to reproduce the basic characteristics of a two-fluid capillary pressure-saturation curve, and model predictions are shown to agree with both two- and three-fluid experimental data.

TI A model for two-phase flow in porous media including fluid-fluid

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; SATURATION; SYSTEMS
AB We present a new numerical model for macroscale two-phase flow in porous media which is based on a physically consistent theory of multi-phase flow. The standard approach for modeling the flow of two fluid phases in a porous medium consists of a continuity equation for each phase, an extended form of Darcy's law as well as constitutive relationships for relative permeability and capillary pressure. This approach is known to have a number of important shortcomings and, in particular, it does not account for the presence and role of fluid-fluid interfaces. The alternative is to use an extended model, which is founded on thermodynamic principles and is physically consistent. In addition to the standard equations, the model uses a balance equation for specific interfacial area. The constitutive relationship for capillary pressure involves not only saturation, but also specific interfacial area. We present results of a numerical modeling study based on this extended model. We show that the extended model can capture additional physical processes compared to the standard model, such as hysteresis.

AB It is difficult to predict and track the propagation of a hydrological drought because it is hard to determine its propagation speed. We propose a useful framework for calculating the hydrological drought instantaneous propagation speed which includes the instantaneous development speed (IDS) and instantaneous recovery speed (IRS). First, the run theory was applied to subdivide the propagation of individual hydrological drought events into the development and recovery stages and to determine the individual propagation times (drought development duration and drought recovery duration). Then the hydrological drought instantaneous propagation speed of each hydrological drought event, including the IDS and IRS, were determined based on the variable motion relationship of speed-time process commonly applied in physics. Finally, the optimal theoretical values of the IDS and IRS were evaluated using a cross-validation method. Three hydrometric stations, located at the upstream catchment with less human activities influence, were chosen from different countries (China, the United States, and Germany) to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of this proposed framework. The results indicate that the variable motion relationship of speed-time process can provide an assessment of the overall hydrological drought propagation and perform well for identifying the propagation time in these study areas. The optimal theoretical values of IDS (or IRS) obtained by the variable motion relationship can simulate the actual drought development duration (or drought recovery duration) of hydrological drought well. The sensitivity of IDS (or IRS) of hydrological drought is correlated with climate, catchment characteristics, and human activities that should be explored to improve hydrological drought propagation prediction.

AB A new analytical solution for nonlinear storage routing with a general power-law storage function is presented. The resulting implicit solution, expressed in terms of the incomplete beta function, is valid for inflow hydrographs that may be represented by a series of pulses of arbitrary widths. The new solution thus extends the existing analytical solutions reported in the literature which are valid only for specific exponents in the power-law storage function. An explicit solution expressed in terms of the Lambert-W function is also presented for reservoirs for reservoirs with linear storage-elevation relationship and a single orifice or submerged sluice gate outlet. To support practical design applications and to demonstrate the utility of the new solution, we provide approximate explicit solutions and four simple applications. The results show that, being exact, the new solution is not subject to numerical errors or instabilities and may hence be used in a variety of modeling, design, optimization, forecasting, and control applications involving nonlinear routing with power-law storage functions.

   SUBSURFACE STORMFLOW; SURFACE; SOIL
AB Solutions to the Boussinesq equation describing drainage into a fully penetrating channel have been used for aquifer characterization. Two analytical solutions exist for early- and late-time drainage from a saturated, homogeneous, and horizontal aquifer following instantaneous drawdown. The solutions for discharge Q can be expressed as dQ/dt = -aQ(b), where a is constant and b takes on the value 3 and 3/2 for early and late time, respectively. Though many factors can contribute to departures from the two predictions, we explore the effect of having permeability decrease with depth, as it is known that many natural soils exhibit this characteristic. We derive a new set of analytical solutions to the Boussinesq equation for k proportional to z(n), where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, z is the height above an impermeable base, and n is a constant. The solutions reveal that in early time, b retains the value of 3 regardless of the value of n, while in late time, b ranges from 3/2 to 2 as n varies from 0 to infinity. Similar to discharge, water table height h in late time can be expressed as dh/dt = -ch(d), where d = 2 for constant k and d --> infinity as n --> infinity. In theory, inclusion of a power law k profile does not complicate aquifer parameter estimation because n can be solved for when fitting b to the late-time data, whereas previously b was assumed to be 3/2. However, if either early- or late-time data are missing, there is an additional unknown. Under appropriate conditions, water table height measurements can be used to solve for an unknown parameter.

AB The measurement of discharge in major rivers is very important and serves as the base information for hydrological analysis. The rating curve is used to assess the discharge from the measured stage values in the gauging sites. The rating curve has important bearing on the correct assessment of discharge. The usefulness of the fuzzy neural network modelling approach in deriving the stage-discharge relationship is discussed. The performances of a neural network model, a modularized neural network model, a conventional curve-fitting approach and a fuzzy neural network model for deriving the rating curve are compared using a case study. Overall, the fuzzy neural network model gives the best results.

AB Knowledge of rainfall characteristics such as drop-size distribution is essential for the development of erosion-mitigation strategies and models. This research used an optical disdrometer to elucidate the relationships between raindrop-size distribution, median volume drop diameter (D-50), kinetic energy and radar reflectivity (dBz) of simulated rainfall of different intensities. The D-50 values were higher for the simulated rain than for natural rain at almost all rainfall intensities, perhaps due to variations in rainfall types and the turbulence in natural rain that breaks up large drops. The kinetic energy ranged from 26.67 to 5955.51Jm(-2)h (-1), while the median volume drop diameter (D-50) was in the range 1.94-7.25mm, for intensities between 1.5 and 202.6mmh(-1). The relationship between radar reflectivity (Z) and the intensity (R) of the simulated rain was best described by a power law function (Z=aR(b)), with a and b coefficients in the ranges 162-706 and 0.94-2.46, respectively, throughout the range of rainfall intensities (1.5-202.6mmh(-1)).

AB This paper presents a generic framework of release rules for reservoir flood control operation during three stages. In the stage prior to flood arrival, the rules indicate the timing and release discharge of pre-releasing reservoir storage to the initial level of flood control operation. In the stage preceding the flood peak, the rules prescribe the portion of inflow to be detained to mitigate downstream flooding, without allowing the water surface level of reservoir to exceed the acceptable safety level of surcharge. After the flood peak, the rules suggest the timing for stepwise reduction of the release flows and closing the gates of spillways and other outlets to achieve the normal level of conservation use. A simulation model is developed and linked with BOBYQA, an efficient optimization algorithm, to determine the optimal rule parameters in a stage-wise manner. The release rules of Shihmen Reservoir of Taiwan are established using inflow records of 59 historical typhoons and the probable maximum flood. The deviations from target levels at the end of different stages of all calibration events are minimized by the proposed method to improve the reliability of flood control operation. The optimized rules satisfy operational objectives including dam safety, flood mitigation, achieving sufficient end-of-operation storage for conservation purposes and smooth operation.

AB This study presents a methodology to establish a set of optimal operation release rules which are tree-based rules for real-time flood control on a multipurpose multireservoir system. The derived rules can be used to determine the optimal real-time releases during flood periods. Steps of the proposed methodology involve: (1) collection of data, (2) building of flood database, (3) generation of optimal input-output patterns by running the flood control optimization model, (4) classification of training and testing data, (5) extraction of tree-based release rules for designed scenarios using the decision-tree algorithm (C5.0), (6) determination of optimal tree-based rules, (7) generation of the real-time forecast data by using the hydrological forecast model, (8) processing of reservoir real-time releases by simulating the reservoir real-time flood control operation, and (9) verification of the superior release rules through comparisons of tree-based rules, regression-based rules derived from a multiple-linear regression model and existing release rules. The developed methodology is applied to the Tanshui River Reservoir System in Taiwan to extract the decision trees for each scenario and then select the best ones with highest accuracy as the optimal tree-based rules. The derived optimal tree-based rules, regression-based rules and existing rules are compared by conducting the real-time operations in three historical typhoons, including Aere, Haima and Nock-ten in 2004. Results demonstrate that the solution using the derived tree-based rules have better performance than the regression-based rules and the existing rules in terms of reducing the peak stage at downstream control points, and meeting the target reservoir storage at the end of flood.

AB Climate change is affecting hydrological variables and consequently is impacting water resources management. Historical strategies are no longer applicable under climate change. Therefore, adaptive management, especially adaptive operating rules for reservoirs, has been developed to mitigate the possible adverse effects of climate change. However, to date, adaptive operating rules are generally based on future projections involving uncertainties under climate change, yet ignoring historical information. To address this, we propose an approach for deriving adaptive operating rules considering both historical information and future projections, namely historical and future operating rules (HAFOR). A robustness index was developed by comparing benefits from HAFOR with benefits from conventional operating rules (COR). For both historical and future streamflow series, maximizations of both average benefits and the robustness index were employed as objectives, and four trade-offs were implemented to solve the multi objective problem. Based on the integrated objective, the simulation-based optimization method was used to optimize the parameters of HAFOR. Using the Dongwushi Reservoir in China as a case study, HAFOR was demonstrated to be an effective and robust method for developing adaptive operating rules under the uncertain changing environment. Compared with historical or projected future operating rules (HOR or FPOR), HAFOR can reduce the uncertainty and increase the robustness for future projections, especially regarding results of reservoir releases and volumes. HAFOR, therefore, facilitates adaptive management in the context that climate change is difficult to predict accurately. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Devils Lake, a terminal lake in eastern North Dakota, rose more than 9 m between 1992 and 2013, producing a 286% increase in lake area, and causing more than US$1 billion in direct damages. An annual volumetric lake water budget is developed from monthly hydroclimatological variables for the period 1951-2010 to investigate the rapid lake expansion. The lake is an amplifier terminal lake in which long-term climatic changes are amplified by positive feedback mechanisms, causing the lake to transition from a precipitation-dominated to a runoff-dominated water budget. Factors specific to the Devils Lake Basin further amplify this positive feedback relationship. These include principles of fill-spill hydrology that operate between individual sub-basins within the closed basin, and between the innumerable wetland complexes within each sub-basin. These factors create a pronounced non-stationary precipitation-runoff relationship in the basin during both long-term wetting and drying phases.

AB Multicomponent cation exchange reactions have important applications in groundwater remediation, disposal of nuclear wastes as well as enhanced oil recovery. The hyperbolic theory of conservation laws can be used to explain the nature of displacements observed during flow with cation exchange reactions between flowing aqueous phase and stationary solid phase. Analytical solutions have been developed to predict the effluent profiles for a particular case of heterovalent cations (Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) and an anion (Cl-) for any combination of constant injection and constant initial composition using this theory. We assume local equilibrium, neglect dispersion and model the displacement as a Riemann problem using mass action laws, the charge conservation equation and the cation exchange capacity equation. The theoretical predictions have been compared with experimental data available at two scales-the laboratory scale and the field scale. The theory agrees well with the experimental data at both scales. Analytical theory predictions show good agreement with numerical model, developed using finite differences.

AB The exploitation of water from the Main Outfall Drain (MOD) canal together with the water from the Tigris River can be considered an effective solution to reduce the water consumption from the Tigris River by Iraq's agricultural sector. This extra outflow can be used to restore Hawizeh Marsh and improve/control the consequent environmental problems (including dust storms) across the region. Accordingly, this study presents an efficient water resource management framework based on a game theory model to calculate the amount of agricultural drainage water available for exploitation in MOD, which can be integrated with the Tigris River water for agricultural irrigation. Different conjunctive water use scenarios were evaluated through a non-cooperative game theory model. The proposed optimum scenarios, in addition to supplying this wetland's water rights and consequently mitigating its environmental problems, can also perfectly meet the water demand of farmers in terms of both quantity and quality.

AB We encounter three-phase flow in porous media within a range of settings, such as enhanced oil recovery, geologic CO2 sequestration, and groundwater remediation. While an abundance of studies has been performed on the behavior of two fluid phases (e.g. oil/water or air/water) in porous media, relatively little information exists for three-phase flow systems (e.g. oil/water/air). This work explores the relationships between capillary pressure (P-c), saturation (S) and fluid-fluid interfacial area (a) for water-wet three-phase flow systems where water is the wetting phase, oil is the intermediate-wet phase, and air (or gas) is the non-wetting phase. Specifically, we examine whether the P-c-S-a relationships exhibit hysteresis during drainage and imbibition cycles. We present data collected via x-ray microtomography resulting in high-resolution three-dimensional images of the fluid configurations for varying degrees of saturation. Among the findings of the study (based on the available data), we highlight that (1) the P-c-S-a relationship is non-hysteretic for both the oil-water fluid pair, and the air-oil fluid pair, and (2) that this same relationship is independent of the initial water saturation at the point of air injection. This finding suggests that both the oil-water and air-oil fluid pairs in a three-phase system can be adequately described by the thermodynamics-based theory originally proposed by Hassanizadeh and Gray (1993), as is the case for the equivalent two-phase system.

AB Multireservoir systems are designed to serve multiple conflicting demands over varying time scales that may be out of phase with the system's hydroclimatic inputs. Adaptive, nonlinear reservoir control policies are often best suited to serve these needs. However, nonlinear operating policies are hard to interpret, so water managers tend to favor simple, static rules that may not effectively manage conflicts between the system's multisectoral demands. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework for opening the black box of optimized nonlinear operating policies, decomposing their time-varying information sensitivities to show how their adaptive and coordinated release prescriptions better manage hydrologic variability. Interestingly, these information sensitivities vary significantly across policies depending on how they negotiate tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We illustrate this analysis in the Red River basin of Vietnam, where four major reservoirs serve to protect the capital of Hanoi from flooding while also providing the surrounding region with electric power and meeting multisectoral water demands for the agricultural and urban economies. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search, we are able to design policies that, using the same information as sequential if/then/else-based operating guidelines developed by the government, outperform these traditional rules with respect to every objective. Policy diagnostics using time-varying sensitivity analysis illustrate how the Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search operations better adapt and coordinate information use to reduce food-energy-water conflicts in the basin. These findings accentuate the benefits of transitioning to dynamic operating policies in order to manage evolving hydroclimatic variability and socioeconomic demands in multipurpose reservoir networks.

AB An evaluation of published laboratory studies of flow through single rough fractures was conducted to establish a relationship between aperture (2b) and critical Reynolds number (Re-c) under controlled conditions for physically measured fractures. Of the relevant 47 published laboratory studies, only six reported physically measured apertures along with adequate hydraulic testing information to determine the corresponding Re-c value and show that the fractures follow the cubic law reasonably well. Our analysis indicates a logarithmic relationship between 2b and Re-c for cubic-law fractures in the reported aperture range (100-500 mu m), consistent with theoretical and modeling studies. Discrete fracture network models used for simulating flow and transport in fractured rock aquifers require reliable values for 2b, usually obtained from the cubic law, using T values from straddle-packer hydraulic tests. The cubic law requires specification of the number of permeable fractures (N) in each test interval, but, distinguishing the permeable from the impermeable fractures is problematic. The relationship between 2b and Re-c determined from the laboratory tests provides a fluid-mechanics basis for estimating the number of permeable fractures in straddle-packer tests. Constant-head step-tests carefully done with many steps provide precise identification of the flow rate at the onset of nonlinear flow, and numerous tests have shown that flow deviates from linearity at larger flow rates for larger values of transmissivity (T). A procedure was previously developed to relate N, 2b, and Re-c using hydraulic test data, but this approach requires knowledge of the relation between 2b and Re-c a thereby motivating this work.

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

DE Flow resistance; Vegetation; Mechanics; Deflection
ID RIPARIAN VEGETATION; MODELS
AB Vegetation-induced flow roughness can result in significant changes in stream hydraulics. This study revisits the well-known empirical equation for submerged flexible vegetation developed by Kouwen and collaborators, which describes the relationships between shear stress, flexural rigidity, and vegetation deflection. Theoretical analysis shows that the theories for the mechanics of large deflection cantilever beams can essentially explain this equation. The results show that for moderate to large deflection (the ratio of deflected height to original height l/L < 0.85 - 0.9) the theoretically derived relationships can be approximated with power-law equations, which have similar exponents to the Kouwen's equation and agree with its empirical relationships, which indicates the consistency of the underlying physics for the two approaches. Direct comparisons under given vegetation-height conditions also show a general agreement between the empirical and the theoretical equations. For small deflections, the theoretical results exhibit a more intuitive trend, which shows that the shear stress approaches zero at infinitesimal deflection. Additionally, theoretical analysis suggests a different non-dimensional parameter for vegetation mechanical properties and a better structure of the equation, which is expected to improve the estimation of vegetation-induced roughness. Finally, theoretical analysis indicates that even though the structure maintains, the specific relationship between vegetation bending and resistance is dependent on the flow velocity profile. Further development of these approaches need to take flow characteristics into consideration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research aims to understand how insurance, rainfall, land cover and urban flooding are related and how these variables influenced the material damage in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) during the 2000-2011 period. Correlation coefficients show strong relationships between built-up areas and claims (0.94) and payouts (0.88). Despite no significant relationships being found between rainfall and the amount of material damage per event, three likelihood levels of flooding were determined for hourly rainfall. Unlike the studied period, the number of claims and their spatial distribution during the 2008 extreme rainfall event were strongly dependent on rainfall. Flooding related to the old watercourses assumed greater importance during this extreme event, recovering a more natural/ancient hydrological behaviour. In the LMA, the greatest material damage was the result of high-magnitude/low-probability rainfall events. Lower magnitude events can trigger numerous claims in heavily built-up areas, but they are hardly capable of producing large material damage.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; MODELS; RISK
AB The potential of aggregation-decomposition (AGDP) for flood control of mixed reservoir system remains unclear due to the flood variability and complex hydraulic connections. In this study, we develop flood classification-aggregation-decomposition (FAD) operating rules to adapt for flood variability and to account for the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream. Three steps are involved in the proposed FAD operating rules: (1) flood classification by projection pursuit (PP) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA); (2) definition of FAD operating rules using the AGDP model coupled with piecewise linear function based on flood classification; and (3) optimization of FAD operating rules by parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO). A case study is performed with a large-scale mixed reservoir system in the Xijiang river basin (China) in three scenarios: conventional operation for the status quo year (CO-SQY), conventional operation for the perspective year 2030 (CO-2030) and FAD operation for the perspective year 2030 (FAD-2030). The results clearly show that flood classification enables reservoir operating rules to better adapt for flood variability, and the FAD operating rules in the scenario of FAD-2030 outperform the conventional operating rules in the scenarios of CO-SQY and CO-2030, as it considers flood variability and the trade-offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream.

AB In this paper we consider the problem of modelling the stage-discharge relationship by curve fitting using the least squares method. Our basic idea is to present new models which are more flexible and have the ability to model phenomena with increasing or unchanging carrying capacity. The new models present a generalization of some sigmoid smooth models commonly used in practice. They are characterized by a curvilinear asymptote and may have several inflection points. The use of these models on six real datasets collected from the US Geological Survey's website proves their performance and their ability to model hydrological phenomena.

AB We analyze the elongation (the scaling properties of drainage area with mainstream length) in optimal channel networks (OCNs) obtained through different algorithms searching for the minimum of a functional computing the total energy dissipation of the drainage system. The algorithms have different capabilities to overcome the imprinting of initial and boundary conditions, and thus they have different chances of attaining the global optimum. We find that suboptimal shapes, i.e., dynamically accessible states characterized by locally stationary total potential energy, show the robust type of elongation that is consistently observed in nature. This suggestive and directly measurable property is not found in the so-called ground state, i.e., the global minimum, whose features, including elongation, are known exactly. The global minimum is shown to be too regular and symmetric to be dynamically accessible in nature, owing to features and constraints of erosional processes. Thus Hack's law is seen as a signature of feasible optimality thus yielding further support to the suggestion that optimality of the system as a whole explains the dynamic origin of fractal forms in nature.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

ID SOUTH-AFRICA; EFFICIENCY; TRANSFERS; VALLEY
AB Water markets are commonly described as failing to achieve efficient water management because of transaction cost barriers to trade. In the western United States, two sources of legal conflict frequently drive transaction costs: (1) negative externalities of trading and (2) uncertain property rights. Conflicts arise because water law applies a no-injury rule that prevents water transfers from modifying water available to third-party water rights and defines water rights by historical water use, among other reasons. Existing literature suggests many legal changes to reduce transaction costs, but no studies in the western United States quantify transaction costs under proposed future changes. Here we developed statistical models of transaction costs for water transfer proponents under four specific legal changes in the state of Colorado. Two legal changes would modify the no-injury rule, and two aim to clarify property rights. Colorado hosts active markets and has recently experienced debate over such legal changes. By surveying 100 legal and hydrologic experts, we elicited transaction cost estimates and rankings of which legal changes were most likely to increase third-party injury. The legal changes that aim to clarify property rights had significantly lower likelihoods of increasing injury. One of these legal changes, which would not limit transferable water to historical use in certain circumstances, also had the greatest reductions in proponents' transaction costs. Meanwhile, the legal changes that directly modify the no-injury rule project substantial transaction cost savings but much higher likelihoods of increased injury. The results demonstrate trade-offs between reducing transaction costs and increasing third-party effects.

   An economic survey quantified how legal changes impact transaction costs, completion times, and third-party effects for water marketing Some legal changes project decreases in transaction costs and report less probable increases in third-party effects, while others do not Modifying water law to reduce transaction costs involves trade-offs between these reductions and potential increases in third-party effects

AB Depending on the concept of optimality, the decision makers responsible for the planning and management of water resources seek to maximize the optimization performance. However, the optimized solutions are vulnerable to failure because decision making in water resources management usually involves factors with deep uncertainties (e.g. runoff conditions, water demand growth, climatic forces, etc.). In this study, we further contribute to the Many-Objective Robust Decision Making framework for defining the robust operating rules of a water supply system of interest. The multi-objective optimization and uncertainty analysis tools were used to reveal the trade-offs between the competing objectives and discover the sensitive factors for the plausible states of the system, respectively. The robust operating rules are demonstrated for the Han to Wei inter-basin water transfer project, which is the most important water diversion project in Shaanxi Province, China. Results show that, although the current operating rules are optimized for the water supply system over the long term, these operating rules cannot deal with the problem of performance degradation under deep uncertainties associated with runoff conditions and water demand growth. The two uncertain factors are the sensitive factors responsible for the failure or success of the system, and robustness of the system may be achieved by reducing the effect of key uncertainties (e.g. reduced water demand growth). Furthermore, there are obvious differences in the robust operating rules across different months, with the key or sensitive months providing the uncertain ranges to likely sustain the success of the system. Finally, the successful frequency of the system derived from the most robust operating rules is 18% higher than that obtained from the current operating rules for alternative states of the world. The robust operating rules offer critical insights into the challenges posed by deep uncertainties and provide a management template for decision making on climate change and complex human activities.

AB Peak discharge to drainage area relationships are widely applied engineering solutions for design flood estimation in ungauged basins. In this study we investigated the effects of antecedent moisture conditions (AMC), rainfall duration, and channel transmission losses on discharge-drainage area power law scaling relationships. The spatial organization of peak discharges were evaluated through coupled surface-subsurface physics based numerical modeling. We take advantage past research and the detailed flexibility of HydroGeoSphere, the numerical modeling platform, to systematically vary AMC and rainfall depths evolving the current understanding of the effects on discharge-drainage area relationships. Channel network dynamics in the Beaver Creek watershed dominated the location of a scale break, or the location where the log-log linear relationship between peak discharge and drainage area is best described by two or more slopes. Single peaked hydrographs and high-quality power law scaling relationships resulted from wet AMC conditions or high precipitation depths. As we reduced the AMC, under low rainfall depths, the hillslope response diverged from the channel response, providing an unorganized system response no longer fitting the power law scaling relationship. Additionally, when initializing the system under losing stream conditions, where the stream channel is assumed unsaturated, a single peaked response ensued whereby the channel and hillslope responded in unison. This study adds to our current understanding of the physical basis of the variability of the scaling structure of peak discharges that is observed in single rainfall-runoff events by investigating the spatial organization of peak discharges under exceedingly dry antecedent soil moisture conditions.

AB [1] This study extends and applies the theory of micromixing, first introduced in the chemical reaction engineering literature, to the topic of reactive transport in porous media. For all but the simplest linear kinetic and sorption models the fate and transport of a reactive solute depends on the residence times and the details of small-scale mixing. The latter phenomenon, also called micromixing, is important because it brings into close proximity chemical species that react, and it controls the local concentrations in a flowing system. Solutes with reaction rates or sorption isotherms that depend on species concentration will therefore be affected by micromixing. Two models for micromixing are introduced, the minimum and maximum mixedness models, that provide bounds on the extent of reaction or retardation behavior within the constraints imposed by the residence time distribution (RTD) of a conservative solute in the same flow system. These mixing models prescribe the latest or earliest permissible mixing of parcels of fluid of different residence times, which in turn bounds the degree of reaction of a reactive solute for nonlinear rate laws or sorption isotherms. Simulation results using the bounding models show that micromixing effects are most important for nonlinear reaction curves, solute pulses of short duration, and systems with broad RTD curves. Use of these models is a straightforward and practical way to investigate the importance of a phenomenon for which data are seldom available and whose impact on groundwater reactive transport models has heretofore not been studied in a systematic, bounding manner.

AB Soil erosion probability maps were produced under various case scenarios by accounting for uncertainties in the data and in the decision rule, using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS). This objective was realized by applying the Bayesian Probability Theory within IDRISI, a raster. based GIS. The outcomes were two continuous probability soil erosion maps ranging from zero to 1. Comparing these maps with an earlier study indicates that accounting For the uncertainties has, in general, decreased the probability of soil erosion. Based on average readings for specific sites on the maps, increases in erosion risk under the second case scenario have had the highest impact on the highlands that is in the central, eastern, and northern regions of Langkawi Island, Malaysia. Assuming a 10% risk, this impact has increased by 11.98, 11.83 and 5.741% for high, medium and low soil erosion risk areas on the island respectively.

AB A streamflow time series contains a large quantity of information and finding the instruments that are capable of accessing this information remains an important task. Using the Kolmogorov complexity (KC) and its derivatives, it has previously been shown that the degree of randomness in streamflow partly depends on its orographic characteristics. This paper applied a change-based complexity measure (Aksentijevic-Gibson complexity - AG) to investigate the spatiotemporal regularities of monthly streamflow of seven rivers from Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of 1965-1986, and evaluate their hydrological effects. A unique advantage of this complexity measure is its ability to quantify large-scale complexity and to zoom in on low-level structure and detect patterns that are normally inaccessible. Ten time series created from the seven rivers were examined and temporal and structural complexity profiles of different streamflows and annual periodicities associated with bimodal/mixed flow regimes were obtained. The AG complexity can be employed as a standard instrument for the analysis of hydrological data and it holds the promise of uncovering patterns and rhythms in the data that cannot be captured by KC and other complexity measures.

AB Risk assessment is a preliminary step in flood management and mitigation, and risk zoning provides a quantitative measure of flood risk. The difficulty in flood risk zoning is to deal with the complicated non-linear relationship among indices and risk levels. To solve this problem, the ant colony algorithm based on rule mining (Ant-Miner) is promoted in this paper to map the regional flood risk at grid scale. For the case study in the Dongjiang River Basin in Southern China, 11 and 14 indices (without and with the socio-economic indices considered) are respectively chosen to construct the zoning model based on Ant-Miner. The results show that Ant-Miner exhibits higher accuracy and more simple rules that can be used to generate flood risk zoning map quickly and easily than decision tree method (DT); compared to random forest (RF) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE), Ant-Miner has significant advantages both in implementation step-reducing and computing time-saving. Although the comprehensive measure and natural hazard measure of flood risk distributed similarly over the entire region, the former one which considered the socio-economic indices is more reasonable in term of real impact to natural and socio-economy. The areas with high-risk level obtained in this paper matched well with the integrated risk zoning map and the inundation areas of historical floods, suggesting that the proposed Ant-Miner method is capable of zoning the flood risk at grid scale. This study shows the potential to provide a novel and successful approach to flood risk zoning. Evaluation results provide a reference for flood risk management, prevention, and reduction of natural disasters in the study basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a new mathematical model for describing the drawdown distribution due to a constant rate pumping (CRP) in an unconfined aquifer considering the lagging theory. We introduce two lag times in Darcy's law and in turn in a free surface equation to reflect the effects of the capillary fringe and the capillary suction on the water table motion. The present free surface equation can reduce to those used in previous studies. The Laplace and Weber transform methods are used to derive the semianalytical solution to the model including the effect of wellbore storage. The algorithm of numerical Laplace inversion is applied to obtain the transient solution of the model. We find that the delay index, commonly used in the literature, is equivalent to the lag time associated with the effect of the capillary suction. The sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the drawdown behavior in response to the change in each aquifer parameter. The drawdown distributions predicted by the present solution agree fairly well to the field data taken from CRP tests at Cape Cod, Massachusetts; the Canadian Forces Base Borden, Ontario; and Saint Pardon de Conques, Gironde (France). The lag times determined by both CRP tests seem to decrease linearly with increasing distance on the logarithmic scale from the pumping well. The consideration of two lag times considerably improves the accuracy in estimated specific yields.

AB Based on a literature overview, this paper summarizes the impact and legacy of the contributions of Wilfried Brutsaert and Jean-Yves Parlange (Cornell University) with respect to the current state-of-the-art understanding in hydraulic groundwater theory. Forming the basis of many applications in catchment hydrology, ranging from drought flow analysis to surface water-groundwater interactions, hydraulic groundwater theory simplifies the description of water flow in unconfined riparian and perched aquifers through assumptions attributed to Dupuit and Forchheimer. Boussinesq (1877) derived a general equation to study flow dynamics of unconfined aquifers in uniformly sloping hillslopes, resulting in a remarkably accurate and applicable family of results, though often challenging to solve due to its nonlinear form. Under certain conditions, the Boussinesq equation can be solved analytically allowing compact representation of soil and geomorphological controls on unconfined aquifer storage and release dynamics. The Boussinesq equation has been extended to account for flow divergence/convergence as well as for nonuniform bedrock slope (concave/convex). The extended Boussinesq equation has been favorably compared to numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Richards equation, confirming its validity under certain geometric conditions. Analytical solutions of the linearized original and extended Boussinesq equations led to the formulation of similarity indices for baseflow recession analysis, including scaling rules, to predict the moments of baseflow response. Validation of theoretical recession parameters on real-world streamflow data is complicated due to limited measurement accuracy, changing boundary conditions, and the strong coupling between the saturated aquifer with the overlying unsaturated zone. However, recent advances are shown to have mitigated several of these issues. The extended Boussinesq equation has been successfully applied to represent baseflow dynamics in catchment-scale hydrological models, and it is currently considered to represent lateral redistribution of groundwater in land surface schemes applied in global circulation models. From the review, it is clear that Wilfried Brutsaert and Jean-Yves Parlange stimulated a body of research that has led to several fundamental discoveries and practical applications with important contributions in hydrological modeling.

AB The pursuit of a theoretical foundation of Darcy's law based on volume averaging of equations at the scale of flow in pores has a long history. While theories are well established for homogeneous systems, more complex systems exhibit inconsistencies in the resulting equations. The difficulties often lie in the treatment of surface integral terms arising from the classical averaging theorems used to transform averages of derivatives into derivatives of averages. In this work we extend the intrinsic phase average as a macroscale variable to a family of more general macroscale variables, which take into account systematic dependencies of averaging volume size on the macroscale. Comparison to Darcy's law gives new insight into the relationship between variables at the microscale and macroscale.

ID IMMISCIBLE DISPLACEMENT; INTERFACIAL-AREAS; MULTIPHASE FLOW; OIL-WET;

AB We study the impact of pore structure and surface roughness on capillary trapping of nonwetting gas phase during imbibition with water for capillary numbers between 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-5), within glass beads, natural sands, glass beads monolayers, and 2-D micromodels. The materials exhibit different roughness of the pore-solid interface. We found that glass beads and natural sands, which exhibit nearly the same grain size distribution, pore size distribution, and connectivity, showed a significant difference of the trapped gas phase of about 15%. This difference can be explained by the microstructure of the pore-solid interface. Based on the visualization of the trapping dynamics within glass beads monolayers and 2-D micromodels, we could show that bypass trapping controls the trapping process in glass beads monolayers, while snap-off trapping controls the trapping process in 2-D micromodels. We conclude that these different trapping processes are the reason for the different trapping efficiency, when comparing glass beads packs with natural sand packs. Moreover, for small capillary numbers of 10(-6), we found that the cluster size distribution of trapped gas clusters of all 2-D and 3-D porous media can be described by a universal power law behavior predicted from percolation theory. This cannot be expected a priori for 2-D porous media, because bicontinuity of the two bulk phases is violated. Obviously, bicontinuity holds for the thin-film water phase and the bulk gas phase. The snap-off trapping process leads to ordinary bond percolation in front of the advancing bulk water phase and is the reason for the observed universal power law behavior in 2-D micromodels with rough surfaces.

AB Mixing laws have been used in hydrogeology for decades. In glacial hydrology, they are used to determine the contributions of the different reservoirs supplying the proglacial stream. However, some assumptions about dischargesolute matter and dischargeelectrical conductivity (EC) relationships have led to erroneous conclusions. Analysis of a theoretical example indicated a hyperbolic relationship between discharge and solute matter concentration/EC for two reservoirs. We applied this approach to experimental data from the Baounet Glacier (Savoie, France), assuming that the proglacial stream is provided by a combination of watershed groundwater flow (diurnally stable and with high EC) and quick drainage from the glacier (low EC and discharge that change very quickly). Applying mixing laws allowed us to characterise these two flows and to separate the quick flows (glacial ablation and rainfalls). Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper is concerned with the formulation of an adequate likelihood function in the application of Bayesian epistemology to uncertainty quantification of hydrologic models. We focus our attention on a special class of likelihood functions (hereinafter referred to as distribution-adaptive likelihood functions), which do not require prior assumptions about the expected distribution of the residuals, rather inference takes place over the hypotheses (model parameters) and space of distribution functions. Our goals are threefold. First, we present theory of a revised implementation of the generalized likelihood (GL) function of Schoups and Vrugt (2010) wherein residual standardization precedes the treatment of serial correlation. This so-called GL+ function, enjoys a solid statistical underpinning and guarantees a more robust joint inference of the autoregressive coefficients and residual properties. Then, as secondary goal, we present a further generalization of the GL+ function, coined the universal likelihood (UL) function, which extends applicability to highly asymmetrical lepto-and platy-kurtic residual distributions. The UL function builds on the 5-parameter skewed generalized Student's t distribution of Theodossiou (2015) which makes up a large family of continuous probability distributions including (but not limited to) symmetric and skewed forms of the generalized normal, generalized t, Laplace, normal, Student's t, and Cauchy-Lorentz distributions. As our third and last goal, we present the use of strictly proper scoring rules to evaluate, compare and rank likelihood functions. These scoring rules condense the accuracy of a distribution forecast to a single value while retaining attractive statistical properties. The GL+ and UL functions are illustrated using data of a simple autoregressive scheme and benchmarked against the GL function, Student t likelihood (SL) of Scharnagl et al. (2015) and normal likelihood (NL) for a conceptual hydrologic model using measured streamflow data. Our results show that, (i) the GL+ function is superior to the GL function, (ii) the active set of nuisance variables exerts a large control on the performance of the GL+, SL and UL functions, (iii) the treatment of autocorrelation deteriorates the scoring rules and performance metrics of the forecast distribution, (iv) a leptokurtic distribution is favored for discharge residuals, (v) scoring rules are indispensable in our search for the true forecast distribution, and (vi) the use of multiple strictly proper scoring rules turns the selection of an adequate likelihood function into a multi-criteria problem.

AB Although the semi-arid region of Brazil appears to be homogeneous due to drought conditions, there is a great deal of variability in climatic elements in the region, so that the definition of homogeneous regions will provide the deployment of measures appropriate for each locality. However, the limited information on climatic parameters in the region makes it difficult to define these regions. This problem can, however, be alleviated by the use of entropy theory. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of the theory to identify hydrologically homogeneous regions for conditions of the semi-arid region of Brazil. Entropy-based Disorder Index (DI) data were computed, based on monthly precipitation and monthly water balance (precipitation - reference evapotranspiration) for 290 gauge stations. For defining homogeneous regions, cluster analysis was utilized, using the data on geographical information about rain gauges (latitude and longitude), annual precipitation, annual water balance, coefficient of skewness, coefficient of kurtosis and DI. The identification of homogeneous regions in the Brazilian semi-arid region was only possible when the grouping of stations was performed, based on DI for precipitation and latitude. Results showed the definition of seven homogeneous regions in the semi-arid region of Brazil.

AB Effective environmental flow management depends on identification of ecologically-relevant flow attributes to maintain or restore flows in the context of other natural and human influences on stream ecosystems. This study in subtropical eastern Australia identified associations of fish with climatic and flow gradients, catchment topography, reach geology, habitat structure and land use across 20 catchments. Land-use patterns and associated stressors accounted for very little variation in fish assemblage structure. Of the 35 fish species analysed, 24 were strongly associated with gradients in mean daily flows and their variability, baseflow, number of zero-flow days and high-flow pulses, magnitude of the 1-year annual return interval flood and the constancy and predictability of monthly flows. The finding that 22 species (benthic and pelagic) were associated with gradients of antecedent low-flow hydrology indicates that these species (or functional trait groups) should be the focus of further analysis to explore hydro-ecological relationships in systems with regulated flow regimes.

AB Pre-releasing before a flood can increase reservoir flood control storage capacity to effectively improve the flood disaster prevention and mitigation effects, but also might bring water shortage risk due to the uncertain forecasts. This paper proposes a framework to determine the optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre-release based on uncertain forecasts. The framework includes three models: a pre-release model at the early stage of the flood to enlarge the flood control storage capacity; a multi-objective optimization model with resilience and risk as objectives at the flood regulating stage to optimize the flood control operating rules; a fuzzy optimum selecting model to determine the satisfied operating rule considering forecast uncertainty and decision-maker's preferences. In the framework, forecast uncertainty has been considered from the perspective of the forecast error distribution. Nierji Reservoir in Northeast China is taken as a case study. Results show that compared with the existing operating rule, the recommended operating rule considering pre-release releases water more evenly and can not only decrease the peak flow at the downstream protection point but also improve the downstream flood resilience without increasing reservoir risk. The proposed framework that considers forecast error distribution provides higher superiority degrees of the rules than the traditional framework that considers the maximum and minimum forecast errors in the real-time operation of the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs.

AB Characterizing residual non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in porous media is essential for designing contaminated site remediation strategies. The direct current resistivity method is increasingly being used at sites contaminated by NAPLs, which uses the Archie's second law to connect NAPL saturation with the resistivity of porous media. A power-law relationship connecting the phase morphology measured by Euler characteristic with resistivity has also been observed at the pore-scale. Because these relationships are limited for porous media with specific wettability, previous research works have demonstrated deviations from Archie's second law in both the laboratory and field experiments. To evaluate the effects of residual NAPL morphology with different wettability on bulk resistivity, we developed two 2D-micromodels and measured their electrical resistivity and phase morphology during phase displacement under laboratory-controlled conditions. Furthermore, pore network simulations of a variety of conditions were performed in absence of surface conduction. Results show that NAPL distributed in dead ends of the pore space has limited influence on bulk resistivity since they do not control the current path and voltage distribution. The correlations between resistivity index and Euler characteristic are determined by NAPL ganglia size and pore throat width. A power-law relationship is found between the Archie's saturation exponent and the average size of the residual NAPL ganglia, indicating that this exponent can be interpreted as the rate of change of the pore water connectivity with saturation. These insights provide a physical framework connecting the morphology and wettability of the NAPL ganglia with the Archie's saturation exponent.

TI Role of price and enforcement in water allocation: Insights from Game
   Theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PUNISHMENT
AB As many countries are moving toward water sector reforms, practical issues of how water management institutions can better effect allocation, regulation, and enforcement of water rights have emerged. The problem of nonavailability of water to tailenders on an irrigation system in developing countries, due to unlicensed upstream diversions is well documented. The reliability of access or equivalently the uncertainty associated with water availability at their diversion point becomes a parameter that is likely to influence the application by users for water licenses, as well as their willingness to pay for licensed use. The ability of a water agency to reduce this uncertainty through effective water rights enforcement is related to the fiscal ability of the agency to monitor and enforce licensed use. In this paper, this interplay across the users and the agency is explored, considering the hydraulic structure or sequence of water use and parameters that define the users and the agency's economics. The potential for free rider behavior by the users, as well as their proposals for licensed use are derived conditional on this setting. The analyses presented are developed in the framework of the theory of "Law and Economics,'' with user interactions modeled as a game theoretic enterprise. The state of Ceara, Brazil, is used loosely as an example setting, with parameter values for the experiments indexed to be approximately those relevant for current decisions. The potential for using the ideas in participatory decision making is discussed. This paper is an initial attempt to develop a conceptual framework for analyzing such situations but with a focus on the reservoir-canal system water rights enforcement.

TI Entropy theory for derivation of infiltration equations
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDROLOGICAL STOCHASTICS; VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION; UNCERTAINTY; WATER
AB An entropy theory is formulated for modeling the potential rate of infiltration in unsaturated soils. The theory is composed of six parts: (1) Shannon entropy, (2) principle of maximum entropy (POME), (3) specification of information on infiltration in terms of constraints, (4) maximization of entropy in accordance with POME, (5) derivation of the probability distribution of infiltration, and (6) derivation of infiltration equations. The theory is illustrated with the derivation of six infiltration equations commonly used in hydrology, watershed management, and agricultural irrigation, including Horton, Kostiakov, Philip two-term, Green-Ampt, Overton, and Holtan equations, and the determination of the least biased probability distributions of these infiltration equations and their entropies. The theory leads to the expression of parameters of the derived infiltration equations in terms of measurable quantities (or information), called constraints, and in this sense these equations are rendered nonparametric. Furthermore, parameters of these infiltration equations can be expressed in terms of three measurable quantities: initial infiltration, steady infiltration, and soil moisture retention capacity. Using parameters so obtained, infiltration rates are computed using these six infiltration equations and are compared with field experimental observations reported in the hydrologic literature as well as the rates computed using parameters of these equations obtained by calibration. It is found that infiltration parameter values yielded by the entropy theory are good approximations.

AB Numerical experiments on vertical unsaturated flow using the Richards equation were conducted to examine the physical basis of why storm runoff responses from mountainous watersheds in tectonically active regions could be simulated by simple runoff models with a runoff-storage power-law relationship. Pressure head propagation transmitted through vertical unsaturated flow could produce a rapid response of the outflow from bottom of the soil column, regardless of the inherent soil hydraulic properties, similar to storm runoff responses observed on a hillslope in a 'constant allocation period' when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff. Additional experiments were conducted both for an increasing stage of downward flux in response to increasing rainfall intensity and for a recession stage without rainfall, to investigate the detailed characteristics of vertical unsaturated flow. The creation of a wetting front during the increasing stage delayed the increase of outflow, but this delay was small during a constant allocation period. An interdependent relationship between the outflow rate and the total storage of the soil column throughout the recession stage was approximated by a power-law equation derived from relationships between total storage and constant outflow under steady-state conditions. The exponent of the power-law equation approached a maximum of unity as the column length decreased, and it approached the minimum value obtained from the intrinsic relationship between soil hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as the column length increased. The interdependence of the outflow rate with the total storage generally detected only in the unsaturated zone might cause a low sensitivity of outflow responses to the heterogeneities of soil hydraulic properties, justifying the application of simple runoff models in heterogeneous mountain watersheds.

AB A reliable fog forecast can assist in water resource management and mitigate against hazardous effects on transport networks. However, diagnosing fog from numerical weather prediction models remains a challenge and various methods have been developed to achieve this. One approach is to use a multi rule-based method, where threshold values of multiple variables are employed to define fog conditions in the forecast. Such a method is presented here for next day forecasts of radiation fog at Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Variables tested include the dew point depression, wind speed, modified Richardson index, inversion depth, relative humidity and liquid water content. Of these, the best performing rule included relative humidity (>= 94%), wind speed (<= 3 ms(-1)) and inversion depth (>250 m) with a probability of detection (POD) (false alarm ratio (FAR)) of 0.62 (0.37). The worst performing rule was liquid water content with a POD (FAR) of 0.37 (0.31). Model performance was more sensitive to inversion depth than wind speed, and rules that included inversion depth performed better than rules that included the modified Richardson number. A qualitative spatial analysis showed that rules produced realistic fog patches when compared to satellite images. This suggests that the geophysical parameters chosen to define rules are well suited for defining fog as long as the model bias is sufficiently small to fall within the threshold values. This method worked well for the study region and did not demonstrate any seasonal bias.

AB Due to the lack of resources, individuals, groups, or countries are more involved in common resource conflicts. This paper uses the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution methodology to model a conflict based on the Nash solution concept, General Meta-Rationality, Symmetric Meta-Rationality, Sequential Stability, Limited h Move Stability, and Non-Myopic Stability definitions and then sieve the socially optimal outcomes from the results of the graph model. We propose to add a new analytical stage as a sequential next step to the equilibria in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and utilize social choice voting rules such as the Borda score, the Plurality rule, the Median voting rule, Copeland's method, Simpson's rule, and Fallback bargaining. We also apply a new approach called Related games, where we show how the Leading game impacts the Consequential game's outcome and equilibria. To demonstrate the proposed concepts, we applied these ideas to two case studies; (1) the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers conflict between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, and (2) the Shatt al-Arab, which is on the border of Iran and Iraq. Results confirm that adding analytical stages in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and considering the Related games concept help decision and policy makers to gain a clearer insight into the conflict.

AB Rills caused by run-off concentration on erodible hillslopes have very irregular profiles and cross-section shapes. Rill erosion directly depends on the hydraulics of flow in the rills, which may differ greatly from hydraulics of flow in larger and regular channels. In this paper, a recently theoretically deduced rill flow resistance equation, based on a power-velocity profile, was tested experimentally on plots of varying slopes (ranging from 9% to 26%) in which mobile and fixed bed rills were incised. Initially, measurements of flow velocity, water depth, cross-section area, wetted perimeter, and bed slope, carried out in 320 reaches of mobile bed rills and in 165 reaches of fixed rills, were used for calibrating the theoretical flow resistance equation. Then the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Gamma, the channel slope, and the flow Froude number was separately calibrated for the mobile bed rills and for the fixed ones. The measurements carried out in both conditions (fixed and mobile bed rills) confirmed that the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor can be accurately estimated using the proposed theoretical approach. For mobile bed rills, the data were supportive of the slope independence hypothesis of velocity, due to the feedback mechanism, stated by Govers. The feedback mechanism was able to produce quasicritical flow conditions. For fixed bed rills, obtained by fixing the rill channel, by a glue, at the end of the experimental run with a mobile bed rill, the slope independence of the flow velocity measurements was also detected. Therefore, an experimental run carried out by a rill bed fixed after modelling flow action is useful to detect the feedback mechanism. Finally, the analysis showed that, for the investigated conditions, the effect of sediment transport on the flow resistance law can be considered negligible respect to the grain roughness effect.

AB The principal geological periods from 19 to 37 Ma correspond to events during which the solar system crossed the spiral galactic streams of matter. The boundary of the Quaternary (1.5 Ma BP) was forming during the intersection of the arm of Orion-Cygnus with the solar system (2.7-0.7 Ma). There is a stable cooling trend and Matuyama-reversed epoch at that time. Oscillations with periods (T-J = 0.75 2(J/16)y) under 2 Ma have been formed inside the solar system. The structure of rhythms with 16 periods in an octave has determined the cosmic, solar, and terrestrial processes. The laws of conservation of momentum create spectra: A(J) = alpha(S)T(J)(2), where A(J) is amplitude and alpha(S) is the constant for a series of cycles. These regularities, which. are very convenient for classifying cycles and land forms, permit estimation of the time of formation of geomorphological objects. Reconstructions for the last glacial period, and approximation and extrapolation of the last homogeneous part of the row, allow enhancement of the interpretation of the isotope series.

AB [1] Topologically, water bodies are the first-level topographic regions that get flooded, and as the flood level gets higher, adjacent water bodies merge. The looplike network that forms along all these merging points represents zones of influence of each water body. These two topologically interdependent phenomena follow the universal scaling laws similar to certain other environmental and biological phenomena. Despite morphological variations, water bodies and their influence zones of varied sizes and shapes have different sets of scaling exponents, thereby determining that they belong to different universality classes.

TI Deriving representative reservoir operation rules using a hidden

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

ID HYDROLOGY; SCIENCE
AB Reservoirs have been widely used to regulate streamflow to meet both human and natural water requirements. This study applies a hidden Markov-decision tree (HM-DT) model to derive representative reservoir operation modules under various operation conditions (i.e., inflow, storage, as well as unknown factors) and their transitions (the dynamic change of operation rules) that reflect the impacts of seasonality, long-term non-stationarity, and extreme events on reservoir operation. The representative operation modules can be applied to reservoirs in the same region that are not observed; the capability for simulating dynamic operation behaviors improves the predictive accuracy as compared to regular decision trees. Using a number of reservoirs located in the same region for training, the HM-DT model can derive a limited number of representative operation modules in the form of decision trees (DT), and the transitions between different operation schemes in response to changing operation conditions. The application of the HM-DT model is demonstrated through a case study of the Upper Colorado River basin, where eight representative operation modules are determined for 50 reservoirs located in the region, and the modules are validated with 11 reservoirs in the same region. The eight operation modules are classified into three types (i.e. nearly constant release, release as a piece-wise function of inflow, and release almost identical to inflow). The identified operation modules and the transition patterns between operation modules can be used to better understand real-world operation behaviors, improve future operations, and build realistic reservoir operation components in basin-scale hydrological models.

AB The Buckingham-Darcy Law is used to describe fluid flow in unsaturated porous media at low Reynolds number. In order to provide a priori corrections to this law, a process thermodynamic approach is utilized to ascertain the functional dependence. Using this knowledge, corrections to the hydraulic conductivity coefficient are proposed and compared with available data. The proposed corrections substantially predict the observed behavior of flow of high concentration (saturated) sodium chloride solutions in porous media. During the derivation, physical principles consistent with the thermodynamics of the system were utilized. A review of these principles and their results provides an alternative form of the generalized Gibbs-Duhem Relation for continuous processes, indicating that the identical equivalence to zero is unlikely to occur for dissipative processes. Further, the postulated Gibbs and Gibbs-Duhem Relations indicate that special differential operators need to be used for continuous processes rather than the usual use of a generic differential.

AB We study the assimilation of uncertain physical knowledge across space and time, and we discuss the resulting issues of environmental inference and prediction. The term "assimilation" refers to a general framework that includes physical knowledge integration and processing activities in a variety of scientific disciplines (atmospheric data analysis and weather forecasting, environmental pollution mapping, exposure assessment, etc.). The choice of an adequate assimilation approach is primarily a conceptual modelling affair that is supported by the physical and logical features of the environmental situation under consideration, rather than merely relying on pure inductive schemes and statistical arguments. In many cases, the assimilation approach involves conditionalization techniques which enable it to merge various forms of site-specific data with modelling frameworks. We distinguish between interpretive conditionalization (which refers to the physical and epistemic characteristics of assimilation modelling) and formal conditionalization (which is a purely mathematical construction), and emphasize the importance of an adequate choice of the latter to represent the former. We point out the considerable improvements of the operational Bayesian conditionalization approach over the standard Bayesian rule. Statistical learning techniques are useful at the descriptive/correlation level of scientific inquiry, whereas the level of explanation/prediction is the domain of advanced operational techniques. An operational approach is based on an epistemic view in which the relevant natural processes are represented in terms of spatiotemporal random fields and the probability laws are expressed in terms of physically meaningful operators. The spirit of this view is to keep the field solutions consistent with the site-specific information (hard data, uncertain observations, etc.) while exactly satisfying the constraints arising from general knowledge sources (physical laws, primitive equations, scientific theories, etc.). Natural field probabilities in space and time are derived for non-Bayesian operational conditionals based on deductively sound inference, which are valid for a wide variety of knowledge bases. Analytical and numerical comparisons are made between Bayesian and non-Bayesian conditionals, and insight is gained in terms of examples and applications which cut across various earth science disciplines. Operational Bayesian conditionalization is a powerful and versatile component of assimilation modelling with many applications in environmental sciences, although in certain cases a non-Bayesian conditional (based on deductive logic and the characterization of physical connection) may provide a meaningful description of the data assimilation framework suggested by the laws of nature.

AB Elevation-based hydrogeomorphic models are widely used to parsimoniously delineate floodplains with limited input data using topographic gradients to distinguish floodplain areas from hillslopes. Hydrogeomorphic models generally use scaling laws to assess flood flow depths as a function of contributing drainage areas. Floodplains are consequently mapped as those areas underlying maximum flood levels. Recent scientific literature has demonstrated that hydrogeomorphic models consistently perform from regional to global scale, validating geomorphic floodplain delineations in diverse morphological and hydroclimatic river settings. Nevertheless, the relationship between model fidelity, basin morphology, and basin hydroclimatic conditions is still unclear. Specifically, further investigations on the applicability of scaling laws in semi-arid and low-gradient basins is needed. In this work we investigated how climatic variability and basin slope can influence the parameterization of the abovementioned scaling laws in support of hydrogeomorphic floodplain modeling. Eleven basins in the west-central United States were selected as case studies. This research demonstrated that sub-basins slope and annual rainfall are the most influential morphometric and climatic parameters on scaling law regressions. Specifically, we found that scaling relationships are inconsistent in defining semi-arid basin floodplains (average annual rainfall lower than 570 mm) with low-gradient valley slopes (lower than 5%).

AB A connection between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and weather phenomena in eastern Australia has been recognized for several decades. However. little work has been devoted to addressing how this correlation affects hydrological system behaviour within regional scale catchments. In this study. spatially distributed ENSO effects are evaluated in terms of monthly rainfall, evaporation, streamflow and runoff characteristics for a 1300(2) km catchment. The catchment is located in southeastern Australia where previous studies have indicated only modest ENSO influences on rainfall variability. Spatial and temporal analysis indicates that strongest ENSO-induced rainfall variability occurs during summer months. Additionally, the: strength of the relationship is variable in space indicating that topographic controls may affect ENSO influences on rainfall totals and intensities. However, analysis of runoff shows substantially magnified ENSO-induced variability In comparison to the induced variability in rainfall. This may be attributable to the nonlinearity of runoff generation. Differences in antecedent moisture storage conditions will exist but mag also br enhanced by complementary ENSO influences on daily rainfall intensities and mean monthly evaporation and temperature totals. The degree of the nonlinearity displayed by the hydrometeorological processes presented demonstrates that the significance of ENSO forecasts for surface water resource management should be assessed with direct regard to streamflow generation rather than on the basis Of rainfall totals alone.

AB A conceptual model is presented for non-Newtonian fluid flow in a rough channel representing a single fracture. The fluid rheology is described via a truncated power-law (TPL) model approximating the Carreau constitutive equation, while the aperture variation along the channel is modeled via a stochastic distribution of assigned mean and variance; the log normal and gamma distributions are considered, together with a deterministic variation of sinusoidal behavior. The flow rate in a fracture subject to an external pressure gradient is derived under the lubrication approximation for the two limiting cases of a pressure gradient which is i) perpendicular and ii) parallel to aperture variation; these parallel and serial arrangements (PA or SA) provide an upper and lower bound to the fracture conductance. Different combinations of the parameters describing the fluid rheology and the variability of the aperture field are considered for a sensitivity analysis. Results are also compared with those valid for a pure power-law (PL) fluid which provides a relevant benchmark. The channel flow rate shows a direct/inverse dependency upon aperture variability for PA/SA. The difference in flow rate between the PL and TPL models is positively affected by aperture variability and pressure gradient, negatively affected by flow behaviour index, while its sign is positive or negative depending on PA/SA. The influence of the specific pdf adopted for the aperture field is moderate, an increasing function of aperture variability and depends on the third and fourth moment of the distribution. The conductance for a deterministic aperture variation exhibits the same trends as a stochastic variation, with differences from the latter depending on aperture variability and flow arrangement.

AB The high complexity of nitrate dynamics and corresponding deterministic models make it very appealing to employ easy, fast, and parsimonious modelling alternatives for decision support. This study presents a fuzzy rule based metamodel consisting of eight fuzzy modules, which is able to simulate nitrate fluxes in large watersheds from their diffuse sources via surface runoff, interflow, and base flow to the catchment outlet. The fuzzy rules are trained on a database established with a calibrated SWAT model for an investigation area of 1000 km(2). The metamodel performs well on this training area and on two out of three validation areas in different landscapes, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of around 0.5-0.7 for the monthly nitrate calculations. The fuzzy model proves to be fast, requires only few readily available input data, and the rule based model structure facilitates a common-sense interpretation of the model, which deems the presented approach suitable for the development of decision support tools.

AB The classical Local Cubic Law (LCL) generally overestimates flow through real fractures. We thus developed and tested a modified LCL (MLCL) which takes into account local tortuosity and roughness, and works across a low range of local Reynolds Numbers. The MLCL is based on (1) modifying the aperture field by orienting it with the flow direction and (2) correcting for local roughness changes associated with local flow expansion/contraction. In order to test the MLCL, we compared it with direct numerical simulations with the Navier-Stokes equations using real and synthetic three-dimensional rough-walled fractures, previous corrected forms of the LCL, and experimental flow tests. The MLCL performed well and the effective errors () in volumetric flow rate range from -3.4% to 13.4% with an arithmetic mean of |delta| (<|delta|>) equal to 3.7%. The MLCL is more accurate than previous modifications of the LCL. We also investigated the error associated with applying the Cubic Law (CL) while utilizing modified aperture field. The from the CL ranges from -14.2% to 11.2%, with a slightly higher <|delta|>=6.1% than the MLCL. The CL with the modified aperture field considering local tortuosity and roughness may also be sufficient for predicting the hydraulic properties of rough fractures.

AB [1] Field observations have revealed that the diffusion properties of fractured materials are strongly influenced by the presence of fractures. Using power law fracture length and fracture permeability distributions currently observed on natural fractured networks, we model the equivalent permeability of two- dimensional (2D) discrete fracture networks by using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments. We first give the dependence of the network equivalent permeability, obtained at the scale of the network, on the characteristic power law exponents of the fracture length and fracture permeability distributions. We especially show that the equivalent permeability depends simply on the geometrical mean of the local fracture permeability distribution. Such networks are characterized by an increase of permeability with scale without limitations, provided that the fracture length and fracture permeability distributions are broad enough. Although a correlation length cannot be systematically defined, the flow structure is still characterized by simple properties. The flow is either extremely channeled in one dominant path or distributed in several separated structures. We show finally that the observed scale effects and flow structure are very different from the one obtained in the lognormal fracture permeability distribution case.

AB Watersheds aggregate precipitation signals of many intensities and from many locations into a single observable streamflow at an outlet point. This dependency between precipitation and streamflow varies seasonally and can shift over time due to changes in land cover, climate, human water uses, or changes in properties of precipitation events themselves. We apply information theory-based measures to capture temporal linkages, or information transfers, from daily precipitation occurrence at different locations in a basin to streamflow at an outlet. We detect critical magnitudes of precipitation and lag times associated with the strongest precipitation-streamflow relationships, and further partition information transfers to determine relative contributions from the knowledge of wet versus dry past states. Based on an analysis of daily U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow and Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded gauge-based precipitation data sets in the Colorado Headwaters Basin, this dependency is strongest in fall, the longest dominant lag times occur in spring, and the strengths of dependencies have increased in spring and summer over the past 65 years. These features relate to both seasonal and spatial characteristics of precipitation and the landscape. A partitioning of information components shows that in this basin, the particular knowledge of a lagged, or past, wet state tends to be more informative to flow than a lagged dry state, even though dry days are more frequent. This study introduces several signatures of precipitation-streamflow relationships that can also more broadly characterize strengths, thresholds, and timescales associated with various interconnected processes.

AB Spreading of conservative solutes in groundwater due to aquifer heterogeneity is quantified by the macrodispersivity, which was found to be scale dependent. It increases with travel distance, stabilizing eventually at a constant value. However, the question of its asymptotic behavior at very large scale is still a matter of debate. It was surmised in the literature that macrodispersivity scales up following a unique scaling law. Attempts to define such a law were made by fitting a regression line in the log-log representation of an ensemble of macrodispersivities from multiple experiments. The functional relationships differ among the authors, based on the choice of data. Our study revisits the data basis, used for inferring unique scaling, through a detailed analysis of literature marcodispersivities. In addition, values were collected from the most recent tracer tests reported in the literature. We specified a system of criteria for reliability and reevaluated the reliability of the reported values. The final collection of reliable estimates of macrodispersivity does not support a unique scaling law relationship. On the contrary, our results indicate, that the field data can be explained as a collection of macrodispersivities of aquifers with varying degree of heterogeneity where each exhibits its own constant asymptotic value. Our investigation concludes that transport, and particularly the macrodispersivity, is formation-specific, and that modeling of transport cannot be relegated to a unique scaling law. Instead, transport requires characterization of aquifer properties, e.g., spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity, and the use of adequate models.

AB Environmental flow standards are a management tool that can help to protect the ecosystem services sustained by rivers. Although environmental flow requirements can be assessed using a variety of methods, most of these methods require establishing relationships between flow and habitat of species of concern. Here, we conducted a synthesis of past flow-ecology studies in the southeast USA. For each state or interstate river basin, we used the published data to determine the flow metrics that resulted in the greatest changes in ecological metrics, and the ecological metrics that were most sensitive to hydrologic alteration. The flow metrics that were most important in preserving ecological metrics were high-flow duration and frequency, 3-day maximum and minimum, and number of reversals. The ecological metrics most sensitive to hydrologic alteration were mostly related to presence or absence of key indicator species.

AB Finding an operational parameter vector is always challenging in the application of hydrologic models, with over-parameterization and limited information from observations leading to uncertainty about the best parameter vectors. Thus, it is beneficial to find every possible behavioural parameter vector. This paper presents a new methodology, called the patient rule induction method for parameter estimation (PRIM-PE), to define where the behavioural parameter vectors are located in the parameter space. The PRIM-PE was used to discover all regions of the parameter space containing an acceptable model behaviour. This algorithm consists of an initial sampling procedure to generate a parameter sample that sufficiently represents the response surface with a uniform distribution within the good-enough region (i.e., performance better than a predefined threshold) and a rule induction component (PRIM), which is then used to define regions in the parameter space in which the acceptable parameter vectors are located. To investigate its ability in different situations, the methodology is evaluated using four test problems. The PRIM-PE sampling procedure was also compared against a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler known as the differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM(ZS)) algorithm. Finally, a spatially distributed hydrological model calibration problem with two settings (a three-parameter calibration problem and a 23-parameter calibration problem) was solved using the PRIM-PE algorithm. The results show that the PRIM-PE method captured the good-enough region in the parameter space successfully using 8 and 107 boxes for the three-parameter and 23-parameter problems, respectively. This good-enough region can be used in a global sensitivity analysis to provide a broad range of parameter vectors that produce acceptable model performance. Moreover, for a specific objective function and model structure, the size of the boxes can be used as a measure of equifinality.

AB Flow through rough fractures is investigated numerically in order to assess the validity of the local cubic law for different fracture geometries. Two-dimensional channels with sinusoidal walls having different geometrical properties defined by the aperture, the amplitude, and the wavelength of the walls' corrugations, the corrugations asymmetry, and the phase shift between the two walls are considered to represent different fracture geometries. First, it is analytically shown that the hydraulic aperture clearly deviates from the mean aperture when the walls' roughness, the phase shift, and/or the asymmetry between the fracture walls are relatively high. The continuity and the Navier-Stokes equations are then solved by means of the finite element method and the numerical solutions compared to the theoretical predictions of the local cubic law. Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.066 to 66.66 are investigated so as to focus more particularly on the effect of flow inertial effects on the validity of the local cubic law. For low Reynolds number, typically less than 15, the local cubic law properly describes the fracture flow, especially when the fracture walls have small corrugation amplitudes. For Reynolds numbers higher than 15, the local cubic law is valid under the conditions that the fracture presents a low aspect ratio, small corrugation amplitudes, and a moderate phase lag between its walls.

AB Operating rule curves have been widely applied to reservoir operation, due to their ease of implementation. However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves including ecological operating rule curve under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China's Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge relating to the relationship between the characteristics of precipitation and sources of moisture is essential to improve our understanding of the global water cycle. This study presents the first quantitative estimation of the moisture source regions combined with stable isotope analyses for precipitation at K-puszta, east Hungary. The contributions of the following moisture sources were diagnosed according to the sector analysis of 4-day backward trajectories together with the calculation of evaporation and precipitation fluxes based on the specific humidity: Mediterranean region (57.0%), local moisture (14.8%), Atlantic region (14.2%), Northern Europe (7.4%) and Eastern Europe (6.6%). The D and O-18 values of daily precipitation were measured and the deuterium excess (d-excess) was calculated. The d-excess showed systematic differences among the marine sources, reflecting the characteristics of the moisture source area. The results suggest that the stable isotope composition of precipitation preserves information regarding the origin of the water vapour.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are widely used to assess the link between hydrological and biogeochemical processes at the catchment scale. C-Q relationships are mainly calibrated using mono-objective methods to represent, either concentrations or discharge-weighted concentrations (i.e., load). Based on its wide use in hydrological modelling, we test a multi-objective calibration for the C-Q relationship parameters, using both concentration and load, and compare it to a mono-objective calibration applied on either concentrations or load. This work is carried out on a high-frequency dataset (ORACLE-Orgeval Observatory, France). Our findings show that the multi-objective calibration yield a better representation of C-Q relationships parameters during the high and low-flow events. The multi-objective calibration can be used for all forms of C-Q relationships and avoids issues of under-representation of dilution processes characterized by high-discharge, low-concentration periods.

AB Mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions may alter porosity and permeability in porous media. While porosity generally increases with mineral dissolution and decreases with precipitation, corresponding permeability alterations are complex and predictive capabilities remain limited. The evolution of permeability depends on the spatial locations of geochemical reactions, both in individual pores and in the greater pore network and a range of reaction patterns have been observed in prior experimental investigations. Macroscopic relationships are needed in core-to-field scale reactive transport simulations that can accurately simulate permeability evolutions resulting from pore-scale reactions. Currently, empirical porosity-permeability relationships, such as the Kozeny-Carman equation, are widely used to predict permeability evolution. However, these relationships only allow for a single permeability value for each porosity value and the validity of these relationships for the various spatial distributions of pore-scale alterations is unknown. Using pore network model simulations, changes in permeability resulting from a range of dissolution and precipitation patterns (uniform, random, channelized, and size-dependent) in a sandstone sample are investigated. The validity of macroscopic porosity-permeability relationships for these reaction scenarios is evaluated by comparing computed permeability values with pore model simulations. Simulation results exhibit a large variation in porosity-permeability relationships among reaction scenarios. Macroscopic porosity-permeability relationships work well for uniform reaction scenarios where the extent of reaction is related to the pore size. The porosity and permeability relationships that result from more complex pore-scale alterations, including pore size-dependent reactions however, cannot be captured using these empirical relationships.

AB We have conducted extensive hydrologic simulation experiments in order to investigate how the flood scaling parameters in the power-law relationship Q(A) = alpha A(theta), between peak-discharges resulting from a single rainfall-runoff event Q(A) and upstream area A, change as a function of rainfall, runoff coefficient (C-r) that we use as a proxy for catchment antecedent moisture state, hillslope overland flow velocity (v(h)), and channel flow velocity (v(c)), all of which are variable in space. We use a physically-based distributed numerical framework that is based on an accurate representation of the drainage network and apply it to the Cedar River basin (A = 16, 861 km(2)), which is located in Eastern Iowa, USA. Our work is motivated by seminal empirical studies that show that the flood scaling parameters alpha and theta change from event to event. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanism behind the event-to-event variability of alpha and theta in terms of catchment physical processes and rainfall properties would significantly improve our ability to predict peak-discharge in ungauged basins (PUB). The simulation results demonstrate how both a and h are systematically controlled by the interplay among rainfall duration T, spatially averaged rainfall intensity E[I], as well as E[C-r], E[v(h)], and v(c). Specifically, we found that the value of theta generally decreases with increasing values of E[I], E[C-r], and E[v(h)], whereas its value generally increases with increasing T. Moreover, while alpha is primarily controlled by E[I], it increases with increasing E[C-r] and E[v(h)]. These results highlight the fact that the flood scaling parameters are able to be estimated from the aforementioned catchment rainfall and physical variables, which can be measured either directly or indirectly.

AB Large hydrological systems aggregate compositionally different waters derived from a variety of pathways. In the case of continental-scale rivers, such aggregation occurs noticeably at confluences between tributaries. Here we explore how such aggregation can affect solute concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships and thus obscure the message carried by these relationships in terms of weathering properties of the Critical Zone. We build up a simple model for tributary mixing to predict the behavior of C-Q relationships during aggregation. We test a set of predictions made in the context of the largest world's river, the Amazon. In particular, we predict that the C-Q relationships of the rivers draining heterogeneous catchments should be the most "dilutional" and should display the widest hysteresis loops. To check these predictions, we compute 10 day-periodicity time series of Q and major solute (Si, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-) C and fluxes (F) for 13 gauging stations located throughout the Amazon basin. In agreement with the model predictions, C-Q relationships of most solutes shift from a fairly "chemostatic" behavior (nearly constant C) at the Andean mountain front and in pure lowland areas, to more "dilutional" patterns (negative C-Q relationship) toward the system mouth. More prominent C-Q hysteresis loops are also observed at the most downstream stations. Altogether, this study suggests that mixing of water and solutes between different flowpaths exerts a strong control on C-Q relationships of large-scale hydrological systems.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by vascular plants that form a mosaic of hydraulic conduits to water movement from the soil to the atmosphere. Together with canopy leaf area. canopy stomatal conductance regulates plant water use and thereby photosynthesis and growth. Although stomatal conductance is coordinated with plant hydraulic conductance, governing relationships across species has not yet been formulated at a practical level that can be employed in large-scale models. Here, combinations of published conductance measurements obtained with several methodologies across boreal to tropical climates were used to explore relationships between canopy conductance rates and hydraulic constraints. A parsimonious hydraulic model requiring sapwood-to-leaf area ratio and canopy height generated acceptable agreement with measurements across a range of biomes (r(2) = 0.75). The results suggest that, at long time scales, the functional convergence among ecosystems in the relationship between water-use and hydraulic architecture eclipses inter-specific variation in physiology and anatomy of the transport system. Prognostic applicability of this model requires independent knowledge of sapwood-to-leaf area. In this study, we did not find a strong relationship between sapwood-to-leaf area and physical or climatic variables that are readily determinable at coarse scales, though the results suggest that climate may have a mediating influence on the relationship between sapwood-to-leaf area and height. Within temperate forests, canopy height alone explained a large amount of the variance in reference canopy conductance (r(2) = 0.68) and this relationship may be more immediately applicable in the terrestrial ecosystem models.

AB The spatiotemporal distribution of pore water in the vadose zone can have a critical control on many processes in the near-surface Earth, such as the onset of landslides, crop yield, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation. Electrical geophysics has been widely used to monitor the moisture content (theta) distribution in the vadose zone at field sites, and often resistivity (rho) or conductivity (sigma) is converted to moisture contents through petrophysical relationships (e.g., Archie's law). Though both the petrophysical relationships (i.e., choices of appropriate model and parameterization) and the derived moisture content are known to be subject to uncertainty, they are commonly treated as exact and error-free. This study examines the impact of uncertain petrophysical relationships on the moisture content estimates derived from electrical geophysics. We show from a collection of data from multiple core samples that significant variability in the theta (rho) relationship can exist. Using rules of error propagation, we demonstrate the combined effect of inversion and uncertain petrophysical parameterization on moisture content estimates and derive their uncertainty bounds. Through investigation of a water injection experiment, we observe that the petrophysical uncertainty yields a large range of estimated total moisture volume within the water plume. The estimates of changes in water volume, however, generally agree within (large) uncertainty bounds. Our results caution against solely relying on electrical geophysics to estimate moisture content in the field. The uncertainty propagation approach is transferrable to other field studies of moisture content estimation.
   Plain Language Summary Maps and images of electrical resistivity have been widely applied to effectively monitor the wetting or drying of the Earths' near-surface. But how well can they quantify such change? How variable are the petrophysical model parameters that relate resistivity and moisture content? Does uncertainty in such relationships impact our confidence in moisture content estimates from resistivity imaging? Our analysis of field samples collected at a U.K. field site reveals great variability in petrophysical parameters. Using an uncertainty propagation method, which combines the uncertainty contributions from both petrophysical parameters and resistivity data errors, we find that the variable petrophysical parameters can lead to high uncertainty in moisture content estimates and they appear to be the dominating factor in many cases. These effects on uncertainty are greater than previously appreciated. The implication is that realistic uncertainty bounds are needed whenever electrical geophysical methods are used to quantify the amount of water present underground or its changes over time. The findings highlight the importance of better characterization of petrophysical parameters and the need to supplement the interpretation of resistivity-based moisture content estimates with other data sources.

AB Karst aquifers and springs are important with respect to their potential for supplying drinking water in regions suffering from water scarcity in Iran. Accordingly, it is essential to determine the recharge potential of the catchment and the regions with higher obtainability potential. This study provides a road map for the Sheshpeer catchment in southern Iran. A recharge potential (RP) map was produced from which a recharge index (RI) was computed for several selected springs in the catchment. Furthermore, the unit discharge (q) - defined as the average annual discharge for a given catchment area and unit rainfall depth for each spring - was calculated. The plot of q versus RI for the springs showed a linear positive relationship between the two variables (R-2 = 0.9). Applying the trend equation of this plot to the whole Sheshpeer karstic catchment reveals that its long-term recharge coefficient is 0.74.

AB River channels self-organize to form tree-like networks that follow certain statistical laws, such as Horton's laws and Hack's law, which is perhaps the reason why simple statistical models are often used to explain river network evolution. However, statistical models generally do not attempt to explain the differences between network structures. Here we address this issue by incorporating certain physically meaningful variables in a statistical modeling framework. The model allows the network to grow in a headward direction via probabilistic decisions based on two free parameters. Simulations performed over a planar matrix result in tree-like networks exhibiting power-law scaling relationships as displayed by real river networks. The two parameters are shown to be capable of explaining the variation of key network characteristics such as compactness coefficient and Hack's exponent. The uniqueness of the model thus lies in its ability to generate networks with different shapes and characteristics.

AB This study aims to analyse the effect of the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) on drought indices in northern Iraq. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for 3-, 6- and 12-month time scales was calculated to determine the behaviour of the meteorological drought for the period 1983-2014. Average drought characteristics were found for three periods: 1983-1993, 1994-2004 and 2005-2014. The SPEI demonstrated similar patterns for the 3- and 6-month time scales in terms of the worst drought years for the first and second periods. The relationship between SPEI and AOI exhibited higher correlation in the 12-month time scale than in the 3- and 6-month time scales for all regions. In particular, the AOI had a more significant impact on SPEI 12-month time scale for Mosul and Duhok regions compared with the other regions.

AB In this paper we focus on a general model to describe compressible and immiscible three-phase flow in porous media. The underlying idea is to replace Darcy's law by more general momentum balance equations. In particular, we want to account for viscous coupling effects by introducing fluid-fluid interaction terms. In [Qiao, et al. (2018) Adv Water Resour 112: 170-188] a water-oil model based on the theory of mixtures was explored. It was demonstrated how the inclusion of viscous coupling effects could allow the model to better capture flow regimes which involve a combination of co-current and counter-current flow. In this work we extend the model in different aspects: (i) account for three phases (water,oil,gas) instead of two; (H) deal with both the compressible and incompressible case; (Hi) include viscous terms that represent frictional forces within the fluid (Brinkman type). A main objective of this work is to explore this three-phase model, which appears to be more realistic than standard formulation, in the context of petroleum related applications. We first provide development of stable numerical schemes in a one-dimensional setting which can be used to explore the generalized water-oil-gas model, both for the compressible and incompressible case. Then, several numerical examples with waterflooding in a gas reservoir and water alternating gas (WAG) experiments in an oil reservoir are investigated. Differences and similarities between the compressible and incompressible model are highlighted, and the fluid-fluid interaction effect is illustrated by comparison of results from the generalized model and a conventional model formulation.

AB Empirically-derived relationships are mainly used to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) in water balance models. Due to a lack of effective factors and correct conceptual relationships, the resulting ET may be inaccurate. Therefore, a hydrological model was developed by combining water balance and bulk transfer theory, called semi-distributed coupled water balance and bulk transfer (SD-CWBT). According to it, a dynamic interrelationship between ET and soil moisture was correctly established to estimate ET via physical concepts. Global gridded ET retrievals, which provide the spatiotemporal distribution of ET at a global scale, including ECMWF Reanalysis v5-Land (ERA5-Land), TERRA, Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), were employed to evaluate the model. The results indicated the SD-CWBT, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of [0.6, 0.95], [0.68, 0.96], and [12.61, 0.99] for the streamflow and groundwater level simulation, respectively, had better performance compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, the estimated spatiotemporal distributions of ET agreed well with the climatic-vegetation conditions.

AB The rill structure over the soil surface plays an important role in determining the runoff and sediment loss from hillslopes. The microtopography is often complicated, and representation of the hillslope surface on a rill-by-rill basis is uneconomical and impractical. A spectral approach combined with a stochastic theory is proposed for the rill profile. The theory develops appropriate probability distribution laws for rill amplitudes and rill periods (interrill areas) under the assumption that the spectrum of the rill profile is narrow banded. This study establishes a foundation for future studies dealing with parameter estimation, and determining the global roughness and erodibility for runoff and sediment discharge predictions over hillslopes.

AB The main aim of this paper was to test a recently theoretically deduced flow resistance equation, based on a power-velocity profile, using a wide database of available measurements carried out in laboratory and field experimental runs with overland flow under simulated rainfall. In comparison with previous calibrations and validations of this theoretically deduced flow resistance equation, the used database by Emmett is characterized by a wide range of rainfall intensities (from 79.2 to 303.5 mm h(-1) for laboratory runs and from 178.3 to 215.9 mmh -l- for field investigations) and bed slopes (from 0.33 to 17% for laboratory runs and from 2.9 to 33.2% for field investigations). For the first time, the wide Emmett's database of laboratory runs carried out by an overland flow subjected to rainfall in a rough-bed-flume was used for testing the theoretical resistance law. Furthermore, the seven investigated field vegetated plots allowed to broaden the range of examined subcritical flows and rainfall intensity. Laboratory data were divided into two datasets (calibration and testing), and the overland flow measurements on a smooth bed by Yoon and Wenzel were added to the testing dataset to assess the applicability of the calibrated equation for different bed roughness conditions. The available laboratory measurements of flow velocity, water depth, hydraulic cross-section area, wetted perimeter and bed slope allowed both to calibrate and test the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Gamma, the bed slope, the flow Froude number, and the rainfall Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless group representing the effect of rainfall intensity on flow resistance. The field data were used to calibrate the same flow resistance law and evaluate the effect of different types of vegetation, adapting the relationship obtained by Nicosia et al. The developed analysis showed that: i) the theoretical flow resistance equation gave an accurate estimate of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for overland flow under simulated rainfall on rough bed both in laboratory and in field condition; ii) the flow resistance increased with rainfall intensity for the investigated laminar overland flow; iii) the flow resistance relationship is able to take into account different vegetation types characterized by different roughness.

AB Reservoirs are one of the most efficient infrastructures for integrated water resources development and management; and play a more and more important role in flood control and conservation. Optimal refill operation before the end of flood season is a valuable and effective approach to compromise the flood control, hydropower generation and comprehensive utilization of water resources of river basins. An integrated model consisting of a flood control risk analysis module, a utilization benefits analysis module and a multi-objective evaluation module was proposed in this study to derive joint optimal refill rules for cascade reservoirs. The Jinsha River and Three Gorges cascade reservoirs in the Changjiang River basin of China are selected for a case study. Sixty-one years of observed daily runoff data from 1950 to 2010 have been used to test the model. The results indicate that the proposed model can make an effective tradeoff between flood control and utilization benefits. Joint optimal synchronous and asynchronous refill rules can generate 3.25% and 2.78% more annual average hydropower, respectively and improve the fullness storage rate without increasing flood control risk comparing with the original designed operating rules.

AB A proper understanding of the sources and effects of uncertainty is needed to achieve the goals of reliability and sustainability in water resource management and planning. Many studies have focused on uncertainties relating to climate inputs (e. g., precipitation and temperature), as well as those related to supply and demand relationships. In the end-to-end projection of the hydrological impacts of climate variability, however, hydrological uncertainties have often been ignored or addressed indirectly. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of hydrological uncertainties for reliable water resources management. We assess the uncertainties associated with hydrological inputs, parameters, and model structural uncertainties using an integrated Bayesian uncertainty estimator framework. Subsequently, these uncertainties are propagated through a simple reservoir management model in order to evaluate how various operational rules impact the characteristics of the downstream uncertainties, such as the width of the uncertainty bounds. By considering different operational rules, we examine how hydrological uncertainties impact reliability, resilience, and vulnerability of the management system. The results of this study suggest that a combination of operational rules (i.e., an adaptive operational approach) is the most reliable and sustainable overall management strategy.

TI Foundation theories of solute transport in porous media: a critical
   review
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Review
ID DISPERSION; MODELS; FLOW; EQUATIONS
AB The theories that have been employed to derive the macroscopic differential equations that describe solute transport through porous media are reviewed critically. These foundational theories may be grouped into three classes: (1) those based in fluid mechanics, (2) those based in kinematic approaches employing the mathematics of the theory of Markov processes, and (3) those based in a formal analogy between statistical thermodynamics and hydrodynamic dispersion. It is shown that the theories of class 1 have had to employ highly artificial models of a porous medium in order to produce a well-defined velocity field in the pore space that can be analysed rigorously or have i had to assume that well-defined solutions of the equations of fluid mechanics exist in the pore space of a natural porous medium and then adopt an ad hoc definition of the solute diffusivity tensor. The theories of class 2 do not require the validity of fluid mechanics but they suffer from the absence of a firm dynamical basis, at the molecular level, for the stochastic properties they attribute to the velocity of a solute molecule, or they ignore dynamics altogether and make kinematic assumptions directly on the position process of a solute molecule. The theories of class 3 have been purely formal in nature, with an unclear physical content, or have been no different in content from empirically based theories that make use of the analogy between heat and matter flow at the macroscopic level. It is concluded that none of the existing foundational theories has yet achieved the objectives of: (1) deriving, in a physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous fashion, the macroscopic differential equations of solute transport theory, and (2) elucidating the structure of the empirical coefficients appearing in these equations.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

   SOIL; FRONT; MODEL; DIMENSIONS; GRADIENT; GRAVITY
AB Early stages of evaporation from porous media are marked by relatively high evaporation rates supplied by capillary liquid flow from a receding drying front to vaporization surface. At a characteristic drying front depth, hydraulic continuity to the surface is disrupted marking the onset of stage-2 evaporation where a lower evaporative flux is supported by vapor diffusion. Observations suggest that in some cases the transition is accompanied by a jump in the vaporization plane from the surface to a certain depth below. The resulting range of evaporation rates at the onset of stage-2 is relatively narrow (0.5-2.5 mm d(-1)). The objective is to estimate the depth of the vaporization plane that defines vapor diffusion length at the onset of stage-2. The working hypothesis is that the jump length is determined by a characteristic length of connected clusters at the secondary drying front that obeys a power law with the system's Bond number. We conducted evaporation experiments using sands and glass beads of different particle size distributions and extracted experimental data from the literature for model comparison. Results indicate the jump length at the end of stage-1 was affected primarily by porous media properties and less so by boundary conditions. Results show power law relationships between the length of the vaporization plane jump and Bond number with an exponent of -0.48 in good agreement with the percolation theory theoretical exponent of -0.47. The results explain the origins of a relatively narrow range of evaporation rates at the onset of stage-2, and provide a means for estimating these rates.

AB The high variability in the hydrological regime of the Eastern Hydrological Region (EHR) of Northeast Brazil often results in floods and droughts, leading to serious socio-economic issues. Therefore, this work aimed to investigate connections between spatiotemporal hydrological variability of the EHR and large-scale climate phenomena. Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to relate climate indices with hydrological variables within two representative river basins in the EHR. The results indicated a multi-annual relationship between the state of the sea surface temperature of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and anomalous hydrological variability in the basins. In addition, the northern Tropical Atlantic conditions were shown to play an important role in modulating the long-term variability of the hydrological response of the basins, whilst only extreme ENSO anomalies seemed to affect the rainy season. This knowledge is an important step towards long-term prediction of hydrological conditions and contributes to the improvement of water resources planning and management in the EHR.

AB A model based on analytical development and numerical solution is presented for estimating the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the runoff volume and peak discharge rate of urban floods using the joint probability density function (pdf) of rainfall volume and duration together with information about the catchment's physical characteristics. The joint pdf of rainfall event volume and duration is derived using the theory of copulas. Four families of Archimedean copulas are tested in order to select the most appropriate to reproduce the dependence structure of those variables. Frequency distributions of runoff event volume and peak discharge rate are obtained following the derived probability distribution theory, using the functional relationship given by the rainfall runoff process. The model is tested in two urban catchments located in the cities of Chillan and Santiago, Chile. The results are compared with the outcomes of continuous simulation in the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and with those from another analytical model that assumes storm event duration and volume to be statistically independent exponentially distributed variables.

   MEDIA; INSTABILITY; EVOLUTION
AB [1] For unsteady variable-density seepage flow, alternative solutions are obtained by taking, respectively, the curl and the divergence of a linear form of Darcy's law, and solving each problem directly, using compatible boundary conditions. This gives a vector potential formulation depending upon the horizontal density gradient, and a pressure formulation depending upon the vertical density gradient, resulting in two complementary solutions. Two velocity fields are obtained by taking the curl of the vector potential solution, and by solving Darcy's law using the gradient of the pressure solution, and corresponding vector potentials are obtained, fairly symmetrically, from these velocities. The novelty is that a linear combination of the two solutions can be made by simple addition or subtraction, with independent scalar coefficients, having broader scope than each of the alternative solutions alone. A two-dimensional model, based on convective plumes in a Hele-Shaw experiment with a macroscopic Rayleigh number of 3975, is treated as a benchmark salt lake problem, having a uniform evaporation layer with 1% noise along one-third part of the upper boundary, with appropriate saline recharge. The coefficients are optimized for maximum circulation. This determines the ratio of the pressure-based solution to the vector potential-based solution, modifying the Rayleigh number downward to an effective value of 3455. Numerical streamlines reveal secondary flow typical of Henry circulation, measured by a peak stream function equal to the circulation flux. From finger geometry, there is better agreement between the numerically calculated plumes and the experimental plumes than has been achieved previously.

AB We examined stream water concentration-discharge relationships for eight small, forest watersheds ranging in elevation from 1485 to 2465 m in the southern Sierra Nevada. These headwater streams revealed nearly chemostatic behavior by current definitions for K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, and SO42 in most cases but not for NH4+, NO3, or ortho-P. The latter ions were somewhat enriched during high flows. All ions studied showed a dilution process at lower flows (< 50 L s(-1)) with the concentration-discharge relationship being more chemostatic at higher flows. While previous studies in the Sierra Nevada have reported peak concentrations of NH4+, NO3, and SO42 during snowmelt, the headwater systems of the Kings River Experimental Watersheds experience peak concentrations of these ions during the fall rains after the dry summer. These forested watersheds span the rain-snow transition zone, are 49-228 ha in size, and have soils derived from granite. A statistically significant relationship between soils and stream water concentrations for ortho-P, Ca2+, and Na+ strongly suggests that soil chemistry has a major influence on stream water chemistry. Factors controlling stream water NH4+, NO3, and SO4+ concentrations are less clear, but one possible source of spikes in these ions during storm events is input from O-horizon runoff where high concentrations were measured. Overall, stream water concentration-discharge relationships for these Sierran watersheds are similar to those found in other watershed systems (nearly chemostatic); however, the dominant processes controlling these relationships are probably localized because of different watershed characteristics like soil chemistry, vegetation cover, hydrologic flow paths, and weather patterns.

AB The operating rules, especially the hedging rules, which are known as useful tools for effective utilization of water from reservoir systems, are commonly applied for managing reservoir systems in severe drought periods. Extracting optimal operation policies for multi-reservoir systems is a challenging issue due to their non-linear, large-scale, and stochastic nature. Therefore, improving optimization techniques is a worthy effort in developing the operating rules for multi-reservoir systems. Hence, this research aimed to develop an efficient optimization method called multi-mechanism ensemble interior search algorithm (MEISA) to tackle various problems in the optimal management of reservoir systems. The MEISA promotes the two main operators of the interior search algorithm (ISA) (i.e., the composition and the mirror operators) to enhance the capability of global and local search. Besides, the proposed algorithm employs an enhanced opposition-based learning (EOBL) operator to improve the best solution and increase the convergence speed. The MEISA also uses an adaptive parameter to balance the global and local search in the proposed algorithm. The results of several test functions demonstrate that the MEISA outperforms other optimizers in terms of the solution accuracy, the quality, and the convergence rate. Finally, the results of optimizing the hedging rules for two real-world single- and multi-reservoir systems in Iran indicate that the MEISA is more suitable efficient in ameliorating irreversible impacts of severe drought periods as compared with other optimization methods. The results show that the MEISA has highly convincing performance in obtaining the optimal hedging rules for the efficient management of multi-reservoir systems.

AB An entropy theory is formulated for one-dimensional movement of moisture in unsaturated soils in the vertically downward direction. The theory is composed of five parts: (1) Tsallis entropy, (2) principle of maximum entropy, (3) specification of information on soil moisture in terms of constraints, (4) maximization of the Tsallis entropy, and (5) derivation of the probability distributions of soil moisture. The theory is applied to determine the soil moisture profile under three conditions: (1) the moisture is maximum at the soil surface and decreases downward to a minimum value at the bottom of the soil column (it may be near the water table); (2) the moisture is minimum at the soil surface and increases downward to a maximum value at the end of the soil column (this case is the opposite of case 1); and (3) the moisture at the soil surface is low and increases downward up to a distance and then decreases up to the bottom (this case combines case 2 and case 1). The entropy-based soil moisture profiles are tested using experimental observations reported in the literature, and properties of these profiles are enumerated.

AB Numerical modeling was used to generate pore-scale structures with different structural properties. They were partially saturated according to wetting and drainage regimes using morphological operations for a range of saturations. The hydraulic and electrical conductivities of the resulting partially saturated grain packs were numerically computed to produce relative hydraulic conductivity versus saturation and relative electrical conductivity versus saturation curves. The relative hydraulic conductivities were then compared to the relative electrical conductivities for the same saturations and it was found that relative hydraulic conductivity could be expressed as relative electrical conductivity to a power law exponent, . This exponent was not correlated to porosity, specific surface area, or tortuosity. It did change according to whether the soil was wetting or draining. However, a value of 2.1 reproduced relative hydraulic conductivity from relative electrical conductivity with little added error. The effects of surface conduction on the observed power law relationship due to either low fluid electrical conductivity or increased clay content were analyzed. The relationship was found to hold for fluid conductivities typical of groundwater and for clay content of less than 5% if the clays were layered perpendicular to electrical flow. The relationship breaks down for electrical flow parallel to clay layers, which makes the choice of electrode arrangement important in cases where clay may be present. This relationship can be used with secondary pressure or saturation data to characterize a soil's hydraulic conductivity curve.

AB The rate of streamflow recession can be used to assess storage-outflow properties of source aquifers. A common method of analyzing streamflow recession is to plot the time rate of change in streamflow Q as a function of Q in a log-log space. Theory predicts, for diagnostic recession regimes, a power law relationship -dQ /dt = aQ(b), where recession coefficients a and b are functions of the hydraulic and geometric properties of the aquifer and of boundary and initial conditions. Observational error reduces the accuracy of estimates of a and b with errors in estimating the time derivative of the late-time recession (-dQ/dt) being particularly sensitive to observational error. Here we propose a method to improve estimation of a and b with particular focus on the estimation of -dQ/dt. Compared to previously published methods we find greater robustness in estimates of -dQ/dt and recession parameters and less sensitivity to the methodological parameters employed. Previous methods result in up to 50 to 100% error when estimating the recession parameter b, while the proposed methodology produces errors below 5% in the cases analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The work done on the intertidal landscape by low tide rainfall events has been shown to augment the cycling of dissolved and particulate nutrients, but low tide rainfall events are not a well-documented component of coastal ecosystem models. Here we develop the relationships between rainfall intensity (I), and median volume raindrop diameter, and three rainfall erosivity indices (kinetic energy, momentum, and momentum multiplied by the drop diameter) using an optical disdrometer deployed in the intertidal zone during summer and fall of 2010 and 2011. These data include the local effects of Hurricane Irene in 2011. Raindrop data measured for 27 days of late summer were analyzed. The best fit between median volume raindrop diameter and I was a combination of the power-law and logarithm equations, and the best fits of three erosivity indices and I were obtained with power-law equations. Kinetic energy was slightly higher than the world average. Observed raindrop velocity was typically lower and more widely distributed than the theoretical raindrop terminal velocity. Hence, erosivity indices based on observed velocity were lower than those based on terminal velocity. The hurricane provided larger raindrops and more widely distributed raindrop velocity than normal events. Overall, results indicate that it is not suitable to assume that background erosivity-I relationships apply to cyclonic events. We derived new erosivity-I relationships to help characterize soil erosion processes in salt marsh areas for normal events. These results will help predict material and nutrient fluxes between intertidal and subtidal landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall data are needed for water resource management and decision making and are obtained from rainfall networks. These data are especially important for streamflow simulations and forecasting the occurrence of intense rainfall during the flood season. Therefore, rainfall networks should be carefully designed and evaluated. Several methods are used for rainfall network design, and information theory-based methods have recently received significant attention. This study focuses on the design of a rainfall network, especially for streamflow simulation. A multi-objective design method is proposed and applied to the Wei River basin in China. We use the total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy and multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer. Information redundancy refers to the overlap of information between rainfall stations, and information transfer refers to the rainfall-runoff relationship. The outlet streamflow station (Huaxian station in the Wei River basin) is used as the target station for the streamflow simulation. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used for the multi-objective optimization of the rainfall network design. We compared the proposed multi-objective design with two other methods using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The optimized rainfall network from the proposed method led to reasonable outlet streamflow forecasts with a balance between network efficiency and streamflow simulation. Our results indicate that the multi-objective strategy provides an effective design by which the rainfall network can consider the rainfall-runoff process and benefit streamflow prediction on a catchment scale.

AB GRACE observations of the time-dependent gravity field provide a direct measurement of the monthly state of mass and thus monthly total water storage in a catchment. This for the first time allows for a direct comparison of monthly runoff and water storage. Investigations of global scale Runoff-Storage (R-S) relationships for different climatic conditions show distinct periodic characteristics with hysteresis for total water storage. For fully humid tropical catchments, hysteresis reveals a time invariant temporal delay from storage to runoff. Our spectral analysis supports the fact that the R-S relationships can be characterized as a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) System. As a consequence in time domain an adjustment of time lag leads to correlation of 0.98 between runoff and storage. Based hereon, the hypothesis of a R-S relationship characterized by the superposition of linear contributions from coupled/liquid storage and nonlinear contributions from uncoupled storages is investigated by means of remote sensing. For boreal catchments MODIS snow coverage is used to separate total storage into coupled/liquid and uncoupled/solid components either directly by assigning frozen solid storage to the snow-covered areas or indirectly by a model-based aggregation of snow and liquid according to snow coverage. Both methods show that the nonlinear part of the R-S relationship can be fully assigned to the uncoupled/solid storage while the relationship of runoff and liquid storage can also be characterized as an LTI system. This system behavior thus allows for a direct determination of river runoff from GRACE mass and vice versa for unmanaged catchments, provided that the coupled/uncoupled storage components can be quantified remote sensing.

AB Quantitative descriptions of two-phase flow in the subsurface require knowledge of the capillary pressure-saturation relationships. The effect of interfacial forces on the drainage capillary pressure-saturation relationship for organic liquid-water systems is usually expressed by the ratio of the liquid-liquid interfacial tensions as given by Leverett's (1941) function. To assess the appropriateness of this approach for primary drainage of organic liquid-water systems typical of hazardous waste sites and to evaluate its extendability to spontaneous imbibition, measurements were made of these relationships for various immiscible liquid systems in unconsolidated sand. The results showed increasing deviations with decreasing interfacial forces between the measured values and those predicted by a ratio of interfacial tensions. To improve the predictive capability of Leverett's function, forms including the intrinsic contact angle and roughness were examined. Scaling of the capillary pressure relationships was best achieved by including a correction for both interface curvature and roughness. These corrections became significant for drainage for contact angles larger than 35-degrees-55-degrees, and for imbibition for contact angles larger than 15-degrees-25-degrees. None of the forms of Leverett's function examined predicted the increased residual saturation with decreasing interfacial forces observed in this study. Consequently, their ability to scale the measured data was predicated on posing the saturation of the wetting phase in terms of the variable effective saturation.

AB [1] We present a theoretical and numerical study of the connectivity of fracture networks with fractal correlations. In addition to length distribution, this spatial property observed on most fracture networks conveys long-range correlation that may be crucial on network connectivity. We especially focus on the model that comes out relevant to natural fracture network: a fractal density distribution for the fracture centers ( dimension D) and a power law distribution for the fracture lengths (exponent a, n(l) similar to l(-a)). Three different regimes of connectivity are identified depending on D and on a. For a < D + 1 the length distribution prevails against fractal correlation on network connectivity. In this case, global connectivity is mostly ruled by the largest fractures whose length is of the order of the system size, and thus the connectivity increases with scale. For a > D + 1 the connectivity is ruled by fractures much smaller than the system size with a strong control of spatial correlation; the connectivity now decreases with system scale. Finally, for the self-similar case ( a = D + 1), which corresponds to the transition between the two previous regimes, connectivity properties are scale invariant: percolation threshold corresponds to a critical fractal density and the average number of intersections per fracture at threshold is a scale invariant as well.

AB Hack's law, an empirical, power law relationship between drainage basin area and the length of the main stream channel, has long been taken to imply that drainage basins become more elongate (relatively longer and narrower) with increasing basin size. A study of the geometry of 38 basins from three distinct geomorphic settings shows that this geometric interpretation of Hack's law is only occasionally true: Even though Hack's power law relationship holds between basin area and main channel length, these basins do not necessarily become more elongate with increasing size. Rather, Hack's law is an expression of a balance between changes in basin shape and changes in channel planform geometry. For the basins in this study, changes in channel sinuosity play the most important role in this balance; changes in basin shape are far less regular. Local conditions appear to determine the partitioning of importance between changes in basin shape and channel sinuosity.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; MODELS; DERIVATION
AB Reservoir operation rules play a key role in real-time reservoir operation; the main factors affecting operation decisions are the current reservoir status and the future inflows. However, the future reservoir inflows are stochastic and always contain uncertainty. To study the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules, this paper proposes a Bayesian Deep learning method that considers both model parameter uncertainty and inflow uncertainty. In the model, the Monte Carlo integration is used to convert the complex integrals of inflow probability into a summation form. Variational inference is employed to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters. The proposed method is applied to a real-world application at Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River. The uncertainty estimation results show that the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rule is greater than model parameter uncertainty, and the decision of reservoir operation is more sensitive to the reservoir inflow during dry season than other seasons. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian deep learning performs better than the comparison method in term of hydropower generation and the root mean square errors. Moreover, the proposed method is more robust than the comparison method when considering the inflow uncertainty.

   CLIMATE; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB The increase in water demand in association with the degradation of water quality can result in conflicts between users, especially in semi-arid regions where reduced flow is likely during long periods of drought. In these regions, reservoirs are normally operated to ration water, according to the level of water stored, in order to reserve this water to supply the demands of a future drought, i.e., using the Zone-based Guide Curve method. However, the quality of the water is also important because eutrophication in reservoirs limits the use and availability of water. The aim of this study was to use the quantity-quality approach to define the operating rule for four reservoirs in the semi-arid region of Brazil, with the aim of providing satisfactory supply to users while reducing water scarcity and eutrophication in the reservoirs. Scenarios of supplying the demands were simulated and optimized with the use of the Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm, NSGA-II. The results showed that the application of the Zone Hedging Rule (ZHR), considering only the quantitative approach, was able to guarantee the priority demands and reduce the water scarcity for non-priority requirements. However, by only using the quantitative approach the reservoirs did not meet the quality criteria required by Brazilian legislation. Applying the ZHR with a quanti-qualitative approach considering more favorable water quality conditions, the reservoirs were able to supply the demands with satisfactory quantity and quality; however, when the phosphorus concentration is high, a severe rationing of demands is triggered, which may not be viable, especially in reservoirs with greater demands in relation to the regularized flow and the average annual input flow. Therefore, actions are required to reduce nutrient concentrations in reservoirs, in addition to optimizing operating rules.

TI Water for food: The global virtual water trade network
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID INTEGRATED MODEL; RESOURCES; FLOWS
AB We present a novel conceptual framework and methodology for studying virtual water trade. We utilize complex network theory to analyze the structure of the global virtual water trade associated with the international food trade. In the global virtual water trade network, the nations that participate in the international food trade correspond to the nodes, and the links represent the flows of virtual water associated with the trade of food from the country of export to the country of import. We find that the number of trade connections follows an exponential distribution, except for the case of import trade relationships, while the volume of water that each nation trades compares well with a stretched exponential distribution, indicating high heterogeneity of flows between nations. There is a power law relationship between the volume of virtual water traded and the number of trade connections of each nation. Highly connected nations are preferentially linked to poorly connected nations and exhibit low levels of clustering. However, when the volume of virtual water traded is taken into account, this structure breaks down. This indicates a global hierarchy, in which nations that trade large volumes of water are more likely to link to and cluster with other nations that trade large volumes of water, particularly when the direction of trade is considered. Nations that play a critical role in maintaining the global network architecture are highlighted. Our analysis provides the necessary framework for the development of a model of global virtual water trade aimed at applications ranging from network optimization to climate change impact evaluations.

AB Since Brutsaert and Neiber (1977), recession curves are widely used to analyse subsurface systems of river basins by expressing -dQ/dt as a function of Q, which typically take a power law form: -dQ/dt=kQ, where Q is the discharge at a basin outlet at time t. Traditionally recession flows are modelled by single reservoir models that assume a unique relationship between -dQ/dt and Q for a basin. However, recent observations indicate that -dQ/dt-Q relationship of a basin varies greatly across recession events, indicating the limitation of such models. In this study, the dynamic relationship between -dQ/dt and Q of a basin is investigated through the geomorphological recession flow model which models recession flows by considering the temporal evolution of its active drainage network (the part of the stream network of the basin draining water at time t). Two primary factors responsible for the dynamic relationship are identified: (i) degree of aquifer recharge (ii) spatial variation of rainfall. Degree of aquifer recharge, which is likely to be controlled by (effective) rainfall patterns, influences the power law coefficient, k. It is found that k has correlation with past average streamflow, which confirms the notion that dynamic -dQ/dt-Q relationship is caused by the degree of aquifer recharge. Spatial variation of rainfall is found to have control on both the exponent, , and the power law coefficient, k. It is noticed that that even with same and k, recession curves can be different, possibly due to their different (recession) peak values. This may also happen due to spatial variation of rainfall.

AB This work comprises a spatial, temporal and statistical analysis of the epidemiology of malaria occurrence in four municipalities of the State of Amazonas, Brazil: Coari, Codajas, Manacapuru and Manaus, for the period 2003-2009. The number of malaria cases, precipitation, water level and temperature data were analysed in this study. The strength of the relationship between these hydrological/meteorological variables and the occurrence of malaria was determined by employing the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Seasonal peaks of malaria were registered, on average, about 1-2 months before the annual maximum temperature and after the river's seasonal high-water level. The phenomenon called repiquete (notable variations in the water level) was observed during periods of between 9 and 56 days. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between malaria, temperature, precipitation and water level. Temperature influenced malaria occurrence the least, while rainfall was the most important factor, especially in the municipality of Coari. Water level had an important influence on the records of malarial occurrence in the municipality of Manacapuru.

AB The derivation of joint operating policy is a challenging task for a multi-purpose multi-reservoir system. This study proposed an aggregation-decomposition model to guide the joint operation of multi-purpose multi-reservoir system, including: (1) an aggregated model based on the improved hedging rule to ensure the long-term water-supply operating benefit; (2) a decomposed model to allocate the limited release to individual reservoirs for the purpose of maximizing the total profit of the facing period; and (3) a double layer simulation-based optimization model to obtain the optimal time-varying hedging rules using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, whose objectives were to minimize maximum water deficit and maximize water supply reliability. The water-supply system of Li River in Guangxi Province, China, was selected for the case study. The results show that the operating policy proposed in this study is better than conventional operating rules and aggregated standard operating policy for both water supply and hydropower generation due to the use of hedging mechanism and effective coordination among multiple objectives.

AB Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships describe rainfall intensity as a function of duration and return period, and they are significant for water resources planning, as well as for the design of hydraulic constructions. In this study, the two-parameter lognormal (LN2) and Gumbel distributions are used as parent distribution functions. Derivation of the IDF relationship by this approach is quite simple, because it only requires an appropriate function of the mean of annual maximum rainfall intensity as a function of rainfall duration. It is shown that the monotonic temporal trend in the mean rainfall intensity can successfully be described by this parametric function which comprises a combination of the parameters of the quantile function a(T) and completely the duration function b(d) of the separable IDF relationship. In the case study of Aegean Region (Turkey), the IDF relationships derived through this simple generalization procedure (SGP) may produce IDF relationships as successfully as does the well-known robust estimation procedure (REP), which is based on minimization of the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test statistic with respect to the parameters and of the duration function. Because the approach proposed herein is based on lower-order sample statistics, risks and uncertainties arising from sampling errors in higher-order sample statistics were significantly reduced. The authors recommend to establish the separable IDF relationships by the SGP for a statistically favorable two-parameter parent distribution, because it uses the same assumptions as the REP does, it maintains the observed temporal trend in the mean additionally, it is easy to handle analytically and requires considerably less computational effort.

AB The optimization of the mixed reservoir system, consisting of parallel and cascade reservoirs, is a complex issue due to its nonlinear storage curves, complex hydraulic connection and coordination. This paper aims to derive optimal operating rules for the flood control of large-scale mixed reservoir using a new algorithm known as weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGA II), which could efficiently locate the Pareto front in the non-dominated region due to directed searching with the weighted crowding distance. A case study was performed in the Xijiang river basin in China, where there are eight flood control reservoirs and five flood control sections in four tributaries and the mainstream. Three scenarios, including conventional operating rules (COR), single-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm (PLO-GA), and multi-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by WNSGA II (PLO-WNSGA II), are compared, and the resilience of three reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated as well. The results indicate that: (1) WNSGA II can locate non-dominated solutions more efficiently and provide better Pareto front than non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) due to the weighted crowding distance; (2) PLO-WNSGA II outperforms COR and PLO-GA for the control of basin-wide floods; and (3) PLO-WNSGA II is more resilient under inflow uncertainty. Therefore, PLO-WNSGA II is effective and efficient for the control of basin-wide floods in a mixed reservoir system.

AB Flow-sediment relationships provide insights into the erosion and transport of materials within catchments. Investigating the flow-sediment relationships across multiple timescales can reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human-caused changes to catchments. This study chose fourteen main catchments in the Loess Plateau of China, which are the major sediment sources of Yellow River, to extract the temporal patterns of flow-sediment relationships during the 1950s-2014 period. The study revealed quantifiable effects of land use/cover changes (LUCC) on the variability of flow-sediment relationships. The LUCC induced by the soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) during 1970-1999 and vegetation restoration campaign since 2000 resulted in significant reductions of annual streamflow, sediment yield and sediment concentration. The mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions also decreased greatly. The flow-sediment relationships revealed time dependence over different stages and time scales. Before 2000, the annual and monthly flow-sediment relationships could be generally characterized by the linear functions, and the power-law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow-sediment relationship. As vegetation restoration campaign took effect, the flow-sediment relationship became much weaker, which could not be described by a clear relationship. This suggests that the variability of flow-sediment relationships over the entire period was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration campaign. In addition, the sediment concentration exhibited a linear decreasing relationship with the area under land use/cover treatment. In this way, the study has brought out the roles of ecological restoration measures in controlling the temporal variability of flow-sediment relationships at the catchment scale.

   CONDITIONS; RELAXATION DYNAMICS; HYSTERESIS; UNIQUENESS
AB Empirical relationships that describe two-phase flow in porous media have been largely hysteretic in nature, thereby requiring different relationships depending on whether the system is undergoing drainage or imbibition. Recent studies have suggested using interfacial area to close the well-known capillary pressure-saturation relationship, while others expand upon this by including the Euler characteristic for a geometric description of the system. With the advancement of fast x-ray microtomography at synchrotron facilities, three-dimensional experiments of two-phase quasi- and non-equilibrium flow experiments were conducted to quantify the uniqueness of constitutive relationships under different flow conditions. We find that the state functions that include the Euler characteristic provide the most unique prediction of the state of the system for both quasi- and non-equilibrium flow. Of these functions, those that infer volume fraction from the other state variables are independent of flow condition (quasi- or non-equilibrium). This enhances the applicability of new constitutive relationships allowing for more robust models of two-phase flow.

AB We explore the bankfull width (W-bf) versus drainage area (A(da)) relationship across a range of climatic and geologic environments and ask (1) is the relationship between ln(W-bf) and ln(A(da)) best described by a linear function and (2) can a reliable relationship be developed for predicting W-bf with A(da) as the only independent variable. The principal data set for this study was compiled from regional curve studies and other reports that represent 1018 sites (1 mW(bf)110 m and 0.50 km(2)A(da)22,000 km(2)) in the continental United States. Two additional data sets were used for validation. After dividing the data into small, medium, and large-size basins which, respectfully, correspond to A(da)<4.95 km(2), 4.95 km(2)A(da)<337 km(2), and A(da)337 km(2), regression lines from each data set were compared using one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A second ANCOVA was performed to determine if mean annual precipitation (P) is an extraneous factor in the W-bf versus A(da) relationship. The ANCOVA results reveal that using A(da) alone does not yield a reliable W-bf versus A(da) relationship that is applicable across a wide range of environments and that P is a significant extraneous factor in the relationship. Considering data for very small basins (A(da)0.49 km(2)) and very large basins (A(da)1.0 x 10(5) km(2)) we conclude that a two-segment linear model is the most probable form of the ln(W-bf) versus ln(A(da)) relationship. This study provides useful information for building complex multivariate models for predicting W-bf.

AB Most current long-term (decadal and longer) hydrological predictions implicitly assume that hydrological processes are stationary even under changing climate. However, in practice, we suspect that changing climatic conditions may affect runoff generation processes and cause changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship. In this article, we investigate whether temporary but prolonged (i.e., of the order of a decade) shifts in rainfall result in changes in rainfall-runoff relationships at the catchment scale. Annual rainfall and runoff records from south-eastern Australia are used to examine whether interdecadal climate variability induces changes in hydrological behavior. We test statistically whether annual rainfall-runoff relationships are significantly different during extended dry periods, compared with the historical norm. The results demonstrate that protracted drought led to a significant shift in the rainfall-runoff relationship in approximate to 44% of the catchment-dry periods studied. The shift led to less annual runoff for a given annual rainfall, compared with the historical relationship. We explore linkages between cases where statistically significant changes occurred and potential explanatory factors, including catchment properties and characteristics of the dry period (e.g., length, precipitation anomalies). We find that long-term drought is more likely to affect transformation of rainfall to runoff in drier, flatter, and less forested catchments. Understanding changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship is important for accurate streamflow projections and to help develop adaptation strategies to deal with multiyear droughts.

AB Equatorial rivers of East Africa exhibit unusually complex seasonal and inter-annual flow regimes, and aquatic and adjacent terrestrial organisms have adapted to cope with this flow variability. This study examined the annual flow regime over the past 40 years for three gauging stations on the Mara River in Kenya and Tanzania, which is of international importance because it is the only perennial river traversing the Mara-Serengeti ecoregion. Select environmental flow components were quantified and converted to ecologically relevant hydraulic variables. Vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish were collected and identified at target study sites during low and high flows. The results were compared with available knowledge of the life histories and flow sensitivities of the riverine communities to infer flow-ecology relationships. Management implications are discussed, including the need to preserve a dynamic environmental flow regime to protect ecosystems in the region. The results for the Mara may serve as a useful model for river basins of the wider equatorial East Africa region.

AB After a brief summary of previous work on multicomponent diffusion theory, we review how the thermodynamics of irreversible processes leads us to an expression for the generalized driving force for diffusion. We then give the generalized Fick's law expression containing the diffusivities D-alpha gamma; then we show how this may be turned ''wrong-side out'' using Merk's method to give the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations containing the diffusivities D-12  x(1)x(2)/C-12. Finally, we show how the latter are related to the diffusivities D-12 that are usually reported in the literature. All results are applicable to gases or liquids. This review is restricted to presenting the basic theory in a consistent notation, and not to the applications of the theory. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Building reservoir release schedules to manage engineered river systems can involve costly trade-offs between storing and releasing water. As a result, the design of release schedules requires metrics that quantify the benefit and damages created by releases to the downstream ecosystem. Such metrics should support making operational decisions under uncertain hydrologic conditions, including drought and flood seasons. This study addresses this need and develops a reservoir operation rule structure and method to maximize downstream environmental benefit while meeting human water demands. The result is a general approach for hedging downstream environmental objectives. A multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program with Markov Chains, identifies optimal environmental hedging, releases to maximize environmental benefits subject to probabilistic seasonal hydrologic conditions, current, past, and future environmental demand, human water supply needs, infrastructure limitations, population dynamics, drought storage protection, and the river's carrying capacity. Environmental hedging hedges bets for drought by reducing releases for fish, sometimes intentionally killing some fish early to reduce the likelihood of large fish kills and storage crises later. This approach is applied to Folsom reservoir in California to support survival of fall-run Chinook salmon in the lower American River for a range of carryover and initial storage cases. Benefit is measured in terms of fish survival; maintaining self-sustaining native fish populations is a significant indicator of ecosystem function. Environmental hedging meets human demand and outperforms other operating rules, including the current Folsom operating strategy, based on metrics of fish extirpation and water supply reliability.

AB An extensive literature documents relations between reservoir storage capacity and water supply yield and the properties of instream flow needed to support downstream aquatic ecosystems. However, the literature that evaluates the impact of reservoir operating rules on instream flow properties is limited to a few site-specific studies, and as a result, few general conclusions can be drawn to date. This study adapts the existing generalized water evaluation and planning model (WEAP) to enable general explorations of relations between reservoir storage, instream flow, and water supply yield for a wide class of reservoirs and operating rules. Generalized relationships among these variables document the types of instream flow policies that when combined with drought management strategies, are likely to provide compromise solutions to the ecological and human negotiations for water for different sized reservoir systems. The concept of a seasonal ecodeficit/ecosurplus is introduced for evaluating the impact of reservoir regulation on ecological flow regimes.

AB The spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity.. is modelled by a power law, andwepresent a methodological approach to quantify the exponent (crowding index) of such a law as detected within a well-type flow configuration. Based upon the outcome of several pumping tests conducted into a caisson (mesoscale), we identify the crowding index as function of the volumetric flow rate. Hence, we develop a simple (although approximated) procedure to assess whether the spatial distribution of.. can be characterized by a power law. We demonstrate that, even at the mesoscale, the conductivity.. can not be regarded as a formation's property (nonlocality), in agreement with the recent developments on the theory of flows into radial configurations.

AB The scaling relationships of groundwater contributions have been examined in previous studies, but whether these findings are site-specific or applicable to other watersheds remains unclear. Here, we illustrate how scaling relationships differ between watersheds with different geology. We investigated the spatial distributions of the specific discharge (discharge per unit drainage area) and chemical compositions of stream and spring water during baseflow periods in three Cretaceous to Eocene sedimentary watersheds and three Neogene volcanic watersheds in the Ishikari River basin, Japan. End-member mixing analysis was used to separate stream water into shallow and deep groundwater. The specific discharge of stream water only significantly increased with drainage area for two of the volcanic study sites. Conversely, the ratio of deep groundwater to stream water only significantly increased with drainage area for two of the sedimentary study sites. The specific discharge of deep groundwater increased with area in both volcanic and sedimentary sites, but the specific discharge of shallow groundwater only increased with area for the volcanic sites. These findings indicate that the shallow groundwater flow played a crucial role in making geology-dependent differences in scaling relationships. The geological effects on shallow groundwater flow were likely characterized by the spatial distribution of highly permeable bedrock layer. This geological control provides a useful framework for generalizing knowledge about the scaling relationships of groundwater contributions.

AB We used a seemingly unrelated partially linear model (SUPLM) to address a potential correlation between pollutants (nitrogen, phosphorous, dissolved oxygen and mercury) in an environmental Kuznets curve study. Simulation studies show that the SUPLM performs well to address potential correlation among pollutants. We find that the relationship between income and pollution follows an inverted U-shaped curve for nitrogen and dissolved oxygen and a cubic shaped curve for mercury. Model specification tests suggest that a SUPLM is better specified compared to a parametric model to study the income-pollution relationship. Results suggest a need to continually assess policy effectiveness of pollution reduction as income increases.

AB The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate. We hypothesis that as seasonally frozen soils thaw and recede in extent as a response to this warming, flow path diversity and thus hydrologic connectivity increases. This enhanced hydrologic connectivity then increases the non-linearity of the storage-discharge relationship in a catchment. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by quantifying trends and spatio-temporal differences in the degree of linearity in the storage-discharge relationships for 16 catchments within Northern Sweden from 1950 to 2018. We demonstrate a clear increase in non-linearity of the storage-discharge relationship over time for all catchments with 75% showing a statistically significant increase in non-linearity. Spring has significantly more linear storage-discharge relationships than summer for most catchments (75%) supporting the idea that seasonally frozen soils with a low degree of hydrological connectivity have a linear storage-discharge relationship. For the period considered, spring also showed greater change in storage-discharge relationship trends than summer signifying that changes in recessions are primarily occurring during the thawing period. Separate storage-discharge analyses combined with preceding winter conditions demonstrated that especially cold winters with little snow yielded springs and summers with more linear storage-discharge relationships. We show that streamflow recession analysis reflects ongoing hydrological change of an arctic landscape as well as offering new metrics for tracking change across arctic and sub-arctic landscapes.

AB Reservoir storage helps manage hydrological variability, increasing predictability and productivity of water supply. However, there are inevitable tradeoffs, with control of high frequency variability coming at the expense of robustness to low frequency variability. Tightly controlling variability can reduce incentives to maintain adaptive capacity needed during events that exceed design thresholds. With multiple dimensions of change projected for many water supply systems globally, increased knowledge on the role of design and operational choices in balancing short-term control and long-term adaptability is needed. Here we investigated how the scale of reservoir storage (relative to demands and streamflow variability) and reservoir operating rules interact to mitigate shortage risk under changing supplies and/or demands. To address these questions, we examined three water supply systems that have faced changing conditions: the Colorado River in the Western United States, the Melbourne Water Supply System in Southeastern Australia, and the Western Cape Water Supply System in South Africa. Moreover, we parameterize a sociohydrological model of reservoir dynamics using time series from the three case studies above. We then used the model to explore the impacts of storage and operational rules. We found that larger storage volumes lead to a greater time before the shortage is observed, but that this time is not consistently used for adaptation. Additionally, our modeling results show that operating rules that trigger withdrawal decreases sooner tend to increase the probability of an adaptive response; the findings from this model are bolstered by the three case studies. While there are many factors influencing the response to water stress, our results demonstrate the importance of: i) evaluating design and operational choices in concert, and ii) examining the role of information salience in adapting water supply systems to changing conditions.

AB Developing a general framework to capture the complexities associated with the non-linear and adaptive nature of farmers facing water resources scarcity is a challenging problem. This paper integrates agent-based modelling (ABM) and a data mining method to develop a hybrid socio-hydrological framework to provide future insights for policy-makers. The data associated with the farmers' main characteristics were collected through field surveys and interviews. Afterwards, the association rule was employed to discover the main patterns representing the farmers' agricultural decisions. The discovered patterns were then used as the behavioural rules in ABM to simulate the agricultural activities. The proposed framework has been was applied to explore the interactions between agricultural activities and the main river feeding the Urmia-Lake, Iran. The outcomes indicate that farmers' acquisitive traits and belongings have significant impacts on their socio-hydrological interactions. The reported values of the efficiency criteria may support the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework.

On this basis, a random cascades model is identified. The scale-invariant law obtained for extreme values represents a theoretical foundation for empirical models proposed since the 1960s which link extreme values, and their associated hazards, with surfaces of drainage areas.

AB The complementary relationship (CR) of evapotranspiration allows the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration rate (ETa) of the land surface using only routine meteorological data, which is of great importance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to its sparse observation network. With the highest in situ automatic climate observation system in a typical semiarid alpine steppe region of the TP, the wind function of Penman was replaced by one based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity theory for calculating the potential evapotranspiration rate (ETp); the Priestley-Taylor coefficient, , was estimated using observations in wet days; and the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve was evaluated at an estimate of the wet surface temperature, provided the latter was smaller than the actual air temperature. A symmetric CR was obtained between the observed daily actual and potential evapotranspiration. Local calibration of the parameter value (in this order) is key to obtaining a symmetric CR: , wet environment air temperature (T-wea), and wind function. Also, present symmetric CR contradicts previous research that used default parameter values for claiming an asymmetric CR in arid and semiarid regions of the TP. The effectiveness of estimating the daily ETa via symmetric CR was greatly improved when local calibrations were implemented. At the same time, an asymmetric CR was found between the observed daily ETa and pan evaporation rates (E-pan), both for D20 aboveground and E601B sunken pans. The daily ETa could also be estimated by coupling the E-pan of D20 aboveground and/or E601B sunken pan through CR. The former provided good descriptors for observed ETa, while the latter still tended to overestimate it to some extent.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that improving water governance is the key to solving water insecurity in developing countries but there are also many disagreements on operational and methodological issues. In this paper, we build on the work of Saleth and Dinar and surveyed 100 water experts from 17 countries in Asia to compare 19 indicators of water laws, policies, and administration among and within countries from 2001 to 2010. We present the results of our study in a comparative dashboard and report how water governance indicators vary with a country's level of economic development, which ones do not and how and why some indicators change overtime in some countries. We have two main results. First, our initial findings suggest the possibility of water Kuznet's curve, i.e., certain water governance indicators vary with a country's level of economic development. However, more studies are needed given the caveats and limitations of our study. Second, the results have practical value for policy makers and researchers for benchmarking with other countries and tracking changes within their countries overtime. We conclude with implications for a second-generation research agenda on water governance.

AB [1] Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can be used to obtain information about the variation in the dielectric constant of the subsurface. The sensitivity of a soil's dielectric constant to the presence of water therefore makes water content estimation by GPR possible. The dielectric constant derived from GPR data, however, is also influenced by the geometric distribution of water in the subsurface. We show that this causes the relationship between the dielectric constant and water content to become scale dependent in complex geologic systems. We have derived dielectric constant-water content relationships that account for subsurface geometries in spatially correlated random media that can be characterized using geostatistics. From these relationships we illustrate that the importance of scale effects are strongly dependent on the variance and the anisotropy of the water content in the subsurface; in some cases, ignoring scale effects will not significantly impact the estimation of water content, while in other cases, large biases can occur. This work provides a conceptual framework for the predictive modeling of field-scale dielectric constant-water content relationships.

AB In a recent work [Valiani A, Caleffi V. Depth-energy and depth-force relationships in open channel flows: analytical findings. Adv Water Resour 2008:31(3):447-54], the authors analytically inverted the depth-specific energy and depth-total force relationships for flows in open channels with wide rectangular cross-sections.
   In the present work, the previous results are extended using a simple analytical perturbation technique to the important class of power-law cross-sections, which can often be used to approximate real fluvial geometry. Assuming the river cross-section slightly different from the rectangular form, the exponent of the power-law defining the river cross-section is subsequently small. The expressions for the specific energy and total force as functions of the water depth are considered in dimensionless form. The inversion of these functions begins with the exact analytical solutions for wide rectangular sections. A perturbation analysis is carried out taking the exponent of the power-law as a small parameter. For a known discharge and for each meaningful value of the specific energy, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are analytically determined, expanding the depth in terms of this small parameter up to the second-order. Similarly, for each meaningful value of the total force, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are found analytically, also using a second-order expansion of the flow depth. Examples from classical open channel hydraulics show the consistency of these analytical solutions. An error analysis is presented to provide limits of presented solutions and an analytical technique is proposed to further refine the solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A fixed Z-R relationship approach, such as the Marshall-Palmer relationship, for an entire year and for different seasons can be problematic in cases where the relationship varies spatially and temporally throughout a region. From this perspective, this study explores the use of a long-term radar reflectivity factor for South Korea to obtain a nationwide calibrated power law relationship, Z = alpha center dot R-beta, where R is the rainfall intensity and Z is the reflectivity factor, in the context of bias-correction and the associated uncertainties within a Bayesian regression framework. This study also investigates seasonal differences in the bias-correction parameters (i.e., additive and multiplicative bias-correction factors) and their roles in reducing systematic error. Distinct differences in the calibrated parameters over stations are identified, and more importantly, an inverse relationship between the two reflectivity parameters alpha and beta (i.e., decreasing trend in beta with increasing a) is clearly identified with different parameter space based on the seasons. A spatially structured pattern in the parameters exists, particularly parameter alpha, for the wet season and parameter beta for the dry season. A pronounced region of high values in the power law parameters (i.e., alpha and beta) during the wet and dry seasons may be partially due to the overestimation of the radar reflectivity factor associated with enhancement of moisture transport directly over the coastal region. Finally, the radar rainfall estimates through the calibrated Z-R relationship are compared with the currently used Z-R relationships for estimating stratiform rainfall and convective rainfall. Overall, the radar rainfall fields based on the proposed modeling procedure are similar to the observed rainfall fields, whereas the radar rainfall fields obtained from the currently used Marshall-Palmer Z-R relationship show a systematic underestimation. The calibrated Z-R relationships are further validated by testing the predictions of unseen radargauge pairs in the year 2018, in the context of cross-validation. The cross-validation results are largely similar to those in the calibration process, suggesting that the derived Z-R relationships fit the radar-gauge pairs reasonably well.

AB Complex transport behavior other than advection-dispersion, simple retardation, and first-order removal has been observed in many biocolloid transport experiments in porous media. Such nonideal transport behavior is particularly evident in the late time elution of biocolloids at low concentrations. Here we present a series of saturated column experiments that were designed to measure the breakthrough and long-term elution of Cryptosporidium parvum in medium sand for a few thousand pore volumes after the initial source of oocysts was removed. For a wide range of ionic strengths, I, we consistently observe slower-than-Fickian, power law tailing. The slope of the tail is flatter for higher I. At very high ionic strength the slope decays to a rate slower than t(-1). To explain this behavior, we propose a new filtration model based on the continuous time random walk (CTRW) theory. Our theory upscales heterogeneities at both the pore-scale geometry of the flow field and the grain surface physicochemical properties that affect biocolloid attachment and detachment. Pore-scale heterogeneities in fluid flow are shown to control the breakthrough of a conservative tracer but are shown to have negligible effect on oocyst transport. In our experiments, C. parvum transport is dominated by the effects of physicochemical heterogeneities. The CTRW model provides a parsimonious theory of nonreactive and reactive transport. The CTRW filtration process is controlled by three parameters, Lambda, beta, and c, which are related to the overall breakthrough retardation (R = 1 + Lambda), the slope of the power law tail (beta), and the transition to a slower than t(-1) decay (c).

AB This study proposes a novel socio-hydrological modeling framework for assessing the performance of complex water resources systems. It employs and integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) into the socio-hydrological modeling framework to account for agents' behaviors. Due to farmers' major role in anthropogenic droughts, this paper mainly focuses on farmers' behavior. The TPB framework and the agents' behavioral rules in ABM are structured based on the data obtained from field questionnaires and interviews by the farmers in the Zarrineh River Basin as the main river feeding the Urmia Lake. The proposed modeling framework, including the TPB and ABM structures and rules, are validated by comparing the results of the proposed socio-hydrological simulation model with the actual data on the simulation period. To assess the ability of the proposed framework, root mean square error (RMSE) and the determination coefficient (DC) were computed. The results show the acceptable performance of the proposed model by RMSE = 0.18 and DC = 0.92. Analysis of the results indicates that financial conditions, farmland size, farmers' age, and farmers' education are among the major factors in farmers' decision-making process, respectively.

AB Accurate and meaningful prediction of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers requires appropriate prediction tools. Artificial intelligence-based prediction models and their ensembles have been a better choice for mimicking the complex and nonlinear seawater intrusion progressions in coastal aquifers. This study utilizes a weighted-average ensemble of 'heterogeneous' prediction models to predict the saltwater intrusion progression in a coastal aquifer study area. The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is employed to calculate the weights of five different prediction model algorithms. Corresponding weights for individual prediction models are utilized in developing the ensemble prediction. Ensemble prediction performance for salinity intrusion in coastal aquifers in this effort is evaluated using several descriptive metrics. The values of the descriptive metrics suggest that the ensemble model performs in the same way as the best model in the ensemble. The methodology is evaluated for an illustrative coastal aquifer study area exposed to pumping-induced saltwater intrusion.

AB In the developing world's irrigated areas, water management and planning is often motivated by the need for lasting food security. Two important policy measures to address this need are improving the flexibility of water appropriation rules and developing irrigation storage infrastructure. Little research to date has investigated the performance of these two policy measures in a single analysis while maintaining a basin wide water balance. This paper examines impacts of storage capacity and water appropriation rules on total economic welfare in irrigated agriculture, while maintaining a water balance. The application is to a river basin in northern Afghanistan. A constrained optimization framework is developed to examine economic consequences on food security and farm income resulting from each policy measure. Results show that significant improvements in both policy aims can be achieved through expanding existing storage capacity to capture up to 150 percent of long-term average annual water supplies when added capacity is combined with either a proportional sharing of water shortages or unrestricted water trading. An important contribution of the paper is to show how the benefits of storage and a changed water appropriation system operate under a variable climate. Results show that the hardship of droughts can be substantially lessened, with the largest rewards taking place in the most difficult periods. Findings provide a comprehensive framework for addressing future water scarcity, rural livelihoods, and food security in the developing world's irrigated regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID BAYESIAN METHODS
AB The procedure of fitting rating curves in channels where the stage-discharge relationship is subject to changes driven by morphological processes remains one of the major unsolved problems in hydrometry. This paper addresses this issue by formulating the stage-discharge relationship as a steady flow, one-segmented power law model with parameters that are viewed as stochastic processes with characteristics associated with the temporal instabilities of the channel elements governing the stage-discharge relationship. A Bayesian analysis with informative priors and time-stage-discharge measurements as forcing data is used to determine the most plausible model and its posterior parameter distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques and particle filtering. The proposed framework is applied to data from gauging stations in two unstable rivers and one stable river in Norway.

AB Environmental processes (e.g., groundwater contaminants, air pollution patterns, air-water and air-soil energy exchanges) are characterized by variability and uncertainty. Spatiotemporal random fields are used to represent correlations between fluctuations in the composite space-time domain. Modelling the effects of fluctuations with suitable covariance functions can improve our ability to characterize and predict space-time variations in various natural systems (e.g., environmental media, long-term climatic evolutions on local/global scales, and human exposure to pollutants). The goal of this work is to present the reader with various methods for constructing space-time covariance models. In this context, we provide a mathematical exposition and visual representations of several theoretical covariance models. These include non-separable (in space and time) covariance models derived from physical laws (i.e., differential equations and dynamic rules), spectral functions, and generalized random fields. It is also shown that non-separability is often a direct result of the physical laws that govern the process. The proposed methods can generate covariance models for homogeneous/stationary as well as for non-homogeneous/non-stationary environmental processes across space and time. We investigate several properties (short-range and asymptotic behavior, shape of the covariance function etc.) of these models and present plots of the space-time dependence for various parameter values.

AB [1] Fine-sediment storage within floodplain systems typically represents a significant component of the catchment sediment budget and a primary control on sediment-associated nutrient and contaminant fluxes at the basin scale. However, quantitative modeling of floodplain sedimentation within whole catchments represents a significant challenge, not least because hydraulic controls on sediment transport and deposition processes operate at fine spatial scales that cannot be resolved by basin-scale models. This paper outlines a new approach to addressing this problem in order to develop a computationally efficient model of floodplain sedimentation, which retains a strong physical basis. The approach involves two stages. First, a simple theoretical model of overbank sedimentation is presented, which quantifies the relationship between floodplain geometry, overbank discharge, and total sedimentation rate. Second, the precise form that such a relationship should take is established by analysis of the output from high-resolution flow and suspended sediment transport models applied to 22 floodplain reaches along three U.K. rivers. This analysis supports a simple power law model between discharge in excess of bankfull and sedimentation rate per unit valley floor length per unit sediment concentration. The power law model is then incorporated within a sediment budget framework and implemented using a Monte Carlo approach to allow an assessment of uncertainty in the model parameterization. The relative likelihood of competing model structures is determined using estimates of mean annual floodplain sediment storage derived by analysis of the Cs-137 content of floodplain sediment cores. Comparison of Cs-137-derived sedimentation rates with uncertainty-bounded model predictions highlights the potential for assessing the significance of overbank sedimentation within catchment sediment budgets using the simple power law model.

ID FLOW; EFFICIENCY; IMPACTS; STREAMS; OXYGEN; GRAVEL
AB Improved water management strategies necessitate a solid understanding of environmental impacts associated with various flow release policies. Habitat suitability models use hydrodynamic simulations to generate weighted usable area curves, which are useful in characterizing the ecological suitability of flow release rules. However, these models are not conveniently run to resolve the hydrodynamics at the smaller scales associated with macroroughness elements (e.g., individual stones), which produce wakes that contribute significantly to habitat suitability by serving as shelter zones where fishes can rest and feed. In this study, we propose a robust environmental indicator that considers the habitat generated by the wakes downstream of stones and can thus be used to assess the environmental efficiency of flow release rules for impounded streams. We develop an analytical solution to approximate the wake areas behind macroroughness elements, and the statistical distribution of wake areas is then found using the derived distribution approach. To illustrate the concept, we apply our theory to four exemplary river streams with dispersed stones having different statistical diameter size distributions, some of which allow for an analytical expression of the weighted usable area. We additionally investigate the impact of spatiotemporal changes in stone size distributions on the usable area and the consequent threshold flows. Finally, we include the proposed environmental indicator to solve a multiobjective reservoir optimization problem. This exemplifies its practical use and allows stakeholders to find the most favorable operational rules depending on the macroroughness characteristics of the impounded stream.

AB A comparison of the Mamdani and the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy inference systems is presented for predicting streamflow values. The TS fuzzy rule base uses linear functions of inputs to predict the output, whereas the Mamdani version of inference determines outputs through fuzzy sub-sets. A genetic algorithm-trained Mamdani system is applied for streamflow forecasting. All the uncertainties and model complications are treated in linguistic expressions in the form of IF-THEN statements. Fuzzy membership functions, rules and the type of defuzzification method are adjusted until the best correlation between measured and predicted values is reached. The two methods are then applied to flow predictions on the Euphrates River in Turkey, without employing exogenous variables such as rainfall. The advantages and disadvantages of the models are discussed using the case study. It is shown that the Mamdani type of fuzzy inference modelling outperforms the Takagi-Sugeno approach in terms of error criteria comparisons, but neither of the two outperforms a standard ARMA(2, 2) model.

AB Relationships between channel characteristics (e.g., mean depth, water surface width, mean velocity) and discharge, known as hydraulic geometry (HG), have been extensively used by hydrologists and geomorphologists since the seminal work of Leopold and Maddock [ 953]. On the basis of recent empirical evidence that the parameters of at-site HG depend systematically on the contributing area ( scale) and that the parameters of downstream HG depend on the frequency of discharge, we propose a multiscaling formalism within which to model and interpret both at-site and downstream HG in a homogeneous region. In particular, we postulate and test multiscaling models for cross-sectional area and discharge and derive generalized HG relationships that explicitly account for scale-frequency dependence. The multiscaling formalism is tested in several basins in Oklahoma and Kansas for drainage areas ranging from 2 to 20,000 km 2 and shows good agreement with the data. To quantify the effects that scale dependence in HG has on the hydrologic response of a basin, a geomorphologic nonlinear cascade of reservoirs model has been used to compute attributes of a representative hydrologic response function for various levels of catchment-averaged effective rainfall and different basin orders. The numerical experiment shows substantial differences in hydrologic response when using classical versus generalized HG. Finally, a preliminary effort is reported to generalize even further the HG relationships such that they can account for deviations from a single power law ( e. g., consideration of two different power laws in low- and high-flow regimes) through the introduction of a bivariate mixed multiscaling framework.

AB This study proposes an improved nonstationary model for flood frequency analysis by investigating the relationship between flood peak and flood volume, using the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), China, for verification. First, the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) is used as the prior distribution. Then, under Bayesian theory, the prior distribution is updated using the conditional distribution, which is derived from the copula function. The results show that the improvement of the proposed model is significant compared with the GAMLSS-based prior distribution. Meanwhile, selection of a suitable prior distribution has a significant effect on the results of the improvement. For applications to the TGD, the nonstationary model can obviously increase the engineering management benefits and reduce the perceived risks of large floods. This study provides guidance for the dynamic management of hydraulic engineering under nonstationary conditions.

AB The importance of fracture intersection mixing rules, complete mixing and streamline routing, on simulated solute migration patterns in random fracture networks is assessed, For this purpose, a-ad based on geological evidence, two-dimensional model networks having power law fracture length distributions and lognormal fracture permeability distributions are considered. Different fracture network structures are accounted for by the power law length distribution, ranging from networks composed of infinite length fractures to percolation networks, with constant length fractures. Comparison of solute particle statistics shows that there is no significant difference between the bulk transport properties calculated with the two mixing rules. In fact, it is found that the choice of. Mixing assumptions has a significant influence in less than 5% of the total number of fracture intersections in most fracture networks. This result can be attributed to the small mean effective coordination number, defined as the number of branches connected to an intersection with nonzero flux. It is concluded that solute transport in fracture networks is strongly influenced by variability and uncertainty in parameters defining the geometrical structure of networks and that, by comparison, the choice of mixing rules at fracture intersections is of little importance.

TI Single-site monthly streamflow simulation using entropy theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DISAGGREGATION PROCEDURES; MODELS; BOOTSTRAP
AB Using entropy theory, a new method for single-site monthly streamflow simulation is developed, which is capable of preserving mean, standard deviation, skewness, and lag-one correlation. The method entails deriving joint and conditional probability density functions using the entropy theory, determining the Lagrange multipliers using the information obtained from the historical record, and then simulating streamflow by sequential sampling from the conditional distribution. The advantage of the entropy-based method is that it does not make any assumptions about the probability distribution of the streamflow data. It can also preserve the cross-correlation between streamflow of the last month of the previous year and the first month of the current year and avoid the generation of negative values. The method can also be extended to incorporate higher-order moments and more lag correlations if needed. The disadvantage is that the method will be cumbersome when more statistics need to be preserved and the bimodality that may exist in the empirical probability density function cannot yet be resolved. Application to the Colorado River basin shows that the entropy-based method satisfactorily simulates monthly streamflow.

AB The governing equations for subsurface flow codes in a deformable porous media are derived from the balance of fluid mass and Darcy's equation. One class of these codes, which we call general subsurface flow codes (GSFs), allow for more general constitutive relations for material properties such as porosity, permeability and density. Examples of GSFs include PFLOTRAN, FEHM, TOUGH2, STOMP, and some reservoir simulators such as BOAST. Depending on the constitutive relations used in GSFs, an inconsistency arises between the standard groundwater flow equation and the governing equation of GSFs, and we clarify that the reason for this inconsistency is because the Darcy's equation used in the GSFs should account for the velocity of fluid with respect to solid. Due to lack of awareness of this inconsistency, users of the GSFs tend to use a porosity-pressure relationship that comes from the standard groundwater flow equation and assumes that the relative velocity is already accounted for. For the Theis problem, we show that using this traditional relationship in the GSFs leads to significantly large errors. We propose an alternate porosity-pressure relationship that is consistent with the derivation of the governing equations in the GSFs where the solid velocity is not tracked, and show that, with this relationship, the results are more accurate for the Theis problem. The purpose of this note is to make the users and developers of these GSFs aware of this inconsistency and to advocate that the alternate porosity model derived here should be incorporated in GSFs.

AB [1] The sculpture of valleys by flowing water is widely recognized, and simplified models of incision by this process (e.g., the stream power law) are the basis for most recent landscape evolution models. Under steady state conditions a stream power law predicts that channel slope varies as an inverse power law of drainage area. Using both contour maps and laser altimetry, we find that this inverse power law rarely extends to slopes greater than similar to0.03 to 0.10, values below which debris flows rarely travel. Instead, with decreasing drainage area the rate of increase in slope declines, leading to a curved relationship on a log-log plot of slope against drainage area. Fieldwork in the western United States and Taiwan indicates that debris flow incision of bedrock valley floors tends to terminate upstream of where strath terraces begin and where area-slope data follow fluvial power laws. These observations lead us to propose that the steeper portions of unglaciated valley networks of landscapes steep enough to produce mass failures are predominately cut by debris flows, whose topographic signature is an area-slope plot that curves in log-log space. This matters greatly as valleys with curved area-slope plots are both extensive by length (>80% of large steepland basins) and comprise large fractions of main stem valley relief (25-100%). As a consequence, valleys carved by debris flows, not rivers, bound most hillslopes in unglaciated steeplands. Debris flow scour of these valleys appears to limit the height of some mountains to substantially lower elevations than river incision laws would predict, an effect absent in current landscape evolution models. We anticipate that an understanding of debris flow incision, for which we currently lack even an empirical expression, would substantially change model results and inferences drawn about linkages between landscape morphology and tectonics, climate, and geology.

AB The rainfall erosivity plays a fundamental role in water soil erosion processes and it can be expressed by its kinetic power. At first in this paper, the raindrop-size distributions measured, in the period June 2006-March 2014, by an optical disdrometer installed at the Department of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences of University of Palermo are aggregated into rainfall intensity classes, having different ranges, and the measured kinetic power values are determined. Measured kinetic power values are initially used for testing the applicability of the kinetic power-rainfall intensity relationships proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (), used in Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Brown and Foster () (RUSLE), and McGregor et al. () (RUSLE2). Then, the reliability of a theoretical relationship for estimating the kinetic power by rainfall intensity and median volume diameter is verified. Finally, using the literature available datasets, corresponding to measurements carried out by different techniques and in different geographical sites, the analysis demonstrated that the rainfall intensity is not sufficient to determine the rainfall kinetic power. On the contrary, the theoretically deduced relationship allows to reproduce adequately the kinetic power of all available datasets, demonstrating that the knowledge of both rainfall intensity and median volume diameter allows a reliable estimate of the rainfall erosivity.

   Recession Behavior

AB The subsurface flow contribution to a basin hydrograph is often conceptualized as a single lumped reservoir parameterized by a power law function fit through the observed recession behavior of the basin. However, basins may be better represented as multiple independent subsurface hillslope reservoirs characterized with variable, transient recession behavior as a function of the time history of recharge. In this work, we unify the latter, more complex understanding of the subsurface with the large-scale power law recession behavior convenient in hydrologic modeling applications. This unification is achieved by deriving upscaling relationships capable of converting simple metrics of basin hillslope topography into a signature basin response characterizing the subsurface-flow-induced recession from a single recharge event. Event superposition may then be used to simulate the application of a time series of recharge and a simple scaling relationship may be used to handle basins with homogeneous conductivity. The signature response is informed by numerical simulations of the hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation for unconfined saturated flow through sloping hillslopes applied to 30 basins in the CAMELS database. The efficacy of the upscaled signature response in replicating numerical simulations in 50 CAMELS basins is demonstrated, as is the practical efficacy of the upscaling relationships for predicting transient recession in 17 of these basins. The upscaled signature response method thus provides a tool for hydrologic modelers to estimate transient recession parameters using the insights of subsurface flow modeling, although the predictions made by this method are unable to capture the full variability of observed recession behavior.

AB We adapted Newton's law of cooling to model downstream water temperature change in response to stream-adjacent forest harvest on small and medium streams (average 327ha in size) throughout the Oregon Coast Range, USA. The model requires measured stream gradient, width, depth and upstream control reach temperatures as inputs and contains two free parameters, which were determined by fitting the model to measured stream temperature data. This model reproduces the measured downstream temperature responses to within 0.4 degrees C for 15 of the 16 streams studied and provides insight into the physical sources of site-to-site variation among those responses. We also use the model to examine how the pre-harvest to post-harvest change in daily maximum stream temperature depends on distance from the harvest reach. The model suggests that the pre-harvest to post-harvest temperature change approximately 300m downstream of the harvest will range from roughly 82% to less than 1% of that temperature change that occurred within the harvest reach, depending primarily on the downstream width, depth and gradient. Using study-averaged values for these channel characteristics, the model suggests that for a stream representative of those in the study, the temperature change approximately 300m downstream of the harvest will be 56% of the temperature change that occurred within the harvest reach. This adapted Newton's law of cooling procedure represents a highly practical means for predicting stream temperature behaviour downstream of timber harvests relative to conventional heat budget approaches and is informative of the dominant processes affecting stream temperature.

AB Daily actual evaporation observed locally is compared to daily pan evaporation to clarify and test the validity of the complementary relationship at this timescale. For this purpose, use was made of actual evaporation measurements at two sites, namely, in the Konza Prairie, Kansas, during the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment, and in the Little Washita River Basin, Oklahoma, as part of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program. The corresponding pan evaporation data were obtained from nearby class A pan stations. The results of the analyses confirm the complementary relationship at this shorter timescale and lead to a procedure to estimate actual landscape evaporation by means of net radiation and pan evaporation data; they also provide support for the notion that even under conditions of decreasing incoming radiation, a negative trend in pan evaporation may still indicate a positive trend in landscape evapotranspiration.

AB We introduce a groundwater sustainability index offering a novel combination of features. It is holistic in the sense that it incorporates both water quantity and water quality indicators. The former employs the signal-to-noise ratio of long-term trends estimated via robust regression; the latter uses concentration of the primary contaminant of concern. A fuzzy inference system integrates these unlike metrics. The system also explicitly encodes expert knowledge and stakeholder values, and directly acknowledges subjectivity in environmental condition "grading," through the use of linguistic rules and fuzzy sets, respectively. The fuzzy rule base is constructed such that poor environmental conditions captured by one measure are not hidden by good performance in another. A standard Mamdani (max-min) inference engine is used with centroid defuzzification. The outcome is an intuitively accessible index ranging from 0 to 100. The method is demonstrated using examples from the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer, an important and managerially challenging transboundary (Canada-US) water resource.

ID DRAINAGE NETWORKS
AB Watershed subdivision is a useful discretization method for distributed hydrological models at large river basins. A subwatershed codification method, which is able to identify the subwatershed uniquely and reflect the topological relationship is desired. According to the previous literatures, there are two types of coding methods suitable for the subwatershed codification: the Pfafstetter-group rules and the modified binary tree codification method. But, both of them have some shortcomings in theory and application. A new coding method named stem-branch topological codification is developed to overcome these shortcomings, which is based on the stem-branch topological structure of the drainage networks and capable of reflecting the river hierarchy. The basic coding elements of the method are river reaches in the drainage networks, which are not only generated by the tributary junctions, but also by the splitting points of hydrological factors (e.g. hydrological gauge stations and reservoirs). Also, the method could handle complex confluences (e.g. river reaches with more than two upstream inflows), which are rare under natural conditions, but more frequent in the digital elevation model extracted or artificial drainage networks (e.g. sewage systems or irrigation drainage networks). With the stem-branch topological codification codes, it is easy to identify the upstream (or downstream) relationship between any two subwatersheds and to calculate the directly connected subwatershed codes. Also, if some changes have occurred in the drainage network, there is no need to recode the whole watershed, but by modifying the existed codes to form the new ones.

AB Many natural hazards satisfy power-law (fractal) frequency-size statistics to a good approximation for medium and large events. Examples include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, landslides, and forest fires. A major question is whether this is also true for floods. A number of authors have argued in favor of the applicability of power-law statistics to floods. We discuss these arguments and consider a number of examples, using both instrumental records and paleoflood studies. In our analyses we consider both annual and partial-duration flood series. We argue that use of annual floods for statistical considerations strongly biases the flood-frequency estimates, as in some years, the annual flood will be much smaller than a number of `statistically independent' floods (partial-duration floods) in other years. We examine six USGS hydrologic stations with drainage areas from 41 to 95,300 km(2), representing very different climatic regions and hydrologic conditions, and with periods of records ranging from 74 to 110 water years. Excellent power-law fits to each partial-duration series are found taking Q similar to T-alpha, with Q the discharge associated with the recurrence interval T, and the power-law exponent a ranging from 0.27 to 0.90. We also consider paleoflood estimates for Axehandle Alcove on the Colorado River and Bonza Alcove on the Paria River, and find that that power-law extrapolations based on instrumental partial-duration series for stations in each of these two areas is within a half order of magnitude when compared to their respective paleoflood estimates. Finally, we consider an alternative approach to extreme streamflows that has been proposed, examining the cumulative probability distribution of instrumental daily mean streamflows. We show that this distribution is in good agreement with the power-law correlation found using the partial-duration series. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stream ecosystem processes, such as metabolism, are dynamically impacted by flow intensity. Therefore, without integrating ecosystem processes with water quality, we miss opportunities to develop frameworks to understand metabolic responses to changing flow. Flow simultaneously affects the material transport and biological opportunities for material transformation. Combining the strengths of ecohydrology and stream ecology to understand how flow variation alters ecosystem processes, we analyzed more than 5 years of water quality and stream metabolism data. We created segmented process-discharge (P-Q) relationships to examine how metabolism rates vary across discharge and compared them to concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships to explore the dynamic effects of discharge on processes and physicochemical parameters. Within the segmented P-Q relationships, we found the behavior of ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP) to be different at high and low flows with varying degrees of statistical significance, demonstrating the potential for divergent metabolic responses across changing flows. GPP declined with increasing discharge. The rate of ER declined with discharge initially but then became unchanging at higher flows. NEP reflected the divergent trends between ER and GPP, as the relationship of NEP to Q was flat at lower discharge and declined at higher flows. Interrelated physicochemical parameters and ecosystem processes, such as pH and NEP, had mirrored responses to discharge. Coupling analyses of flow, water quality, and metabolism offers a more complete picture of interrelated ecosystem processes, allowing for a better understanding of ecosystem response to the physical and chemical changes that occur across flows.

AB Analytical and numerical solutions for flow through partially saturated soils typically require functional relationships between water content, pressure, and hydraulic conductivity. Here we propose a Weibull-type function to describe the hydraulic conductivity-pressure head function. We show that this is a more flexible function that has the ability to address air entry pressure, while retaining the ease of integration and differentiation that facilitates many important computations which have to this point favored the Gardner exponential function (which is a special case of the proposed function). The ability to fit measured values is shown to be better than commonly employed functions of similar simplicity. Strong relationships were found between the parameters of the proposed function and the corresponding soil water retention curve, thus providing predictive capability. A simple relationship was also found between the parameters of the function and the wetting front pressure, psi(f). Applying the proposed function to estimate psi(f) improves the accuracy of predictions for infiltration using the Green and Ampt model.

AB We developed a hydrologic model capable of simulating pothole complexes composed of tens of thousands or more individual closed-basin water bodies. It was applied to simulate the hydrologic response of a prairie pothole complex to climatic variability over a 105 year period (1901-2005) in an area of the Prairie Pothole Region in North Dakota. The model was calibrated and validated with a genetic algorithm by comparing the simulated results with observed power law relationships on water area-frequency derived from Landsat images and a 27 year record of water depths from six wetlands in the Cottonwood Lake area. The simulated behavior in water area and water body frequency showed good agreement with the observations under average, dry, and wet conditions. Analysis of simulation results over the last century showed that the power laws changed intra-annually and interannually as a function of climate. Major droughts and deluges can produce marked variability in the power law function (e. g., up to 1.5 orders of magnitude variability in intercept from the extreme Dust Bowl drought to the extreme 1993-2001 deluge). Analyses also revealed the frequency of occurrence of small potholes and puddles did not follow pure power law behavior and that details of the departure from linear behavior were closely related to the climatic conditions. A general equation, which encompasses both the linear power law segment for large potholes and nonlinear unimodal body for small potholes and puddles, was used to build conceptual models to describe how the numbers of water bodies as a function of water area respond to fluctuations in climate.

AB Worldwide water governance failures undermine effective water management under uncertainty and change. Overcoming these failures requires employing more adaptive, resilient water management approaches; yet, while scholars have advance theory of what adaptive, resilient approaches should be, there is little empirical evidence to support those normative propositions. To fill this gap, we reviewed the literature to derive theorized characteristics of adaptive, resilient water governance including knowledge generation and use, participation, clear rules for water use, and incorporating nonstationarity. Then, using interviews and documentary analysis focused on five U.S. states' allocation and planning approaches, we examined empirically if embodying these characteristics made states more (or less) adaptive and resilient in practice. We found that adaptive, resilient water governance requires not just possessing these characteristics but combining and building on them. That is, adaptive, resilient water governance requires well-funded, transparent knowledge systems combined with broad, multilevel participatory processes that support learning, strong institutional arrangements that establish authorities and rules and that allow flexibility as conditions change, and resources for integrated planning and allocation. We also found that difficulty incorporating climate change or altering existing water governance paradigms and inadequate funding of water programs undermine adaptive, resilient governance.

AB The analysis of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships provides useful information on the processes controlling the mobilization and delivery of chemical elements into streams as well as biogeochemical transformations in river networks. Previous metrics developed to characterize export regimes seldom considered the possibility for the C response to Q dynamics to differ between short-term Q variations during storm events and seasonal Q variations during baseflow periods. Here, we present the "C-Q(quick-show)" model, which considers the possibility for C-Q relationships to vary across temporal scales. This model was applied in 219 French catchments with various sizes (11-2500 km(2)), land use and hydrological contexts. We evidenced contrasting export regimes for nitrate (NO3-), total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and surprisingly consistent C-Q patterns at the seasonal scale for each parameter. For instance, NO3--Q relationships were positive at the seasonal scale in 75% cases and relationships during storms showed either a dilution pattern (24% cases), a non-significant pattern (50%), or a mobilization pattern (12%). TP and SRP relationships with Q at the seasonal scale were almost systematically negative (95%), and patterns during storm events were in most cases mobilization for TP (77%) or non-significant for SRP (69%). We linked the different C-Q relationships with catchment descriptors and found that indicators of diffuse source loading determined NO3- seasonal amplitudes, and hydrological drivers could explain the behavior during storms. By contrast, point sources determined P seasonal amplitudes, and diffuse sources controlled P dynamics during storms. The C-Q(quick-show) model has the potential to improve nutrient load estimations because of the good predictability of appropriate C-Q archetypes and the possibility to interpolate low frequency concentration data to a daily frequency.

AB We have developed a new theory and numerical model of electrical self-potential (SP) signals associated with unsaturated flow in melting snow. The model is applicable to continuous natural melt as well as transient flow phenomena such as meltwater pulses and is tested using laboratory column experiments. SP signals fundamentally depend on the temporal evolution of snow porosity and meltwater flux, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH. We infer a reversal of the sign of the zeta potential (a fundamental electrical property of grain surfaces in porous media) consistent with well-known elution sequences of ions that cause progressive increases and decreases in meltwater pH and EC, respectively. Injection of fully melted snow samples, containing the entire natural range of ions, into melting snow columns caused additional temporary reversals of the sign of the zeta potential. Widely used empirical relationships between effective saturation, meltwater fraction, EC, and pH, as well as snow porosity, grain size, and permeability, are found to be robust for modeling purposes. Thus nonintrusive SP measurements can serve as proxies for snow meltwater fluxes and the temporal evolution of fundamental snow textural, hydraulic, or water quality parameters. Adaptation of automated multisensor SP acquisition technology from other environmental applications thus promises to bridge the widely acknowledged gap in spatial scales between satellite remote sensing and point measurements of snow properties. SP measurements and modeling may therefore contribute to solving a wide range of problems related to the assessment of water resource availability, avalanche or flood risk, or the amplification of climatic forcing of ice shelf, ice sheet, or glacier dynamics.

AB Using generalizations of the Cahn-Hilliard equation for modeling two-phase flow in porous media at the pore scale has become popular due to its ability to capture interfacial effects by adding minimal complications. Here we use upscaled field equations and exploit the second law of thermodynamics in the spirit of rational thermodynamics to develop a framework that, for two phases at the macroscale, recovers the Korteweg stress tensor for the liquid phase, generalizes Darcy's law, and recovers the classical Cahn-Hilliard equation. The corresponding results for three-phases at the macroscale are derived and are shown to be a generalization of Richards equation, and with appropriate simplifying assumptions are shown to recover the two-phase results. Simplifying the results appropriately produces a pore scale model for two liquid phases, and are shown to generalize previous works by Cuero-Felgueroso and Juanes and Boyer and Quintard et al. The results are are also compared with the Cahn-Hilliard Brinkman equations, where it is noted that to be physically consistent the state variable should represent a physical quantity. One key aspect that distinguishes this formulation from others is that it captures the different energies of the three interfaces (gas-liquid, gas-solid, and liquid-solid) without introducing the corresponding quantities at the microscale (interfacial tension, contact angle, etc).

AB In pore network modeling, the void space of a rock sample is represented at the microscopic scale by a network of pores connected by throats. Construction of a reasonable representation of the geometry and topology of the pore space will lead to a reliable prediction of the properties of porous media. Recently, the theory of multi-cellular growth (or L-systems) has been used as a flexible tool for generation of pore network models which do not require any special information such as 2D SEM or 3D pore space images. In general, the networks generated by this method are irregular pore network models which are inherently closer to the complicated nature of the porous media rather than regular lattice networks. In this approach, the construction process is controlled only by the production rules that govern the development process of the network. In this study, genetic algorithm has been used to obtain the optimum values of the uncertain parameters of these production rules to build an appropriate irregular lattice network capable of the prediction of both static and hydraulic information of the target porous medium.

AB Classical morphological descriptors of river networks have been developed in 2D planar system. The third z-dimension (elevation), however, is necessary to model landscape evolution, particularly in a mountainous region when taking into account transport processes such as in glaciology and erosion. This paper aims at analyzing 3D morphometric properties of channel networks on the basis of probabilistic relationships relating the drained area and the elevation. The methodology is an extension of the fundamental planar power-law description proposed by Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. () representing the probability that the drained area A is higher than a threshold area a, P[A>a]similar to a(-beta), where beta is constant and represents an invariant property of natural river networks. A new scaling factor taking into account hypsometry is introduced in the previous power-law relationship, as P[A>a]similar to a(-tau)F(a/theta(z)), where F is a scaling function and theta is a measure of the system scale and a function of hypsometry. The new power law has one empirical parameter tau. A procedure was developed to calibrate this parameter and to calculate the corresponding uncertainty for applications on a single basin and then extended to a set of 70 basins in the Southern Rocky Mountains. The results show that the 3D power law exhibits scale-invariance properties with respect to theta, when applied to a single basin. Looking at the entire set of 70 basins, the criterion value associated with the uncertainty model shows a moderate loss in scaling quality compared with the basin-per-basin description but nevertheless remains acceptable. This 3D power law provides a geomorphologic basis for applications in mountainous regions where the relation between drained area and hypsometry has to be considered.

AB Through the new method for automatic extraction of a tidal network from topographic or bathymetric fields described in a companion paper [Fagherazzi et al., this issue], we analyze the morphology of aggregated patterns that we observe in nature in different tidal environments. Specifically, we define, on the basis of a hydrodynamic analysis, a procedure for watershed delineation and for the identification of the "divides" for every subnetwork and look at the resulting drainage density and its related scaling properties. From the systematic, large-scale plots of drainage density and channel width versus watershed area we address the issue of a possible geomorphic criterion that corresponds to the parts of the tidal landscape that are characterized by river-like features. We also analyze the relationship of total contributing tidal basin area to channel widths and to mainstream lengths (Hack's law). We study comparatively probability distributions of total drainage areas and of "botanical" mass (the area of the channelized landscape upstream of a given section) for tidal and fluvial patterns and find altered scaling features of tidal landforms that reflect the complex interactions of different mechanisms that shape their geometry. Simple geomorphic relationships of the types observed in the fluvial basin (e.g,, power laws in the watershed area versus drainage density, mainstream length, or channel width relationships) do not hold throughout the range of scales investigated and are site-specific. We conclude that tidal networks unlike rivers exhibit great diversity in their geometrical and topological forms. This diversity is suggested to stem from the pronounced spatial gradients of landscape-forming flow rates and from the imprinting of several crossovers from competing dynamic processes.

AB Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the "best" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.

AB Roll waves commonly occur in overland flow and have an important influence on the progress of soil erosion on slopes. This study aimed to explore the evolution and mechanism of roll waves on steep slopes. The potential effects of flow rate, rainfall intensity and bed roughness on the laws controlling roll wave parameters were investigated. The flow rates, rainfall intensities and bed roughness varied from 5 to 30 L/min, 0 to 150 mm/h, and 0.061 to 1.700 mm, respectively. The results indicate that roll waves polymerize significantly along the propagation path, and bed roughness and rainfall affect the generation and evolution of roll waves. The wave velocity, length and height decreased with bed roughness, whereas the wave frequency increased with increasing bed roughness under fixed flow rate and rainfall intensity conditions. Rainfall increased the wave velocity and wavelength and decreased the wave frequency. The wave velocity, height and wavelength tended to increase with an increasing flow rate. Rainfall promoted the generation of roll waves, whereas bed roughness had the opposite effect. The generation of roll waves is closely related to the Froude number (Fr) and flow resistance. In this experiment, the range of the Reynolds number for the roll waves generated in the laminar region was 142-416, and the range of the flow resistance coefficient was 0.64-4.85. The critical value of the Fr for flow instability in the laminar region was approximately 0.57. Exploring the generation and evolution law of roll waves is necessary for understanding the processes and dynamic mechanisms of slope soil erosion.

AB In this study, we explore the use of unsteady transit time distribution (TTD) theory to model solute transport in biofilters, a popular form of nature-based or "green" storm water infrastructure (GSI). TTD theory has the potential to address many unresolved challenges associated with predicting pollutant fate and transport through these systems, including unsteadiness in the water balance (time-varying inflows, outflows, and storage), unsteadiness in pollutant loading, time-dependent reactions, and scale-up to GSI networks and urban catchments. From a solution to the unsteady age conservation equation under uniform sampling, we derive an explicit expression for solute breakthrough during and after one or more storm events. The solution is calibrated and validated with breakthrough data from 17 simulated storms at a field-scale biofilter test facility in Southern California, using bromide as a conservative tracer. TTD theory closely reproduces bromide breakthrough concentrations, provided that lateral exchange with the surrounding soil is accounted for. At any given time, according to theory, more than half of the water in storage is from the most recent storm, while the rest is a mixture of penultimate and earlier storms. Thus, key management endpoints, such as the pollutant treatment credit attributable to GSI, are likely to depend on the evolving age distribution of water stored and released by these systems.

AB Water resources in dryland areas are often provided by numerous surface reservoirs. As a basis for securing future water supply, the dynamics of reservoir systems need to be simulated for large river basins, accounting for environmental change and an increasing water demand. For the State of Ceara in semiarid Northeast Brazil, with several thousands of reservoirs, a simple deterministic water balance model is presented. Within a cascade-type approach, the reservoirs are grouped into six classes according to storage capacity, rules for flow routing between reservoirs of different size are defined, and water withdrawal and return flow due to human water use is accounted for. While large uncertainties in model applications exist, particularly in terms of reservoir operation rules, model validation against observed reservoir storage volumes shows that the approach is a reasonable simplification to assess surface water availability in large river basins. The results demonstrate the large impact of reservoir storage on downstream flow and stress the need for a coupled simulation of runoff generation, network redistribution and water use.

AB The assumptions of equilibrium flow conditions neglecting the flow acceleration for vertical velocity distributions and of the equilibrium wall law applied to the bottom boundary condition, in which the flow acceleration is neglected in the vicinity of the bed, are questionable when used to calculate sediment transport for flows that vary rapidly over time and space. Examples of such flows include dam-break flows and flows around structures. This study proposes a two-phase depth-integrated model for large-scale geophysical flow applications involving sediment transport phenomena and bed morphology. The model for the fluid phase is based on the non-hydrostatic quasi-3D method, and uses a dynamic rough wall law that employs continuity and momentum equations for the bottom boundary conditions.
   It was confirmed that the proposed model reduces to the previous bedload formulae for uniform flow conditions under the weak sediment transport condition. The model was applied in an experiment involving a dambreak flow on a movable bed channel with a suddenly enlarged section. The comparison between the experimental results and the results calculated with the proposed model and previous models demonstrates the validity of the proposed model. The comparison also highlights the advantages of introducing a quasi-3D two-phase model to evaluate vertical velocity distributions and non-equilibrium sediment motions.

AB Hydrogeomorphic models allow parsimonious, fast and effective floodplain extent mapping using topographic data as the main input. Hydrogeomorphic approaches enforce the principle that floodplains are well-distinguished and unique landscape features within river corridors. We investigated the sensitivity of a hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation algorithm, based on a hydrological power law, relating flow depth to contributing area, digital terrain model (DTM) resolution and river network hierarchy. In addition, we compared the results to other common floodplain mapping methods using standard flood-hazard maps as a reference. Taking the Arno River Basin, Italy, as a case study, our results show a dependency between the optimal power law parameters and DTM resolution, with larger parameter values required to reach optimal consistency with flood-hazard maps as DTM resolution increased. Floodplain mapping performance was also found to depend on stream order. We further tested the model consistency at a larger scale to evaluate its performance with respect to inundation maps in Hungary, Italy, Spain and the UK. Our study suggests that pre-defined power law parameters can be assumed, considering DTM resolution and stream order, supporting the use of the presented hydrogeomorphic model for large-scale floodplain mapping in ungauged basins where reference flood-hazard maps are not available.

AB Existing analytical or approximate solutions that are appropriate for describing the migration mechanics of CO2 and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs do not consider the high compressibility of CO2, which reduces their calculation accuracy and application value. Therefore, this work first derives a new governing equation that represents the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs, based on the equation of continuity and the generalized Darcy's law. A more rigorous definition of the coefficient of compressibility of fluid is then presented, and a power function model (PFM) that characterizes the relationship between the physical properties of CO2 and the pressure is derived. Meanwhile, to avoid the difficulty of determining the saturation of fluids, a method that directly assumes the average relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains is proposed, based on the theory of gradual change. An advanced analytical solution is obtained that includes both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of CO2 and brine in evaluating the evolution of fluid pressure by integrating within different regions. Finally, two typical sample analyses are used to verify the reliability, improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution. Based on the physical characteristics and the results calculated for the examples, this work elaborates the concept and basis of partitioning for use in further work.

AB A model commonly applied to the estimation of water relative permeability k(rw) in porous media is the Burdine-Brooks-Corey model, which relies on a simplified picture of pores as a bundle of noninterconnected capillary tubes. In this model, the empirical tortuosity-connectivity factor is assumed to be a power law function of effective saturation with an exponent (mu) commonly set equal to 2 in the literature. Invoking critical path analysis and using percolation theory, we relate the tortuosity-connectivity exponent mu to the critical scaling exponent t of percolation that characterizes the power law behavior of the saturation-dependent electrical conductivity of porous media. We also discuss the cause of the nonuniversality of mu in terms of the nonuniversality of t and compare model estimations with water relative permeability from experiments. The comparison supports determining mu from the electrical conductivity scaling exponent t, but also highlights limitations of the model.

AB The macroscopic modelling of two-phase flow processes in subsurface hydrosystems or industrial applications on the Darcy scale usually requires a constitutive relationship between capillary pressure and saturation, the P-c(S-w) relationship. Traditionally, it is assumed that a unique relation between P-c and S-w exists independently of the flow conditions as long as hysteretic effects can be neglected. Recently, this assumption has been questioned and alternative formulations have been suggested. For example, the extended P-c(S-w) relationship by Hassanizadeh and Gray [Hassanizadeh SM, Gray WG. Mechanics and thermodynamics of multiphase flow in porous media including interphase boundaries. Adv Water Resources 1990;13(4):169-86] proposes that the difference between the phase pressures to the equilibrium capillary pressure is a linear function of the rate of change of saturation, thereby introducing a constant of proportionality, the coefficient tau. It is desirable to identify cases where the extended relationship needs to be considered. Consequently, a dimensional analysis is performed on the basis of the two-phase balance equations. In addition to the well-known capillary and gravitational number, the dimensional analysis yields a new dimensionless number. The dynamic number Dy quantifies the ratio of dynamic capillary to viscous forces. Relating the dynamic to the capillary as well as the gravitational number gives the new numbers DyC and DyG, respectively. For given sets of fluid and porous medium parameters, the dimensionless numbers Dy and DyC are interpreted as functions of the characteristic length and flow velocity. The simulation of an imbibition process provides insight into the interpretation of the characteristic length scale. The most promising choice for this length scale seems to be the front width. We conclude that consideration of the extended P-c(S-w) relationship may be important for porous media with high permeability, small entry pressure and high coefficient tau when systems with a small characteristic length (e.g. steep front) and small characteristic time scale are under investigation.

AB Pumping tests are established for characterizing spatial average properties of aquifers. At the same time, they are promising tools to identify heterogeneity characteristics such as log-conductivity variance and correlation scales. We present the extended Generalized Radial Flow Model (eGRF) which combines the characterization of well flow in fractal geometry with an upscaled conductivity for pumping tests in heterogeneous media. We show that the eGRF is a generalization of previously solutions, such as that of Barker, Butler and Neuman. We derive effective conductivities for uniform and well flow conditions in heterogeneous log-normal media with a truncated power law correlation structure through the upscaling procedure Coarse Graining. The radial-dependent effective conductivity for well flow reflects the gradual change of heterogeneity impact on average pumping test drawdowns. We then combine upscaled conductivities with the eGRF model to determine the effective pumping test solution. We provide a proof of concept by comparing theoretical upscaling results with Monte Carlo well flow simulations in heterogeneous fractal fields. The eGRF and upscaling results are implemented and made freely available as python code for transport simulation as well as pumping test analysis.

ID SANDSTONE CATCHMENT; PATTERNS
AB Initial catchment state, such as soil moisture, strongly controls rainfall-runoff transformation processes. However, due to the high spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, point measurements may not always be suitable to represent the actual system state of a whole catchment as required in distributed catchment modelling. In this study a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang approach has been developed using soil moisture and rainfall as input variables to predict the actual discharge at the catchment outlet. Four soil moisture probes from the hydrological test site Durreych (Black Forest, southwest Germany) were selected, each of them representing a particular runoff generation process (saturation excess flow, infiltration excess flow, slow and fast interflow, return flow). After manual calibration, the simulated peak discharges were very similar to the measured values. Furthermore, the pattern of rule activation in the FRBS reflected the complex, highly nonlinear behaviour of the catchment. Thus, in the FRBS framework, the measurements of soil moisture at representative locations could be used as representation for the actual system state, allowing for an entirely data-driven prediction of the runoff response using rainfall.

ID HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; CONNECTIVITY
AB Observations of outcrops of fractured media show that fractures are correlated at all scales of the medium and that there are also fractures of sizes ranging from the microscale to the macroscale. Recent studies have shown that the correlation pattern is often a fractal characterized by its dimension D-c and that the fracture length distribution is a power law of characteristic exponent -a. We study the influence of these long-range heterogeneities on the equivalent medium permeability. Fracture correlation and fracture length are present at all scales of the medium and may thus influence the hydraulic properties and their scaling at all scales. We have numerically investigated the effect of the fractal correlation pattern and of the power law length distribution on the equivalent permeability of fracture networks. The correlation and the length distribution have opposite effects on connectivity and permeability. Increasing correlation lets connectivity and permeability decrease and conversely for the length distribution. In most cases, one of the characteristics (i.e., length or correlation) supersedes the other. There is only a small area defined by a > 2 and a less than or equal to D-c + 1 where both characteristics have a simultaneous influence on permeability. In this area the influence of the correlation remains low, more precisely a scale increase of at least 5 orders of magnitude is required to produce a permeability increase of 1 order of magnitude. Although the correlation pattern does not have much influence on the equivalent permeability, its influence on the flow pattern increases from negligible for networks at threshold to important for dense networks.

AB The time compression (or time condensation) approximation (TCA) is commonly used in conjunction with an infiltration capacity equation for predicting the postponding infiltration rate, or, more generally, infiltration under time-varying precipitation. In this paper a power function relationship for TCA between infiltration capacity and its time derivative is proposed for infiltration in the presence of a shallow water table. The results show that the exponent () in the power function relationship is not a constant but decreases as infiltration proceeds. The change of indicates that the TCA relationship changes during infiltration and further suggests the necessity of using different TCA relationships for predicting infiltration rate during different stages after ponding. We argue that the change of is due to the gradual dynamic change of the relative role of gravity and capillarity during infiltration. A Peclet number ( is proposed for measuring the relative effect of gravity and capillarity. In the early times of infiltration when, with the increase of infiltration when Pe < 1, with the increase of Pe, ss decreases roughly from 3.5 to 2 for clay, silty clay loam, and silty loam, and from 3 to 2 for sandy loam and sand; during the longer times when Pe > 1, ss has a linear relationship with Pe. The relationship between Pe and ss provides an objective approach to select the suitable TCA function during different infiltration stages after ponding.

AB Land surface energetic partitioning between latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes determines climate and influences the terrestrial segment of land-atmosphere coupling. Soil moisture, among other variables, has a direct influence on this partitioning. Dry surfaces characterize a water-limited regime where evapotranspiration and soil moisture are coupled. This coupling is subdued for wet surfaces, or an energy-limited regime. This framework is commonly evaluated using the evaporative fraction--soil moisture relationship. However, this relationship is explicitly or implicitly prescribed in land surface models. These impositions, in turn, confound model-based evaluations of energetic partitioning--soil moisture relationships. In this study, we use satellite-based observations of surface temperature diurnal amplitude (directly related to available energy partitioning) and soil moisture, free of model impositions, to estimate characteristics of surface energetic partitioning--soil moisture relationships during 10--20-day surface drying periods across Africa. We specifically estimate the spatial patterns of water-limited energy flux sensitivity to soil moisture (m) and the soil moisture threshold separating water and energy-limited regimes (theta*). We also assess how time evolution of other factors (e.g., solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, surface albedo, and wind speed) can confound the energetic partitioning--soil moisture relationship. We find higher m in drier regions and interestingly similar spatial theta* distributions across biomes. Vapor pressure deficit and insolation increases during drying tend to increase m. Only vapor pressure deficit increases in the Sahelian grasslands systematically decrease theta*. Ultimately, soil and atmospheric moisture availability together play the largest role in land surface energy partitioning with minimal consistent influences of time evolution of other forcings.

AB This study reports results from an analysis of the relationship between atmospheric forcing and model-simulated water and energy fluxes for the North American Land Data Assimilation System Project Phase 2 (NLDAS-2). The relationships between mean monthly precipitation and total runoff are stronger in the Sacramento (SAC) and variable infiltration capacity (VIC) models, which grew out of the hydrological community, than in the Noah and Mosaic models, which grew out of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) community. The reverse is true for the relationship between mean monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration. In addition, surface energy fluxes in VIC are less sensitive to model forcing (except for air temperature) than those in the Noah and Mosaic model. Notwithstanding these general conclusions, the relationships between forcings and model-simulated water and energy fluxes for all models vary for different seasons, variables, and regions. These findings will ultimately inspire a combination of SVAT-type model energy components with hydrological model water components to develop a SVAT-hydrology model to improve both evapotranspiration and total runoff simulations.

AB Over multi-decadal time scales, assuming that changes in subsurface water storage are negligible, the continental precipitative water flux, P, can be divided into two principal components, Q (run-off, including soil infiltration and groundwater recharge) and ET (evapotranspiration). Taking into account a broadly applied Budyko's phenomenology to describe the relationship of ET/P as a function of PET/P, where PET is the potential evapotranspiration, we propose a theoretical framework for predicting characteristics of the water cycle from scaling relationships. In this framework, the ecosystem net primary productivity is expressed in terms of soil formation and vegetation growth, which is mathematically optimized with respect to the water partitioning, generating directly the value ET/P. The mathematical optimization is based on the general ecological principle that dominant ecosystems tend to be those that, for any given conditions, maximize conversion of atmospheric carbon to biomass. It is shown that application of the results of mathematical optimization to water-limited ecosystems is possible by applying the optimization only to a vegetation covered portion of the surface. For energy-limited ecosystems, the optimization can be applied only to a portion of the precipitation equal to PET, assuming that the remaining P simply runs off. We use theoretical and actual values of plant root fractal dimensionalities, d(f), to predict ranges of ET/P as a function of PET/P for 0 <= PET/P <= 1 and compare with annual and multi-decadal means of ET/P. By comparing the developed approach with a large amount of data collected from the literature, we demonstrate its successful applications to both water- and energy-limited systems.

AB Accurate estimates of mass-exchange parameters in transient storage zones are needed to better understand and quantify solute transport and dispersion in riverine systems. Currently, the predictive mean residence time relies on an empirical entrainment coefficient with a range in variance due to the absence of hydraulic and geomorphic quantities driving mass exchange. Two empirically derived relationships are presented for the mean residence time of lateral cavities-a prevalent and widely recognized type of transient storage-in gravel-bed rivers and streams that incorporates hydraulic and geomorphic parameters. The relationships are applicable for gravel-bed rivers and streams with a range of cavity width to length (W/L) aspect ratios (0.2-0.75), shape, and Reynolds numbers (Re, ranging from 1.0 x 10(4) to 1.0 x 10(7)). The relationships equate normalized mean residence time to nondimensional quantities: Froude number, Re, W/L, depth ratio (ratio of cavity to shear layer depth), roughness factor (ratio of shear to channel velocity), and shape factor (representing degree of cavity equidimensionality). One relationship excludes bed roughness (equation (13)) and the other includes bed roughness (equation (14)). The empirically derived relationships have been verified for conservative tracers (R-2 of 0.83) within a range of flow and geometry conditions. Topics warranting future research are testing the empirical relationship that includes the roughness factor using parameters measured in the vicinity of the cavity to reduce the variance in the correlation, and further development of the relationship for nonconservative transport.

ID ADVECTION-ARIDITY APPROACH; REGIONAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; DESERT; WATER
AB A nonlinear function approach for the normalized complementary relationship evaporation model that is different from the methodology maintaining the symmetric complementary relationship with appropriate definitions of potential and wet-environment evaporation is proposed and verified. This approach employs the definitions used in the advection-aridity model, wherein the potential is estimated using the Penman equation. Normalized by Penman potential evaporation, the complementary relationship model is expressed as a function describing the relationship between the evaporation ratio (the ratio of the actual to the Penman potential evaporation) and the proportion of the radiation term in Penman potential evaporation. The new nonlinear function proposed in the current study is approximately equivalent to the advection-aridity and the modified Granger models under conditions that are neither too wet nor too dry, but is more reasonable under arid and wet conditions. The new nonlinear function model performs well in estimating actual evaporation, as verified by the observed data from four sites under different land covers.

AB A depth-averaged model with a power-law rheology, usually adopted for debris flow of fine sediment-water mixtures, is analytically studied, considering the complete (Full Dynamic Model) and the simplified momentum equations, known as Kinematic, Diffusion, and Quasi-steady Models. Applying the Laplace transform to the linearized equations, the analytical first-order expressions of the upstream and downstream spatio-temporal channel response functions are derived for the full and the approximate models. Both shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids have been considered in hypocritical and linearly stable conditions, to investigate the influence of the rheology on the wave propagation. The effect of the upstream and downstream boundary conditions is considered assuming a finite channel length. The analytic description of the various linearized approximations allows a multi-faceted comparison of the wave propagation. About the basic wave characteristics, in the entire investigated range of Froude numbers and for all the considered rheologies, the Kinematic and Diffusive models underestimate the primary wave celerity and the Quasi-steady model underestimates the wave round-trip time. However, the examination of the response function reveals that the approximate models may provide relatively accurate reproduction of the full dynamic response. Moreover, the analytical solutions in the Laplace variables permit a systematic analysis of some relevant shape factors of the response functions. Independently on the models and the rheology, the damping of the downstream response function is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the upstream one. The results of the shape factor analysis of the upstream response function indicate that the diffusive approximation is the most accurate one. The performed comparison among the wave characteristics of the different approximations provides indications on the applicability of the simplified models for predicting debris or mud flows.

AB Modelling anisotropic flow in rocks requires their full permeability tensor. While theories derived from the upscaling of Stokes flow to Darcy's law may justify the tensor symmetry, homogenisations from micro-scale rock samples often return a non-zero level of asymmetry. Since most studies dismiss these controversial observations as numerical errors, this contribution looks more closely at the physical possibility of such behaviour. Asymmetry of the permeability tensor, which induces a rotatory flow, is manifested at the micro-scale by tortuous streamlines. Conversely, when considering a larger scale - above the Representative Elementary Volume for permeability - these tortuous paths do not statistically affect the flow direction any longer. At this point, the homogenisation of Stokes flow to Darcy's law reaches its domain of validity. We show that the asymmetry in the permeability tensor vanishes for this scale separation, regardless of the choice of boundary conditions unlike previously thought, if the boundary layer effect is disregarded.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) systems are expensive and not financially viable in a budget-restricted hydrological monitoring network. The surface renewal (SR) method is a cheaper alternative that requires a reduced fetch, but is currently dependent on EC for calibration. SR methods not requiring calibration (surface renewal 2 (SR2) and surface renewal dissipation theory (SRDT)) have been used but are not widely tested over indigenous vegetation. The aim of this research was to test the SR approach as a viable alternative to EC for the estimation of sensible heat flux (H) over indigenous vegetation (Leucosidea sericea) in a montane catchment for unstable periods. For both summer (7 d) and winter (9 d) campaigns, the three SR methods showed a good relationship with the EC method for the estimation of H. Overall, the SRDT method was the most viable alternative to EC and produced acceptable estimates of H over an indigenous vegetation canopy in a montane catchment.

AB The water path from any point of a basin to the outlet through the self-similar river network was considered. This hydraulic path was split into components within the Strahler ordering scheme. For the entire basin, we assumed the probability density functions of the lengths of these components, reduced by the scaling factor, to be independent and isotropic. As with these assumptions, we propose a statistical physics reasoning (similar to Maxwell's reasoning) that considers a hydraulic length symbolic space, built on the self-similar lengths of the components. Theoretical expressions of the probability density functions of the hydraulic length and of the lengths of all the components were derived. These expressions are gamma laws expressed in terms of simple geomorphological parameters. We validated our theory with experimental observations from two French basins, which are different in terms of size and relief. From the comparisons, we discuss the relevance of the assumptions and show how a gamma law structure underlies the river network organization, but under the influence of a strong hierarchy constraint. These geomorphological results have been translated into travel time probability density functions, through the hydraulic linear hypothesis. This translation provides deterministic explanations of some famous a priori assumptions of the unit hydrograph and the aeomorphological unit hydrograph theories, such as the gamma law general shape and the exponential distribution of residence time in Strahler states.

TI Bayesian model averaging using particle filtering and Gaussian mixture
   modeling: Theory, concepts, and simulation experiments
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION; SYSTEM; ENSEMBLES
AB Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different models. In recent years, this method has enjoyed widespread application and use in many fields of study to improve the spread-skill relationship of forecast ensembles. The BMA predictive probability density function (pdf) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of pdfs centered around the individual (possibly bias-corrected) forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts, and reflect the individual models skill over a training (calibration) period. The original BMA approach presented by Raftery et al. (2005) assumes that the conditional pdf of each individual model is adequately described with a rather standard Gaussian or Gamma statistical distribution, possibly with a heteroscedastic variance. Here we analyze the advantages of using BMA with a flexible representation of the conditional pdf. A joint particle filtering and Gaussian mixture modeling framework is presented to derive analytically, as closely and consistently as possible, the evolving forecast density (conditional pdf) of each constituent ensemble member. The median forecasts and evolving conditional pdfs of the constituent models are subsequently combined using BMA to derive one overall predictive distribution. This paper introduces the theory and concepts of this new ensemble postprocessing method, and demonstrates its usefulness and applicability by numerical simulation of the rainfall-runoff transformation using discharge data from three different catchments in the contiguous United States. The revised BMA method receives significantly lower-prediction errors than the original default BMA method (due to filtering) with predictive uncertainty intervals that are substantially smaller but still statistically coherent (due to the use of a time-variant conditional pdf).

AB Concentration-discharge relationships have been widely used as clues to the hydrochemical processes that control runoff chemistry. Here we examine concentration-discharge relationships for solutes produced primarily by mineral weathering in 59 geochemically diverse US catchments. We show that these catchments exhibit nearly chemostatic behaviour; their stream concentrations of weathering products such as Ca, Mg, Na, and Si typically vary by factors of only 3 to 20 while discharge varies by several orders of magnitude. Similar patterns are observed at the inter-annual time scale. This behaviour implies that solute concentrations in stream water are not determined by simple dilution of a fixed solute flux by a variable flux of water, and that rates of solute production and/or mobilization must be nearly proportional to water fluxes, both on storm and inter-annual timescales. We compared these catchments' concentration-discharge relationships to the predictions of several simple hydrological and geochemical models. Most of these models can be forced to approximately fit the observed concentration-discharge relationships, but often only by assuming unrealistic or internally inconsistent parameter values. We propose a new model that also fits the data and may be more robust. We suggest possible tests of the new model for future studies. The relative stability of concentration under widely varying discharge may help make aquatic environments habitable. It also implies that fluxes of weathering solutes in streams, and thus fluxes of alkalinity to the oceans, are determined primarily by water fluxes. Thus, hydrology may be a major driver of the ocean-alkalinity feedback regulating climate change. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE Exner law; Sediment transport; Fractional derivative of a function with

ID EQUATION; MODELS; DERIVATION; RESPECT
AB Here we consider a new, more general mathematical formulation of the nonlocal Exner law, widely used in morphodynamics and sediment transport models. In some recent literature the role of nonlocal effects in the sediment flux was analyzed, by using a fractional calculus approach, based on the application of Caputo fractional derivatives. In this paper we apply fractional derivatives of a function with respect to another function in order to have a more general and realistic picture of nonlocal effects in sediment transport models. We then discuss the meaning of this approach, considering a logarithmic profile emerging from the generalized formulation of the nonlocal steady Exner law. We finally suggest that this can be the way to overcome the theoretical shortcomings of the fractional Exner equation based on the application of classical Caputo derivatives.

AB There is growing interest in the use of geophysical methods for hydrological model parameterization. Empirical induced polarization (IP)-hydraulic conductivity (K) relationships have been developed, but these are only applicable to sediments in which the IP response shows limited variation with electrical current frequency. Here we examine the spectral IP response of samples taken from a UK sandstone aquifer and compare measured parameters with physical and hydraulic properties. We demonstrate the limited value of existing IP-K models due to the inherent IP frequency dependence of these samples. Our results show how the mean relaxation time, tau, is a more appropriate measure of IP response for these sediments. A significant inverse correlation between the surface area to pore volume ratio and tau is observed, suggesting that tau is a measure of a characteristic hydraulic length scale. This is supported by a measured strong positive correlation between log tau and log K. Our measurements also reveal evidence of a relationship between tau and a dominant pore throat size, which leads to postulations about the parallelism between the spectral IP behavior and unsaturated hydraulic characteristics. Additional experiments show how the relaxation time is affected by degree of fluid saturation, indicating that saturation levels must be accounted for if our empirical relationships are applied to vadose zone studies. Our results show clear evidence of the potential value of frequency-based IP measurements for parameterization of groundwater flow models.

TI Development of a Stepwise-Clustered Multi-Catchment Hydrological Model
   for Quantifying Interactions in Regional Climate-Runoff Relationships
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID RIVER-BASIN; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; STREAMFLOW; FLOWS
AB The concurrent variations of multi-catchment runoffs exist widely in natural hydrological systems. Approaching such variations requires integrated analyses of not only the climate-runoff relationships within individual catchments but also the distributive interactions among multiple catchments. In this study, a stepwise-clustered multi-catchment hydrological model (SCMW) is proposed to tackle the interactive relationships among multi-catchment runoffs and their concurrent variations within a watershed system. Through multivariate inference based on Wilks likelihood ratio criterions and F tests, the proposed model can deal with both continuous and discrete variables as well as nonlinear relations among multiple variables without the assumptions of functional relationships. The proposed SCMW is applied to the Iskut-Stikine Watershed, Canada. The effects of multiple uncertain factors are traced through multilevel factorial analysis. Overall, the accuracies of SCMW-simulated mean and interval flows demonstrate that the developed method can well reproduce the distributive and interactive relationships between climatic variables and multi-catchment runoffs. At the same time, the contributions of climate variables can be quantified; for example, it is found that near-surface minimum temperature (at Below Johnson Station) can explain 25.6% concurrent variations of multi-catchment runoffs, and vapor pressure (at Below Johnson Station) and precipitation (at Telegraph Creek Station) can explain 17.5% and 4.6% of such variations, respectively. The results of the multilevel factorial analysis indicate that the uncertainties in the simulated runoff levels are mainly from the modeling approach (43.3%); also, significant effects exist from interactions among multiple impact factors. The molding of concurrent variations of multi-catchment runoffs through SCMW is helpful for improving simulation accuracy for watersheds with spatially heterogeneous climate-runoff relationships.

AB A global challenge for water resource management in rivers worldwide is ensuring water supply reliability satisfies consumptive and environmental demands. High variability in water supply, water policy and management decisions, and uncertainty about the effects of climate change compound this challenge. Understanding factors driving water allocations and consequences for water users and the environment is essential. Rainfall and streamflow traditionally drive allocations, yet the influence of water management decisions are often overlooked because they are complex, rarely codified and dependent on the regional context. We compared the relative influences of water management, climate and the river system characteristics including demand and water storage infrastructure on regulated and unregulated water allocations in two regulated rivers with large dams for water supply to towns, irrigated agriculture and wetlands of international significance (Gwydir and Macquarie Rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin, southeastern Australia), using hydrological simulation models and regression-based sensitivity analyses under an historical and drier climate. Water management decisions influenced regulated water allocations (explaining 23% to 52% of the variance) considerably more than unregulated water allocations (explaining 2%). For regulated water allocations, water management decisions and the river system were more important than a plausible change in climate, while for unregulated water allocations, the river system and climate change were dominant drivers. Changing management rules alone could vary long term water allocations by between - 6% and + 0.1% in the Gwydir River and between - 4% and + 22% in the Macquarie River. Management rules which allocated future inflows (i.e. credit model) were more likely to fail in a drying environment with projected reductions in runoff, compared to rules where only water in storage is allocated (i.e. debit model). Management rules differed despite both river systems being governed by a single management agency under the same legislative and policy framework. More systematic approaches to justify water management rules and greater transparency in their influence on water allocations are critical for maximizing the benefits to water users and river health, and for managing risks to water supply in a variable and changing climate.

ID VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION; ENTROPY
AB Regularities exist in fluid flows and can be represented by a set of constants. These constants are functions of the parameter of a probability distribution that exhibits resilience and stability under various flow conditions. Together, these regularities form a network and interact with each other, such that if one is known then the others can be determined from it. The regularities and their network explain the various fluid-flow phenomena and can be used in analysis of rivers and streams. For example, they can be used as the basis to develop simple and efficient methods of discharge measurements as presented herein, which only require velocity sampling at a single point on a water surface or a few points on a single vertical. Because of their simplicity and the short time requirement, these methods can be easily automated for collecting discharge data in unsteady, high flows that are badly needed for real-time flow forecasting and design of flood control structures, and for advancing the fundamental, scientific knowledge in hydrology.

AB In hydrology, the storage-discharge relationship is a fundamental catchment property. Understanding what controls this relationship is at the core of catchment science. To date, there are no direct methods to measure water storage at catchment scales (10(1)-10(3)km(2)). In this study, we use direct measurements of terrestrial water storage dynamics by means of superconducting gravimetry in a small headwater catchment of the Regen River, Germany, to derive empirical storage-discharge relationships in nested catchments of increasing scale. Our results show that the local storage measurements are strongly related to streamflow dynamics at larger scales (> 100km(2); correlation coefficient=0.78-0.81), but at small scale, no such relationship exists (similar to 1km(2); correlation coefficients=-0.11). The geologic setting in the region can explain both the disconnection between local water storage and headwater runoff, and the connectivity between headwater storage and streams draining larger catchment areas. More research is required to understand what controls the form of the observed storage-discharge relationships at the catchment scale. This study demonstrates that high-precision gravimetry can provide new insights into the complex relationship between state and response of hydrological systems.

AB In this paper, a recently deduced flow resistance equation for open channel flow was tested under equilibrium bed-load transport conditions in a rill. First, the flow resistance equation was deduced applying dimensional analysis and the incomplete selfsimilarity condition for the flow velocity distribution. Then, the following steps were carried out for developing the analysis: (a) a relationship (Equation 13) between the G function of the velocity profile, the rill slope, and the Froude number was calibrated by the available measurements by Jiang et al.; (b) a relationship (Equation 17) between the G function, the rill slope, the Shields number, and the Froude number was calibrated by the same measurements; and (c) the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor values measured by Jiang et al. were compared with those calculated by the rill flow resistance equation with G estimated by Equations 13 and 17. This last comparison demonstrated that the rill flow resistance equation, in which slope and Shields number, representative of sediment transport effects, are introduced, is characterized by the lowest values of the estimate errors.

AB Transition of fluid flow from the linear to the nonlinear regime has been confirmed in single rock fractures when the Reynolds number (Re)exceeds some critical values, yet the criterion for such a transition indiscrete fracture networks (DFNs) has received little attention. This study conducted flow tests on crossed fracture models with a single intersection and performed numerical simulations on fluid flow through DFNs of various geometric characteristics. The roles of aperture, surface roughness, and number of intersections of fractures on the variation of the critical hydraulic gradient J(c) for the onset of nonlinear flow through DFNs were systematically investigated. The results showed that the relationship between hydraulic gradient Wand flow rate can be well quantified by Forchheimer's law, when J drops below J(c) it reduces to the widely used cubic law, by diminishing the nonlinear term. Larger apertures, rougher fracture surfaces, and a greater number of intersections in a DFN would result in the onset of nonlinear flow at a lower J(c). Mathematical expressions of J(c) and the coefficients involved in Forchheimer's law were developed based on multi-variable regressions of simulation results, which can help to choose proper governing equations when solving problems associated with fluid flow in fracture networks.

AB We used a combination of diffusion theory and neutron transport simulations to estimate the lateral footprint for a cosmic-ray soil moisture probe. The footprint is radial and can be described by an exponential function. Our theory assumes, and our simulations confirm that the corresponding exponential folding length is closely related to the moderation length in air, which in this work is defined as the average net displacement experienced by neutrons while traveling from the point of emission from soil to the point of detection in air. These simulations indicate that the effective moderation length is 150 m in dry air at sea level, and that this value is fairly constant over a wide range of detection energies-from 10(0) to 10(5) eV. If we define the lateral footprint as the area encompassing two e-fold distances, i.e., the area from which 86% of the recorded neutrons originate, then the footprint diameter is nearly 600 m in dry air. Both theory and simulations indicate that the footprint is inversely proportional to air density and linearly proportional to the height of the sensor above the ground for heights up to 125 m. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that the dependence on soil moisture is small, but the dependence on atmospheric humidity is significant, with a decrease in the footprint diameter of 40 m for every 0.01 kg kg(-1) increase in specific humidity. The good agreement between our theory and transport simulations suggests that the lateral footprint is determined mainly by the properties of air.

AB The relationship between capillary pressure and wetting fluid saturation is one of the most important functions required for the modelling of immiscible displacement within porous media. Commonly, time consuming laboratory experiments or computationally expensive pore-scale numerical simulations are performed to estimate capillary pressure- saturation relationships for a given porous media. In this research, we introduce Analytical Pore-Network Approach (APNA): a new method to forecast capillary pressure-saturation relationships in porous media. APNA is a fully coupled analytical model, that is derived using the concept of Representative Elementary Volume (REV), and underpinned by geometrical analysis of the studied pore network using pore-scale images collected by a range of imaging modalities (e.g. thin section photomicrograph, x-ray micro computed tomography, confocal microscopy, etc.). In comparison to conventional laboratory measurements and numerical simulation techniques, APNA is trivial to implement, and is capable of providing rapid estimates of capillary pressure- saturation relationships for a broad range of porous materials. We validated APNA against empirical capillary pressure- saturation data published in the literature, revealing satisfactory agreement between APNA and the experimental studies.

AB One of the challenges in the design and selection of remediation activities for subsurface contamination is dealing with manifold uncertainties. A scientifically defensible decision process demands consideration of the uncertainties involved. A nonprobabilistic approach based on information gap (info-gap) decision theory is employed to study the robustness of alternative remediation activities. This approach incorporates both parametric and nonparametric (conceptual) uncertainty in predicting contaminant concentrations that are effected by natural processes and the remediation activities. Two remedial scenarios are explored to demonstrate the applicability of the info-gap approach to decision making related to groundwater remediation.

   simulations; Volume of Fluid (VOF) method
ID SURFACE; DYNAMICS; PRESSURE; DRAINAGE
AB In porous media, the dynamics of the invading front between two immiscible fluids is often characterized by abrupt reconfigurations caused by local instabilities of the interface. As a prototype of these phenomena we consider the dynamics of a meniscus in a corner as it can be encountered in angular pores. We investigate this process in detail by means of direct numerical simulations that solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the pore space and employ the Volume of Fluid method (VOF) to track the evolution of the interface. We show that for a quasi-static displacement, the numerically calculated surface energy agrees well with the analytical solutions that we have derived for pores with circular and square cross sections. However, the spontaneous reconfigurations are irreversible and cannot be controlled by the injection rate: they are characterized by the amount of surface energy that is spontaneously released and transformed into kinetic energy. The resulting local velocities can be orders of magnitude larger than the injection velocity and they induce damped oscillations of the interface that possess their own time scales and depend only on fluid properties and pore geometry. In complex media (we consider a network of cubic pores) reconfigurations are so frequent and oscillations last long enough that increasing inertial effects leads to a different fluid distribution by influencing the selection of the next pore to be invaded. This calls into question simple pore-filling rules based only on capillary forces. Also, we demonstrate that inertial effects during irreversible reconfigurations can influence the work done by the external forces that is related to the pressure drop in Darcy's law. This suggests that these phenomena have to be considered when upscaling multiphase flow because local oscillations of the menisci affect macroscopic quantities and modify the constitutive relationships to be used in macro-scale models. These results can be extrapolated to other interface instabilities that are at the origin of fast pore-scale events, such as Haines jumps, snap-off and coalescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Turbulence causes rapid mixing of solutes and fine particles between open channel flow and coarse-grained streambeds. Turbulent mixing is known to control hyporheic exchange fluxes and the distribution of vertical mixing rates in the streambed, but it is unclear how turbulent mixing ultimately influences mass transport at the reach scale. We used a particle-tracking model to simulate local- and reach-scale solute transport for a stream with coarse-grained sediments. Simulations were first used to determine profiles of vertical mixing rates that best described solute concentration profiles measured within a coarse granular bed in flume experiments. These vertical mixing profiles were then used to simulate a pulse solute injection to show the effects of turbulent hyporheic exchange on reach-scale solute transport. Experimentally measured concentrations were best described by simulations with a nonmonotonic mixing profile, with highest mixing at the sediment-water interface and exponential decay into the bed. Reach-scale simulations show that this enhanced interfacial mixing couples in-stream and hyporheic solute transport. Coupling produces an interval of exponential decay in breakthrough curves and delays the onset of power law tailing. High streamwise velocities in the hyporheic zone reduce mass recovery in the water column and cause breakthrough curves to exhibit steeper power law slopes than predictions from mobile-immobile modeling theory. These results demonstrate that transport models must consider the spatial variability of streamwise velocity and vertical mixing for both the stream and the hyporheic zone, and new analytical theory is needed to describe reach-scale transport when high streamwise velocities are present in the hyporheic zone.

TI Assessment of the two relaxation time Lattice-Boltzmann scheme to
   simulate Stokes flow in porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPORT; MODELS; ERRORS
AB The recent advances in 3-D imaging of porous structures have generated a tremendous interest in the simulation of complex single and two-phase flows. Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) schemes present a powerful tool to solve the flow field directly from the binarized 3-D images. However, as viscosity often plays an important role, the LB scheme should correctly treat viscosity effects. This is the case using a LB scheme with two relaxation times (TRT) unlike the broadly used, the single-relaxation rate, BGK, where the velocity of the modeled fluid does not vary as the inverse of the viscosity applying the bounce-back (no-slip) boundary rule. The aim of this work is to apply the LB-TRT approach to different types of porous media (straight channels, 2-D model porous media, sandstone) to solve for the flow field and to evaluate the approach in terms of parameter dependence, error and convergence time on the basis of permeability. We show that the variation of permeability with the free relaxation parameter L of the TRT scheme depends on the heterogeneity of the sample and on the numerical resolution. The convergence time depends on the applied viscosity and the parameter standing for the speed of sound, thus the computation time can be reduced by choosing appropriate values of those parameters. Two approaches to calculate permeability (Darcy's law and viscous energy dissipation) are proposed and investigated. We recommend to use Darcy's law, as dependence on L is less important. Periodic (in the presence of a driving body force) and pressure boundary conditions are evaluated in terms of the results.

TI Forchheimer flow in gently sloping layers: Application to drainage of
   porous asphalt
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RUNOFF; EQUATION; DARCIAN
AB This paper presents analytical solutions for the problem of steady one-dimensional Forchheimer flow in an unconfined layer. The study's motivation is the drainage behavior of a highway pavement called permeable friction course. Permeable friction course is a layer of porous asphalt placed on top of impermeable pavement. Porous overlays are growing in popularity because they reduce noise, mitigate the hazards of wet weather driving, and produce cleaner runoff. Several of these benefits occur because water drains within the pavement rather than on the road surface. Drainage from the friction course is essentially that of an unconfined aquifer and has been successfully modeled using Darcy's law and the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions. Under certain cases, drainage may occur outside of the range where Darcy's law applies. The purpose of this paper is to identify cases where the assumption of Darcy flow is violated, develop analytical solutions based on Forchheimer's equation, and compare the solutions with those obtained for the Darcy case. The principle assumptions used in this analysis are that the relationship between hydraulic gradient and specific discharge is quadratic in nature (Forchheimer's equation) and that the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions apply. Comparing the Darcy and Forchheimer solutions leads to a new criterion for assessing the applicability of Darcy's law termed the discharge ratio.

   CONCEPTUALIZATION
AB Investigating the spatio-temporal variability of streamflow generation is fundamental to interpret the hydrological and biochemical functioning of catchments. In humid temperate environments, streamflow generation is often linked to the occurrence of near stream surface saturated areas, which mediate hydrological connectivity between hillslopes and streams. In this second contribution of a series of two papers, we used salt dilution gauging to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of streamflow in different subcatchments and for different reaches in the Weierbach catchment (0.42 km(2)) and explored the topographical controls on streamflow variability. Moreover, we mapped stream network expansion and contraction dynamics. Finally, we combined the information on the spatio-temporal variability of streamflow with the characterization of riparian surface saturation dynamics of seven different areas within the catchment (mapped with thermal infrared imagery, as presented in our first manuscript). We found heterogeneities in the streamflow contribution from different portions of the catchment. Although the size of the contributing area could explain differences in subcatchments' and reaches' net discharge, no clear topographic controls could be found when considering the area-normalized discharge. This suggests that some local conditions exert control on the variability of specific discharge (e.g., local bedrock characteristics and occurrence of perennial springs). Stream network dynamics were found not to be very responsive to changes in catchment's discharge (i.e., total active stream length vs. stream outlet discharge relationship could be described through a power law function with exponent = 0.0195). On the contrary, surface saturation dynamics were found to be in agreement with the level of streamflow contribution from the correspondent reach in some of the investigated riparian areas. This study represents an example of how the combination of different techniques can be used to characterize the internal heterogeneity of the catchment and thus improve our understanding of how hydrological connectivity is established and streamflow is generated.

TI Numerical simulation of dune-flat bed transition and stage-discharge
   relationship with hysteresis effect
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW; RESISTANCE; TRANSPORT; LOAD
AB This work presents recent advances on morphodynamic modeling of bed forms under unsteady discharge. This paper includes further development of a morphodynamic model proposed earlier by Giri and Shimizu (2006a). This model reproduces the temporal development of river dunes and accurately replicates the physical properties associated with bed form evolution. Model results appear to provide accurate predictions of bed form geometry and form drag over bed forms for arbitrary steady flows. However, accurate predictions of temporal changes of form drag are key to the prediction of stage-discharge relation during flood events. Herein, the model capability is extended to replicate the dune-flat bed transition, and in turn, the variation of form drag produced by the temporal growth or decay of bed forms under unsteady flow conditions. Some numerical experiments are performed to analyze hysteresis of the stage-discharge relationship caused by the transition between dune and flat bed regimes during rising and falling stages of varying flows. The numerical model successfully simulates dune-flat bed transition and the associated hysteresis of the stage-discharge relationship; this is in good agreement with physical observations but has been treated in the past only using empirical methods. A hypothetical relationship for a sediment parameter (the mean step length) is proposed to a first level of approximation that enables reproduction of the dune-flat bed transition. The proposed numerical model demonstrates its ability to address an important practical problem associated with bed form evolution and flow resistance in varying flows.

AB Local cubic law (LCL) is one of the most commonly applied physical laws for flow in single fractures (SF) and fractured media. The foundation of LCL is Darcianflow. This experimental study examines if LCL is valid for flow in a single rough fracture and how the fracture roughness and Reynolds number (Re) affect flow. Similar to the Moody diagram for flow in pipes, a diagram for flow in a single rough fracture has been generated to relate the friction coefficient with Re and the roughness. Under the experimental condition of this study, flow appears to be substantially different from Darcian flow. The flow law of q alpha e(n)J(m) appears to be valid for describing the flow scheme where q, e, and J are the unit width flux, the average aperture, and the hydraulic gradient. The value of the power index m is found to be around 0.83 similar to 0.98, less than what has been used in Darcian flow (m D 1). The power index n is around 11.2 and 13.0, much greater than the n value used in the LCL (n D 3), and it increases with the average velocity. The Moody type of diagram shows that the friction factor for flow in SFs is influenced by Re and the roughness. It decreases with Re when Re is small, and becomes less sensitive to Re when Re is large enough. It also increases with the roughness. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Miller-Miller similar media theory is widely applied to characterize the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties. For a group of soils, a distinct scaling factor is commonly assigned to each individual soil to coalesce the soil water characteristic and hydraulic conductivity functions to single curves. It is generally assumed that the Miller-Miller theory is valid as long as soils are similar either with regard to their microscopic pore space geometry or the closely related macroscopic soil hydraulic functions. In this paper, it is illustrated that similarity is not the sole required condition for validity of the Miller-Miller theory. In addition, the interrelation between the soil water characteristic and the hydraulic conductivity functions considered for scaling need to be comparable. The interrelation is dependent not only on the pore space geometry, but also on solid-liquid interactions. Hence similar interrelation cannot be concluded from similarity of microscopic pore space geometry. A dimensionless parameter termed the joint scaling factor was defined and applied to evaluate the soundness of the interrelation condition for 26 soils from the UNSODA database that were grouped into six classes of similar soils. Obtained results clearly reveal the crucial importance of the interrelation condition for the Miller-Miller scaling theory, which has been hidden behind the similarity requirement, and contradict the general belief that Miller-Miller scaling is valid as long as soils are similar.

TI Comment on Two Papers About the Generalized Complementary Evaporation
   Relationships by Crago et al.
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
AB Crago et al. published two papers in Water Resources Research in 2016 and 2018, respectively, which discussed recent generalized complementary evaporation relationships; they recommended that the lower boundary condition of the Generalized Nonlinear Advection-Aridity (GNAA) model proposed by Brutsaert (2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017720) should be modified to y = 0 at x = x(min), where x(min) is an element of[0,1]. First, it is shown herein that the rescaled complementary relationship (CR) y = X, proposed by Crago et al., does not advance the analysis forward, but that instead the rescaling is tantamount to a reversion to an earlier linear and more traditional asymmetric complementary model, in which the parameter b is a function of x(min). In fact, at x(min) = 0, y = X the rescaled formulation becomes physically unrealistic. The second part of this comment deals with the extended quartic form of GNAA model. The nature of the adjustable parameter c in this extended formulation is further explored, and it is shown that while its lower limit is -1, calibration with actual data can result in values in excess of 2. Such calibration allows then the estimation of x(min) as a function of c, that is, x(min) = f (c). This way, in addition to satisfying the original four boundary conditions, the extended GNAA model also satisfies the boundary condition of y = 0 at x = x(min). The physical variables affecting the nature of the parameter c and its relationship with E-po/E-pmax will require further investigation.

AB Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and concentrations of salts in surface water bodies can be affected by the natural environment and local human activities such as surface and ground water withdrawals, land use and energy extraction, and variability and long-term trends in atmospheric conditions including temperature and precipitation. Here, we quantify the relationship between 121 indicators of mean and extreme temperature and precipitation and 24 water quality parameters in 57 Texas reservoirs using observational data records covering the period 1960 to 2010. Over time scales ranging from 1week to 2years, we find that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, chloride, sulfate, and phosphorus all show consistent correlations with atmospheric predictors, including high and low temperature extremes, dry days, heavy precipitation events, and mean temperature and precipitation. Based on these relationships combined with regional climate projections, we expect climate change to increase water temperatures, decrease dissolved oxygen levels, decrease pH, increase specific conductance, and increase levels of sulfate and chloride in Texas reservoirs. Over decadal time scales, this may affect aquatic ecosystems in the reservoirs, including altering the risk of conditions conducive to algae occurrence, as well as affecting the quality of water available for human consumption and recreation.

DE Improved dynamic programming; Monotonic dependence relationship; State
   transitions; Parallel reservoir system
ID POLICIES; MODELS; RULES; MANAGEMENT
AB Optimizing a multi-reservoir system is challenging due to the problem of the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, rule-based improved dynamic programming (RIDP) and stochastic dynamic programming (RISDP) algorithms for the optimal operation of a system with a number of parallel reservoirs are proposed to alleviate the dimensionality problem. The improvement is based on a key property: the monotonic dependence relationship between individual reservoir carryover storage and system water availability, which is derived with the assumption of the non-decreasing storage distribution characteristic of a parallel reservoir system. Furthermore, a diagnosis procedure is employed to remove infeasible state transitions, which enables the application of the monotonic relationship within the feasible solution space. In general, the computational complexity of (NS)(n2) from DP can be reduced to (NS)(n) from RIDP (NS is the number of storage discretization for individual reservoirs, n is the number of reservoirs in a parallel system), with controlled solution accuracy. The improved algorithms are applied to a real-world parallel reservoir system in northeastern China. The results demonstrate the computational efficiency and effectiveness of RIDP and RISDP.

AB Cooperative game theory solutions can provide useful insights into how parties may use water and environmental resources and share any benefits of cooperation. Here, a method based on Nash and Nash-Harsanyi bargaining solutions is developed to explore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing process, in which owners of non-federal hydropower projects in the United States have to negotiate their allowable operations, with other interest groups (mainly environmental). Linkage of games to expand the feasible solution range and the "strategic loss" concept are discussed and a FERC relicensing bargaining model is developed for studying the bargaining stage (third stage) of the relicensing process. Based on the suggested solution method, how the lack of incentive for cooperation results in long delay in FERC relicensing in practice is explained. Further, potential effects of climate change on the FERC relicensing are presented and how climate change may provide an incentive for cooperation among the parties to hasten the relicensing is discussed. An "adaptive FERC license" framework is proposed, based on cooperative game theory, to improve the performance and adaptability of the system to future changes with no cost to the FERC, in face of uncertainty about future hydrological and ecological conditions.

AB The basis for all knowledge is "information" that we compile about the world, expressed through models that support understanding, prediction, and decision making. This overview paper provides a contextual basis for the four papers that make up the "debate series" compiled under the above title. We briefly introduce Information Theory, discuss how "information" can be considered to be both a "physical" quantity and a "probabilistic" basis for representing incompleteness in knowledge, discuss the core motivation for this debate series, and briefly summarize the major arguments advanced by each of the debate papers. Our purpose is to facilitate an understanding of how these papers are related and how they approach the debate series question from different perspectives, while pointing to future directions for research. Finally, we invite further discourse and debate to advance the understanding and prediction of natural system dynamics using Information Theory, including the assessment of its limitations and complementarity to existing physics and machine learning approaches. Ultimately, our goal is to press for the development of philosophical and methodological advances that will enable the Earth science community to address some of the compelling unsolved problems in our field.

AB Many porous media in which we determine water content are aggregated and characterized by a dual-porosity pore network, composed of interaggregate pores and intra-aggregate pores. This paper reports sample-scale permittivity measurements made in four stable aggregate media with dual porosity. Results indicate two distinct dielectric responses depending on whether the aggregates are surrounded by water or air. We relate transitions in the permittivity response to the water retention characteristic (WRC), showing that after the interaggregate pores have drained, the slope of the water content permittivity relationship is significantly reduced (permittivity values ranging from 5 to 7). The hydraulic critical water content (theta(hc)) is defined as the point where all the interaggregate pores are air filled and all the intra-aggregate pores are water saturated and is determined from the WRC. The dielectric critical water content (theta(dc)) is defined as the point where a slope change in the measured water content-permittivity relationship occurs. A two-step model is presented and designed to capture the physical characteristics of the permittivity response to drainage. Measurements of theta(hc) and theta(dc) reveal a separation in these two values. The difference is considered to be a function of the connectivity of the intra-aggregate pore network. A connectivity ratio is defined as 1-(theta(dc)/theta(hc)), where values close to 0 indicate low connectivity between the intra-aggregate pores and values tending to 1 indicate a high level of connectivity. Results from this work indicate that the reduced permittivity response measured in the water content-permittivity relationship is due to microstructure and phase configuration and not to "bound'' water.

AB River deltas display a wide range of morphologic patterns that influence how nutrients interact in channels and wetlands on their way to the coast. To quantify the role of delta morphology on nitrate fate, we simulated reactive nitrate transport over steady base flow conditions for six synthetic, morphologically unique river-dominated deltas created in Delft3D by varying incoming grain size distributions. We parameterized nitrate removal kinetics using an observed relationship with elevation from Wax Lake Delta (Louisiana, USA). Total nitrate retention across the six synthetic deltas and Wax Lake Delta ranged from 1.3%-13%, suggesting that these river-dominated deltas have limited ability to remove nitrate from incoming river water. Nitrate removal is constrained by limited hydrologic connectivity with the areas of greatest nitrate demand, which are found at higher elevation. In these synthetic numerical experiments, the efficiency of nitrate removal is greatest for deltas with more topologic complexity and greater proportions of the delta plain at higher elevation, which are both common characteristics of coarser-grained deltas. The positive relationship between grain size and nitrate removal may help guide land reclamation projects if project goals include minimizing nitrate export to the sea.

ID ANNUAL FLOW SERIES
AB Two parameters of importance in hydrological droughts viz. the longest duration, L-T and the largest severity, S-T (in standardized form) over a desired return period, T years, have been analysed for monthly flow sequences of Canadian rivers. An important point in the analysis is that monthly sequences are non-stationary (periodic-stochastic) as against annual flows, which fulfil the conditions of stochastic stationarity. The parameters mean, mu, standard deviation, sigma (or coefficient of variation), lagl serial correlation, rho, and skewness, gamma (which is helpful in identifying the probability distribution function) of annual flow sequences, when used in the analytical relationships, are able to predict expected values of the longest duration, E(L-T) in years and the largest standardized severity, E(S-T). For monthly flow sequences, there are 12 sets of these parameters and thus the issue is how to involve these parameters to derive the estimates of E(L-T) and E(S-T). Moreover, the truncation level (i.e. the monthly mean value) varies from month to month. The analysis in this paper demonstrates that the drought analysis on an annual basis can be extended to monthly droughts simply by standardizing the flows for each month. Thus, the variable truncation levels corresponding to the mean monthly flows were transformed into one unified truncation level equal to zero. The runs of deficits in the standardized sequences are treated as drought episodes and thus the theory of runs forms an essential tool for analysis. Estimates of the above parameters (denoted as mu(av), sigma(av), rho(av), and gamma(av)) for use in the analytical relationships were obtained by averaging 12 monthly values for each parameter. The product- and L-moment ratio analyses indicated that the monthly flows in the Canadian rivers fit the gamma probability distribution reasonably well, which resulted in the satisfactory prediction of E(L-T). However, the prediction of E(S-T) tended to be more satisfactory with the assumption of a Markovian normal model and the relationship E(S-T) approximate to E(L-T) was observed to perform better.

AB Flow through rock fractures is frequently represented using models that correct the cubic law to account for the effects of roughness and contact area. However, the scope of such models is often restricted to relatively smooth aperture fields under small confining stresses. This work studies the link between fracture permeability and fracture geometry under normal loads. Numerical experiments are performed to deform synthesized aperture fields of various correlation lengths and roughness values under normal stress. The results demonstrate that aperture roughness can more than triple for applied stresses up to 50 MPa - exceeding the valid range for roughness in most previously published models. Investigating the relationship between permeability and contact area indicates that the increase in flow obstructions due to the development of new contact points strongly depends on the correlation length of the unloaded aperture field. This study eliminates these dependencies by employing a parameter known as the No-Flow Fraction (NFF) to capture the effect of flow stagnation zones. With this concept, a new Cubic-law-based permeability model is proposed that significantly improves the accuracy of permeability estimations, compared to previous models. For cases, where the NFF is difficult to obtain, we introduce an empirical relationship to estimate the parameter from the aperture roughness. The new models yield permeability estimates accurate to within a factor of 2 of the simulated permeability in over three-quarters of the 3,000 deformed fractures studied. This compares with typical deviations of at least one order of magnitude for previously published permeability models.

AB While it is known that farmers adopt different decision-making behaviors to cope with stresses, it remains challenging to capture this diversity in formal model frameworks that are used to advance theory and inform policy. Guided by cognitive theory and the theory of bounded rationality, this research develops a novel, socio-hydrological model framework that can explore how a farmer's perception of water availability impacts crop choice and water allocation. The model is informed by a rich empirical data set at the household level collected during 2013 in Kenya's Upper Ewaso Ng'iro basin that shows that the crop type cultivated is correlated with water availability. The model is able to simulate this pattern and shows that near-optimal or satisficing crop patterns can emerge also when farmers were to make use of simple decision rules and have diverse perceptions on water availability. By focusing on farmer decision making it also captures the rebound effect, i.e., as additional water becomes available through the improvement of crop efficiencies it will be reallocated on the farm instead of flowing downstream, as a farmer will adjust his (her) water allocation and crop pattern to the new water conditions. This study is valuable as it is consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, and thus offers an alternative, descriptive model in addition to normative models. The framework can be used to understand the potential impact of climate change on the socio-hydrological system, to simulate and test various assumptions regarding farmer behavior and to evaluate policy interventions.

AB Systematic experimental deviations from theoretical predictions derived for water retention characteristics of fractal porous media have previously been interpreted in terms of continuum percolation theory (at low moisture contents, below the critical volume fraction of waters alpha(c) capillary flow ceases). In other work, continuum percolation theory was applied to find the hydraulic conductivity as a function of saturation for saturations high enough to guarantee percolation of capillary flow. Now these two problems are further linked, using percolation theory to estimate non-equilibrium water retention at matric potential values such that the equilibrium water content is too low for percolation of capillary flow paths. In particular, a procedure for developing a time-dependent moisture content is developed for experimental time scales long enough that film flow can provide an alternate mechanism for equilibrating when continuous capillary flow is not possible. The time scales are defined in terms of moisture-dependent length scales and film flow and capillary flow hydraulic conductivities. Imbibition is treated in the extreme case of no film-flow contribution to equilibration. In another application at higher matric potentials, recursive relations are derived for the water content of porous media during drying when external pressures are changed at rates too rapid for equilibrium to be attained by capillary flow.

AB Rock pore geometry has heterogeneous characteristics and is scale dependent. This feature in a geological formation differs significantly from artificial materials and makes it difficult to predict hydrologic and elastic properties. To characterize pore heterogeneity, we propose an evaluation method that exploits the recently developed persistent homology theory. In the proposed method, complex pore geometry is first represented as sphere cloud data using a pore-network extraction method. Then, a persistence diagram (PD) is calculated from the point cloud, which represents the spatial distribution of pore bodies. A new parameter (distance index H) derived from the PD is proposed to characterize the degree of rock heterogeneity. Low H value indicates high heterogeneity. A new empirical equation using this index H is proposed to predict the effective elastic modulus of porous media. The results indicate that the proposed PD analysis is very efficient for extracting topological feature of pore geometry.

AB Despite many efforts to develop evapotranspiration (ET) models with improved parametrizations of resistance terms for water vapor transfer into the atmosphere, estimates of ET and its partitioning remain prone to bias. Much of this bias could arise from inadequate representations of physical interactions near nonuniform surfaces from which localized heat and water vapor fluxes emanate. This study aims to provide a mechanistic bridge from land-surface characteristics to vertical transport predictions, and proposes a new physically based ET model that builds on a recently developed bluff-rough bare soil evaporation model incorporating coupled soil moisture-atmospheric controls. The newly developed ET model explicitly accounts for (1) near-surface turbulent interactions affecting soil drying and (2) soil-moisture-dependent stomatal responses to atmospheric evaporative demand that influence leaf (and canopy) transpiration. Model estimates of ET and its partitioning were in good agreement with available field-scale data, and highlight hidden processes not accounted for by commonly used ET schemes. One such process, non-linear vegetation-induced turbulence (as a function of vegetation stature and cover fraction) significantly influences ET-soil moisture relationships. Our results are particularly important for water resources and land use planning of semiarid sparsely vegetated ecosystems where soil surface interactions are known to play a critical role in land-climate interactions. This study potentially facilitates a mathematically tractable description of the strength (i.e., the slope) of the ET-soil moisture relationship, which is a core component of models that seek to predict land-atmosphere coupling and its feedback to the climate system in a changing climate.
   Plain Language Summary Being located in the transitional zone between dry and wet climate areas, semiarid ecosystems (and their associated ecohydrological processes) play a critical role in controlling climate change and global warming. Land evapotranspiration (ET), which is a central process in the climate system, typically accounts for up to 95% of the water budget in these regions. Thus, the manner in which ET is partitioned into soil evaporation and plant transpiration in semiarid areas is of practical importance for water and carbon cycling and their feedbacks to the climate system. ET (and its partitioning) in semiarid ecosystems is primarily controlled by surface soil moisture which varies episodically under stochastic precipitation inputs. Important as the ET-soil moisture relationship is, it remains empirical, and physical mechanisms governing its nature and dynamics are underexplored. This study aims to deepen our mechanistic understanding of hidden (subgrid-scale) mechanisms such as vegetation-induced turbulence that strongly influences soil evaporation and thus ET dynamics. Our results facilitate a mathematically tractable description of the strength (i.e., the slope) of the ET-soil moisture relationship, which is a core component of models that seek to predict land-climate feedback processes in a changing climate.

AB Complex subsurface flow dynamics impact the storage, routing, and transport of water and solutes to streams in headwater catchments. Many of these hydrogeologic processes are indirectly reflected in observations of stream chemistry responses to rain events, also known as concentration-discharge (CQ) relations. Identifying the relative importance of subsurface flows to stream CQ relationships is often challenging in headwater environments due to spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, this study combines a diverse set of methods, including tracer injection tests, cation exchange experiments, geochemical analyses, and numerical modeling, to map groundwater-surface water interactions along a first-order, sandstone stream (Garner Run) in the Appalachian Mountains of central Pennsylvania. The primary flow paths to the stream include preferential flow through the unsaturated zone ("interflow"), flow discharging from a spring, and groundwater discharge. Garner Run stream inherits geochemical signatures from geochemical reactions occurring along each of these flow paths. In addition to end-member mixing effects on CQ, we find that the exchange of solutes, nutrients, and water between the hyporheic zone and the main stream channel is a relevant control on the chemistry of Garner Run. CQ relationships for Garner Run were compared to prior results from a nearby headwater catchment overlying shale bedrock (Shale Hills). At the sandstone site, solutes associated with organo-mineral associations in the hyporheic zone influence CQ, while CQ trends in the shale catchment are affected by preferential flow through hillslope swales. The difference in CQ trends document how the lithology and catchment hydrology control CQ relationships.
   Plain Language Summary Stream chemistry serves as a fingerprint for the processes that occur in the critical zone, which extends from unweathered bedrock to the top of the tree canopy. The critical zone thus includes all resources critical to life. This paper evaluates chemical and physical processes in the critical zone, specifically in soils, streams, and groundwater. Our work suggests the important influence of groundwater-surface water interactions on mountain streams with an emphasis on the transport of water and solutes through the streambed. By comparing these transport processes on sandstone and shale, we hypothesize that the type of rock underlying a watershed can influence the relative importance of groundwater-surface water interactions on stream chemistry.

The WRC model of Brooks and Corey is a widely used empirical, easy to derive but discontinuous expression that introduces the pore size distribution index, lambda, and Mualem's approach is widely used to predict the RHC in terms of the WRC. When this approach is applied to the Brooks and Corey expression, the prediction of the RHC depends solely on lambda. The present study used measured hydraulic functions of a wide range of soil types to derive parameter equivalence between the parameters psi(c) and lambda of the Brooks and Corey expression and the parameters xi and mu of the continuous expression that results from the WRC model of Assouline et al. Strong relationships were found between mu and lambda and between xi and (psi(-lambda)(c)). Also, it was found that lambda is inversely proportional to the coefficient of variation, epsilon, of the WRC. On the basis of a previous relationship between the parameter eta in the RHC model of Assouline and epsilon a relationship between lambda and eta is derived. This leads to a new simple expression for the prediction of the RHC.

AB A theory of pressure sensor response in snow is derived and used to examine the sources of measurement errors in snow water equivalent (SWE) pressure sensors. Measurement errors in SWE are caused by differences in the compressibility of the pressure sensor and the adjacent snow layer, which produces a shear stress along the perimeter of the sensor. When the temperature at the base of the snow cover equals 0degreesC, differences in the snowmelt rate between the snow-SWE sensor interface and the adjacent snow-soil interface may also produce a shear stress along the sensor's perimeter. This shear stress perturbs the pressure field over the sensor, producing SWE measurement errors. Snow creep acts to reduce shear stresses along the SWE sensor's perimeter at a rate that is inversely proportional to the snow viscosity. For sustained periods of differential snowmelt, a difference in the mass of snow over the sensor compared with the surrounding soil will develop, producing additional permanent errors in SWE measurements. The theory indicates that SWE pressure sensor performance can be improved by designing a sensor with a high Young's modulus (low compressibility), low aspect ratio, large diameter and thermal properties that match those of the surrounding soil. Simulations of SWE pressure sensor errors using the theory are in close agreement with observed errors and may provide a means to correct historical SWE measurements for use in hydrological hindcast or climate studies.

AB Several geomorphological fluvial features are able to induce hyporheic exchange between the rivers and the alluvial sediments. However, while the small-scale exchange induced by bed forms has been thoroughly investigated, the role of the larger features remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the hyporheic flows driven by the channel sinuosity in the intrameander zone. A physically based model is adopted to simulate the morphodynamic evolution of three different meandering rivers, from the first stages of the meander evolution until the incipient meander cutoff. For each stage, the sinuosity-driven intrameander hyporheic flow is computed. In this way, the hyporheic flow field, the fluxes exchanged with the river, and the residence times are described during the whole meander evolution. The main result concerns the existence of a remarkable zonation induced by the flow field in the intrameander zone. The more the meander evolves, the more the zonation becomes pronounced, and the probability distribution of the residence times shows a bimodal shape with an intermediate power law behavior. Some general rules governing the typical timescales of the intrameander hyporheic flow and the mean exchanged flux are also deduced.

TI Relationships among air-water interfacial area, capillary pressure, and
   water saturation for a sandy porous medium
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID PORE; TRANSPORT; FLOW
AB [1] The relationships among air-water interfacial area, capillary pressure, and water saturation were investigated for a sandy, natural porous medium. Air-water interfacial areas as a function of water saturation were measured using two methods, gas phase partitioning tracer tests and synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The tracer test method provides a measure of effective total ( capillary and film) interfacial area, whereas microtomography can be used to determine both capillary-associated and total areas ( the latter is the focus of this study). Air-water interfacial areas determined with both methods increased continuously with decreasing water saturation. The areas measured with the tracer test method were significantly larger than those obtained from microtomography. The maximum values measured with the tracer test method approached the N-2/BET-measured specific solid surface area, whereas the maximum values measured by microtomography approached the smooth-sphere-calculated specific solid surface area. The interfacial area-saturation data were combined with capillary pressure-saturation data obtained from water drainage experiments to examine the relationship between total air-water interfacial area and capillary pressure. Air-water interfacial area was observed to increase monotonically with increasing capillary pressure and then to plateau at values that correspond to areas associated with residual water saturation. These results are consistent with previously reported theoretically and computationally based analyses of functional relationships between total nonwetting-wetting interfacial area and capillary pressure.

AB Chemical reactions may be simulated without regard to local concentrations by applying simple probabilistic rules of particle interaction and combination. The forward reaction A + B -> C is coded by calculating the probability that any A and B particles will occupy the same volume over some time interval. This becomes a convolution of the location densities of the two particles. The backward reaction is a simple exponential decay of C particles into A and B particles. When the mixing of reactants is not a limiting process, the classical thermodynamic reaction rates are reproduced. When low mixing (as by diffusion) limits the reaction probabilities, the reaction rates drop significantly, including the rate of approach to global equilibrium. At long enough times, the law of mass action is reproduced exactly in the mean, with some irreducible deviation in the local equilibrium saturations (the equilibrium constant divided by the mass action expression) away from unity. The saturation variability is not sensitive to numerical parameters but depends strongly on how far from equilibrium the system is initiated. This is simply due to a relative paucity of particles of some species as the reaction moves far to one side or the other.

AB While lake and reservoir abundance has been correlated to size, water inflow has not been linked to the volume or area of water bodies. We therefore investigated relationships between water depth, surface area, volume and inflow for four categories of water bodies: unregulated lakes, regulated lakes, reservoirs and a combination of unregulated lakes and seas. Data on the physical dimensions of the water bodies (n = 652) were selected from databases and literature. To facilitate interpretation, the empirical regressions derived were compared with a theoretical framework comprising a minimum of equations with independently derived parameter values.
   All empirical regressions were highly significant (p < 0.0001) and, with exception of some correlations for reservoirs, explained a large fraction (r(2) > 0.6) of the variability. The analysis showed that overall patterns in natural systems can be represented by cones or troughs with near-uniform scaling, supporting the model and parameter assumptions made. Water inflow in lakes scaled geometrically to catchment size, lake surface area and lake volume. Seas fitted into the patterns observed for lakes, but size scaling of man-made reservoirs was different.
   Inflow increased with lake size at exponents that were opposite to those previously reported for lake abundance. Combining the relationships for inflow and abundance, a water equivalency hypothesis was postulated. While water can flow into a few large or many small lakes, it is suggested that, within a region, the total amount of water flowing into all lakes of a given size is independent of that size, similar to the energy equivalence rule in ecology.

AB The definition of potential evaporation remains widely debated despite its centrality for hydrologic and climatic models. We employed an analytical pore-scale representation of evaporation from terrestrial surfaces to define potential evaporation using a hypothetical steady state reference temperature that is common to both air and evaporating surface. The feedback between drying land surfaces and overlaying air properties, central in the Bouchet (1963) complementary relationship, is implicitly incorporated in the hypothetical steady state where the sensible heat flux vanishes and the available energy is consumed by evaporation. Evaporation rates predicted based on the steady state reference temperature hypothesis were in good agreement with class A pan evaporation measurements suggesting that evaporation from pans occurs with negligible sensible heat flux. The model facilitates a new generalization of the asymmetric complementary relationship with the asymmetry parameter b analytically predicted for a wide range of meteorological conditions with initial tests yielding good agreement between measured and predicted actual evaporation.

DE rainfall; interception; raindrop size distribution; scaling
ID 2-LAYER STOCHASTIC-MODEL
AB In a series of three articles Calder, Hall and colleagues have recently presented an extension of Calder's original stochastic model of rainfall interception. In their model, the dependence of rainfall interception on raindrop size is explicitly taken into account. All raindrops are assumed to have the same characteristic size, the so-called median-volume raindrop diameter D-0, which is taken to be a power law function of the rain rate R. However, the D-0-R relationship used in their model results from an erroneous interpretation of the general theory of the raindrop size distribution recently proposed by Sempere Torres and colleagues. As a result, this relationship is not consistent with the postulated underlying raindrop size distribution. Moreover, it seriously underestimates D-0 for a given R as compared to the consistently derived D-0-R relationships and to the D-0-R relationship reported in a classical article on the subject of raindrop size distributions. This may seriously affect the model results presented by Calder, Hall and colleagues. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (HC) is one of the most challenging problems in soil science. Here, we propose a novel approach to model HC using percolation theory. Transient behavior of water transport phenomena at low moisture contents requires additional physical process representation, beside capillary conductivity, to ensure accurate prediction of unsaturated HC. We augment the capillary model from percolation theory with two additional components, namely, (1) film flow, which is the product of volumetric flow rate per perimeter by specific perimeter of solid particles, and (2) isothermal vapor HC, derived from the Fick's law of vapor diffusion and relative humidity. The fractal characteristics of last fractal regime are used to model tortuosity and ultimately HC of vapor flow. Since the typical pressure head range of universal scaling from percolation theory is analogous to the range of vapor flow, we demonstrate that the universal scaling presented in previous studies is not sufficient to model HC for water contents below a crossover point. We also, by analyzing the scaled water retention properties, demonstrate that most studied soils exhibit three fractal regimes. Therefore, a piecewise HC function of capillary flow is developed to account for three fractal regimes, providing more flexibility for soils with multimodal characteristics. The proposed joint HC function is more accurate compared to the model of Peters-Durner-Iden and predecessor percolation theory models.

AB Reach-scale at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) relationships are power laws that describe variations of reach-averaged water depth, wetted width, and current velocity in stream reaches when discharge varies. Modeling AHG exponents is important, because the variations of hydraulics with discharge in stream networks influence physical habitats of aquatic species, biodiversity, water temperature, nutrient fluxes, and sediment transport. Theoretical approaches indicated that AHG exponents should depend on topographic descriptors of cross sections and roughness elements. Empirical approaches suggested that AHG exponents partly depend on hydraulic characteristics measured at a single discharge. We used a unique data set of AHG observed in 812 stream reaches (obtained from measurements at several discharge rates or from hydrodynamic models) to (1) test the consistency of theoretical and empirical predictions of AHG exponents and (2) test the generality of AHG predictions across rivers of different countries with variable landscape settings. We found that observed AHG depended on topographic predictors (describing cross-section shape and substrate size) as expected from theory. However, AHG exponents were better predicted by empirical hydraulic characteristics of reaches: the ratio of wetted width to bankfull width and the reach Froude number. The effects of hydraulic variables were consistent with those of topographic predictors. In addition, relations between AHG and hydraulic predictors were significant and with similar direction in different data sets. Despite limited explanatory power, our results help identifying general drivers of AHG exponents. Their application still requires measurements at a single discharge rate but open perspectives of generalized AHG prediction by remote sensing.

AB Permeability of a streambed is an important factor regulating nutrient and oxygen availability for aquatic biota. In order to investigate the relationship, an accurate permeability should be measured. However, it is difficult to measure permeability in a coarse gravel bed using a conventional permeability test. Moreover, turbulent flow may occur in coarse bed material, and then deviations from Darcy's law do occur. Thus, permeability calculated following Darcy's law may be overestimated under turbulent flow conditions and should be corrected. The packer test can be used in highly permeable gravel beds. We developed a field method applicable to a gravel bed using the packer test and derived an equation adopting a law of turbulent flow to study the problems under any type of flow condition. The accuracy of the equation was examined using a laboratory flume with a gravel bed. The results suggested that permeability calculated from Hvorslev's equation is overestimated for turbulent flow. In contrast, our equation, developed here, could evaluate permeability accurately under any type of flow condition. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper introduces the papers in the "Debates-Stochastic Subsurface Hydrology from Theory to Practice'' series. Beginning in the 1970s, the field of stochastic subsurface hydrology has been an active field of research, with over 3500 journal publications, of which over 850 have appeared in Water Resources Research. We are fortunate to have insightful contributions from four groups of distinguished authors who discuss the reasons why the advanced research framework established in stochastic subsurface hydrology has not impacted the practice of groundwater flow and transport modeling and design significantly. There is reasonable consensus that a community effort aimed at developing "toolboxes'' for applications of stochastic methods will make them more accessible and encourage practical applications.

AB Hyporheic flow transports fine particles into the riverbed, which can lead to clogging of the bed and in turn affect hyporheic flow and exchange processes. Field measurements and numerical simulations show the formation of a low-permeability layer (LPL) near the bed surface due to fine particle clogging, and consequently reduction of exchange fluxes between the bed and river water. A characteristic porosity (epsilon*) and time scale were derived to quantify the clogging process and effects on transport. Both the exchange flux and mean solute residence time were found to follow a power law relationship with epsilon*. For the normalized particle exchange flux, the exponent is close to unity, i.e., a linear relationship with epsilon*. The results also showed significant effects of the fine particle concentration, pressure difference, sediment collision efficiency and fine particle diameter on the bed clogging. Large values of these parameters led to intensified clogging, with the formation of different types of LPL.

TI Scale dependence of Hortonian rainfall-runoff processes in a semiarid

   DYNAMICS; MODEL; PARAMETERS
AB Scale dependence of Hortonian rainfall-runoff processes has received much attention in the literature but has not been fully resolved. To further explore this issue, a recently developed model was applied to simulate rainfall-infiltration-runoff processes at multiple spatial scales. The model consists of the coupling between a two-dimensional runoff routing module and a two-layer infiltration module, thus accounting for spatial variability in soil properties, soil surface sealing, topography, and partial vegetation cover. A 76 m(2) semiarid experimental plot with sparse cover of vegetation patches and a sealed soil surface in inter-patch bare areas was used as a representative elementary area (REA). A series of four larger artificial plots of different areas was created based on this REA to examine the scale dependence of rainfall-runoff relationships in the case of stationary heterogeneity. Results show that runoff depth (or runoff coefficient) decreases with increasing scale. This trend is more prominent at scales less than 10 times the REA length. Power law relationships can quantitatively describe the scaling law. The major mechanism of the scale effect is run-on infiltration. However, rainfall intensity and soil properties can both affect the scaling trend through their interaction with run-on. Higher intensity and less temporal variability of rainfall can both reduce the scale effect. Temporally intermittent rainfall may produce spatially oscillating infiltration rates at large scales. Vegetation patterns are another factor that may affect the scaling. Random-vegetation patterns, compared with regular patterns with similar statistical properties, change the spatial distributions, but do not significantly change either the total amount and statistical properties of infiltration and runoff or the scale dependence of the rainfall-runoff process.

AB Although relationships between roughness, flow, and transport processes in rivers and streams have been investigated for several decades, the prediction of flow resistance and longitudinal dispersion in small streams is still challenging. Major uncertainties in existing approaches for quantifying flow resistance and longitudinal dispersion at the reach scale arise from limitations in the characterization of riverbed roughness. In this study, we characterized the riverbed roughness in small moderate-gradient streams (0.1-0.5% bed slope) and investigated its effects on flow resistance and dispersion. We analyzed high-resolution transect-based measurements of stream depth and width, which resolved the complete roughness spectrum with scales ranging from the micro to the reach scale. Independently measured flow resistance and dispersion coefficients were mainly affected by roughness at spatial scales between the median grain size and the stream width, i.e., by roughness between the micro-and the mesoscale. We also compared our flow resistance measurements with calculations using various flow resistance equations. Flow resistance in our study streams was well approximated by the equations that were developed for high gradient streams (> 1%) and it was overestimated by approaches developed for sand-bed streams with a smooth riverbed or ripple bed.

AB Little is known about temporal variability in nitrate concentration responses to changes in discharge on intraannual time scales in large rivers. To investigate this knowledge gap, we used a six-year data set of daily surface water nitrate concentration and discharge averaged from near-continuous monitoring at U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations on the Connecticut, Potomac, and Mississippi Rivers, three large rivers that contribute substantial nutrient pollution to important estuaries. Interannually, a comparison of nitrate concentration-discharge (c-Q) relationships between a traditional discrete grab sample data set and the near-continuous data set revealed differing c-Q slopes, which suggests that sample frequency can impact how we ultimately characterize hydrologic systems. Intraannually, we conducted correlation analyses over 30-day windows to isolate the strength and direction of monthly c-Q relationships. Monthly c-Q slopes in the Potomac were positive (enrichment/mobilization response) in summer and fall and negative (dilution response) and weakly chemostatic (nonsignificant near-zero c-Q slope) in winter and spring, respectively. The Connecticut displayed a dilution response year-round, except summer when it was weakly chemostatic. Mississippi c-Q slopes were weakly chemostatic in all seasons and showed inconsistent responses to discharge fluctuations. The c-Q dynamics in the Potomac and Connecticut were correlated (R>0.3) to river temperature, flow percentile, and calendar day. Minimal correlation in the Mississippi suggests that the large basin area coupled with spatiotemporally variable anthropogenic forcings from substantial land use development created stochastic short-term c-Q relationships. Additional work using high-frequency sensors across large river networks can improve our understanding of spatial source input dynamics in these natural-human coupled systems.

TI Optimization of water level monitoring network in polder systems using
   information theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID ENTROPY; UNCERTAINTY
AB A method for siting water level monitors based on information theory measurements is presented. The first measurement is joint entropy, which evaluates the amount of information content that a monitoring set is able to collect, and the second measurement is total correlation, which evaluates the level of dependency or redundancy among monitors in the set. In order to find the most convenient set of places to put monitors from a large number of potential sites, a multiobjective optimization problem is posed under two different considerations: (1) taking into account the costs of placing new monitors and (2) considering the cost of placing monitors too close to hydraulic structures. In both cases, the joint entropy of the set is maximized and its total correlation is minimized. The costs are considered in terms of information theory units, for which additional terms affecting the objective functions are introduced. The proposed method is applied in a case study of the Delfland region, Netherlands. Results show that total correlation is an effective way to measure multivariate independency and that it must be combined with joint entropy to get results that cover a significant proportion of the total information content of the system. The maximization of joint entropy gives results that cover between 82% and 85% of the total information content.

ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; BENCHMARKING; DIAGNOSTICS
AB In a complex ecohydrologic system, vegetation and soil variables combine to dictate heat fluxes, and these fluxes may vary depending on the extent to which drivers are linearly or nonlinearly interrelated. From a modeling and causality perspective, uncertainty, sensitivity, and performance measures all relate to how information from different sources "flows" through a model to produce a target, or output. We address how model structure, broadly defined as a mapping from inputs to an output, combines with source dependencies to produce a range of information flow pathways from sources to a target. We apply information decomposition, which partitions reductions in uncertainty into synergistic, redundant, and unique information types, to a range of model cases. Toy models show that model structure and source dependencies both restrict the types of interactions that can arise between sources and targets. Regressions based on weather data illustrate how different model structures vary in their sensitivity to source dependencies, thus affecting predictive and functional performance. Finally, we compare the Surface Flux Equilibrium theory, a land-surface model, and neural networks in estimating the Bowen ratio and find that models trade off information types particularly when sources have the highest and lowest dependencies. Overall, this study extends an information theory-based model evaluation framework to incorporate the influence of source dependency on information pathways. This could be applied to explore behavioral ranges for both machine learning and process-based models, and guide model development by highlighting model deficiencies based on information flow pathways that would not be apparent based on existing measures.

AB Streamflow recession analysis characterizes the storage-outflow relationship in catchments. This relationship, which typically follows a power law, summarizes all catchment-scale subsurface hydrological processes and has long been known to be a key descriptor of the hydrologic response. In this paper, we tested a range of common recession analysis methods (RAMs) and propose the use of an analytic streamflow distribution model as an alternative method for recession parameter estimation and to objectively compare different RAMs. The used analytical model assumes power law recessions, in combination with a stochastic process for streamflow triggering rainfall events. This streamflow distribution model is used in the present framework to establish reference values for the recession parameters via maximum likelihood estimation. The model-based method has two main advantages: (a) joint estimation of both power law recession parameters (coefficient and exponent), which are known to be strongly correlated, and (b) parameter estimation based on all available streamflow data (no recession selection). The approach is applied to five rainfall-dominated catchments in Switzerland with 40 years of continuous streamflow observations. The results show that the estimated recession parameters are highly dependent on methodological choices and that some RAMs lead to biased estimates. The recession selection method is shown to be of prime importance for a reliable description of catchment-scale recession behaviour, in particular in presence of short streamflow records. The newly proposed model-based RAM yields robust results, which supports the further development of this method for comparative hydrology and opens new perspectives for understanding the recession behaviour of catchments.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB Manantali is a multi-purpose reservoir on the upper Senegal River. Among its operational objectives, conventional flood management required for traditional flood plain farming causes, during below average water years, significant losses of electric power production and reduction of water stored for irrigation. Rules are proposed for an economical variable management policy which incorporates coincident flow peaks on uncontrolled tributaries for which 10-day forecasts are made. A daily numerical simulation shows that variable flood management compared with fixed-date management gives, during dry years, important benefits in electric power production and maintains flood frequency behaviour better than that of the natural regime.

AB Many investigators have attempted to define the threshold of landslide failure, that is, the level of the selected climatic variable above which a rainfall-induced landslide occurs. Intensity-duration (I-d) relationships are the most common type of empirical thresholds proposed in the literature for predicting landslide occurrence induced by rainfall. Recent studies propose the use of the kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall (J m(-2)mm(-1)) to quantify the threshold of landslides induced by rainfall. In this paper, the relationship between rainfall duration and kinetic power corresponding to landslides triggered by rain was used to propose a new approach to define the threshold for predicting landslide occurrence. In particular, for the first time, a kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall-duration relationship is proposed for defining the minimum threshold needed for landslide failure. This new method can be applied using commonly used relationship for estimating the kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall and a new equation based on the measured raindrop size distribution. The applicability of this last method was tested using the data of rainfall intensity, duration and median volume diameter for 51 landslides in Taiwan. For the 51 landslides, the comparison between the measured pairs' kinetic power-duration and all selected relationships demonstrated that the equation based on the measured raindrop size distribution is the best method to define the landslide occurrence threshold, as it is both a process-oriented approach and is characterized by the best statistical performance. This last method has also the advantage to allow the forecasting of landslide hazard before the end of the rainfall event, since the rainfall kinetic power threshold value can be exceeded for a time interval less than the event duration.

   TERRESTRIAL; ALGORITHM; DEMAND; TRENDS
AB Recent research into the complementary relationship (CR) between actual and apparent potential evaporation has resulted in numerous alternative forms for the CR. Inspired by Brutsaert (2015), who derived a general CR in the form y = function (x), where x is the ratio of potential evaporation to apparent potential evaporation and y is the ratio of actual to apparent potential evaporation, an equation is proposed to calculate the value of x at which y goes to zero, denoted x(min). The value of x(min) varies even at an individual observation site, but can be calculated using only the data required for the Penman (1948) equation as expressed here, so no calibration of xmin is required. It is shown that the scatter in x-y plots using experimental data is reduced when x is replaced by X = (x - x(min))/(1 - x(min)). This rescaling results in data falling along the line y - X, which is proposed as a new version of the CR. While a reinterpretation of the fundamental boundary conditions proposed by Brutsaert (2015) is required, the physical constraints behind them are still met. An alternative formulation relating y to X is also discussed.

AB Hydrology is rich in methods that use information theory to evaluate monitoring networks. Yet in most existing studies, only the available data set as a whole is used, which neglects the intraannual variability of the hydrological system. In this paper, we demonstrate how this variability can be considered by extending monitoring evaluation to subsets of the available data. Therefore, we separately evaluated time windows of fixed length, which were shifted through the data set, and successively extended time windows. We used basic information theory measures and a greedy ranking algorithm based on the criterion of maximum information/minimum redundancy. The network investigated monitored surface and groundwater levels at quarter-hourly intervals and was located at an artificially drained lowland site in the Spreewald region in north-east Germany. The results revealed that some of the monitoring stations were of value permanently while others were needed only temporally. The prevailing meteorological conditions, particularly the amount of precipitation, affected the degree of similarity between the water levels measured. The hydrological system tended to act more individually during periods of no or little rainfall. The optimal monitoring setup, its stability, and the monitoring effort necessary were influenced by the meteorological forcing. Altogether, the methodology presented can help achieve a monitoring network design that has a more even performance or covers the conditions of interest (e.g., floods or droughts) best.

AB Laboratory measurements of the permeability and spectral-induced polarization (SIP) response of samples consisting of unconsolidated sands typical of those found in New Zealand aquifers have been made. After correction of measured formation factors to allow for the fact that some were measured at only one fluid conductivity, predictions of permeability from the grain size (d) of the samples are found to agree well with measured values of permeability. The Cole-Cole time constant (derived from the SIP measurements) is found, as expected, to depend upon d(2), but can be affected by the inclusion of smaller grains in the sample. Measurements made on samples comprising of mixtures of grain sizes show that inclusion in a sample of even 10% of smaller grains can significantly reduce both the Cole-Cole time constant ((CC)) and the permeability, and support theoretical derivation of how the permeability of a mixture of grain sizes varies with the content of the mixture. Proposed relationships for using (CC) as a predictor for permeability are tested and found to be crucially dependent on the assumed relationship between the dynamic pore radius and grain size. The inclusion of a multiplicative constant to take account of numerical approximations results in good predictions for the permeability of the samples in this study. It seems unlikely, however, that there is a single global expression for predicting permeability from SIP data for all samples.

AB This short communication investigates if the capillary air-liquid interfacial area vs. saturation relationship A(lv) (S) can be predicted from the capillary pressure vs. saturation relationship S (h), using the theoretical sample scale model of Diamantopoulos and Durner (2013, 2015). We selected three published experimental datasets, where S (h) and A(lv) (S) relationships had been measured for the same porous media. The sample scale model was fitted to the retention curve S (h) of each porous medium and then used to predict the air-liquid interfacial area A(lv) (S). We also included in the analysis the thermodynamic models of Leverett (1941) and Grant and Gerhard (2007). For two sandy materials and especially for high saturation values, the model predicted the capillary A(lv) (S) successfully, which was in one case given by a pore-network model simulation (Kibbey and Chen, 2012) and in the other case experimentally determined (Brusseau et al., 2006). For glass bead experiments, the contact angle needed to be fitted to properly describe the experimental A(lv) (S) curve. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID WATER-QUALITY
AB This technical note deals with the mathematical representation of concentration-discharge relationships. We propose a two-sided affine power scaling relationship (2S-APS) as an alternative to the classic one-sided power scaling relationship (commonly known as "power law"). We also discuss the identification of the parameters of the proposed relationship, using an appropriate numerical criterion. The application of 2S-APS to the high-frequency chemical time series of the Orgeval-ORACLE observatory is presented here (in calibration and validation mode): it yields better results for several solutes and for electrical conductivity in comparison with the power law relationship.

ID RULE-BASED MODELS; WAVE; MOVEMENT
AB A fuzzy dynamic flood routing model (FDFRM) for natural channels is presented, wherein the flood wave can be approximated to a monoclinal wave. This study is based on modification of an earlier published work by the same authors, where the nature of the wave was of gravity type. Momentum equation of the dynamic wave model is replaced by a fuzzy rule based model, while retaining the continuity equation in its complete form. Hence, the FDFRM gets rid of the assumptions associated with the momentum equation. Also, it overcomes the necessity of calculating friction slope (S-f) in flood routing and hence the associated uncertainties are eliminated. The fuzzy rule based model is developed on an equation for wave velocity, which is obtained in terms of discontinuities in the gradient of flow parameters. The channel reach is divided into a number of approximately uniform sub-reaches. Training set required for development of the fuzzy rule based model for each sub-reach is obtained from discharge-area relationship at its mean section. For highly heterogeneous sub-reaches, optimized fuzzy rule based models are obtained by means of a neuro-fuzzy algorithm. For demonstration, the FDFRM is applied to flood routing problems in a fictitious channel with single uniform reach, in a fictitious channel with two uniform sub-reaches and also in a natural channel with a number of approximately uniform sub-reaches. It is observed that in cases of the fictitious channels, the FDFRM outputs match well with those of an implicit numerical model (INM), which solves the dynamic wave equations using an implicit numerical scheme. For the natural channel, the FDFRM Outputs are comparable to those of the HEC-RAS model. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID URBAN WATER; RAINFALL; SYSTEMS; REUSE
AB As the concept of sustainable urban water management is incorporated into the practice of urban water resource managers, actions, such as the utilization of roof runoff via rainwater tanks, which have multiple benefits, are increasingly being built into urban water systems. Modelling tools are frequently used to predict the yield from rainwater tanks and to estimate the storage capacity required to achieve a given potable supply reduction level, with these estimates used in both urban water resources policy development and engineering design. Therefore, it is important that the accuracy of commonly used models is understood. This paper investigates the impact of computational time step, computational operating rule, initial storage level, and the length of simulation period on the accuracy of the storage-yield-reliability relationship calculated using a simple rainwater tank behaviour model. Four time steps (ranging from 6 min to 24 h), two operational rules (supply before spillage and supply after spillage), two initial storage level states (empty and full), and three simulation periods (50 years, 10 years and I year) were applied to a wide range of rainwater tank system configurations and three different locations in Australia. It was found that the supply-after-spillage computational operating rule is preferable, while the ratio of the average demand volume in a single computational time step divided by the storage capacity (Delta D/S) can be used to assess whether a given combination of demand, storage, inflow, and computational time step will provide long-term yield estimates that are within 5% of the values produced by a simulation that used a 50-year time series of climate, 6-min time step, and a supply-after-spillage operational rule (50-6-YAS).

ID UPLAND STREAM; RIVER; BEHAVIOR
AB Monthly mean data from a 90 year period relating to a small catchment (1424 . km(2)) in north-central Austria were used to provide a long-term perspective on the nature of the air-water temperature relationship. Annual mean values of air and water temperature were related in a relatively insensitive and scattered way (r(2) < 55%, b < 0 . 65), whereas the relationship for monthly mean values was closer and steeper (r(2) > 95%, b > 0 . 65). A separate regression equation was needed to describe the behaviour of monthly mean water temperatures as the air temperatures fell below freezing. Analysis of air-water temperature regressions for individual months revealed a series of relations which were generally more scattered and less, but variously, sensitive than the ensemble relationship of monthly mean values. Monthly mean water temperatures could be predicted from the ensemble air-water temperature relationship and from the relations for individual months with root mean square errors of > 1 . 0 and < 0 . 8 degrees C, respectively. Segmentation of air-water temperature regressions according to air temperatures above and below freezing did not significantly improve water temperature prediction. Hysteresis in, and the relatively low slope of, the air-water temperature relationships in the study catchment reflected the importance of snowmelt in the flow regime.

AB This study combined concentration-discharge analyses (filtration at 0.45 m), cascade filtrations (at 1.2, 0.4, and 0.025 m) and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation (AF4) to probe the influence of colloidal carriers (dissolved organic matter and inorganic nanoparticles) on observed concentration-discharge relationships for trace metals in a 155 ha forested catchment of the Santa Catalina Mountains Critical Zone Observatory (SCM CZO), Arizona. Many major elements (Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca) show no colloidal influence, and concentration-discharge relationships for these species are explained by previous work. However, the majority of trace metals (Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Cu, Y, REE, U) show at least some influence of colloids on chemistry when filtered at the standard 0.45 m cutoff. Concentration-discharge slopes of trace metals with modest colloidal influence are shallow (approximate to 0.3) similar to that measured for dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 0.24), whereas elements with greater colloidal influence have steeper concentration-discharge slopes approaching that of Al (0.76), the element with the largest colloidal influence in this study (on average 68%). These findings are further supported by AF4 measurements that show distinct and resolvable pools of low hydrodynamic diameter DOC-sized material coexistent with larger diameter inorganic colloids, and the ratio of these carriers changes systematically with discharge because the DOC pool has a concentration-discharge relationship with shallower slope than the inorganic colloidal pool. Together these data sets illustrate that positive concentration-discharge slopes of trace metals in stream waters may be explained as the relative partitioning of trace metals between DOC and inorganic colloids, with contributions of the latter likely increasing as a result of increased prevalence of macropore flow.

AB Interbasin water transfers have been undertaken in those regions that water demand has gone beyond regional water availability. Some reservoirs in a recipient region have both natural inflow (NI) and the controlled inflow (CI) through water transfer. This study establishes a theoretical framework to analyze reservoir operation with combined NI and CI, via an optimization model to maximize the net benefit of reservoir operation, considering both deterministic and stochastic NI. Operation rules for both water transfer and reservoir release are derived from the framework. It is illustrated that the amount of CI depends on water availability to the recipient reservoir, the relationship between marginal benefit and marginal cost, the water transfer capacity, and the uncertainty level of NI. As forecast uncertainty increases, more water is transferred, and more water is left in the reservoir as carryover storage when the initial water availability (WA0) is small; however, with a certain high level of WA0 and forecast uncertainty, water transfer will be controlled to reduce the risk of water abandonment. Notably, the critical values of the forecast uncertainty that control water transfer are identified under the various WA0. The analysis is illustrated via a case study with a real-world reservoir in northeastern China. In summary, this study derives hedging rules for water supply reservoir with combined NI and CI to mitigate the risk of both water shortage and water abandonment and provides guidelines to use NI forecasts for water transfer and reservoir release decisions.
   Plain Language Summary In this paper, we established a theoretical framework to derive hedging rules for reservoir operation with combined natural inflow (NI) and controlled inflow (CI) through interbasin water transfer. It extends the existing studies on hedging rules, which only considered NI. We particularly address the complexity of CI decisions under NI uncertainty-on the one hand, CI enhances water supply reliability of the recipient reservoir; on the other hand, it can increase the risk of water waste via reservoir spill when the likelihood of a full reservoir is increased. We also addressed the critical values of the forecast uncertainty that control water transfer under the various initial water availability levels. In summary, the theoretical analysis provides guidelines to combine NI and CI to mitigate the risk of both water shortage and water abandonment and provides guidelines to use NI forecasts for water transfer and reservoir release decisions.

AB This study investigates the influence of water, carbon, and energy fluxes on solute production and transport through the Jemez Critical Zone (CZ) and impacts on C-Q relationships over variable spatial and temporal scales. Chemical depletion-enrichment profiles of soils, combined with regolith thickness and groundwater data indicate the importance to stream hydrochemistry of incongruent dissolution of silicate minerals during deep bedrock weathering, which is primarily limited by water fluxes, in this highly fractured, young volcanic terrain. Under high flow conditions (e.g., spring snowmelt), wetting of soil and regolith surfaces and presence of organic acids promote mineral dissolution and provide a constant supply of base cations, Si, and DIC to soil water and groundwater. Mixing of waters from different hydrochemical reservoirs in the near stream environment during wet periods leads to the chemostatic behavior of DIC, base cations, and Si in stream flow. Metals transported by organic matter complexation (i.e., Ge, Al) and/or colloids (i.e., Al) during periods of soil saturation and lateral connectivity to the stream display a positive relationship with Q. Variable Si-Q relationships, under all but the highest flow conditions, can be explained by nonconservative transport and precipitation of clay minerals, which influences long versus short-term Si weathering fluxes. By combining measurements of the CZ obtained across different spatial and temporal scales, we were able to constrain weathering processes in different hydrological reservoirs that may be flushed to the stream during hydrologic events, thereby informing C-Q relationships.

AB The application of Dupuit-Boussinesq theory on the two-dimensional steady groundwater flow in an unconfined sloping aquifer with uniform recharge is theoretically investigated. The examination of conditions at the downstream and upstream is performed. The method of phase plane is used to geometrically interpret the characteristics of the nonlinear theory by various initial conditions. For phase portrait analysis, three configurations for aquifers are considered. In each type of aquifer three conditions of recharges as well as downstream groundwater tables are also considered for comprehensive analysis. Based on the phase portrait analysis, one explicit formula in terms of known parameters and downstream boundary condition is derived to easily and straightforwardly determine an appropriate upstream boundary condition. The derived explicit formula can facilitate correct modeling using Boussinesq theory.

AB Representation and quantification of uncertainty in climate change impact studies are a difficult task. Several sources of uncertainty arise in studies of hydrologic impacts of climate change, such as those due to choice of general circulation models (GCMs), scenarios and downscaling methods. Recently, much work has focused on uncertainty quantification and modeling in regional climate change impacts. In this paper, an uncertainty modeling framework is evaluated, which uses a generalized uncertainty measure to combine GCM, scenario and downscaling uncertainties. The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is used for representing and combining uncertainty from various sources. A significant advantage of the D-S framework over the traditional probabilistic approach is that it allows for the allocation of a probability mass to sets or intervals, and can hence handle both aleatory or stochastic uncertainty, and epistemic or subjective uncertainty. This paper shows how the D-S theory can be used to represent beliefs in some hypotheses such as hydrologic drought or wet conditions, describe uncertainty and ignorance in the system, and give a quantitative measurement of belief and plausibility in results. The D-S approach has been used in this work for information synthesis using various evidence combination rules having different conflict modeling approaches. A case study is presented for hydrologic drought prediction using downscaled streamflow in the Mahanadi River at Hirakud in Orissa, India. Projections of n most likely monsoon streamflow sequences are obtained from a conditional random field (CRF) downscaling model, using an ensemble of three GCMs for three scenarios, which are converted to monsoon standardized streamflow index (SSFI-4) series. This range is used to specify the basic probability assignment (bpa) for a Dempster-Shafer structure, which represents uncertainty associated with each of the SSFI-4 classifications. These uncertainties are then combined across GCMs and scenarios using various evidence combination rules given by the D-S theory. A Bayesian approach is also presented for this case study, which models the uncertainty in projected frequencies of SSFI-4 classifications by deriving a posterior distribution for the frequency of each classification, using an ensemble of GCMs and scenarios. Results from the D-S and Bayesian approaches are compared, and relative merits of each approach are discussed. Both approaches show an increasing probability of extreme, severe and moderate droughts and decreasing probability of normal and wet conditions in Orissa as a result of climate change.

TI Imprecise probabilistic evaluation of sewer flooding in urban drainage
   systems using random set theory
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INFINITE RANDOM SETS; UNCERTAINTY
AB Uncertainty analysis is widely applied in water system modeling to quantify prediction uncertainty from models and data. Conventional methods typically handle various kinds of uncertainty using a single characterizing approach, be it probability theory or fuzzy set theory. However, using a single approach may not be appropriate, particularly when uncertainties are of different types. For example, in sewer flood estimation problems, random rainfall variables are used as model inputs and imprecise or subjective information is used to define model parameters. This paper presents a general framework for sewer flood estimation that enables simultaneous consideration of two types of uncertainty: randomness from rainfall data represented using imprecise probabilities and imprecision from model parameters represented by fuzzy numbers. These two types of uncertainties are combined using random set theory and then propagated through a hydrodynamic urban drainage model. Two propagation methods, i.e., discretization and Monte Carlo based methods, are presented and compared, with the latter shown to be much more computationally efficient and hence recommended for high-dimensional problems. The model output (flood depth) is generated in the form of lower and upper cumulative probabilities, which are best estimates given the various stochastic and epistemic uncertainties considered and which embrace the unknown true cumulative probability. The distance between the cumulative probabilities represents the extent of imprecise, incomplete, or conflicting information and can be reduced only when more knowledge is available. The proposed methodology has a more complete and thus more accurate representation of uncertainty in data and models and can effectively handle different uncertainty characterizations in a single, integrated framework for sewer flood estimation.

AB [1] To model the observed local variation of transport speed, an extension of the homogeneous space-fractional advection-dispersion equation (fADE) to more general cases with space-dependent coefficients ( drift velocity V and dispersion coefficient D) has been suggested. To provide a rigorous evaluation of this extension, we explore the underlying physical meanings of two proposed, and one other possible form, of the fADE by using the generalized mass balance law proposed by Meerschaert et al. ( 2006). When the classical Fick's law is replaced by its generalized form in the first-order mass conversation law, the original fADE with constant parameters extends to the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with fractional flux ( denoted as FF-ADE). When the net inflow of dispersive flux is from nonlocal concentration gradients following a fractional divergence, we get the ADE with fractional divergence (FD-ADE). When the total net inflow from both nonlocal advection and nonlocal concentration gradients follows a fractional form, the fADE contains fully fractional divergence (FFD-ADE). These three fADEs with constant parameters can also be obtained by proper choice of the two memory kernels in the nonlocal dispersive constitutive theory proposed by Cushman et al. ( 1994), while the space-variable fADEs correspond to the conditional nonlocal theory proposed by Neuman ( 1993) after specifying the general (Levy-type) functional form of the random distribution. The corresponding Langevin Markov models can be found in many cases, where the Lagrangian stochastic processes can be conditioned directly on local aquifer properties at any practical, measurable level and resolution. The resulting Lagrangian random-walk particle tracking methods, along with previous numerical solutions using implicit Euler finite differences, distinguish and elucidate the plume behavior described by these fADEs. The fractional models are applied to fit the tritium plumes measured at the Macrodispersion Experiment test site. When the local parameters gleaned from the hydraulic conductivity ( K) distribution are varied even slightly (i.e., a two-zone model), allowing the use of observed hydraulic conditions at the site, the model fits are well within the variability of the data. The extended fADEs describe the fast and space-dependent leading edges of measured plumes in the regional-scale alluvial system, which was underestimated and could not be fully captured by the original fADE with constant parameters. Applications also favor the FD-ADE model because of the ease of implementation and consistency with previous analysis of the K statistics.

AB The study of annual maximum rainfall intensity is quite difficult in Spain due to its limited recording rain gauges and short record lengths. This problem can't be solved applying classical regional approach, since scarce stations and great climate variability prevents forming homogeneous regions. The present study tries a new way of applying regionalization, a method which improves robustness, joining series with different durations (<= 1 hour, > 1 hour) at the same station to form regions. Besides, the SQRT-ETmax distribution is used due to extreme rainfall intensity in the Mediterranean area is not under Gumbel law domain. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The basic structure of the scientific methodat least in its idealized formis widely championed as a recipe for scientific progress, but the day-to-day practice may be different. Here, we explore the spectrum of current practice in hypothesis formulation and testing in hydrology, based on a random sample of recent research papers. This analysis suggests that in hydrology, as in other fields, hypothesis formulation and testing rarely correspond to the idealized model of the scientific method. Practices such as p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) are major obstacles to more rigorous hypothesis testing in hydrology, along with the well-known problem of confirmation biasthe tendency to value and trust confirmations more than refutationsamong both researchers and reviewers. Nonetheless, as several examples illustrate, hypothesis tests have played an essential role in spurring major advances in hydrological theory. Hypothesis testing is not the only recipe for scientific progress, however. Exploratory research, driven by innovations in measurement and observation, has also underlain many key advances. Further improvements in observation and measurement will be vital to both exploratory research and hypothesis testing, and thus to advancing the science of hydrology.

AB The ubiquity of the power law relationship between dQ/dt and Q for recession periods (-dQ/dt kQ(alpha); Q being discharge at the basin outlet at time t) clearly hints at the existence of a dominant recession flow process that is common to all real basins. It is commonly assumed that a basin, during recession events, functions as a single phreatic aquifer resting on a impermeable horizontal bed or the Dupuit-Boussinesq (DB) aquifer, and with time different aquifer geometric conditions arise that give different values of alpha and k. The recently proposed alternative model, geomorphological recession flow model, however, suggests that recession flows are controlled primarily by the dynamics of the active drainage network (ADN). In this study we use data for several basins and compare the above two contrasting recession flow models in order to understand which of the above two factors dominates during recession periods in steep basins. Particularly, we do the comparison by selecting three key recession flow properties: (1) power law exponent alpha, (2) dynamic dQ/dt-Q relationship (characterized by k) and (3) recession timescale (time period for which a recession event lasts). Our observations suggest that neither drainage from phreatic aquifers nor evapotranspiration significantly controls recession flows. Results show that the value of a and recession timescale are not modeled well by DB aquifer model. However, the above mentioned three recession curve properties can be captured satisfactorily by considering the dynamics of the ADN as described by geomorphological recession flow model, possibly indicating that the ADN represents not just phreatic aquifers but the organization of various sub-surface storage systems within the basin.

AB Pore velocity-dependent dynamic contact angles provide a mechanism for explaining the formation of fingers/columns in porous media. To study those dynamic contact angles when gravity is present, rectangular capillary tubes were used to facilitate observation of the complete interface without geometric distortion. Results show that the Hoffman (1975) relationship between dynamic contact angle and water velocity applies to gravity-affected flow fields, and that it (when adjusted for nonzero static contact angles) can be used to model dynamic capillary pressures for unstable wettings fronts in porous media by assuming that (1) pressure at the wetting front is discontinuous, (2) the flow field behind the fingertip is highly heterogeneous, and (3) the front line advances one or a few pores at the time. We demonstrate the utility of the Hoffman relationship for porous media with a published infiltration experiment by calculating the capillary pressure successfully at the unstable wetting front as a function of the flux of water in the finger and the grain size diameter.

AB Forecasting the hydrological impacts of climatic and anthropic changes assumes that the evolution of model parameters under changing conditions can be predicted. Hence it is necessary to study the relationship between hydroclimatic variability and model parameter values. In this paper, we explore this issue by implementing a daily lumped hydrological model (GR4J, Perrin et al. (2003)) on the Upper Oueme watershed (10,050 km(2), Benin). West Africa was subjected to changing climatic and hydrological conditions during the second half of the last century, and changes in the water balance can be evidenced on this watershed. Contrasted periods are extracted from the available 1954-2002 data set, so that hydrological and pluviometric extreme periods can be defined. First, the magnitude of changes in model parameter values under changing conditions are analyzed, using a resampling method (first approach) and within an equifinality context (second approach). It is shown that significant changes in the rainfall- runoff relationship do not induce significant changes in the model's parameter values. A third original approach analyzes the signature of hydroclimatic variability in model performance. Hence a test is defined that uses interannual model efficiency variances to measure performance homogeneity and a resampling test to statistically characterize the calculated results. This test demonstrates the hydrological relevance of the calibrated parameter sets because the more stationary the rainfall- runoff relationship, the more homogeneous the model's performance.

AB Multidecadal inland surface water dynamics are of increasing interest due to their importance to climate, ecology, and society, yet several key challenges impede long-term monitoring of inland surface waters globally. This research investigates two novel methods, one addressing subhydroflattened surface estimate uncertainty issues, and a second addressing temporal resolution issues, using 46 water bodies across the western United States. First, low water level estimate uncertainty was reduced using multiple digital elevation models (ALOS, SRTM, and NED) to derive the hypsometric relationship for each lake from the digital elevation model with the lowest hydroflattened water surface. This technique reduced the number of images with subhydroflattened water surfaces by at least 549 over the best individual DEM resulting in higher water surface elevation estimate accuracy. Second, this paper introduces proportional hypsometry which dynamically generates surface area/elevation relationships for every image using clear pixels only by removing contamination from both the image and DEM. Proportional hypsometry was found to be ill-suited for subhydroflattened water surface levels but produced comparable accuracy to clear images for above hydroflattened water levels. Overall, using the lowest hydroflattened surface along with proportional hypsometry improved temporal resolution enabling analysis of nearly 10,000 additional images while maintaining similar accuracy levels as images with <1% contamination (2.35 m RMSE vs. 2.17 m RMSE). This research increases lower water elevation estimate accuracy and temporal resolution and is scalable enabling regional and global water dynamic analysis.

AB A distributed physically-based model describing coupled surface-subsurface flows is applied to an instrumented catchment to investigate the links between runoff generation processes and the dynamics of saturated areas. The spatial characterization of the system is obtained through geophysical measurements and in situ observations. The model is able to reproduce the dynamics of the system through the calibration of only few parameters with a clear physical interpretation, providing a solid basis for our numerical investigations. Such investigations demonstrate the important control exerted by surface topography on the time evolution of saturated area patterns, mainly mediated by topographic curvature, that dictates both the dominant streamflow generation process at the local scale and the connection-disconnection dynamics of saturated areas. The relation between hillslope water storage and streamflow, Q = f(V), is shown to be highly hysteretical and dependent on the mean saturation of the catchment: higher degrees of saturation tend to yield one-to-one relationships between streamflow and water storage. On the contrary, streamflow-water storage relations are importantly affected by the specific configuration of saturated areas connected to the outlet when the system is far from complete saturation. This observation contradicts common assumptions of a one-to-one relationship Q = f(V) often used to justify widely observed power-law Q vs. dQ/dt recession curves. Furthermore, even when Q = f(V) becomes unique at high degrees of saturation, no power-law form emerged in our runs, speculatively because of the small size of the catchment formed by a single incision and the corresponding hillslope.

AB Negligence of environmental flow (e-flow) has severe adverse impacts on wetlands. Additionally, hydrological droughts, compounded by mismanagement of available water resources and anthropogenic activities, lead to water shortage and degrade wetland ecosystem. However, in dealing with reservoir operation/re-operation, a few studies have addressed inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state to improve the monthly operation performance of an upstream reservoir in coordination with downstream wetland needs. Hence, the study objective is to adopt a linear/nonlinear reservoir operation rule to hydrological drought states and e-flow requirements. So, first, the soil and water assessment (SWAT) model is applied to simulate the natural daily flow regime by eliminating human impacts. Then, using the Tennant e-flow scheme, the intra/inter-annual variability of e-flow and the degree of alteration of the flow are measured. Afterward, using the Standardized Hydrological Drought Index (SHDI), the drought/wet severity and duration are determined. A linear/nonlinear simulation model adopted for the presentation of reservoir policies and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was employed to determine the optimal monthly operation of the upstream reservoir. The simulated operation policies correspond to each hydrological drought state were evaluated with reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and water-deficit indices. Results indicated that incorporation of hydrological drought state could improve the overall system reliability by 23% over simply enforcing the monthly variable-parameter nonlinear decision rules. Also, the proposed methodology simultaneously maximized the downstream allocated water and e-flow of the terminal wetland. It also implicitly minimized the change in extreme flow metrics that are known to benefit ecosystem diversity. The proposed framework supports reservoir re-operation in regions subject to challenges in supplying water to different sectors while maintaining e-flow during drought periods.

AB Model evaluation and hypothesis testing are fundamental to any field of science. We propose here that by changing slightly the way we think and communicate about inference-from being fundamentally a problem of uncertainty quantification to being a problem of information quantification-allows us to avoid certain problems related to testing models as hypotheses. We propose that scientists are typically interested in assessing the information provided by models, not the truth value or likelihood of a model. Information theory allows us to formalize this perspective.

AB Despite the importance of mountainous catchments for providing freshwater resources, especially in semi-arid regions, little is known about key hydrological processes such as mountain block recharge (MBR). Here we implement a data-based method informed by isotopic data to quantify MBR rates using recession flow analysis. We applied our hybrid method in a semi-arid sky island catchment in southern Arizona, United States. Sabino Creek is a 91 km(2) catchment with its sources near the summit of the Santa Catalina Mountains northeast of Tucson. Southern Arizona's climate has two distinct wet seasons separated by prolonged dry periods. Winter frontal storms (November-March) provide about 50% of annual precipitation, and summers are dominated by monsoon convective storms from July to September. Isotope analyses of springs and surface water in the Sabino Creek catchment indicate that streamflow during dry periods is derived from groundwater storage in fractured bedrock. Storage-discharge relationships are derived from recession flow analysis to estimate changes in storage during wet periods. To provide reliable estimates, several corrections and improvements to classic base flow recession analysis are considered. These corrections and improvements include adaptive time stepping, data binning, and the choice of storage-discharge functions. Our analysis shows that (1) incorporating adaptive time steps to correct for streamflow measurement errors improves the coefficient of determination, (2) the quantile method is best for streamflow data binning, (3) the choice of the regression model is critical when the stage-discharge function is used to predict changes in bedrock storage beyond the maximum observed flow in the catchment, and (4) the use of daily or night-time hourly streamflow does not affect the form of the storage-discharge relationship but will impact MBR estimates because of differences in the observed range of streamflow in each series.

AB A means of upscaling the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity, < K >, based on spatial variation in the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) field is essential for the application of flow and transport models to practical problems. Multifractals are inherently scaling and thus may offer solutions to this dilemma. Random two-dimensional geometrical multifractal fields (multifractal Sierpinski carpets with a scale factor b = 3) were constructed for iterations i = 1 through 5 using different generator probability values (p). The resulting average mass fractions were normalized and assumed to be directly proportional to K. The objectives were to explore how the frequency distribution of K changes as a function of p and i, how < K > varies with i for different p values, and how < K > is related to the generalized dimensions of the multifractal field. Numerical simulations of flow were performed in the multifractal fields, with < K > computed using Darcy's law. The results showed that < K > increases with increasing i level and increasing p value. The scaling of < K > with resolution, 1/b(i), followed a power law relationship, similar to that observed for a variety of natural porous media. At the highest resolution (i = 5), In < K > was best predicted by the correlation dimension (D-2); In < K > increased as D-2 increased (R-2 = 0.991, p < 0.0001). This relationship indicates that < K > decreases with increasing long-range spatial correlation among the K values in the field. Furthermore, as < K > decreases it becomes increasingly dominated by flow channeling. This is because high values of K become more and more clustered as p decreases. This approach may prove useful for the prediction of < K > from generalized dimensions estimated by multifractal analysis of field measurements of K. The results may also be applicable to the design of sampling strategies for multiple small-scale slug tests at a given resolution.

TI Spatial relationships between soil moisture patterns and topographic

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID ECOLOGICAL DATA; WETNESS INDEX; FIELD; VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGY
AB New tools are needed in hydrology to improve our understanding of process heterogeneity and its relationship to catchment topography. We tested the distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps (DBMEM) method, which models patterns using a combination of positively and negatively autocorrelated structures, searching for soil moisture characteristic scales in a temperate humid forested system. We focused on three questions: (1) What are the characteristic spatial scales of shallow soil moisture? (2) Is there a strong relationship between soil moisture patterns and topographic variables at these scales? and (3) Which hydro-meteorological variables influence soil moisture scales and topographic controls in a significant way? Data consisted of 16 surveys of soil moisture at depths of 5, 15, 30, and 45 cm in the 5.1 ha Hermine catchment (Laurentians, Canada). The global DBMEM model explained 21 to 96% (adjusted R square) of the spatial variations in soil moisture apportioned into decreasing fractions over six spatially nested, additive submodels: very large (0.85-1.4 ha), large (0.54-0.85 ha), meso (0.50-0.54 ha), fine positive (0.22-0.50 ha), fine negative (0.10-0.22 ha), and very fine (0.02-0.10 ha). The effects of catchment topography (e. g., slope and contributing area) on soil moisture were significant at large and very large scales. Moisture patterns at these scales were dependent on previous storm properties and were good predictors of catchment response. The DBMEM approach provided insightful quantitative evidence regarding the temporal dependency of the relationships between dynamic soil moisture content and static topographic variables across scales.

AB In this work, the constitutive relationship between capillary pressure (Pc), saturation (S-w), and fluid-fluid interfacial area per volume (IFA) is characterized using computed microtomography for drainage and imbibition experiments consisting of a nonaqueous phase liquid and water. The experimentally measured relationship was compared to a thermodynamic model that relates the area under the P-c - S-w curve to the total IFA, an, and the capillary-associated IFA, a(nw). Surfaces were fit to the experimental and modeled P-c - S-w - a(n) and P-c - S-w - a(nw) data in order to characterize the relationship in three dimensions (3D). For the experimental system, it was shown that the P-c - S-w - a(n) relationship does not exhibit hysteresis. The model is found to provide a reasonable approximation of the magnitude of the 3D surfaces for an and anw, with a mean absolute percent error of 26% and 15%, respectively. The relatively high mean absolute percent errors are primarily the result of discrepancies observed at the wetting-and nonwetting-phase residual saturation values. Differences in the shapes of the surfaces are noted, particularly in the curvature (arising from the addition of scanning curves and presence of a(n) - S-w hysteresis in the predicted results) and endpoints (particularly the inherent nature of thermodynamic models to predict significant anw associated with residual nonwetting-phase saturation). Overall, the thermodynamic model is shown to be a practical, inexpensive tool for predicting the P-c - S-w - a(n) and P-c - S-w - a(nw) surfaces from P-c -S-w data.

AB The rain kinetic energy (KE) is a widely used indicator of the potential ability of rain to detach soil. However, rain kinetic energy is not a commonly measured meteorological parameter. Therefore, empirical laws linking the rain kinetic energy to the more easily available rain intensity (I) have been proposed based on drop-size and drop-velocity measurements. The various mathematical expressions used to relate rain kinetic energy and rain intensity available from the literature are reported in this study. We focus our discussion on the two expressions of the kinetic energy used: the rain kinetic energy expended per volume of rain or volume-specific kinetic energy (KEmm, J m(-2) mm(-1)) and the rain kinetic energy rate or time-specific kinetic energy (KEtime, J m(-2) h(-1)). We use statistical and micro-physical considerations to demonstrate that KEtime is the most appropriate expression to establish an empirical law between rain kinetic energy and rain intensity. Finally, considering the existing dropsize distribution models from literature, we show that the most suitable mathematical function to link KE and I is a power law. The constants of the power law are related to rain type, geographical location and measurement technique. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of experiments were performed to characterize the permeability, the specific storage, the capillary pressure, the streaming potential coupling coefficient, and the electrical conductivity of a very low permeability Callovo-Oxfordian clay rock at different water saturations. The Callovo-Oxfordian formation is presently investigated as a potential host to store nuclear wastes because of its very low permeability (typically 10 nd at saturation) and high specific surface area. We first present the constitutive transport equations including an electrokinetic cross-coupling term in the generalized Darcy and Ohm constitutive equations. Then we present new experimental results using measurements of transient weight losses of samples submitted to a change in the relative humidity imposed by an automated humidity system in a hermetic chamber. These experiments are interpreted with a 1-D analytical model of the coupled hydromechanical and transport equations. The hydromechanical transport properties (relative permeability and specific storage) of this clay rock are investigated in the relative saturation range from 0.23 to 0.70. We demonstrate that below 30% in relative humidity, the flux of the vapor phase with respect to the flux of the liquid water phase cannot be neglected. The relative apparent permeability can be described by a simple power law relationship with the saturation. In addition, we measure the electrical conductivity and the streaming potential coupling coefficient at various saturations. The electrical conductivity is described by a model accounting for electrical double-layer contributions to surface conductivity. The measurement of the streaming potential coupling coefficient agrees with a power law model for the coupling coefficient versus the relative water saturation. A relationship between the exponent used to characterize the relative permeability and the second Archie's exponent used to describe the dependence of the electrical conductivity of the material with respect to the saturation is discussed.

AB In a previous paper published in Journal of Hydrology, it was shown that underground structures are responsible for a mixing process between shallow and deep groundwater that can favour the spreading of urban contamination. In this paper, the impact of underground structures on the intrinsic vulnerability of urban aquifers was investigated. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a 2D deterministic modelling approach based on the reservoir theory generalized to hydrodispersive systems to better understand this mixing phenomenon and the mixing affected zone (MAZ) caused by underground structures. It was shown that the maximal extent of the MAZ caused by an underground structure is reached approximately 20 years after construction. Consequently, underground structures represent a long-term threat for deep aquifer reservoirs. Regarding the construction process, draining operations have a major impact and favour large-scale mixing between shallow and deep groundwater. Consequently, dewatering should be reduced and enclosed as much as possible. The role played by underground structures' dimensions was assessed. The obstruction of the first aquifer layer caused by construction has the greatest influence on the MAZ. The cumulative impact of several underground structures was assessed. It was shown that the total MAZ area increases linearly with underground structures' density. The role played by materials' properties and hydraulic gradient were assessed. Hydraulic conductivity, anisotropy and porosity have the strongest influence on the development of MAZ. Finally, an empirical law was derived to estimate the MAZ caused by an underground structure in a bi-layered aquifer under unconfined conditions. This empirical law, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis developed in this paper, allows for the estimation of MAZ dimensions under known material properties and underground structure dimensions. This empirical law can help urban planners assess the area of influence of underground structures and protect urban strategic reservoirs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SIMILARITY
AB Understanding the hydro-climatological controls on floods is fundamental for estimating flood frequency. The river flood regime is a reflection of a complex catchment hydrological response to flood producing processes. Hence, the catchment similarity in a flood regime is a feasible basis for identifying flood frequency pooling groups used in regional estimation of design events. This study describes a focused pooling approach that is based on flood regime information. A flood regime descriptor that is sensitive to the modality of the underlying temporal distribution of flood occurrences, and depicts both flood seasonal pattern and flood regularity, was developed and tested. The approach was applied to peaks-over-threshold data from a number of essentially rural sites using a site-focused pooling framework. The relative performance of this approach was evaluated and compared with the; performance of a pooling approach based on a previously used flood seasonality measure, using a regional bootstrap resampling technique. The regional bootstrap model was further used for quantifying the sensitivity of the proposed flood regime descriptor to the record length and the length of overlapping period. The results demonstrate that pooling based on the regime index proposed in this study out-performed the pooling based on the previously used seasonality measure in terms of both bias and RMSE of estimated flow quantiles. A detailed description of flood regime captured in the proposed index. provides sufficient information for effective regional estimation of extreme flow quantiles for the study area.

AB The broad length and aperture distributions are two characteristics of the heterogeneity of fractured media that make difficult, and even theoretically irrelevant, the application of homogenization techniques. We propose a numerical and theoretical study of the consequences of these two properties on the permeability of bidimensional synthetic fracture networks. We use a power law for the model of length distribution and a lognormal model for aperture distribution. We have especially studied the two endmost models for which length and aperture are (1) independent and (2) perfectly positively correlated. For the model without correlation between length and aperture we show that the permeability can be adequately characterized by a power-averaging function whose parameters are detailed in the text. In contrast, for the model with correlation we show that the prevailing parameter is the correlation when the power law length exponent a is lower than 3, whereas the random structure of the network is a second-order parameter. We also determine the permeability scaling and the scale dependence of the flow pattern structure. Three types of scale effects are found, depending exclusively on the geometrical properties of the network, i.e., on the length distribution parameter a. For a larger than 3, permeability decreases for scales below a definite correlation length and becomes constant above. We show in this case that a correlation between length and aperture does not fundamentally change the permeability model. In all other cases the correlation entails much larger-scale effects. For a in the range 1-3 in the case of an absence of correlation and for a in the range 2-3 in the case of correlation, permeability increases and tends to a limit, whereas the flow structure is channeled when permeability increases and tends to homogenize when permeability tends to its limit. We note that this permeability model is consistent with natural observations of permeability scaling. For a in the range 1-2, in the case of correlation, permeability increases with scale with no apparent limit. We characterize the channeled flow pattern, and we show that permeability may increase even when flow is distributed in several independent structures.

AB Fractured karst reservoirs play a significant role in hydrocarbon reserves and groundwater storage. They often exhibit complex multiscale heterogeneities involving pores, fractures and caves, whose length scales range from microns to tens or hundreds of meters. Thus, the study of fractured karst reservoirs is faced with a significant unresolved challenge in quantitatively characterizing the geometrical connectivity and hydraulic conductivity as well as their interrelationships in such strongly heterogeneous, multicomponent systems. In this paper, we propose an analytical formulation to characterize the connectivity of discrete fracture-cave networks building upon the excluded area concept of the percolation theory. By implementing a state-of-the-art computational model solving coupled Navier-Stokes (free flow) and Darcy (porous media flow) equations, we numerically derive the permeability of a fractured and karstified porous media, such that the relationship between the connectivity and permeability is further explored. The high-fidelity numerical model also permits us to elucidate the process of flow channelization within the fracture-cave network. The results show that the fracture-cave network connectivity correlates to the permeability via a power law scaling for connected systems. Significant flow channeling occurs around the percolation threshold where the flow is dominated by a limited number of preferential pathways. Caves play a crucial role in the flow due to the fact that caves could globally enhance the network connectivity and locally serve as hotspots for high fluid velocity. Finally, a semi-analytical permeability model for fractured karst reservoirs is developed. The results of our research and insights obtained have important implications for understanding the subsurface fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs.

AB In headwater catchments, streamflow recedes between periods of rainfall at a predictable rate generally defined by a power-law relationship relating streamflow decay to streamflow. Research over the last four decades has applied this relationship to predictions of water resource availability as well as estimations of basin-wide physiographic characteristics and ecohydrologic conditions. However, the interaction of biophysical processes giving rise to the form of these power-law relationships remains poorly understood, and recent investigations into the variability of streamflow recession characteristics between discrete events have alternatively suggested evapotranspiration, water table elevation, and stream network contraction as dominant factors, without consensus. To assess potential temporal variability and interactions in the mechanism(s) driving streamflow recession, we combine long-term observational data from a headwater stream in the southern Appalachian Mountains with state and flux conditions from a process-based ecohydrologic model. Streamflow recession characteristics are nonunique and vary systematically with seasonal fluctuations in both rates of transpiration and watershed wetness conditions, such that transpiration dominates recession signals in the early growing season and diminishes in effect as the water table elevation progressively drops below and decouples with the root zone with topographic position. As a result of this decoupling, there exists a seasonal hysteretic relationship between streamflow decay and both evapotranspiration and watershed wetness conditions. Results indicate that for portions of the year, forest transpiration may actively compete with subsurface drainage for the same water resource that supplies streamflow, though for extended time periods, these processes exploit distinct water stores. Our analysis raises concerns about the efficacy of assessing humid headwater systems using traditional recession analysis, with recession curve parameters treated as static features of the watershed, and we provide novel alternatives for evaluating interacting biological and geophysical drivers of streamflow recession.

AB Dynamics of a vegetated mixing layer around a patch of submerged plants was examined theoretically and experimentally in a lowland river. Theoretical analysis explored analogy with hydrodynamic mixing layers and introduced equations that describe expansion of the layers and alterations in mean flow. Field experiments provided empirical data for validation of the theory and examination of the effects of population density on the mixing layer dynamics. Detailed measurements assessed the structure of turbulent flow, plant morphology, biomechanical properties, bending, and streamlining due to interaction with the flow. The theory was compared with the field experiments and an agreement was concluded. It was found that near the upstream edge of the patch, the vegetated mixing layer expands similar to the canonical mixing layers, although its statistics scale on the velocity differential characteristic for the stabilized part. Downstream mean momentum flux reduces in magnitude and reverses in direction, while turbulence became dominant. This was observed to stabilize the velocity differential and increase the mean velocity of the layer that result in its limited growth described by a logarithmic function. The population density of vegetation was found to control the flow. In dense vegetation, the analogy with mixing layers resembled best, while in sparse vegetation, the flow behaved similar to the boundary layers. This theory can be used for quantitative assessment of seasonal effects in natural vegetated rivers because the population density of vegetation varies during the vegetation season. The companion paper focuses on the structural properties of turbulence in the vegetated shear layers.

DE Open channel flows; Analytical results; Power law cross-sections; Normal
   flow depth
AB Analytical results concerning open channel flows are presented, assuming that the cross-section is defined by a power law relationship between the channel width and the channel depth. Explicit equations to compute the normal flow depth are derived by considering the liquid discharge, the channel roughness height and the cross-section geometry (based on knowledge of the power law exponent, the reference width, and the reference depth) as known quantities.
   Such equations are deduced by writing the physical quantities as a power expansion in the power law exponent and expressing the wetted perimeter using a Gauss hypergeometric function. With the designed procedure, an accurate estimations of the integrals required to invert the uniform flow formula are obtained, at least for cross-sections characterized by aspect ratios of technical interest.
   Two relationships are proposed between the normal depth and the flow discharge. The first relationship is shown to work well for any discharge, provided that the width to depth ratio is sufficiently large. If this is not the case, the second procedure must be used for non-dimensional discharge larger than a given threshold, while the former procedure remains valid under the threshold.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of snow cover extent (SCE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) play vital roles in the hydrology of northern watersheds. We apply remotely sensed Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data from 1988 to 2007 to explore the relationships between snow distribution and the hydroclimatology of the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) of Canada and its major sub-basins. The Environment Canada (EC) algorithm is adopted to retrieve the SWE from SSM/I data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day maximum snow cover extent products (MOD10A2) are used to estimate the different thresholds of retrieved SWE from SSM/I to classify the land cover as snow or no snow for various sub-basins in the MRB. The sub-basins have varying topography and hence different thresholds that range from 10 mm to 30 mm SWE. The accuracy of snow cover mapping based on the combination of several thresholds for the different sub-basins reaches approximate to 90%. The northern basins are found to have stronger linear relationships between the date on which snow cover fraction (SCF) reaches 50% or when SWE reaches 50% and mean air temperatures, than the southern basins. Correlation coefficients between SCF. SWE, and hydroclimatological variables show the new SCF products from SSM/I perform better than SWE from SSM/I to analyze the relationships with the regional hydroclimatology. Statistical models relating SCF and SWE to runoff indicate that the SCF and SWE from EC algorithms are able to predict the discharge in the early snow ablation seasons in northern watersheds.

AB We compiled a data set of 541 bankfull measurements of alluvial rivers (see supporting information) and used Bayesian linear regression to examine empirical and theoretical support for the hypothesis that alluvial channels adjust to a predictable condition of basal shear stress as a function of sediment transport mode. An empirical closure based on channel slope, bankfull channel depth, and median grain size is proposed and results in the scaling of bankfull Shields stress with the inverse square root of particle Reynolds number. The empirical relationship is sufficient for purposes of quantifying paleohydraulic conditions in ancient alluvial channels. However, it is not currently appropriate for application to alluvial channels on extraterrestrial bodies because it depends on constant-valued, Earth-based coefficients.

AB We present a family of p-enrichment schemes. These schemes may be separated into two basic classes: the first, called fixed tolerance schemes, rely on setting global scalar tolerances on the local regularity of the solution, and the second, called dioristic schemes, rely on time-evolving bounds on the local variation in the solution. Each class of p-enrichment scheme is further divided into two basic types. The first type (the Type I schemes) enrich along lines of maximal variation, striving to enhance stable solutions in "areas of highest interest." The second type (the Type II schemes) enrich along lines of maximal regularity in order to maximize the stability of the enrichment process. Each of these schemes are tested on three model systems. The first is an academic exact system where basic analysis is easily performed. Then we discuss a pair of application model problems arising in coastal hydrology. The first being a contaminant transport model, which addresses a declinature problem for a contaminant plume with respect to a bay inlet setting. And the second, a multicomponent chemically reactive flow model of estuary eutrophication arising in the Gulf of Mexico. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nondilute transport in porous media results in fronts that are much sharper in space and time than the corresponding transport of a conservative, nonreactive dilute species. A thermodynamically constrained averaging theory model for such situations is developed. A novel closure scheme is formulated, which is cross-coupled between flow and transport in its most general form. Experiments are performed to investigate the effects of density, viscosity, and chemical activity. An adaptive numerical approximation method is developed to efficiently solve the formulated model. Parameter estimation is performed, and excellent agreement between laboratory data and model simulations is obtained. Accurate prediction of experimental data not used to estimate model parameters is found. It is also shown that chemical activity effects contribute to asymmetric breakthrough curves for nondilute transport in porous medium systems.

AB The fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) enable comparisons of humic-like (H-L) and fulvic-like (F-L) fluorescence intensities with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems. The fluorescence-DOC relationship differed in gradient, i.e. the fluorescence per gram of carbon, and in the strength of the correlation coefficient. We compare the fluorescence intensity of the F-L and H-L fractions and DOC of freshwater DOM in north Shropshire, England, featuring a river, wetland, spring, pond and sewage DOM sources. Correlations between fluorescence and DOC varied between sample sites. Wetland water samples for the F-L peak gave the best correlation, r = 0.756; the lowest correlation was from final treated sewage effluent, r = 0.167. The relationship between fluorescence and DOC of commercially available International Humic Substances Society standards were also examined and they generally showed a lower fluorescence per gram of carbon for the F-L peak than the natural samples, whereas peat wetland DOM gave a greater fluorescence per gram of carbon than river DOM. Here, we propose the strength of the fluorescence-DOC correlation to be a useful tool when discriminating sources of DOM in fresh water. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB [1] Henry Darcy was a distinguished engineer, scientist, and citizen who is remembered for his many contributions in hydraulics, including Darcy's law for flow in porous media. While he has been given full credit for the finding, little insight has been available on the process of his discovery. It is shown that his discovery was the logical result of a lifetime of education, professional practice, and research. Darcy understood both its significance and its relationship to the broader fields of hydraulics and groundwater hydrology. Besides the discovery of Darcy's law, he was the first to show that significant flow resistance occurs within aquifers, the first to recognize the law's similarity to Poiseuille flow, and the first to combine the law with continuity to obtain a solution for unsteady flow.

AB This study presents a procedure to determine improved curve numbers (CNImp) for application of the enhanced Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) model developed by Verma et al. for improved runoff prediction. To this end, five different mathematical relationships, i.e. linear, exponential, power, logarithmic and polynomial, are developed for 57 US Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) watersheds to compute CNImp with the aid of CN derivable from the National Engineering Handbook, Section-4 (NEH-4) table (CNT) and from the enhanced SCS-CN model (CNV) with significant R (2) values. Using these relationships, CNImp values are computed for another 57 watersheds for validation. Based on common performance criteria, all five developed relationships for CNImp are found to be superior to the original model in runoff computation. When compared, CNImp are close to CNV and very different from CNT. Despite the fact all the relationships performed equally well, with similar performance statistics, the exponential relationship performed the best of all and the power relationship was the worst.

AB This paper discusses the need for a well-considered approach to reconciling environmental theory with observations that has clear and compelling diagnostic power. This need is well recognized by the scientific community in the context of the 'Predictions in Ungaged Basins' initiative and the National Science Foundation sponsored 'Environmental Observatories' initiative, among others. It is suggested that many current strategies for confronting environmental process models with observational data tire inadequate in the face of the highly complex and high order models becoming central to modern environmental science. and steps are proposed towards the development of a robust and powerful 'Theory of Evaluation'. This paper presents the concept of a diagnostic evaluation approach rooted in information theory and employing the notion of signature indices that measure theoretically relevant system process behaviours. The signature-based approach addresses the issue of degree of system complexity resolvable by a model. Further, it can be placed in the context of Bayesian inference to facilitate uncertainty analysis. and can be readily applied to the problem of process evaluation leading to improved predictions in ungaged basins.

TI Coalition possibility of riparian countries via game theory and fuzzy

DT Article
ID WATER; ALLOCATION; COOPERATION; MARKETS; COST
AB In many respects, water resources allocation problems have fuzzy characteristics owing to uncertainty and imprecision not only as numerical data but also as linguistic data, in addition to the political nature of resource allocation. All classical techniques require numerical data and cannot treat linguistic data, but fuzzy inference systems (FIS) can deal with both types of data. Hence, it is suitable to reflect the dynamic nature of country benefits, reflective variations in the main drainage and subdrainage basin flows, and various system parameters in search of a coalition among a few riparian countries. The size of core, which is generated from a series of linear programming (LP) optimization models and game theory concepts, shows the potential extra benefit advantage of being in grand coalition to all parties, but it does not provide a sufficient condition to assemble a robust coalition unless an agreeable allocation scheme or principle is provided. In this respect, there is a fuzzy link between being in the grand coalition and percentage share received from a core. Hence, a proper FIS is proposed, and the necessary steps are developed with the Shapley value and the core as game theory methods, which provide a methodological base in the evaluation of possible allocation schemes among the parties. The application of the methodology is presented to search for coalition possibilities among the riparian countries: Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Basic results are generated over the application of the Inter-Temporal Euphrates and Tigris River Basin Model, which is an optimization model for the allocation of scarce water resources considering agricultural and urban uses, energy generation, and conveyance costs in the Euphrates-Tigris basin.

AB Critical path analysis and percolation theory are known to predict accurately de and low frequency ac electrical conductivity in strongly heterogeneous solids, and have some applications in statistics. Much of this work is dedicated to review the current state of these theories. Application to heterogeneous porous media has been slower, though the concept of percolation was invented in that context. The definition of the critical path is that path which traverses an infinitely large system, with no breaks, which has the lowest possible value of the largest resistance on the path. This resistance is called the rate-limiting, or critical, element, R-c. Mathematical schemes are known for calculating R-c in many cases, but this application is not the focus here. The condition under which critical path analysis and percolation theory are superior to other theories is when heterogeneities are so strong, that transport is largely controlled by a few rate-limiting transitions, and the entire potential field governing the transport is influenced by these individual processes. This is the limit of heterogeneous, deterministic transport, characterized by reproducibility (repeatability). This work goes on to show the issues in which progress with this theoretical approach has been slow tin particular, the relationship between a critical rate, or conductance, and the characteristic conductivity), and what progress is being made towards solving them. It describes applications to saturated and unsaturated flows, some of which are new. The state of knowledge regarding application of cluster statistics of percolation theory to find spatial variability and correlations in the hydraulic conductivity is summarized. Relationships between electrical and hydraulic conductivities are explored. Here, as for the relationship between saturated and unsaturated flows, the approach described includes new applications of existing concepts. The specific case of power-law distributions of pore sizes, a kind of "random" fractal soil is discussed (critical path analysis would not be preferred for calculating the hydraulic conductivity of a regular fractal).

AB Catchment morphology and drainage density are strongly influenced by hillslope processes. The consequences of several different hillslope process lapis are explored in a series of experiments with a numerical model of drainage basin evolution. Five different models are considered, including a simple diffusive-advective process transition, a runoff generation threshold, an erosion threshold, and two types of threshold-activated landsliding. These different hillslope processes alter both the visual appearance of the landscape and the predicted relationship between slope and contributing area. On the basis of the different threshold theories, we derive expressions for the relationships between drainage density and environmental factors such as rainfall, relief, and mean erosion rate. These relationships vary depending on the dominant hillslope threshold. In particular, the sign of the predicted relationship between drainage density and relief is positive in semiarid, low-relief landscapes and negative in humid landscapes dominated by a saturation threshold and/or in high-relief landscapes dominated by simple threshold landsliding.

ID REDUCTION FACTORS; STORM RAINFALL; FLASH-FLOOD; FRANCE; EVENT;
   DERIVATION; FRAMEWORK
AB We propose in this article a regional study of intensity-duration-area-frequency (IDAF) relationships of annual rainfall maxima in southern France. For this we develop a regional extreme value IDAF model based on space-time scale invariance hypotheses. The model allows us to link the statistical distributions of rainfall maxima over any duration and area. It provides in particular an analytical expression of the areal reduction factor, which expresses how the statistical distribution of rainfall maxima changes as the area increases, for any fixed duration. It also provides an analytical expression of areal return level for the continuum of area and duration. The model is applied to radar reanalysis data covering a 13,000-km(2) region of southern France featuring contrasted rainfall regimes (2008-2015). We estimate the IDAF relationships centered on any radar pixel of the region in the range 3-48 hr and 1-2,025 km(2). We obtain in particular a spatial distribution of the areal reduction factor, which allows us to distinguish different rainfall regimes in the region. The overall IDAF model provides also a regional quantification of areal rainfall risk by allowing the computation of rainfall return level maps for any area and duration in the applicable range. Despite inevitable sampling issues due to the shortness of the data sample, we highlight important differences in the spatial distribution of areal rainfall risk depending on the area and duration, illustrating that a comprehensive storm risk evaluation should consider the continuum of area and duration rather than arbitrarily predefined ones.

AB It is widely recognized that vegetation changes can significantly affect the local water availability. Methods have been developed to predict the effects of vegetation change on water yield or total streamflow. However, it is still a challenge to predict changes in base flow following vegetation change due to limited understanding of catchment storage-discharge dynamics. In this study, the power law relationship for describing catchment storage-discharge dynamics is reformulated to quantify the changes in storage-discharge relationship resulting from vegetation changes using streamflow data from six paired-catchment experiments, of which two are deforestation catchments and four are afforestation catchments. Streamflow observations from the paired-catchment experiments clearly demonstrate that vegetation changes have led to significant changes in catchment storage-discharge relationships, accounting for about 83-128% of the changes in groundwater discharge in the treated catchments. Deforestation has led to increases in groundwater discharge (or base flow) but afforestation has resulted in decreases in groundwater discharge. Further analysis shows that the contribution of changes in groundwater discharge to the total changes in streamflow varies greatly among experimental catchments ranging from 12% to 80% with a mean of 38 +/- 22% (mu +/- sigma). This study proposed a new method to quantify the effects of vegetation changes on groundwater discharge from catchment storage and will improve our predictability about the impacts of vegetation changes on catchment water yields.

AB Turbulence theory has demonstrated that the log law is one of the established theoretical results for describing velocity profiles, which is in principle applicable for the near-bed overlap region, being less than about 20% of the flow depth. In comparison, the power law that is often presented in an empirical fashion could apply to larger fraction of the flow domain. However, limited information is available for evaluating the power-law exponent or index. This paper attempts to show that the power law can be derived as a first-order approximation to the log law, and its power-law index is computed as a function of the Reynolds number as well as the relative roughness height. The result obtained also coincides with the fact that the one-sixth power included in the Manning equation is of prevalent acceptance, while higher indexes would be required for flows over very rough boundaries.

AB Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) computations of single phase, pore-to-pore conductance are compared to models in which such conductances are computed via standard pore body-channel-pore body series resistance (SR), with the conductance of each individual element (pore body, channel) based on geometric shape factor measurements. The LB computations, based upon actual channel geometry derived from X-ray computed tomographic imagery, reveal that the variation in conductance for channels having similar shape factor is much larger than is adequately captured by the geometric models. Fits to the dependence of median value of conductance versus shape factor from the LB-based computations show a power law dependence of higher power than that predicted by the geometric models. We introduce two network flow models based upon the LB conductance computations: one model is based upon LB computations for each pore-to-pore connection; the second is based upon a power law fit to the relationship between computed conductance and throat shape factor. Bulk absolute permeabilities for Fontainebleau sandstone images are computed using the SR-based network models and the two LB-based models. Both LB-based network models produce bulk absolute permeability values that fit published data more accurately than the SR-based models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although important for riverine solute and nutrient fluxes, the connections between biogeochemical processes and subsurface hydrology remain poorly characterized. We investigate these couplings in the East River, CO, a high-elevation shale-dominated catchment in the Rocky Mountains, using concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for major cations, anions, and organic carbon. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) displays a positive C-Q relationship with clockwise hysteresis, indicating mobilization and depletion of DOC in the upper soil horizons and emphasizing the importance of shallow flow paths during snowmelt. Cation and anion concentrations demonstrate that carbonate weathering, which dominates solute fluxes, is promoted by both sulfuric acid derived from pyrite oxidation in the shale bedrock and carbonic acid derived from subsurface respiration. Sulfuric acid weathering dominates during base flow conditions when waters infiltrate below the inferred pyrite oxidation front, whereas carbonic acid weathering plays a dominant role during snowmelt as a result of shallow flow paths. Differential C-Q relationships between solutes suggest that infiltrating waters approach calcite saturation before reaching the pyrite oxidation front, after which sulfuric acid reduces carbonate alkalinity. This reduction in alkalinity results in CO2 outgassing when waters equilibrate to surface conditions, and reduces the riverine export of carbon and alkalinity by roughly 33% annually. Future changes in snowmelt dynamics that control the balance of carbonic and sulfuric acid weathering may substantially alter carbon cycling in the East River. Ultimately, we demonstrate that differential C-Q relationships between major solutes can provide unique insights into the complex subsurface flow and biogeochemical dynamics that operate at catchment scales.

AB While large-scale terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) information is essential for our understanding of the Earth's water and energy cycles, substantial differences exist in current global ET products due partly to uncertainties in soil- and vegetation-related parameters and/or precipitation forcing. Here a calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) model, driven purely by routine meteorological forcing (air and dew-point temperature, wind speed, and net radiation), mainly from ERA5, was employed to estimate global ET rates during 1982-2016. Modeled ET agrees favorably with (a) monthly eddy-covariance measurements of 129 global FLUXNET sites, and; (b) water-balance-derived ET of 52 basins at the multiyear mean and annual scales. Additional evaluations demonstrate that the CR is very competitive, in comparison with other 12 widely used global ET products. The 35-years mean global land ET rate from the CR is 500 +/- 6 mm yr(-1) (72.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(3) km(3) yr(-1)) with more than 70% of the land area exhibiting increasing annual ET rates over the study period. Globally, CR ET significantly increased at a rate of 0.31 mm yr(-1) during 1982-2016, suggesting a 2.2% increase in global land ET over last 35 years. Model inter-comparisons indicate that global annual CR ET values and their trend are close to the median of not only the 12 ET products chosen but also that of 20 CMIP6 models. Since this calibration-free CR model requires no precipitation (except in sea-shore deserts for a subsequent ET correction), vegetation or soil data, it could be incorporated into complex hydrological and/or climate models, thereby facilitating large-scale hydrological and climate simulations.

AB [1] Conceptual and mathematical models are presented that explain tracer breakthrough tailing in the absence of significant matrix diffusion. Model predictions are compared to field results from radially convergent, weak-dipole, and push-pull tracer experiments conducted in a saturated crystalline bedrock. The models are based upon the assumption that flow is highly channelized, that the mass of tracer in a channel is proportional to the cube of the mean channel aperture, and the mean transport time in the channel is related to the square of the mean channel aperture. These models predict the consistent -2 straight line power law slope observed in breakthrough from radially convergent and weak-dipole tracer experiments and the variable straight line power law slope observed in push-pull tracer experiments with varying injection volumes. The power law breakthrough slope is predicted in the absence of matrix diffusion. A comparison of tracer experiments in which the flow field was reversed to those in which it was not indicates that the apparent dispersion in the breakthrough curve is partially reversible. We hypothesize that the observed breakthrough tailing is due to a combination of local hydrodynamic dispersion, which always increases in the direction of fluid velocity, and heterogeneous advection, which is partially reversed when the flow field is reversed. In spite of our attempt to account for heterogeneous advection using a multipath approach, a much smaller estimate of hydrodynamic dispersivity was obtained from push-pull experiments than from radially convergent or weak dipole experiments. These results suggest that although we can explain breakthrough tailing as an advective phenomenon, we cannot ignore the relationship between hydrodynamic dispersion and flow field geometry at this site. The design of the tracer experiment can severely impact the estimation of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion in highly heterogeneous geologic media.

AB Wet-surface evaporation equations related to the Penman equation can be represented graphically on vapor pressure (e) versus temperature (T) graphs (Qualls & Crago, 2020, ). Here, actual regional evaporation is represented graphically on (e, T) graphs using the Complementary Relationship (CR) between actual and apparent potential evaporation. The CR proposed by the authors can be represented in a simple and intuitive geometric form, in which lines representing the regional latent heat flux, LE, and the wet surface (Priestley & Taylor, 1972, ) evaporation rate, LEPT, intersect at e = 0. This approach allows a graphical estimate of LE (or the corresponding mathematical formulation), provided available energy, wind speed, air temperature and humidity, and roughness lengths for momentum and sensible heat are available. The wet surface temperature is needed, and a calculation method for it is provided. The formulation works well using monthly data from seven sites in Australia, even when the same value of the Priestley & Taylor parameter alpha is used for all sites. Overall, compared to eddy covariance measurements, root mean square difference averaged 19 W m(-2); this compares favorably with the CR formulation proposed by Brutsaert (2015, ).

AB With the continuous construction of reservoir group systems and the improvement in flood control objectives in China, a demand has arisen for joint flood control operations of reservoir groups in river basins. However, the existing conventional flood control operation rule (CFCOR) of most reservoirs are based generally on a simple discriminant and there is a lack of coordination among the reservoir group. Further, owing to a shortage of high-precision, long-term forecasting schemes and forecasting professionals for reservoirs in small and medium river basins, it is difficult to obtain acceptable results when applying the forecasting-operation mode. Therefore, an optimal joint flood control operation rule (OJFCOR) of parallel reservoir groups is proposed in this study based on the Aggregation-Decomposition method (AGDP). This proposed rule comprises the aggregated reservoir flood control operation chart and the decomposition strategy named occupied flood regulation storage capacity ratio method (OFRSCR). We applied the simulation-optimisation method (SLOS) nested annealing accuracy penalty function method-adaptive multi-variant particle swarm optimisation (AAPF-AMPSO) to optimise OJFCOR, with the objective function being the maximum average peak-cutting rate of the flood control section. A case study was conducted with a parallel reservoir group located in the upper reaches of the Lijiang River basin (URLRB). Our results showed that, compared with the widely used inflow ratio method (IR), the performance of OFRSCR was a more suitable decomposition strategy and superior in maintaining the synchronisation of the parallel reservoir group. Further, OJFCOR showed a satisfactory peak-cutting effect on floods with different rainstorm centres and flood magnitudes, with the average flood peak-cutting rate of 37.68%, which is superior to those of CFCOR (25.26%) and DP (32.69%), but inferior to that of POA-DPSA (45.23%). Besides strong peak-cutting ability and strong adaptability, OJFCOR also has advantages of smooth outflow process and being convenient for professional operators. Generally, the OJFCOR proposed in this research was found reasonable and effective, and it was shown suitable for practical real-time flood control operations and reducing the effects of flood disasters.

AB A semianalytical solution is presented for transient streaming potentials associated with flow to a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer, taking into account the effect of flow in the unsaturated zone above the water table. Flow in the unsaturated zone is modeled with a linearized form of Richards' equation using an exponential model for soil moisture retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Archie's law is invoked for unsaturated electrical conductivity. The unsaturated electrokinetic coupling coefficient is modeled with a decaying exponential, where the maximum value is at and below the water table. The coupled flow and electrokinetic problem is solved using Laplace and Hankel transforms. The results of the model predicted behavior are presented and compared to that observed in laboratory simulations of pumping tests. The early time polarity reversal predicted the model is observable in the experiments. Other nonmonotonic streaming potential behaviors predicted by the model are also evident in experimental measurements. The model is used to estimate hydraulic parameters from SP data and these compare well to those obtained from drawdown data. For example, a hydraulic conductivity of 3.6 x 10(-4) m/s is obtained from SP data compared to 3.4 x 10(-4) m/s from drawdown data.

AB The study of hyporheic exchange and the temperature response law driven by spur dikes is helpful to promote the protection of ecological river environments. Taking the river channel course with a spur dike as the research object, the numerical simulation method was used to study the influence of the river width narrowing rate (L/B), spur dike angle (theta), surface water velocity (U), and hydraulic conductivity (K) on the hyporheic exchange characteristics and the temperature response of the hyporheic zone. Research shows that the degree of hyporheic exchange and the spatial range of the temperature response of the hyporheic zone are positively correlated with the river width narrowing rate, surface water velocity and hydraulic conductivity and negatively correlated with the spur dike angle. The temperature response law of the hyporheic zone is affected by spur dikes in different spatial locations in the following ways, from the cross-section, the upstream response area of the spur dike deepens near the dam bank, while the downstream response area deepens on the other side of the spur dikes, and the downstream response area affected by spur dikes is significantly larger than the upstream response area in the vertical range. From the side section, the response area of the curved boundary appears around the spur dike in the central section of the river, and the curvature radius of the response area of the curved boundary around the spur dike in the side section near the dam is smaller. From the longitudinal section, the sensitivity of the temperature response of the shallow section is significantly stronger than that of the deep section. Consequently, we found that the hyporheic exchange law driven by spur dikes. We offer recommendations for future studies seeking to choose the reasonable structure of the spur dam in practical engineering, and optimize the design of the spur dam.

AB Tracer approaches have been used worldwide to clarify time and geographic sources of stream water in catchments, although the relationship between these two sources is poorly discussed. We considered the mean residence time (MRT) and its spatial distribution to determine the relationship between geographic source components and time source components. There were clear differences in solute concentrations and MRT among shallow, middle, and bottom layers along the vertical profile of the riparian groundwater body. Those in the stream water were intermediate compared to those in the shallow and middle layers; thus, the consistent geographic sources were groundwater in these layers. In the context of end-members mixing analysis (EMMA), however, the end-members were rainfall, hillslope groundwater, and riparian groundwater in the bottom layer. The other riparian groundwaters were a mixture of end-members. The discrepancy between the geographic sources and the end-members was resolved by considering the MRT, the time required to move the end-member or geographic source within the catchment. Our approach clarified the relationships among the geographic sources, time sources, and hydrological pathways, which are the essential factors of runoff generation processes and hydrochemical processes. Therefore, to go beyond previous applications of EMMA on the basis of systematic learning from observed data, it is insightful to combine the common approaches to analyze landscape heterogeneity and process complexity and to reconsider the framework of the hydrobiogeochemical models in various regions and at multiple spatial scales.

AB Accelerated glacier-snow-permafrost erosion due to global warming amplifies the sediment availability in cold environments and affects the time-varying suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge (Q) relationship. Here, the sediment-availability-transport (SAT) model is proposed to simulate dynamic SSC-Q relationships by integrating the sediment availability coupled by thermal processes, fluvial processes and long-term storage exhaustion into a sediment rating curve (SSC = a x Q(b) with a and b as fitting parameters). In the SAT-model, increased sediment sources from glacier-snow-permafrost erosion are captured by changes in basin temperature, showing an exponential amplification of SSC when basin temperature increases. Enhanced fluvial erosion by the elevated water supply from rainfall and meltwater is captured by the factor of runoff surge, which results in a linear amplification of SSC. The SAT-model is validated for the permafrost-dominated Tuotuohe basin on Tibetan Plateau utilizing multi-decadal daily SSC/Q in-situ observations (1985-2017). Results show that sediment rating curves for Tuotuohe display significant inter-annual variations. The higher parameter-b in a warmer and wetter climate confirms the increased sediment availability due to the expanded erodible landscapes and gullying-enhanced connectivity between channels and slopes. Through capturing such time-varying sediment availability, the SAT-model can robustly reproduce the long-term evolution, seasonality, and various event-scale hysteresis of SSC, including clockwise, counter-clockwise, figure-eight, counter-figure-eight, and more complex hysteresis loops. Overall, the SAT-model can explain over 75% of long-term SSC variance with stable performance under hydroclimate abrupt changes, outperforming the conventional and static sediment rating curve approach by 20%. The SAT-model not only advances understanding of sediment transport mechanisms by integrating thermal- and fluvial-erosion processes, but also provides a model framework to simulate and project future sediment loads in other cold basins.

AB A storage-discharge relation tells us how discharge will change when new water enters a hydrologic system but not which water is released. Does an incremental increase in discharge come from faster turnover of older water already in storage? Or are the recent inputs rapidly delivered to the outlet, "short-circuiting" the bulk of the system? Here I demonstrate that the concepts of storage-discharge relationships and transit time distributions can be unified into a single relationship that can usefully address these questions: the age-ranked storage-discharge relation. This relationship captures how changes in total discharge arise from changes in the turnover rate of younger and older water in storage and provides a window into both the celerity and velocity of water in a catchment. This leads naturally to a distinction between cases where an increase in total discharge is accompanied by an increase (old water acceleration), no change (old water steadiness), or a decrease in the rate of discharge of older water in storage (old water suppression). The simple theoretical case of a power law age-ranked storage-discharge relations is explored to illustrate these cases. Example applications to data suggest that the apparent presence of old water acceleration or suppression is sensitive to the functional form chosen to fit to the data, making it difficult to draw decisive conclusions. This suggests new methods are needed that do not require a functional form to be chosen and provide age-dependent uncertainty bounds.

AB Hydrological processes of lowland watersheds of the southern USA are not well understood compared to a hilly landscape due to their unique topography, soil compositions, and climate. This study describes the seasonal relationships between rainfall patterns and runoff (sum of storm flow and base flow) using 13 years (1964-1976) of rainfall and stream flow data for a low-gradient, third-order forested watershed. It was hypothesized that runoff-rainfall ratios (R/P) are smaller during the dry periods (summer and fall) and greater during the wet periods (winter and spring). We found a large seasonal variability in event R/P potentially due to differences in forest evapotranspiration that affected seasonal soil moisture conditions. Linear regression analysis results revealed a significant relationship between rainfall and runoff for wet (r(2) = 0.68; p < 0.01) and dry (r(2) = 0.19; p = 0.02) periods. Rainfall-runoff relationships based on a 5-day antecedent precipitation index (API) showed significant (r(2) = 0.39; p < 0.01) correspondence for wet but not r(2) = 0.02; p = 0.56) for dry conditions. The same was true for rainfall-runoff relationships based on 30-day API (r(2) = 0.39; p < 0.01 for wet and r(2) = 0.00; p = 0.79 for dry). Stepwise regression analyses suggested that runoff was controlled mainly by rainfall amount and initial soil moisture conditions as represented by the initial flow rate of a storm event. Mean event R/P were higher for the wet period (R/P = 0.33), and the wet antecedent soil moisture condition based on 5-day (R/P = 0.25) and 30-day (R/P = 0.26) prior API than those for the dry period conditions. This study suggests that soil water status, i.e. antecedent soil moisture and groundwater table level, is important besides the rainfall to seasonal runoff generation in the coastal plain region with shallow soil argillic horizons.

AB [1] In this study we use fuzzy sets to describe uncertainty in aquifer parameters and demonstrate the use of this information in optimal design of pump-and-treat systems. On the basis of uncertainty in aquifer parameters, two optimization models are formulated, where pumping rates are represented as either deterministic or fuzzy decision variables. Both models with fuzzy constants and fuzzy variables are then transformed into computationally efficient algorithms through the application of fuzzy set theory. The resulting models are solved by optimization algorithms such as golden section search, genetic algorithm (GA), and direct comparison methods. Several examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the models and algorithms presented in this study. The numerical results, which are also compared with the results obtained from probabilistic analysis, show that the optimal solutions obtained from both models provide flexible and reliable pump-and-treat strategies and may increase the effectiveness of the remediation system under uncertainty.

AB The Washburn theory is frequently applied to determine the wetting angle of soils. It is based on the porous medium being characterized as a set of cylindrical, straight capillaries. It is clear that this is an oversimplification as real soil pores vary at least as regards two important features: cross-section and tortuosity. In this study, a mathematical model of meniscus movement in a tortuous, sinusoidal shaped capillary was developed and the obtained analytical expressions for the wetting angle and for the pore radius were compared with the appropriate formula concerning the Washburn theory. The results demonstrate that the wetting angle of water in soil determined on the basis of the measured wetting front kinetics and of Washburn equations is likely to have an overestimated value due to the wavy, tortuous nature of inter-soil grain pores. The above conclusion was confirmed by capillary rise experiments. Wetting angles of methyl alcohol and of water measured on flat glass were 0 and 27.4 degrees, respectively. Apparent wetting angles calculated from capillary rise in powdered glass kinetics and Washburn equation were 70 and 83 degrees respectively. If the pore structure characteristics of porous media are not taken into account the applicability of the Washburn theory for soil wettability estimation seems to be very limited.

ID RAINDROP SPECTRA; PRECIPITATION
AB Power law models that relate rainfall rate and radar reflectivity factor are the principal topic of this paper. Two interrelated problems associated with these models are examined: (1) estimation of parameters of power law models, and (2) assessment of the accuracy of rainfall rate estimates derived from power law models. A statistical model of raindrop processes is used for analysis of both problems. The model provides explicit representations of power law model parameter estimates and the error of rainfall rate-reflectivity relationships in terms of simple representations of raindrop processes. These results are used to examine issues related to parameterization of algorithms for radar rainfall estimation including (1) bounds on power law model parameter estimates, (2) climatological variability of power law model parameters, (3) seasonal variability of power law model parameters, and (4) multiplicative bias in radar rainfall estimates. Empirical analyses are carried out using drop size data from a number of sites. Detailed analyses are carried out for a data set from North Carolina.

TI Drought early warning system in reservoir operation: Theory and practice
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INDEX
AB This paper revises the drought early warning system (DEWS) for reservoir operation, originally developed by Huang and Yuan (2004). The changes are made in response to requirements raised by the Water Resources Agency in Taiwan. We extend the DEWS to include a number of new factors: in particular, to take into account meteorological drought and the determination of alert levels in policy making based on information entropy. The goals of this paper are critical: (1) revising the DEWS based on experience, (2) examining a specific case study of how the system works, (3) involving users in decision making, and (4) comparing theory with practice. The Shihmen reservoir in northern Taiwan was picked by the agency as a real-case study. In hindsight, the revised drought early warning system performed well over a simulation of five consecutive years (1999-2003). These results verify the applicability of this renewed DEWS in reservoir operation for lowering potential drought threats.

AB Droughts constrain environmental, economic, and social development around the world. Reservoir hedging rules are commonly used to reduce the risk of severe water shortages, but the effects are closely related to the characteristic of the reservoir water supply system. Previous studies have limited understanding of the key system characteristics that help to determine whether hedging rules are beneficial for drought mitigation. To fill this gap, this study carries out experiments with a hedging rule triggered by drought limited water level (DLWL). We explore the impact of DLWL on system performance i.e., water supply reliability, resilience, and vulnera-bility, with a range of hypothetical reservoirs, propose the criterion to decide whether the DLWL is applicable, and identify characteristics of reservoirs where DLWL is not applicable via a scenario discovery method. Three types of reservoirs where DLWL is not applicable are identified. Type I and type II experience structural deficits. Type I is characterized by scarce water resources (m < 0.44) and high inflow uncertainty (Cv > 0.60). Type II is mainly characterized by the low reservoir regulation capacity (SI < 0.35). In the type III systems, water demand can always be satisfied and is characterized by the abundance of water resources (m > 0.98) and adequate regulation capacity (SI > 1.02). For the rest of the reservoirs where DLWL is applicable, a multi-objective DLWL optimization method is put forward. Qing River Reservoir in Northeast China is taken as a base case to demonstrate the effectiveness of DLWL and study the influence of changing hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions on optimal seasonal DLWLs. Results indicate that to cope with increasing water supply pressure featured by increasing total demand, decreasing streamflow, and higher streamflow uncertainty, DLWL during the high-water demand periods ought to be raised and DLWL during the dry season that guides water supply for several months ought to be lowered. Insights from this work have general merit for instructing reservoir man-agers to take effective drought mitigation measures.

ID MODEL; DISSOLUTION; ANISOTROPY
AB Precipitation and dissolution reactions in fractures alter apertures, which in turn affects their flow and transport properties. We consider aperture alteration by precipitation in a "gradient-reaction" regime where fluids are close to chemical equilibrium with a mineral everywhere, but precipitation is driven by solubility gradients. Monte Carlo simulations on computer-generated aperture fields suggest that the most important feature of fracture alteration by precipitation is the formation of elongated precipitate bodies perpendicular to the mean flow direction. The simulation results provide a basis for a proposed upscaling relationship between mean aperture and the effective transmissivity tensor, incorporating a critical aperture at which the transmissivity decreases steeply.

AB The number, size, and shape of lakes are key determinants of the ecological functionality of a lake district. The lake area scaling relationships with lake number and volume enable upscaling biogeochemical processes and spatially considering organisms' metapopulation dynamics. These relationships vary regionally depending on the geomorphological context, particularly in the range of lake area <1 km(2) and mountainous regions. The Cajas Massif (Southern Ecuador) holds a tropical mountain lake district with 5955 water bodies. The number of lakes deviates from a power law relationship with the lake area at both ends of the size range; similarly to the distributions found in temperate mountain ranges. The deviation of each distribution tail does not respond to the same cause. The marked relief limits the size of the largest lakes at high altitudes, whereas ponds are prompt to a complete infilling. A bathymetry survey of 202 lakes, selected across the full-size range, revealed a volume-area scaling coefficient larger than those found for other lake areas of glacial origin but softer relief. Water renewal time is not consistently proportional to the lake area due to the volume-area variation in midsize lakes. The 85% of the water surface is in lakes >10(4) m(2) and 50% of the water resources are held in a few ones (similar to 10) deeper than 18 m. Therefore, midlakes and large lakes are by far more biogeochemically relevant than ponds and shallow lakes in this tropical mountain lake district.

AB Local drainage density (dd) has been traditionally defined as the inverse of twice the distance one has to walk before encountering a channel. This formalization easily allows to derive raster-based maps of dd extracted straight off from digital elevation model data. Maps of local dd, which are continuous in space, are able to reveal the appearance of strong heterogeneities in the geological and geomorphological properties of natural landscapes across different scales. In this work we employ the information provided by these spatial maps to study the potential effects of the within-catchment variability of dd on the hydrologic response. A simple power law relationship between runoff yield at the local scale and the value of dd has been adopted; the hypothesis is supported by a large number of past empirical observations and modeling. The novel framework proposed (ddRWF) embeds this spatially variable runoff weight in the well-known Rescaled Width Function (RWF) framework, based on the more general geomorphological theory of the hydrologic response. The model is applied to four sub-basins in the Cascade Range Region (Oregon, USA) where strong contrasts in dissection patterns due the underlain geology have been broadly addressed in previous literature. The ddRWF approach is compared with the classic RWF in terms of shape, moments and peak of the simulated hydrograph response. Results hint that the variability of runoff yield due to the heterogeneity of dd (i.e. of hillslope lengths) determines a more rapid concentration of runoff, which implies shorter lag times, larger skewness and higher peak floods, especially in the case hillslope velocity is much smaller than channel velocity. The potential of the proposed framework relies on accounting for spatially variable losses related to geomorphologic heterogeneity in lumped rainfall-runoff models, still keeping the simple and robust structure of the IUH approach.

AB This study presents a new model for description of hysteretic constitutive relationships between capillary pressure and saturation under capillary-dominated multiphase flow conditions in porous media. Hysteretic relationships are required for accurate prediction of spatial and temporal distribution of multiphase fluids in response to successively occurring drainage and imbibition events in porous media. In addition to contact angle effects, connectivity of the void space in the porous medium plays a central role for the macroscopic manifestation of hysteresis behavior and capillary entrapment of wetting and nonwetting fluids. The hysteretic constitutive model developed in this work uses void-size distribution and a measure of connectivity for void space to compute the hysteretic curves and to predict entrapped fluid-phase saturations. Two functions, the drainage connectivity function and the wetting connectivity function, are introduced to characterize connectivity of fluids in void space during drainage and wetting processes. These functions can be estimated through pore-scale simulations in computer-generated porous media or from traditional experimental measurements of primary drainage and main wetting curves. The hysteresis model results are verified by comparing the model predicted scanning curves with 3-D pore-scale simulations as well as with actual data sets obtained from column experiments found in the literature.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Editorial Material
AB Ma and Zhang (2017) note a concern they have with our rescaled Complementary Relationship (CR) for land surface evaporation when daily average wind speeds are very low (perhaps less than 1 m/s). We discuss conditions and specific formulations that lead to this concern, but ultimately argue that under these conditions, a key assumption behind the CR itself may not be satisfied at the daily time scale. Thus, careful consideration of the reliability of the CR is needed when wind speeds are very low.

ID INFORMATION; MODELS; CALIBRATION; MULTIPLE; INCOHERENCE; SYSTEMS
AB Uncertainty is an epistemological concept in the sense that any meaningful understanding of uncertainty requires a theory of knowledge. Therefore, uncertainty resulting from scientific endeavors can only be properly understood in the context of a well-defined philosophy of science. Our main message here is that much of the discussion about uncertainty in hydrology has lacked grounding in these foundational concepts, and has resulted in a controversy that is largely the product of logical errors rather than true (axiomatic) disagreement. As an example, we explore the current debate about the appropriate role of probability theory for hydrological uncertainty quantification. Our main messages are: (1) apparent (and/or claimed) limitations of probability theory are not actually consequences of that theory, but rather of deeper underlying epistemological (and ontological) issues; (2) questions about the appropriateness of probability theory are only meaningful if posed as questions about our preferred philosophy of science; and (3) questions about uncertainty may often be better posed as questions about available information and information use efficiency. Our purpose here is to discuss how hydrologists might ask more meaningful questions about uncertainty.

AB Subsurface stormflow is an important component of the rainfall-runoff response, especially in steep terrain. Its contribution to total runoff is, however, poorly represented in the current generation of land surface models. The lack of physical basis of these common parameterizations precludes a priori estimation of the stormflow (i.e. without calibration), which is a major drawback for prediction in ungauged basins, or for use in global land surface models. This paper is aimed at deriving regionalized parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship relating to subsurface stormflow from a top-down empirical data analysis of streamflow recession curves extracted from 50 eastern United States catchments. Detailed regression analyses were performed between parameters of the empirical storage-discharge relationships and the controlling climate, soil and topographic characteristics. The regression analyses performed on empirical recession curves at catchment scale indicated that the coefficient of the power-law form storage-discharge relationship is closely related to the catchment hydrologic characteristics, which is consistent with the hydraulic theory derived mainly at the hillslope scale. As for the exponent, besides the role of field scale soil hydraulic properties as suggested by hydraulic theory, it is found to be more strongly affected by climate (aridity) at the catchment scale. At a fundamental level these results point to the need for more detailed exploration of the co-dependence of soil, vegetation and topography with climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An extreme value analysis (EVA) point process approach has been implemented to examine the flood characteristics of Puerto Rico when tropical cyclones (TCs) are present in the discharge series and when they are removed from it. Mean daily discharge values that exceeded the 99th percentile thresholds were used in both the TC and non-TC data series. In nine of the 12 stations the maximum discharge was associated with a TC, with hurricanes Hortense (1996), Georges (1998) and Eloise (1975) responsible for most of the maximum peaks at each site. Percentage changes in the generalized extreme value parameters, which include location (central tendency), scale (variance) and shape (skewness), between the TC and non-TC data exhibited a decrease in the majority of stations. Stations in the eastern interior and central region of the island showed the largest decrease in all parameters, in flood occurrences and in return periods when TCs were removed from the series.

AB Data-driven flood forecasting methods are useful, especially for rivers that lack information required for building physical models. Although the former methods can forecast river stages using only past water levels and rainfall data, they cannot easily predict unprecedented water levels and require a large amount of data to build accurate models. We focus on phase-space reconstruction approaches based on dynamical systems theory and develop a practical data-driven forecasting method to overcome existing problems. The proposed method can predict unprecedented water levels owing to a proposed correction term, and provide forecasts using only a small number of water level increase events. We applied the proposed method to data from actual rivers and it achieved the best forecast performance among existing data-driven methods, including a multilayer perceptron, and a conventional method based on phase-space reconstruction. In addition, the proposed method forecasted the exceedance of the evacuation warning level 6 h earlier for small and steep rivers. Given its performance and maintainability, the proposed method can be applied to many gauged rivers to facilitate early evacuation.

AB Investigation of seepage law of fluid flow through a self-affine, rough fracture has attracted broad attention because of its fundamental importance for complex hydrodynamic problems. Although it is natural to assume that permeability value depends on aperture size, it is hard to determine which is the appropriate relationship between them because of the large number of parameters related to the multi-scale geometries and mismatched behaviors in internal surfaces. Moreover, those parameters are hard to obtain by field observation or laboratory tests. For these, we focused on synthesising mismatched composite topography of natural fractures and numerical simulation of fluid flow through them at pore scale. Firstly, the control mechanism of self-affine property was clarified, and a novel Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) function was proposed to model self-affine profile as per fractal topography theory. Afterwards, a weighting algorithm was developed to construct the composite topography of fractures accounting for the mismatched behavior. Finally, the effects of mismatched behavior, hydraulic and surface tortuosities on fracture flow were systematically analyzed by numerical simulations using Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) at pore scale. Our investigation indicates that the aperture distribution is dominated by the mismatched range between internal surfaces, however the hydraulic and surface tortuosity effects are approximately scaled by 2(H - 1) (H is the Hurst exponent) with the mean aperture despite of its distribution. Moreover, it was found that the local surface roughness factor, accounting for effects from surface geometries with size smaller than the value of mean aperture, is stationary at long range and inversely proportional to fracture permeability. Based on above discussions, the validity of triple-effect model for permeability prediction of mismatched self-affine fractures was established.

ID HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA; TURBULENCE; PERMEABILITY; CONDUCTIVITY;

AB We develop a model and a framework for understanding the explicitly resolved, large-scale dynamics of groundwater flow in fully saturated, heterogeneous porous media. The approach is based upon the large eddy simulation (LES) methodology from geophysical fluid dynamics. The idea behind the LES approach is to explicitly resolve the larger scales of flow and provide a closure model for the effect of subgrid scales upon resolved scales. The technical foundation of the method rests on a spatial filtering operation, which allows one to precisely define the scale of the model. We spatially filter Darcy's law and the continuity equation to produce a model for the resolved-scale dynamics. We develop LES approximations for 'the resulting flow equations and a closure model for unresolved, subgrid-scale terms. We model the subgrid terms using resolved-scale quantities only and thus do not require subgrid-scale information. The accuracy of these closure models depends upon the scale at which hydraulic conductivity is ''measured'' by field tests. We characterize the approximations used to model subgrid-scale effects asymptotically with a small parameter, the dimensionless filter widths, defined as the ratio of the filter width to the dominant length scale of the explicitly resolved variables.

AB Subsurface fluid flow and solute transport take place in a multiscale heterogeneous environment. Neither these phenomena nor their host environment can be observed or described with certainty at all scales and locations of relevance, The resulting ambiguity has led to alternative conceptualizations of flow and transport and multiple ways of addressing their scale and space-time dependencies. We focus our attention on four approaches that give rise to nonlocal representations of advective and dispersive transport of nonreactive tracers in randomly heterogeneous porous or fractured continua. We compare these approaches theoretically on the basis of their underlying premises and the mathematical forms of the corresponding nonlocal advective-dispersive terms. One of the four approaches describes transport at some reference support scale by a classical (Fickian) advection-dispersion equation (ADE) in which velocity is a spatially (and possibly temporally) correlated random field. The randomness of the velocity, which is given by Darcy's law, stems from random fluctuations in hydraulic conductivity (and advective porosity though this is often disregarded). Averaging the stochastic ADE over an ensemble of velocity fields results in a space-time-nonlocal representation of mean advective-dispersive flux, an approach we designate as stnADE. A closely related space-time-non local representation of ensemble mean transport is obtained upon averaging the motion of solute particles through a random velocity field within a Lagrangian framework, an approach we designate stnL The concept of continuous time random walk (CTRW) yields a representation of advective-dispersive flux that is nonlocal in time but local in space. Closely related to the latter are forms of ADE entailing fractional derivatives (fADE) which leads to representations of advective-dispersive flux that are nonlocal in space but local in time; nonlocality in time arises in the context of multirate mass transfer models, which we exclude from consideration in this paper. We describe briefly each of these four nonlocal approaches and offer a perspective on their differences, commonalities, and relative merits as analytical and predictive tools. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the Upper Yellow River of China has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents, which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the Yellow River. In this paper, we aim at optimizing water-sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs (Longyangxia and Liujiaxia) as the regulatory bodies using one multi-objective model (sediment transport and hydropower generation) and two single-objective models (sediment transport only, and hydropower generation only). We propose an innovative approach (FSS-MOPSO) that hybrids the Feasible Search Space (FSS) with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. We analyze the transformation rules of water-sediment regulation among five objectives (hydropower generation, sediment transport, water supply, flood control and ice control) under various optimization schemes. The results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent. An extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2.31 billion kWh (17.6% increase) would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport (73.5% decrease) while only makes little effects on the other three objectives. The results demonstrate that the optimal water-sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future (2030) but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods. The research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water-sediment regulation for efficient cascade reservoirs operation in the Upper Yellow River.

AB The relationship between sediment concentration, C, and water discharge, Q, during floods is studied qualitatively by analysing temporal graphs and the particular relationship C-Q. The plot of points exhibits a hysteresis loop which is explained by the variability of concentration of sediments during storm events. This is due to seasonal effects and hysteresis of sediment concentration during a single hydrological event. A simple and reliable criterion, the ratio C/Q, was used for identification of a hysteresis loop. This study revealed three classes of C-Q relationships. Explanations for each type are discussed.

TI Channel bifurcation in braided rivers: Equilibrium configurations and
   stability
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE bifurcation; braiding; stability
AB [1] We investigate the equilibrium configurations and the stability of river bifurcations in gravel braided networks. Within the context of a one-dimensional approach, the nodal point conditions play a crucial rule, as pointed out by Wang et al. [1995] who propose an empirical relationship relating water and sediment flow rates into the downstream branches. In the present paper, an alternative formulation of nodal point conditions is proposed based on a quasi two-dimensional approach. The results show that, if the Shields parameter of the upstream channel is large enough, the system only admits of one solution with both branches open, which is invariably stable. As the Shields parameter of the upstream channel decreases, two further stable solutions appear characterized by a different partition of water discharge into the downstream branches: in this case, the previous solution becomes unstable. Theoretical findings are confirmed by the numerical solution of the nonlinear one-dimensional equations.

AB Many studies have examined how runoff (Q) responds to long-term changes in precipitation (P) and temperature (T), but the effects of potential evapotranspiration (PET) have received less attention. We examine observational data sets for P, T, and Q, along with PET estimated from observations, to determine the extent to which derived P and PET runoff elasticities (epsilon(P) and epsilon(PET), the fractional changes in runoff associated with given fractional changes in precipitation and PET, respectively) meet Dooge's complementary relationship (under certain conditions, epsilon(P) + epsilon(PET) = 1). We apply three statistical methods and two hydrologic models to estimate epsilon(P) and epsilon(PET) in 84 headwater river basins in California, Oregon, and Washington. We find that while the estimates of epsilon(P) are generally consistent across two statistical estimators and one model-based estimator, the estimates of epsilon(PET) using the statistical methods differ considerably (generally, they are much more negative) from the model-based estimates, and some appear to be implausible. The model-based estimates show better conformance to the complementary relationship (and in the median across sites, they sum to close to 1.0). We explore several factors that might explain the failure of the observation-based estimators, including interaction between P and PET and nonclosure of the water budget at annual time scales.

AB Entropy and Information are key concepts not only in Information Theory but also in Physics: historically in the fields of Thermodynamics, Statistical and Analytical Mechanics, and, more recently, in the field of Information Physics. In this paper we argue that Information Physics reconciles and generalizes statistical, geometric, and mechanistic views on information. We start by demonstrating how the use and interpretation of Entropy and Information coincide in Information Theory, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Analytical Mechanics, and how this can be taken advantage of when addressing Earth Science problems in general and hydrological problems in particular. In the second part we discuss how Information Physics provides ways to quantify Information and Entropy from fundamental physical principles. This extends their use to cases where the preconditions to calculate Entropy in the classical manner as an aggregate statistical measure are not met. Indeed, these preconditions are rarely met in the Earth Sciences due either to limited observations or the far-from-equilibrium nature of evolving systems. Information Physics therefore offers new opportunities for improving the treatment of Earth Science problems.

AB Power law tails, commonly observed in solute breakthrough curves, are notoriously difficult to measure with confidence as they typically occur at low concentrations. This leads us to ask if other signatures of anomalous transport can be sought. We develop a general stochastic transport framework and derive an asymptotic relation between the tail scaling of a breakthrough curve for a conservative tracer at a fixed downstream position and the scaling of the peak concentration of breakthrough curves as a function of downstream position, demonstrating that they provide equivalent information. We then quantify the relevant spatiotemporal scales for the emergence of this asymptotic regime, where the relationship holds, and validate our results in the context of a very simple model that represents transport in an idealized river.

The approach is based on two distinct probability functions, one relevant to the detachment of grains and the second relevant to the length of particle jumps. The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions. The final formulation was calibrated by means of a large number of experimental data and also by comparison with some of the most widely-used empirical formulas. The results show a better agreement between theory and experiments than do the other theories analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, hydraulic and seismic tomographic measurements were used to derive a site-specific relationship between the geophysical parameter p-wave velocity and the hydraulic parameters, diffusivity and specific storage. Our field study includes diffusivity tomograms derived from hydraulic travel time tomography, specific storage tomograms, derived from hydraulic attenuation tomography, and p-wave velocity tomograms, derived from seismic tomography. The tomographic inversion was performed in all three cases with the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique algorithm, using a ray tracing technique with curved trajectories. The experimental set up was designed such that the p-wave velocity tomogram overlaps the hydraulic tomograms by half. The experiments were performed at a well-characterized sand and gravel aquifer, located in the Leine River valley near Gottingen, Germany. Access to the shallow subsurface was provided by direct-push technology. The high spatial resolution of hydraulic and seismic tomography was exploited to derive representative site-specific relationships between the hydraulic and geophysical parameters, based on the area where geophysical and hydraulic tests were performed. The transformation of the p-wave velocities into hydraulic properties was undertaken using a k-means cluster analysis. Results demonstrate that the combination of hydraulic and geophysical tomographic data is a promising approach to improve hydrogeophysical site characterization.

AB Identifying the main controlling factors of the stream temperature (Tw) variability is important to target streams sensitive to climate and other drivers of change. The thermal sensitivity (TS), based on relationship between air temperature (Ta) and Tw, of a given stream can be used for quantifying the streams sensitivity to future climate change. This study aims to compare TS for a wide range of temperate streams located within a large French catchment (110,000 km(2)) using 4 years of hourly data (2008-2012) and to cluster stations sharing similar thermal variabilities and thereby identify environmental key drivers that modify TS at the regional scale. Two successive classifications were carried out: (a) first based on Ta-Tw relationship metrics including TS and (b) second to establish a link between a selection of environmental variables and clusters of stations. Based on weekly Ta-Tw relationships, the first classification identified four thermal regimes with differing annual Tw in terms of magnitude and amplitudes in comparison with Ta. The second classification, based on classification and regression tree method, succeeded to link each thermal regime to different environmental controlling factors. Streams influenced by both groundwater inflows and shading are the most moderated with the lowest TS and an annual amplitude of Tw around half of the annual amplitude of Ta. Inversely, stations located on large streams with a high distance from source and not (or slightly) influenced by groundwater inflows nor shading showed the highest TS, and so, they are very climate sensitive. These findings have implications for guiding river basin managers and other stakeholders in implementing thermal moderation measures in the context of a warming climate and global change.

AB We examined evolutionary pathways for water quality policies in relation to changing pollution events and socio-political system changes in Oregon, USA, and South Korea. Despite geographic and temporal differences, strong oversight and financial support of the governments with public pressure played a crucial role in point source control. As point sources came under control, focus shifted to nonpoint source policies that have evolved through different pathways according to the regional socio-hydrological context. In Oregon, cross-scale collaborative governance and watershed approaches have been encouraged from the beginning. While the South Korean government relied on the rules of the point source era in the early period, it emphasized collaborative and inclusive policies in the later period. The trajectories of both regions illustrate that the pivotal policies in the point source era do not necessarily guarantee successes in nonpoint source management, and hydra-headed problems such as climate change can further complicate water quality management.

AB Equitable water allocation in the context of local-scale water conflicts can be challenging. We present a holistic framework for the analysis of small-scale water disputes, contributing an integrated approach to the analysis of water conflicts by providing technical solutions combined with an in-depth analysis of social dynamics. The analysis focuses on an ongoing water conflict in El Carracillo region (Spain) related to an artificial aquifer recharge project. This case study involves two competing water users: horticultural farmers and ecosystem services provided by Cega River, from which water is diverted in order to recharge the aquifer. Based on a stakeholder analysis, a tool was developed to support participatory processes by facilitating mediation procedures. Preliminary results show solutions exist that account for ecosystem needs without causing major negative impacts on El Carracillo agriculture, and suggest the need for a re-negotiation of the existing rules governing water diversion from Cega River.

TI Evaluation of the Generalized and Rescaled Complementary Evaporation
   Relationships
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID REGIONAL EVAPORATION; WATER; FLUX; VAPOR; HEAT
AB A rigorous approach to the complementary relationship (CR) in land surface evaporation was introduced by Brutsaert (2015, https://doi .org/10.1002/2015WR017720) in which the problem was cast in nondimensional form for generality, boundary conditions (BCs) were established from physical constraints, and a suitable mathematical solution was formulated. Building on Brutsaert's insightful foundation, Crago et al. (2016, https://doi .org/10.1002/2016WR019753) showed the need, for rational reasons, to modify Brutsaert's BCs by introducing E-max, an upper limit to the apparent potential evaporation corresponding to an actual evaporation of O. Following the rigorous approach of Brutsaert, this paper presents the derivation and resulting CR. The BC associated with E-max, requires a solution that is rescaled with regard to Brutsaert's dimensionless framework and represents a fundamentally different solution from that of Brutsaert. In essence, this formulation acknowledges a pattern of organized variability, which exists within the data when scaled in Brutsaert's dimensionless framework, and our rescaled CR reorganizes the data, collapsing it toward a more universal representation. Our rescaled CR, implemented with two versions of E-max, one based on mass transfer and another on the Penman equation, is evaluated alongside Brutsaert's original formulation. Multiyear data sets from seven Fluxnet sites in Australia, ranging from a sparsely vegetated ephemeral tropical wetland to a temperate forest with a 75-m-tall canopy were used to test the formulations on a weekly basis. All three formulations performed adequately. Overall, the rescaled model with E max based on the Penman equation performed best; it extracts more information with no additional observational data requirements.

AB When estimating the dry-canopy evaporation rate of coniferous stands using the Penman-Monteith equation, it is crucial to determine the reference value of surface conductance G,. This paper examines the relationship between canopy height and the reference value of G, based on the maximum value of G(s) with a vapour pressure deficit greater than or equal to 1.0 kPa, (G) over cap (S) (max).There is a clear correlation between canopy height and (G) over cap (S) (max) when the projected leaf area index greater than or equal to 3.0. This suggests that using this relationship will enable more accurate determination of the reference value of G(s) for closed stands. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Conservative and sorptive tracer experiments were conducted in a highly heterogeneous (sigma(2)(lnK) = 1.79) and anisotropic (lambda(H)/lambda(V) = 3.52) three-dimensional test aquifer under well-controlled laboratory conditions to evaluate the effective conductivity and temporal moments predicted by stochastic theories. The spatial distribution of lnK in the test aquifer conformed to a statistically homogeneous system, thus allowing evaluation of results from stochastic theories for stationary random fields. Effective hydraulic conductivity K-eff in the mean flow direction for the test aquifer was compared with different stochastic theoretical expressions. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) at individual deep-penetrating observation wells and averaged breakthrough curves at control planes were examined. The mean arrival time and the travel time variance estimated using averaged BTCs from many observation wells at the same control plane for bromide and lithium were slightly overestimated by stochastic theories, yet most of the experimental data ranged within the confidence interval rendered by the uncertainty in the statistical properties of the test aquifer. A highlight of our experimental approach is that the continuous sampling procedure also permitted the evaluation of higher-order temporal moments that were analyzed to study the asymmetry and peakedness of BTCs by means of the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, respectively. Small-perturbation analytical solutions for the coefficient of skewness and kurtosis were provided. It is seen that although stochastic theories based upon small perturbations provide reasonably good estimates of the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis associated with averaged BTCs at control planes, in general, they can largely underestimate the peakedness and tailing of BTCs observed at individual deep-penetrating observation wells.

ID ABANDONED WELLS; LEAKAGE; SIMULATION; PRESSURE; BRINE
AB Decisions related to subsurface engineering problems such as groundwater management, fossil fuel production, and geologic carbon sequestration are frequently challenging because of an overabundance of uncertainties (related to conceptualizations, parameters, observations, etc.). Because of the importance of these problems to agriculture, energy, and the climate (respectively), good decisions that are scientifically defensible must be made despite the uncertainties. We describe a general approach to making decisions for challenging problems such as these in the presence of severe uncertainties that combines probabilistic and nonprobabilistic methods. The approach uses Bayesian sampling to assess parametric uncertainty and Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) to address model inadequacy. The combined approach also resolves an issue that frequently arises when applying Bayesian methods to real-world engineering problems related to the enumeration of possible outcomes. In the case of zero nonprobabilistic uncertainty, the method reduces to a Bayesian method. To illustrate the approach, we apply it to a site-selection decision for geologic CO2 sequestration.

AB A theory for quantile based hydrologic model selection and model structure deficiency assessment is presented. The paper demonstrates that the degree to which a model selection problem is constrained by the model structure (measured by the Lagrange multipliers of the constraints) quantifies structural deficiency. This leads to a formal definition of model structure deficiency (or rigidity). Model structure deficiency introduces a bias in the prediction of an observed quantile, which is often not equal across quantiles. Structure deficiency is therefore diagnosed when any two quantile predictions for a given model structure cross since unequal bias across quantiles result in quantile predictions crossing. The analysis further suggests that the optimal value of quantile specific loss functions order different model structures by its structure deficiencies over a range of quantiles. In addition to such novelties, quantile hydrologic model selection is a frequentist approach that seeks to complement existing Bayesian approaches to hydrological model uncertainty.

TI Relationships among groundwater age, denitrification, and the coupled

AB The relationships among coupled groundwater and nitrogen (N) fluxes, groundwater age, and denitrification were examined for a section of West Bear Creek, an agricultural stream in the coastal plain of North Carolina, United States. Simultaneous streambed measurements of hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydraulic head gradient (J) and the concentrations of NO3- ([NO3-]), dissolved gases, and chlorofluorocarbons in groundwater were interpolated, mapped, and (for water flux v = KJ and nitrate flux f(NO3) = v[NO3-]) integrated over the streambed area. Nitrate and dissolved organic N accounted for 92 and 8% of N flux through the streambed, respectively. Streambed maps show a band of greater groundwater age, and lower [NO3-] and f(NO3), running through the center of most of the study reach. Nitrate flux (f(NO3)) exhibits this "center-low'' pattern even though one of its controlling factors, groundwater flux (v), has on average the opposite "center-high'' pattern. An inverse relationship between [NO3-] and age is indicative of fertilizer as the primary source of groundwater NO3-. Denitrification reduced mean f(NO3) by similar to 50%, from 370 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (what it would have been in the absence of denitrification) to 173 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (what it actually was). Measurement of both groundwater age and v made possible a new method for estimating flow-weighted mean groundwater age (tau(FWM)), an important aquifer hydraulic characteristic related to groundwater storage and recharge rate. This method gives tau(FWM) = 30 years, which, along with the overall distribution of groundwater ages, suggests the possibility of a significant time lag between changes in N fertilizer application rates and NO3- flux from groundwater to West Bear Creek. Differences in streambed groundwater chemistry between the left and right sides of the streambed suggest differences in agricultural practices on opposite sides of the stream.

AB This study compares stream nitrate (NO3-) concentrations to spatially distributed snowmelt in two alpine catchments, the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado (GLV4) and Tokopah Basin, California (TOK). A snow water equivalent reconstruction model and Landsat 5 and 7 snow cover data were used to estimate daily snowmelt at 30 m spatial resolution in order to derive indices of new snowmelt areas (NSAs). Estimates of NSA were then used to explain the NO3- flushing behavior for each basin over a 12 year period (19962007). To identify the optimal method for defining NSAs and elucidate mechanisms underlying catchment NO3- flushing, we conducted a series of regression analyses using multiple thresholds of snowmelt based on temporal and volumetric metrics. NSA indices defined by volume of snowmelt (e.g., snowmelt <= 30 cm) rather than snowmelt duration (e.g., snowmelt <= 9 days) were the best predictors of stream NO3- concentrations. The NSA indices were better correlated with stream NO3- concentration in TOK (average R-2 = 0.68) versus GLV4 (average R-2 = 0.44). Positive relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were observed in TOK with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring on the rising limb of snowmelt. Positive and negative relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were found in GLV4 with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring as NSA expands. Consistent with previous works, the contrasting NO3- flushing behavior suggests that streamflow in TOK was primarily influenced by overland flow and shallow subsurface flow, whereas GLV4 appeared to be more strongly influenced by deeper subsurface flow paths.

AB Flow regimes profoundly influence river organisms and ecosystem functions, but regulatory approaches often lack the scientific basis to support sustainable water allocation. In part, this reflects the challenge of understanding the ecological effects of flow variability over different temporal and spatial domains. Here, we use a process-based distributed hydrological model to simulate 23 years of natural flow regime in 100 bioassessment sites across the Adige River network (NE Italy), and to identify typical nivo-glacial, nivo-pluvial, and pluvial reaches. We then applied spatial stream-network models (SSN) to investigate the relationships between hydrologic and macroinvertebrate metrics while accounting for network spatial autocorrelation and local habitat conditions. Macroinvertebrate metrics correlated most strongly with summer, winter, and temporal variation in streamflow, but effects varied across flow regime types. For example (i) taxon richness appeared limited by high summer flows and high winter flows in nivo-glacial and pluvial streams, respectively; (ii) invertebrate grazers increased proportionally with the annual coefficient of flow variation in nivo-glacial streams but tended to decline with flow variation in pluvial streams. Although local land-use and water quality also affected benthic communities, most variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was associated with spatial autocorrelation. These findings highlight the importance of developing environmental flow management policies in ways that reflect specific hydro-ecological and land use contexts. Our analyses also illustrate the importance of spatially-explicit approaches that account for auto-correlation when quantifying flow-ecology relationships.

AB Exploring the relationship between hydrological and meteorological droughts under influence of large reservoirs is crucial for early warning of hydrological drought. This study took Jinjiang River basin in the southeast coastal region of China as an example, where the Shilong hydrometric station is influenced by a large reservoir (Shanmei), and the Anxi hydrological station is not. Based on monthly data of stream flow with precipitation and historical drought records from 1960 to 2010, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) series (representing meteorological drought and hydrological drought, respectively) were each calculated with a 3-month timescale. Run theory was then used to identify the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought, including duration and magnitude. The relationship with which hydrological drought responds to meteorological drought was established by a non-linear function model at the Anxi station and Shilong station which reflected the periods of natural condition without reservoir and reservoir-influence condition, respectively. The results indicate that (1) there was a clear non-linear relationship of hydrological drought and meteorological drought, and the threshold within which hydrological drought started to respond to meteorological drought was obtained according to the non-linear function model; (2) the operational activities of the Shanmei reservoir during 1983-2010 have significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of hydrological drought at the Shilong station compared to the natural-influence period of 1960-1982, which, in turn, altered the relationship between the hydrological drought and meteorological drought. The propagation process from meteorological to hydrological droughts was shortened because of the changed relationship. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal flood-limited water level (FLWL), which reflects the seasonal flood information, plays an important role in governing the trade-off between reservoir flood control and conservation. A risk analysis model for flood control operation of seasonal FLWL incorporating the inflow forecasting error was proposed and developed. The variable kernel estimation is implemented for deriving the inflow forecasting error density. The synthetic inflow incorporating forecasting error is simulated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) according to the inflow forecasting error density. The risk analysis for seasonal FLWL control was estimated by MCS based on a combination of the forecasting inflow lead-time, seasonal design flood hydrographs and seasonal operation rules. The Three Gorges reservoir is selected as a case study. The application results indicate that the seasonal FLWL control can effectively enhance flood water utilization rate without lowering the annual flood control standard.

AB Momentum and kinetic energy of rainfall are widely used indices to describe erosivity, the ability of rainfall to detach soil particles and erode the landscape. An optical laser disdrometer was installed in Santiago Island, Cape Verde, between September 2008 and September 2010 to measure rainfall intensity and size distribution of raindrops. A total time series of 5129 observations of radar reflectivity, visibility, rainfall intensity and number of particles were gathered. Rainfall kinetic energy expenditure (J m(-2) h(-1)), kinetic energy content KEmm, (J m(-2) mm(-1)) and momentum flux M-tA (kg m s(-1) m(-2) s(-1)) were calculated and fitted to different known experimental equations. The best fit between rainfall intensity and kinetic energy expenditure, kinetic energy content and momentum were obtained with power-law equations. These equations were validated in two independent events corresponding to 2008 and 2009, producing high correlation coefficients. The results show that for Cape Verde, KEtime is a more appropriate index to relate with rainfall intensity, and that kinetic energy expenditure and momentum flux are interchangeable parameters for erosivity estimation. New relationships relating kinetic energy and rainfall intensity, and momentum and rainfall intensity were derived, which contribute to the characterization of rainfall originating from tropical depressions at lower latitudes.

AB Accurate estimates of water losses by evaporation from shallow water tables are important for hydrological, agricultural, and climatic purposes. An experiment was conducted in a weighing lysimeter to characterize the diurnal dynamics of evaporation under natural conditions. Sampling revealed a completely dry surface sand layer after 5 days of evaporation. Its thickness was <1 cm early in the morning, increasing to reach 4-5 cm in the evening. This evidence points out fundamental limitations of the approaches that assume hydraulic connectivity from the water table up to the surface, as well as those that suppose monotonic drying when unsteady conditions prevail. The computed vapor phase diffusion rates from the apparent drying front based on Fick's law failed to reproduce the measured cumulative evaporation during the sampling day. We propose that two processes rule natural evaporation resulting from daily fluctuations of climatic variables: (i) evaporation of water, stored during nighttime due to redistribution and vapor condensation, directly into the atmosphere from the soil surface during the early morning hours, that could be simulated using a mass transfer approach and (ii) subsurface evaporation limited by Fickian diffusion, afterward. For the conditions prevailing during the sampling day, the amount of water stored at the vicinity of the soil surface was 0.3 mm and was depleted before 11:00. Combining evaporation from the surface before 11:00 and subsurface evaporation limited by Fickian diffusion after that time, the agreement between the estimated and measured cumulative evaporation was significantly improved.

AB The article aims to respond a comment made on our paper about appropriate boundary condition for the original Dupuit-Boussinesq theory for two-dimensional steady groundwater flow in an unconfined sloping aquifer with uniform rainfall recharge. To respond to the comments arguing the existence of lateral groundwater flows and negative groundwater table, clarifications are made for our analysis focusing on two-dimensional groundwater flow without considering lateral effects by using the original and classical approximate theory.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships reflect material sources, storage, reaction, proximity, and transport in catchments. Differences in hydrologic pathways and connectivity influence observed C-Q patterns at the catchment outlet. We examined solute and sediment C-Q relationships at event and interannual timescales in a small mid-Atlantic (USA) catchment. We found systematic differences in the C-Q behaviour of geogenic/exogenous solutes (e.g., calcium and nitrate), biologically associated solutes (e.g., dissolved organic carbon), and particulate materials (e.g., total suspended solids). Negative log(C)-log(Q) regression slopes, indicating dilution, were common for geogenic solutes whereas positive slopes, indicating concentration increase, were common for biologically associated solutes. Biologically associated solutes often exhibited counterclockwise hysteresis during events whereas geogenic solutes exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Across event and interannual timescales, solute C-Q patterns are linked to the spatial distribution of hydrologic sources and the timing and sequence of hydro-biogeochemical source contributions to the stream. Groundwater is the primary source of stormflow during the earliest and latest stages of events, whereas precipitation and soil water become increasingly connected to the stream near peakflow. This sequence and timing of flowpath connectivity results in dilution and clockwise hysteresis for geogenic/exogenous solutes and concentration increase and counterclockwise hysteresis for biologically associated solutes. Particulate materials demonstrated positive C-Q slopes over the long-term and clockwise hysteresis during individual events. Drivers of particulate and solute C-Q relationships differ, based on longitudinal and lateral expansion of active channels and changing shear stresses with increasing flows. Although important distinctions exist between the drivers of solute and sediment C-Q relationships, overall solute and sediment C-Q patterns at event and interannual timescales reflect consistent catchment hydro-biogeochemical processes.

TI Toward a robust method for subdaily rainfall downscaling from daily data
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCHASTIC-MODELS; SPATIAL RAINFALL; TIME; CALIBRATION; SPACE
AB Compared to daily rainfall data, observed subdaily rainfall times are rare and often very short. For hydrologic modeling, this problem is often addressed by generating synthetic hourly rainfall series, with rainfall generators calibrated on relevant rainfall statistics. The required subdaily rainfall statistics are traditionally derived from daily rainfall records by assuming some temporal scaling behavior of these statistics. However, as our analyzes of a large data set suggest, the mathematical form of this scaling behavior might be specific to individual gauges. This paper presents, therefore, a novel approach that bypasses the temporal scaling behavior assumption. The method uses multivariate adaptive regression splines; it is learning-based and seeks directly relationships between target subdaily statistics and available predictors (including (supra-) daily rainfall statistics and external information such as large-scale atmospheric variables). A large data set is used to investigate these relationships, including almost 340 hourly rainfall series coming from gauges spread over Switzerland, the USA and the UK. The predictive power of the new approach is assessed for several subdaily rainfall statistics and is shown to be superior to the one of temporal scaling laws. The study is completed with a detailed discussion of how such reconstructed statistics improve the accuracy of an hourly rainfall generator based on Poisson cluster models.

AB We study the scale dependence of the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s through the effective porosity n(e) by means of a newly developed power-law model (PLM) which allows to use simultaneously measurements at different scales. The model is expressed as product between a single PLM (capturing the impact of the dominating scale) and a characteristic function accounting for the correction because of the other scale(s). The simple (closed form) expression of the -function enables one to easily identify the scales which are relevant for K-s. The proposed model is then applied to a set of real data taken at the experimental site of Montalto Uffugo (Italy), and we show that in this case two (i.e. laboratory and field) scales appear to be the main ones. The implications toward an important application (solute transport) in Hydrology are finally discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Hysteresis in the relationship between capillary pressure (P-c), wetting phase saturation (S-w) and nonwetting-wetting interfacial area per volume (a(nw)) is investigated using multiphase lattice-Boltzmann simulations of drainage and imbibition in a glass bead porous system. In order to validate the simulations, the P-c-S-w and a(nw)-S-w main hysteresis loops were compared to experimental data reported by Culligan et al. [Culligan KA, Wildenschild D, Christensen BS, Gray WG, Rivers ML, Tompson AB. Interfacial area measurements for unsaturated flow through porous media. Water Resour Res 2004;40:W12413]. In general, the comparison shows that the simulations are reliable and capture the important physical processes in the experimental system. P-c-S-w curves, a(nw)-S-w curves and phase distributions (within the pores) show good agreement during drainage, but less satisfactory agreement during imbibition. Drainage and imbibition scanning curves were simulated in order to construct P-c-S-w-a(nw) surfaces. The root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between drainage and imbibition surfaces was 0.10 mm(-1) and 0.03 mm(-1), respectively. This small difference indicates that hysteresis is virtually nonexistent in the P-c-S-w-a(nw) relationship for the multiphase system studied here. Additionally, a surface was fit to the main loop (excluding scanning curves) of the drainage and imbibition P-c-S-w-a(nw) data and compared to the surface fit to all of the data. The differences between these two surfaces were small (RMSE = 0.05 mm(-1) and MAE = 0.01 mm(-1)) indicating that the P-c-S-w-a(nw) surface is adequately represented without the need for the scanning curve data, which greatly reduces the amount of data required to construct the non-hysteretic P-c-S-w-a(nw) surface for this data.

AB This study describes the impacts of refinement of hydraulic geometry (HG) relationships in the hydrological MGB model applied to an Amazonian sub-basin (Purus River basin). To this end, HG relationships were developed for the entire basin and for hydrologically homogeneous regions, and their performances were compared with observed data and a global width and depth database. Two simulations were then performed using the MGB model: one using the refined HG relationships and the other using the global width and depth database. The simulated streamflow and water level estimates were compared with observed data. The results showed that HG relationships for the hydrologically homogeneous regions provided better estimates of hydraulic parameters for the basin, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.96 for width and 0.95 for depth, and its use provided an improvement in the performance of the hydrological modelling in some gauge stations, with an increase in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 18% and 65%.

AB Accurate estimators of streamflow statistics are critical to the design, planning, and management of water resources. Given increasing evidence of trends in low-streamflow, new approaches to estimating low-streamflow statistics are needed. Here we investigate simple approaches to select a recent subset of the low-flow record to update the commonly used statistic of 7Q10, the annual minimum 7-day streamflow exceeded in 9 out of 10 years on average. Informed by low-streamflow records at 174 US Geological Survey streamgages, Monte Carlo simulation experiments evaluate competing approaches. We find that a strategy which estimates 7Q10 using the most recent 30 years of record when a trend is detected, reduces error and bias in 7Q10 estimators compared to use of the full record. This simple rule-based approach has potential as the basis for a framework for updating frequency-based statistics in the context of possible trends.

AB Hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reactions are difficult to quantify because of the range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions inherent to streams, wetlands, and nearshore marine ecosystems. Field measurements of biogeochemical reactions in aquatic systems are impeded by the difficulty of measuring hyporheic flow simultaneously with chemical gradients in sediments. Simplified models of hyporheic exchange have been developed using Darcy's law generated by flow and bed topography at the sediment-water interface. However, many modes of transport are potentially involved ( molecular diffusion, bioturbation, advection, shear, bed mobility, and turbulence) with even simple models being difficult to apply in complex natural systems characterized by variable sediment sizes and irregular bed geometries. In this study, we synthesize information from published hyporheic exchange investigations to develop a scaling relationship for estimating mass transfer in near-surface sediments across a range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions. Net hyporheic exchange was quantified using an effective diffusion coefficient ( De) that integrates all of the various transport processes that occur simultaneously in sediments, and dimensional analysis was used to scale De to shear stress velocity, roughness height, and permeability that describe fluid-flow and sediment characteristics. We demonstrated the value of the derived scaling relationship by using it to quantify dissolved oxygen ( DO) uptake rates on the basis of DO profiles in sediments and compared them to independent flux measurements. The results support a broad application of the De scaling relationship for quantifying coupled hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reaction rates in streams and other aquatic ecosystems characterized by complex fluid-flow and sediment conditions.

AB Runoff-runon occurs when spatially variable infiltration capacities result in runoff generated in one location potentially infiltrating downslope in an area with higher infiltration capacity. The runoff-runon process is invoked to explain field observations of runoff ratios that decline with plot length and steady-state infiltration rates that increase gradually with rainfall intensity. To illustrate the influence of spatial variability and runoff-runon on net infiltration and runoff generation, we use both (i) field rainfall simulation on soil with a high infiltration capacity and (ii) numerical rainfall-runoff-runon simulations over a spatially variable area. Numerical simulations have shown that the spatial variability of soil infiltration properties affects surface runoff generation; however, it has proven difficult to represent analytically the associated runoff-runon process. We argue that given some simplifying assumptions, the runoff-runon phenomenon can be represented by queuing theory, well known in the literature on stochastic processes. Using this approach we report simple analytic expressions derived from the queuing literature that quantify the total runoff under steady-state conditions from a spatially variable tilted 2-D plane, and the runoff produced by the area connected with the lower boundary of the plane under these conditions. These quantities are shown to be equal to the waiting time and the sampled busy period, respectively, of a first-in first-out queue with exponentially distributed arrivals and service times. The queuing theory model is shown to be consistent with field observations of runoff; however, the approach requires some simplifying assumptions and restrictions that may negate the benefits of the reported analytic solutions.

   distribution; Weibull distribution; erosion
ID RAINDROP-SIZE; EROSION; MODEL; STRATIFORM; PREDICTION; SPECTRA; IMPACT
AB The rainfall rate is a crucial variable in modeling runoff and water erosion. Rainfall rates present a very large spatial and temporal variability. Radars are used to estimate the spatial and temporal changes in rainfall rates during storms. The radar reflectivity is strongly affected by the drop size distribution (DSD) that results from the relative intensity of the microphysical processes involved in rainfall formation. One of the mathematical models applied to quantify the DSD is the Weibull function. Rainfall rate and kinetic energy, and radar reflectivity, are all related to different moments of the DSD. An analytical expression for these moments is proposed in the case of the Weibull distribution. The resulting relationships between radar reflectivity, rainfall rate, and kinetic energy are presented. The use of a scaled DSD that is independent of rainfall rate and characterizes a specific location allows an a priori estimate of relationships between radar reflectivity, rainfall rate, and kinetic energy that will be also characteristics of that location. Radar reflectivity can be used to estimate the kinetic energy of rainfall events. This extends the application of radar to agriculture and environmental purposes such as potential rainfall damages estimates in terms of soil loss, erosion, and sediment transport.

AB The velocity distribution in natural channels is of considerable interest for streamflow measurements to obtain information on discharge and flow resistance. This study focuses on the comparison of theoretical velocity distributions based on 1) entropy theory, and 2) the two-parameter power law. The analysis identifies the correlation between the parameters of the distributions and defines their dependence on the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the channel. Specifically, we investigate how the parameters are related to the flow resistance in terms of Manning roughness, shear velocity and water surface slope, and several formulae showing their relationships are proposed. Velocity measurements carried out in the past 20 years at Ponte Nuovo gauged section along the Tiber River, central Italy, are the basis for the analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A spatially autocorrelated effect exists in precipitation of a mountainous basin. This study examines the relationship between maximum annual rainfall and elevation in the Kaoping River Basin of southern Taiwan using spatial regression models (i.e. geographically weighted regression (GWR), simultaneous autoregression (SAR), and conditional autoregression (CAR)). Results show that the GWR, SAR, and CAR models can improve spatial data fitting and provide an enhanced estimation for the rainfallelevation relationship than the ordinary least squares approach. In particular, GWR achieves the most accurate estimation, and SAR and CAR achieve similar performance in terms of the Akaike information criterion. The relationship between extreme rainfall and elevation for longer duration is more concise than that for short durations. Results show that the spatial distribution of precipitation depends on elevation and that rainfall patterns in study area are heterogeneous between the southwestern plain and the eastern mountain area.

AB Despite a longstanding interest in understanding the effects of rock fragments on soil hydraulic properties, physically-based models to describe the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils are still rare. The conductivity of stony soils is mostly described by simple scaling approaches, assuming impermeable rock fragments. We present a model based on the general effective medium (GEM) theory to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils. The model accounts for the volumetric content, shape, and orientation of rock fragments in the main direction of water flow. Rock fragments can either be permeable or impermeable in the model which allows to calculate the effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils over the full range of soil matric potentials. Existing models assume rock fragments to be isolated and their application is therefore limited to low to moderately stony soils. In GEM model interaction between rock fragments is allowed, which makes it applicable in stony soils with high contents of rock fragments. The mathematical simplicity of the model makes it suitable for practical applications and provides a strong theoretical basis for improving predictions of flow and transport in hydrological models applied in forested and agricultural watersheds and mountainous areas.

AB The influence of heterogeneous architecture of alluvial aquifers on non-Fickian transport is explored using the Monte Carlo approach. More than two thousand high-resolution hydrofacies models representing seven groups of alluvial settings are built to test the effects of varying facies proportions, mean length and its anisotropy ratio, juxtapositional tendencies, and sub-facies heterogeneity. Results show that the volumetric fraction (P(Z)) of floodplain layers classified by their thicknesses Z controls the non-Fickian tailing of tracer transport at late times. A simple quantitative relationship S-BTC approximate to S-P(Z)/2 - 1 is built based on a multi-rate mass transfer analysis, where S-BTC is the slope of the power-law portion of tracer breakthrough curve, and S-P(Z) denotes the slope of the power-law portion of the distribution of P(Z) which can be measured, e.g., in core logs. At early times, the mean length of hydrofacies affects the non-Fickian tailing by controlling the channeling of flow in high-permeability non-floodplain materials and the sequestration in surrounding low-permeability floodplain layers. The competition between channeling and sequestration generates complex pre-asymptotic features, including sublinear growth of plume mean displacement, superlinear growth of plume variance, and skewed mass distribution. Those observations of the influence of medium heterogeneity on tracer transport at early and late times may lead to development of nonlocal transport models that can be parameterized using measurable aquifer characteristics.

Mixing of external moisture into the boundary layer (BL) alters the dry-end second-type boundary condition yielding a polynomial that can be further generalized into a three-parameter (Priestley-Taylor alpha, a, b) power function (PF3), capable of responding to the level of such admixing. With the help of FLUXNET data and setting a = 2 for a possible recapture of the linear and/or polynomial versions of the CR, it is demonstrated that the resulting two-parameter PF (i.e., PF2) excels among the CR-based two-parameter models considered in this study. PF2 is then employed with a globally set constant value of alpha = 1.1 and 0.5 degrees monthly data across Australia, while calibrating b against the multiyear water-balance evaporation rate on a cell-by-cell basis. The resulting bi-modal histogram peaks first near b = 2 (recapturing the polynomial CR) when moisture admixing is significant, and then at b -> 1 (yielding the linear CR) when mixing effects are negligible. Unlike the linear or polynomial CR versions, PF2 can respond to the general efficiency of external moisture admixing through its parameter b, making it applicable even near sudden discontinuities in surface moisture. A new duality emerges with the PF2: while alpha accounts for the effect of entrainment of free tropospheric drier air into the BL on the resulting wet-environment evaporation rate, b does so for moisture on the drying-environment evaporation rates.

AB Entropy theory applied to hydrometric measurements enables establishing a relationship between the maximum and the mean velocities of flow passing a river section. In many developing countries, river discharge is still estimated by the velocity-area method following the procedure established based on the point-velocities measured at 0.6D depth from the water surface of many verticals of flow section. This study explores the establishment of a relationship between the maximum point-velocity estimated at 0.6D depth of the vertical located at or nearer to the deepest flow depth, and the maximum point-velocity occurring somewhere along the same vertical which in turn can be linked to the sectional mean flow velocity based on the established entropy theory. The appropriateness of the proposed two-steps based approach of discharge estimation is first verified on the Tiber River and the Po River of Italy. The study finds that the values of the maximum point-velocity estimated using the proposed approach closely matches with the recorded maximum flow velocity values along the same flow-depths. After this verification, the proposed method was applied for discharge estimation at two Indian river gauging stations, where only the point-velocity measurements at 0.6D depth locations of the verticals are recorded. The study finds that the discharges estimated by both the proposed approach and the velocity-area method closely match with each other with the estimated Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values greater than 0.99. Thus the proposed two-steps approach involving the entropy concept based relationship for discharge estimation enables to replace the tedious and time-consuming velocity-area approach.

AB Effective policies to protect groundwater-dependent ecosystems require robust methods to determine the environmental flows and levels required to support species and processes. Frameworks to support groundwater management must incorporate the relationships between hydrology and species and ecological processes. These hydro-ecological relationships can be used to develop quantitative, measurable thresholds that are sensitive to changes in groundwater quantity. Here we provide a case study from a group of fens in central Oregon, USA, that are used for cattle watering, but also support numerous sensitive species. We developed quantitative relationships between the position of the water table and wetland indicator plant species and the process of peat development, to propose groundwater withdrawal thresholds. A maximum depth to water table of -0.9 to -34.8 cm for fen plants and -16.6 to -32.2 cm for peat accretion can be tolerated in these wetlands. Defining hydro-ecological relationships as thresholds can support management decisions.

AB The purpose of this Study is to evaluate the applicability of monthly weather forecasting information to the improvement of monthly dam inflow forecasts. The ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) is used to predict the optimal dam inflow, since it has the advantage of tuning the fuzzy inference system with a learning algorithm. A subtractive clustering algorithm is adopted to enhance the performance of the ANFIS model, which has a disadvantage in that the number of control rules increases rapidly as the number of fuzzy variables increases. To incorporate weather forecasting information into the ANFIS model, this study proposes a method for converting qualitative information into quantitative data. The ANFIS model for monthly dam inflow forecasts was tested in cases with and without weather forecasting information. It can be seen that the model performances obtained with the use of both past observed data and future weather forecasting information are much better than those using past observed data only.

AB Regional evapotranspiration is an important component of the hydrological cycle. However. reliable estimates of regional evapotranspiration are extremely difficult to obtain. In this study, the evapotranspiration simulated by three complementary relationship approaches, namely the Advection-Aridity (AA) model, the Complementary Relationship Areal Evapotranspiration (CRAE) model and the Granger (G) model. is evaluated With the observations over the Yellow River basin during 1981-2000. The simulations on overall annual evapotranspiration are reasonably good. with mean annual errors less than 10% except in extreme dry Years. The AA model gives the best estimation for the monthly evapotranspiration, and the CRAE and GM models slightly overestimate in winter. In addition, the AA model presents the same closure error of water balance over the Yellow River basin as model G. which was less than that by the CRAE model. In rather dry and rather wet cases (with higher or lower available energy). all three models perform less well. Empirical parameters of these models need to be recalibrated before they can be applied to other regions. The distribution of evapotranspiration over the Yellow River basin is also discussed.

AB The rapid development of data mining provides a new method for water resource management, hydrology and hydroinformatics research. In the paper, based on data mining theory and technology, we analyse hydrological daily discharge time series of the Shaligunlanke Station in the Tarim River Basin in China from the year 1961 to 2000. Firstly, according to the four monthly statistics, namely mean monthly discharge, monthly maximum discharge, monthly amplitude and monthly standard deviation, K-mean clustering was used to segment the annual process of the daily discharge. The clustering result showed that the annual process of the daily discharge can be divided into five segments: snowmelt period I (April), snowmelt period II (May), rainfall period I (June-August), rainfall period II (September) and dry period (October-December and January-March). Secondly, dynamic time warping (DTW), which is a different distance metric method from the traditional Euclidian distance metric, was used to look for similarities in the discharge process. On the basis of the similarity matrix, the similar discharge processes can be mined in each period. Thirdly, agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to cluster and discover the discharge patterns in terms of the autoregressive model. It was found that the discharge had a close relationship with the temperature and the precipitation, and the discharge processes were more similar under the same climatic condition. Our study shows that data mining is a feasible and efficient approach to discover the hidden information in the historical hydrological data and mining the implicative laws under the hydrological process.

AB Understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors affects the watershed runoff and sediment yield at event scale can provide useful insights into watershed hydrological processes to guide watershed management. This article investigates the nonlinear relationships between natural and anthropogenic factors and event runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree (BRT) model for 38 watersheds within the Loess Plateau in China during 2006 to 2016. The BRT model captures the relative importance of each natural and anthropogenic factors to the variability in runoff and sediment yield. The results show that these relationships are complex and highly nonlinear. The event runoff was most related to NDVI in the grass land (NDVI_g), with a 21.3% contribution, followed by 3-day antecedent precipitation index (AP3), 10-day antecedent precipitation index (AP10), precipitation (P), and 7-day antecedent precipitation index (AP7). For event sediment yield, the strongest factor is AP3, with contribution of 33.3%, followed by P, NDVI in the forest land (NDVI_f), AP7, and NDVI in the crop land (NDVI_c). The marginal effect curves produced by the BRT are often characterized by thresholds. For instance, NDVI_f has the greatest effect on event sediment yield reduction when NDVI_f = 0.42, suggesting that a very intense green coverage is not necessary to achieve maximal soil erosion control. Vegetation coverage and meteorological factors can explain 54.7% of event runoff variation and 55.6% of event sediment yield variation. Our study identify the nonlinear relationships between runoff and sediment yield with vegetation cover and meteorological factors and provide scientific support for the planning of subsequent reforestation projects in the Loess Plateau.

DE global database; slope; SMA; OLS; regressions
AB Scaling relationships between water turnover or discharge and water system size may help to reveal and understand general patterns and processes in regional and global hydrological systems. In the present study, we derived global as well as climate-specific scaling relationships between average or maximum river discharge and catchment area, main-stem length and precipitation, based on data from 663 monitoring stations worldwide. Data were retrieved from a Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) database. The scaling relationships were established with ordinary least square (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) regressions. The focus was on the SMA regressions because this method provides better estimates of the slope. The overall empirical regressions derived were highly significant (p<0.01). Average discharge (Q) and maximum discharge (Q(max)) scaled to catchment area (A) with SMA slopes of 1.23 (r(2)=0.40) and 0.99 (r(2)=0.41), respectively. Average discharge (Q) scaled to length (L) with a slope of 2.16 (r(2)=0.40), while catchment area (A) scaled to main-stem length (L) with a slope of 1.76 (r(2)=0.91). The addition of precipitation (P), yielding a multiple regression of discharge versus catchment area and precipitation, improved the explained variability to r(2)=0.56 and r(2)=0.52 for average and maximum discharge, respectively. Slopes of climate zone-specific regressions tended to be similar to the slopes of the overall relationships. The uncertainties of the regressions were discussed and, where possible, compared to regressions derived in other studies. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Many reservoirs around the world are being operated based on rule curves developed without considering the evacuation of deposited sediment. Current reservoir simulation and optimization models fall short of incorporating the concept of sustainability because the reservoir storage losses due to sedimentation are not considered. This Study develops a new model called Reservoir Optimization-Simulation with Sediment Evacuation (ROSSE) model. The model utilizes genetic algorithm based optimization capabilities and embeds the sediment evacuation module into the simulation module. The sediment evacuation Module is implemented using the Tsinghua university flushing equation. The ROSSE model is applied to optimize the rule curves of Tarbela Reservoir. the largest reservoir in Pakistan with chronic sedimentation problems. fit the present Study, rule curves are optimized for maximization of net economic benefits from water released. The water released call be used for irrigation, power production. sediment evacuation. and for flood control purposes. Relative weights are used to combine the benefits from these conflicting water uses. Nine sets of rule Curves are compared, namely existing rule curves and proposed rule curves for eight scenarios developed for various policy options. These optimized rule curves show all increase of net individual economic benefits ranging, from 9 to 248% over the existing, rule curves. The shortage of irrigation Supply during the simulation period is reduced by 38% and reservoir sustainability is enhanced by 28% through increased sediment evacuation. The study concludes that by modifying the operating policy and rule curves, it is possible to enhance the reservoir's sustainability and maximize the net economic benefits. The developed methodology and the model call be used for optimization of rule curves of other reservoirs with sedimentation problems. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Understanding the interplay of foam and nonaqueous phases in porous media is key to improving the design of foam for enhanced oil recovery and remediation of aquifers and soils. A widely used implicit-texture foam model predicts phenomena analogous to cusp catastrophe theory: The surface describing foam apparent viscosity as a function of fractional flows folds backwards on itself. Thus, there are multiple steady states fitting the same injection condition J defined by the injected fractional flows. Numerical simulations suggest the stable injection state among multiple possible states but do not explain the reason. We address the issue of multiple steady states from the perspective of wave propagation, using three-phase fractional-flow theory. The wave-curve method is applied to solve the two conservation equations for composition paths and wave speeds in 1-D foam-oil flow. There is a composition path from each possible injection state J to the initial state I satisfying the conservation equations. The stable displacement is the one with wave speeds (characteristic velocities) all positive along the path from J to I. In all cases presented, two of the paths feature negative wave velocity at J; such a solution does not correspond to the physical injection conditions. A stable displacement is achieved by either the upper, strong-foam state, or lower, collapsed-foam state but never the intermediate, unstable state. Which state makes the displacement depends on the initial state of a reservoir. The dependence of the choice of the displacing state on initial state is captured by a boundary curve.

AB This paper presents a numerical test problem that was used as the basis for ranking the river basin management models that participated in a tender for a World Bank-funded project in India. The problem is deterministic, and it involves a set of constraints and management objectives that were of interest to the Narmada Control Authority. The test problem had five reservoirs, seven off-stream and four on-stream water demands, steady-state inflows based on a 10-daily time step over a period of nine years, and relatively simple reservoir operating rules. The paper describes the problem and discusses the solutions that were obtained from various vendors. The principal finding is that simulation models should not be used to solve optimization problems. The paper also highlights the importance of establishing benchmarks as an important tool for model evaluation. Input data and the current benchmark solution are available for download.

AB To assess hydrological sensitivity to climate variability, improved understanding is needed of the process cascade linking large-scale climate to river flow. For northern Europe Such knowledge is limited, and is further complicated by mountainous terrain. This research gap is addressed through composite analysis of large-scale climate drivers of monthly high and low river flow across northern Europe for the period 1968-1997. As an organizational framework for this investigation, the study is performed on a regional basis, using cluster analysis for identification of river flow regions. Results of the composite analysis show that the occurrence of high and low flow across northern Europe is associated with large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation variation. Especially in winter, these patterns are linked to changes in large-scale geopotential height and wind fields, and in particular variation in the Azores High and Icelandic Low atmospheric centres of action. This is suggestive of a link between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and river flow, but is too complex to be described solely in terms of the NAO. Outside the winter half year, an inverse climate-river flow relationship is found between northern and Southern Scandinavian river flow regions. This relationship is associated with differences in the relative contribution of meltwater to river flow between these regions, their latitudinal separation and orographic effects on precipitation distribution.

TI Testing a distributed approach for modelling sediment delivery

ID SOIL LOSS EQUATION; EROSION; CESIUM-137
AB Both the theoretical basis of a distributed approach to sediment delivery and its agreement with basin sediment yield measurements are tested. At first, by using morphological data of five Apulian and four Calabrian basins, the applicability of a theoretically-based relationship for evaluating the sediment delivery ratio of each morphological unit SDRi, into which a basin is divided, is verified. Using the morphological data of the nine investigated basins, the sediment delivery relationship, i.e. the relationship of the basin sediment delivery ratio SDRW, and SDRi, is tested. The analysis showed that the relationships, proposed by Ferro (1997), establishing the dependence of the a coefficient of the sediment delivery relationship on the median travel time and on a drainage density index are yet applicable. The influence of the scale of the basin topographic map on the sediment delivery distributed approach is also studied. The analysis showed that the ratio between the a coefficient and the median travel time is scale-invariable while the link between the coefficient a and the drainage density index has to be re-calibrated because the drainage density index is dependent on the map scale used. Finally, the predictive capability of the sediment delivery distributed model is validated using the sediment yield measurements carried out in three small Calabrian basins and in the Apulian Triolo basin. The analysis showed that the model accuracy is dependent on the temporal scale used and the model reliability increases from the event to the annual scale.

AB Accurate representation of terrain with appropriate reproduction of topographic characteristics is important for increasingly sophisticated physically-based models of natural processes. Recently investigators have successfully enforced slope area relationships to interpolate more realistic topographies from the sparse data. The limitation of those procedures is that, for the most part, they preserve only the first moment (the mean), when scaling slope with contributing area. Here we present a simple approach to also enforce the second moment, the variance, during landscape evolution simulations or physically-based spatial interpolations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present an extended law of mass-action (xLMA) method for multiphase equilibrium calculations and apply it in the context of reactive transport modeling. This extended LMA formulation differs from its conventional counterpart in that (i) it is directly derived from the Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) problem (i.e., the fundamental problem that describes the state of equilibrium of a chemical system under constant temperature and pressure); and (ii) it extends the conventional mass-action equations with Lagrange multipliers from the Gibbs energy minimization problem, which can be interpreted as stability indices of the chemical species. Accounting for these multipliers enables the method to determine all stable phases without presuming their types (e.g., aqueous, gaseous) or their presence in the equilibrium state. Therefore, the here proposed xLMA method inherits traits of Gibbs energy minimization algorithms that allow it to naturally detect the phases present in equilibrium, which can be single-component phases (e.g., pure solids or liquids) or non-ideal multi-component phases (e.g., aqueous, melts, gaseous, solid solutions, adsorption, or ion exchange). Moreover, our xLMA method requires no technique that tentatively adds or removes reactions based on phase stability indices (e.g., saturation indices for minerals), since the extended mass-action equations are valid even when their corresponding reactions involve unstable species. We successfully apply the proposed method to a reactive transport modeling problem in which we use PHREEQC and GEMS as alternative backends for the calculation of thermodynamic properties such as equilibrium constants of reactions, standard chemical potentials of species, and activity coefficients. Our tests show that our algorithm is efficient and robust for demanding applications, such as reactive transport modeling, where it converges within 1-3 iterations in most cases. The proposed xLMA method is implemented in Reaktoro, a unified open-source framework for modeling chemically reactive systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The limited availability of hydrometric data makes the design, management, and real-time operation of water systems a difficult task. Here, we propose a generic stochastic framework for the so-called inverse problem of hydroelectricity, using energy production data from small hydropower plants (SHPPs) to retrieve the upstream inflows. In this context, we investigate the alternative configurations of water-energy transformations across SHPPs of negligible storage capacity, which are subject to multiple uncertainties. We focus on two key sources, i.e. observational errors in energy production and uncertain efficiency curves of turbines. In order to extract the full hydrograph, we also extrapolate the high and low flows outside of the range of operation of turbines, by employing empirical rules for representing the rising and falling limbs of the simulated hydrographs. This framework is demonstrated on a real-world system at Evinos River basin, Greece. By taking advantage of the proposed methodology, SHPPs may act as potential hydrometric stations and improve the existing information in poorly gauged areas.

AB In this paper, we comment on the recent two-part paper by Goodwell and Kumar (2017a, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020216,2017b,https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020218) on quantifying three-way interactions between variables using information theory. Their proposed method of partitioning interactions into unique, redundant, and synergistic information is valuable and has potential other applications in the field of water resources. We present an example to investigate the generality of their assumption that redundancy follows from dependency of the sources. In the broader context of information theoretical methods in the geosciences, we argue that implementation challenges stem mostly from issues that are intrinsic to learning patterns from limited data. These issues are only hidden by assumptions, but not absent, when using conventional correlation-based methods. The flexibility of individually choosing assumptions in information theoretical methods gives them a myriad of potential applications in the study of complex systems.

AB In this work, we present a novel laboratory-based microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) experiment designed to investigate the pore-scale drainage behavior of natural sandstone under dynamic conditions. The fluid distribution in a Bentheimer sandstone was visualized every 4 s with a 12 s measurement time, allowing the investigation of single-pore and few-pore-filling events. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such measurements were performed outside of synchrotron facilities, illustrating the growing application potential of laboratory-based micro-CT with subminute temporal resolutions for geological research at the pore scale. To illustrate how the workflow can lead to an improved understanding of drainage behavior, the experiment was analyzed using a decomposition of the pore space into individual geometrical pores. Preliminary results from this analysis suggest that the distribution of drainage event sizes follows a power law scaling, as expected from percolation theory.

AB The structure and scaling of river networks characterized using fractal dimensions related to Horton's laws is assessed. The Hortonian scaling framework is shown to be limited in that strict self similarity is only possible for structurally Hortonian networks. Dimension estimates using the Hortonian scaling system are biased and do not admit space filling. Tokunaga cyclicity presents an alternative way to characterize network scaling that does not suffer from these problems. Fractal dimensions are presented in terms of Tokunaga cyclicity parameters.

AB Particle-based models and continuum models have been developed to quantify mixing-limited bimolecular reactions for decades. Effective model parameters control reaction kinetics, but the relationship between the particle-based model parameter (such as the interaction radius R) and the continuum model parameter (i.e., the effective rate coefficient K-f) remains obscure. This study attempts to evaluate and link R and K-f for the second-order bimolecular reaction in both the bulk and the sharp-concentration-gradient (SCG) systems. First, in the bulk system, the agent-based method reveals that R remains constant for irreversible reactions and decreases nonlinearly in time for a reversible reaction, while mathematical analysis shows that K-f transitions from an exponential to a power-law function. Qualitative link between R and K-f can then be built for the irreversible reaction with equal initial reactant concentrations. Second, in the SCG system with a reaction interface, numerical experiments show that when R and K-f decline as t(-1/2) (for example, to account for the reactant front expansion), the two models capture the transient power-law growth of product mass, and their effective parameters have the same functional form. Finally, revisiting of laboratory experiments further shows that the best fit factor in R and K-f is on the same order, and both models can efficiently describe chemical kinetics observed in the SCG system. Effective model parameters used to describe reaction kinetics therefore may be linked directly, where the exact linkage may depend on the chemical and physical properties of the system.

AB Most studies of land use effects on solute concentrations in streams have focused on smaller streams with watersheds dominated by a single land-use type. Using land cover as a proxy for land use, the objective of this study was to determine whether the hydrologically-driven response of solutes to land use in small streams could be scaled up to predict concentrations in larger receiving streams and rivers in the rural area of the Little Tennessee River basin. We measured concentrations of typically limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), abundant anions (chloride, sulfate), and base cations in 17 small streams and four larger river sites. In the small streams, total solute concentration was strongly related to land cover -- highest in streams with developed watersheds, lowest in streams with forested watersheds, and streams with agricultural watersheds were in between. In general, the best predictor of solute concentrations in the small streams was forest land cover. We then predicted solute concentrations for the river sites based on the solute--land cover relationships of the small streams using multiple linear regressions. Results were mixed -- some of the predicted river concentrations were close to measured values, others were greater or less than measured concentrations. In general, river concentrations did not scale with land cover-solute relationships found in small tributaries. Measured values of nitrogen solutes in the river sites were greater than predicted, perhaps due to the presence of waste water treatment plants. We attributed other differences between measured and predicted river concentrations to the heterogeneous geochemistry of this mountainous region. The combined complexity of hydrology, geochemistry, and human land-use of this mountainous region make it difficult to scale up from small streams to larger river basins.

AB Anomalous (or non-Fickian) transport is ubiquitous in the context of tracer migration in geological formations. We quantitatively identify the origin of anomalous transport in a representative model of a heterogeneous porous medium under uniform (in the mean) flow conditions; we focus on anomalous transport which arises in the complex flow patterns of lognormally distributed hydraulic conductivity (K) fields, with several decades of K values. Transport in the domains is determined by a particle tracking technique and characterized by breakthrough curves (BTCs). The BTC averaged over multiple realizations demonstrates anomalous transport in all cases, which is accounted for entirely by a power law distribution approximate to t-1- of local transition times. The latter is contained in the probability density function (t) of transition times, embedded in the framework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW). A unique feature of our analysis is the derivation of (t) as a function of parameters quantifying the heterogeneity of the domain. In this context, we first establish the dominance of preferential pathways across each domain, and characterize the statistics of these pathways by forming a particle-visitation weighted histogram, Hw(K), of the hydraulic conductivity. By converting the ln(K) dependence of Hw(K) into time, we demonstrate the equivalence of Hw(K) and (t), and delineate the region of Hw(K) that forms the power law of (t). This thus defines the origin of anomalous transport. Analysis of the preferential pathways clearly demonstrates the limitations of critical path analysis and percolation theory as a basis for determining the origin of anomalous transport. Furthermore, we derive an expression defining the power law exponent in terms of the Hw(K) parameters. The equivalence between Hw(K) and (t) is a remarkable result, particularly given the nature of the K heterogeneity, the complexity of the flow field within each realization, and the statistics of the particle transitions.

ID LAND-SURFACE; INFORMATION-THEORY; CLIMATE; SYSTEM
AB A model of heat fluxes over a dry land surface is proposed based on the theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) as a special case of the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt). When the turbulent heat transfer in the atmospheric boundary layer is parameterized using a Monin-Obukhov similarity model, a dissipation function or entropy production function may be expressed in terms of the heat fluxes following the MEP formalism. A solution of the heat fluxes can be obtained by finding the extreme of the dissipation function under the constraint of conservation of energy for a given energy input (i.e., net radiation) at the surface. The MEP solution of the surface heat fluxes is tested using observations from fields experiments.

AB Neutral metacommunity models for spatial biodiversity patterns are implemented on river networks acting as ecological corridors at different resolution. Coarse-graining elevation fields (under the constraint of preserving the basin mean elevation) produce a set of reconfigured drainage networks. The hydrologic assumption made implies uniform runoff production such that each link has the same habitat capacity. Despite the universal scaling properties shown by river basins regardless of size, climate, vegetation, or exposed lithology, we find that species richness at local and regional scales exhibits resolution-dependent behavior. In addition, we investigate species-area relationships and rank-abundance patterns. The slopes of the species-area relationships, which are consistent over coarse-graining resolutions, match those found in real landscapes in the case of long-distance dispersal. The rank-abundance patterns are independent of the resolution over a broad range of dispersal length. Our results confirm that strong interactions occur between network structure and the dispersal of species and that under the assumption of neutral dynamics, these interactions produce resolution-dependent biodiversity patterns that diverge from expectations following from universal geomorphic scaling laws. Both in theoretical and in applied ecology studying how patterns change in resolution is relevant for understanding how ecological dynamics work in fragmented landscape and for sampling and biodiversity management campaigns, especially in consideration of climate change.

ID INFILTRATION; EQUATION; TIME; FLOW
AB The in situ determination of the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity of low-permeability porous materials is a major concern for both geotechnics and soil physics with regards to environmental protection or water resources management. Recent early-time single-ring infiltration experiments, involving sequential constant head and falling head conditions, allow its efficient estimation. Nevertheless, the theory on which the interpretation was based was still strictly valid to nondeformable soils and implicity relied on a particular form of the hydraulic conductivity-soil water pressure head relationship. This theory is now extended to deformable materials, without any restrictive hypothesis. A new concept, bulk sorptivity, which characterizes the solid phase movement, is introduced. Field experiments, conducted on two liners of swelling and slowly permeable materials, revealed that neglecting the soil deformation induces an underestimation of the actual coefficient of permeability of the soil.

TI A Game Theory Warning to Blind Drivers Playing Chicken With Public Goods

AB We develop a game theoretic model of the role of foresight in games involving users interacting over a public good. Previous research in this area has applied game theory to understand social dilemmas and inform policy initiatives. However, considerations of the "evolving structure" of natural resource games over time and agents' planning horizon raises the complexity of game analysis substantially and has often been overlooked. We analyze a simple model of an irrigation system shared by two users and consider how players will act under different levels of foresight. Without foresight into game changes over time, players are blind to the fact that they are in a game of chicken. We model agents with foresight by interconnecting games across time and show how this creates opportunities for "strategic loss" early on, allowing players with foresight to reduce total costs. High future costs can thus be avoided with foresight if the rising costs of inaction are made apparent. We consider the effect of discounting and differences between players to provide policy recommendations regarding incentives for foresight.

AB Urban drainage networks (UDNs) represent important infrastructures to protect and maintain community health and safety. For these reasons, technicians and researcher are focusing more and more on topics related to vulnerability, resilience and monitoring for controlling illicit intrusions, contaminant and pathogenic spread. In the last years the complex network theory (CNT) is attracting attention as a new, useful and structured approach to analyze urban systems. The aim of this work is to evaluate potentialities of CNT approaches for UDNs vulnerability assessment and monitoring system planning. Limits and potentialities of applicability of CNT tools to UDNs are first provided evaluating the performances of standard centrality metrics. Then, it is proposed the use of tailored metrics embedding prior information, as intrinsic relevance of each node and pipe flow direction, which derive from the Horton's hierarchy and geometric data (pipe slope), respectively, without performing hydraulic simulations. The analysis is applied on two schematic literature networks of different complexity and to a real case-study. The results suggest that vulnerability/resilience, monitoring design, contaminant and pathogenic spreads can be effectively analyzed using tailored metrics. Therefore, the proposed approach represents a complementary tool respect the more complex and computationally expensive methodologies and it is particular useful for large complex networks.

AB The Hilhorst model was used to convert bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(b)) to pore water electrical conductivity (sigma(p)) under laboratory conditions by using the linear relationship between the soil dielectric constant (epsilon(b)) and sigma(b). In the present study, applying the linear relationship epsilon(b)-sigma(b) to data obtained from field capacitance sensors resulted in strong positive autocorrelations between the residuals of that regression. We were able to derive an accurate offset of the relationship epsilon(b)-sigma(b) and to estimate the evolution of sigma(p) over time by including a stochastic component to the linear model, rearranging it to a time-varying dynamic linear model (DLM), and using Kalman filtering and smoothing. The offset proved to vary for each depth in the same soil profile. A reason for this might be the changes in soil temperature along the soil profile.

AB The relationship between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and precipitation along the Peruvian Pacific coast is investigated over 1964-2011 on the basis of a variety of indices accounting for the different types of El Nino events and atmospheric and oceanographic manifestations of the interannual variability in the tropical Pacific. We show the existence of fluctuations in the ENSO/precipitation relationship at decadal timescales that are associated with the ENSO property changes over the recent decades. Several indices are considered in order to discriminate the influence of the two types of El Nino, namely, the eastern Pacific El Nino and the central Pacific El Nino, as well as the influence of large-scale atmospheric variability associated to the Madden and Julian Oscillation, and of regional oceanic conditions. Three main periods are identified that correspond to the interleave periods between the main climatic transitions over 1964-2011, i.e. the shifts of the 1970s and the 2000s, over which ENSO experiences significant changes in its characteristics. We show that the relationship between ENSO and precipitation along the western coast of Peru has experienced significant decadal change. Whereas El Nino events before 2000 lead to increased precipitation, in the 2000s, ENSO is associated to drier conditions. This is due to the change in the main ENSO pattern after 2000 that is associated to cooler oceanic conditions off Peru during warm events (i.e. central Pacific El Nino). Our analysis also indicates that the two extreme El Nino events of 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 have overshadowed actual trends in the relationship between interannual variability in the tropical Pacific and precipitation along the coast of Peru. Overall, our study stresses on the complexity of the hydrological cycle on the western side of the Andes with regard to its relationship with the interannual to decadal variability in the tropical Pacific.

AB Unlike embankments, earth dams, and other man-made structures, most landslide dams are formed by rapid accumulation of rock or debris rather than mechanical compaction; thus, they are loose and pose a great risk of seepage failure. Landslide materials usually have complex pore structures with randomly distributed pores of various sizes, making the flow and transport processes very complex. Aiming at these challenges, we systematically investigated the influences of pore structure on the micro-and macro-scale flow characteristics of landslide materials. First, landslide materials are simplified as spherical granular packings with wide grain size distributions. Then, we use the Finite-difference method Stokes solver to simulate the fluid flow through granular packings and calculate their permeability. We characterize the pore structure using different topological measures, including these borrowed from complex network theory. Among these measures, tortuosity and global efficiency show clear relations with permeability. The pore network modeling indicates that pore size heterogeneity and pore connectivity significantly influence the flow characteristics. The correlation between pore-scale velocity and throat diameters follows a power-law scaling with an exponent close to two, suggesting that the Hagen-Poiseuille law would still be valid in complex porous media. The permeability and porosity, throat radius, and tortuosity of pore structure can be related by the equation proposed by Nishiyama and Yokoyama (2017, ). The complex network analysis reveals that the assortative network is more permeable than the disassortative network. Furthermore, pores with larger closeness centrality have higher flow efficiency, resulting in higher macroscopic permeability.

AB We present a methodology for determining reservoir groundwater age and transit time probability distributions in a deterministic manner, considering advective-dispersive transport in steady velocity fields. In a first step, we propose to model the statistical distribution of groundwater age at aquifer scale by means of the classical advection-dispersion. equation for a conservative and non-reactive tracer, associated to proper boundary conditions. The evaluated function corresponds to the density of probability of the random variable age, age being defined as the time elapsed since the water particles entered the aquifer. An adjoint backward model is introduced to characterize the life expectancy distribution, life expectancy being the time remaining before leaving the aquifer. By convolution of these two distributions, groundwater transit time distributions, from inlet to outlet, are fully defined for the entire aquifer domain. In a second step, an accurate and efficient method is introduced to simulate the transit time distribution at discharge zones. By applying the reservoir theory to advective-dispersive aquifer systems, we demonstrate that the discharge zone transit time distribution can be evaluated if the internal age probability distribution is known. The reservoir theory also applies to internal life expectancy probabilities yielding the recharge zone life expectancy distribution. Internal groundwater volumes are finally identified with respect to age and transit time. One- and two-dimensional theoretical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed mathematical models, and make inferences on the effect of aquifer structure and macro-dispersion on the distributions of age, life expectancy and transit time.

AB A theory of cross-coupled flow equations in unsaturated soils is necessary to predict (1) electroosmotic flow with application to electroremediation and agriculture, (2) the electroseismic and the seismoelectric effects to develop new geophysical methods to characterize the vadose zone, and (3) the streaming current, which can be used to investigate remotely ground water flow in unsaturated conditions in the capillary water regime. To develop such a theory, the cross-coupled generalized Darcy and Ohm constitutive equations of transport are extended to unsaturated conditions. This model accounts for inertial effects and for the polarization of porous materials. Rather than using the zeta potential, like in conventional theories for the saturated case, the key parameter used here is the quasi-static volumetric charge density of the pore space, which can be directly computed from the quasi-static permeability. The apparent permeability entering Darcy's law is also frequency dependent with a critical relaxation time that is, in turn, dependent on saturation. A decrease of saturation increases the associated relaxation frequency. The final form of the equations couples the Maxwell equations and a simplified form of two-fluid phases Biot theory accounting for water saturation. A generalized expression of the Richard equation is derived, accounting for the effect of the vibration of the skeleton during the passage of seismic waves and the electrical field. A new expression is obtained for the effective stress tensor. The model is tested against experimental data regarding the saturation and frequency dependence of the streaming potential coupling coefficient. The model is also adapted for two-phase flow conditions and a numerical application is shown for water flooding of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL, oil) contaminated aquifer. Seismoelectric conversions are mostly taking place at the NAPL (oil)/water encroachment front and can be therefore used to remotely track the position of this front. This is not the case for other geophysical methods. Citation: Revil, A., and H.

AB A smart decision making framework for stormwater management systems is designed through predictive real-time control (RTC) of the outlet gate of a stormwater basin. The proposed framework offers a cost-effective non-structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set-points. An integrated RTC optimization and rule-based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse, both in terms of quantity and quality. In this approach, the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set-points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods, while the rule-based part controls the quality of the discharged water, through sedimentation, by increasing the detention time. Various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology. The efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing, respectively, the peak flows and detention times of the integrated RTC strategy with those of a static approach. The results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin, in comparison to the static control approach, both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95% and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h, and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76% in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h.

AB This study is an assessment of the return flow ratio of an irrigation abstraction using the flow records of a downstream stream-gauging station, with the example of the Kozluk scheme irrigated by diverted water from Garzan Creek flowing through the southeastern region of Turkey. In the planning reports of the major dam projects of the region, an unverified return ratio was assumed in eliminating the influence of this irrigation on the flow measurements of Garzan Creek. The correctness of this assumed return ratio is evaluated by analysing the monthly streamflow measurements of the Besiri station through a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model constructed with the coarse-scale topography, land use and soil data from open source databases. The results show the necessity of irrigation project-based return flow analyses using regional fine-scale datasets, instead of rule-of-thumb assumptions, to determine the effects of irrigation activities on flow regimes more accurately.

AB Environmental flow provisions are a legal obligation under South Africa's National Water Act (1998) where they are known as the "ecological reserve", which is now being realized in river operations. This article presents a semi-quantitative method, based on flow-duration curve (FDC) analysis, used to assess the compliance of the Crocodile (East) River with the reserve in an historical context. Using both monthly and daily average flow data, we determine the extent and magnitude of non-compliant flows against environmental water requirements (EWRs) for three periods (1960-1983, 1983-2000, and 2000-2010). The results suggest a high degree of noncompliance, with the reserve increasing with each of these periods (14%, 35%, and 39% of the time), respectively, where effects were most pronounced in the low-flow season. The results also suggest that, whilst the magnitudes of reserve infringements for the latter period are relatively high, there appears to have been some improvement since the implementation of the river's operating rules.

AB The generalization of the poroelasticity theory of consolidation in unsaturated soils to well represent gravitational body forces is presented in the current study. Three partial differential equations featuring the displacement vector of the solid phase, along with the excess pore water and air pressures as dependent variables are derived, with coupling that occurs in the first-order temporal- and spatial- derivative terms. The former arises from viscous drag between solid and fluid, whereas the latter is attributed to the presence of gravity. Given the physically-consistent initial and boundary conditions, these coupled equations are numerically solved under uniaxial strain as a representative example. Our results reveal that variations in the excess pore water pressure due to the existence of gravitational forces increase with soil depth, but these variations are not significant if the soil layer is not sufficiently long. A dimensionless parameter is defined theoretically to quantify the impact of those forces on the final total settlement. This impact is shown to become greater as the soil layer is less stiff and has more length, and bears an inversely-proportional trend with initial water saturation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Transfer function models of the rainfall-runoff relationship with various complexities are developed to investigate the hydrological behaviour of a tropical peat catchment that has undergone continuous drainage for a long time. The study reveals that a linear transfer function model of order one and noise term of ARIMA(1,0,0) best represents the monthly rainfall-runoff relationship of a drained peat catchment. The best-fitted transfer function model is capable of illustrating the cumulative hydrological effects of the catchment when subjected to drainage. Transfer function models of daily rainfall-runoff relationships for each year of the period 1983-1993 are also developed to decipher the changes in hydrological behaviour of the catchment due to drainage. The results show that the amount of rain water temporarily stored in the peat soil decreased and the catchment has become more responsive to rainfall over the study period.

AB Effective nutrient pollution mitigation measures require in-depth understanding of spatio-temporal controls on water quality which can be obtained by analyzing export regime and hysteresis patterns in concentration-discharge (c-Q) relationships. Such analyses require high-frequency data (hourly or higher resolution), hampering the assessment of hysteresis patterns in widely available low-frequency (monthly, biweekly) regulatory water quality data. We propose a reproducible classification of c-Q relationships considering export regime (dilution, constancy, enrichment) and long-term average hysteresis pattern (clockwise, no hysteresis, anticlockwise) applicable to low-frequency water quality data. The classification is based on power-law c-Q models with separate parametrization for low and high discharge and rising and falling hydrograph limb, enabling a better representation of c-Q dynamics. The classification has been applied to a 30-years record of daily streamflow and monthly spot samples of solute concentrations in 45 Scottish catchments with contrasting characteristics in terms of topography, climate, soil and land cover. We found that c-Q classification is solute- and catchment-specific and linked to upland versus lowland catchments and streamflow variability. However as the relationship between solute behavior and catchment characteristics is variable, we propose that future typologies should integrate both water quality response, that is, c-Q classification, and catchment characteristics. The data-driven c-Q classification allows us to increase the information content of low-frequency water quality data and thus inform mitigation measures, monitoring strategies, and modeling approaches. Such approaches open up an ability to characterize processes and best management for a wider number of catchments, subject to regulatory surveillance and outside of research catchments.

AB To calculate the effect of rainfall in detaching particles and initiating soil erosion, or in eroding wind turbine leading edge, it is important to measure recorded drop size distributions (DSD) and fall velocity over long period. Commonly used relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and rainfall rate (R) exhibit strong dependence on the temporal resolution at which the analysis is carried out. Here we aim at developing a new scale invariant relationship relying on the framework of Universal Multifractals (UM), which is widely used to analyze and characterize geophysical fields that exhibit extreme variability across wide range of scales.
   Rainfall data is collected using three optical disdrometers working on different underlying technologies (one Campbell Scientific PWS100 and two OTT Parsivel(2) instruments) and operated by the Hydrology Meteorology and Complexity laboratory of Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in Paris area (France). They provide access to the size and velocity of drops falling through sampling areas of few tens of cm2. Such data enables estimation of rainfall DSD, R and KE at various resolutions. The temporal variations of this geophysical data over wide range of scales are then characterized in the UM framework, which was never done for KE. A new power law relation is developed and tested against the theoretical framework assuming gamma DSD for describing the dependence between KE and R. The developed equation using scale invariant features of UM does not rely on gamma DSD assumption, performs as well as the existing tools, and is valid not only at a single scale, but also across scales.

AB Understanding the distribution of snow-water equivalent (SWE) is crucial for the prediction of water resources in the western United States. Backward running SWE reconstructions use satellite-observed, binary snow presence imagery to reconstruct SWE mass estimates. This approach relies on the connection between snow timing and peak SWE, yet few studies have directly examined this relationship. Here, we investigate the strength and spatiotemporal variation in this relationship across the western United States and Alaska. Within the SNOTEL network (n = 611 sites), we find that most variance in peak SWE is explained (median R-2 = 0.64, sigma = 0.18) by, in order of explanatory skill, the timing of snow disappearance, onset, and cover duration, with variation in skill primarily related to climate conditions-like winter storm size and storm frequency-rather than topographical setting. We expand this analysis with a diagnostic model of peak SWE driven by remotely sensed snow timing indices applied to five hydrologically important regions in the western United States and Alaska. Uncertainties arising between blending point and 500 m grid-scale observations were found to influence model SWE bias, but a robust correlation (median R = 0.88) with observations persisted across all tested thresholds. Overall, this supports the viability of snow timing information for quantifying spatial patterns of peak SWE (mean R-2 = 0.76, percent bias = 3.6%) over the past two decades. These findings carry important implications for the development of SWE reanalysis products and for the evaluation of climate and hydrologic models.

AB [ 1] An integrated hydrological modeling approach based on the discretization of a watershed into spatial units called representative elementary watersheds (REWs) has been introduced in earlier publications. Global balance laws were formulated at the spatial scale of a REW by integrating the point-scale conservation equations over particular control volumes. The choice of the control volumes is subject to the specific flow behavior to be described and is dependent on the hydrological characteristics of the spatial regions. These include the unsaturated subsurface flow, groundwater flow, and overland and channel flow. The REW-scale balance laws constitute generally valid governing equations for environmental flows encountered in hydrological systems and are applicable, in contrast to point-scale equations, independently from the chosen spatial and temporal scale of representation. This paper presents a first application of the REW approach to a complex hydrological system and shows how a theory that has so far only been used for synthetic cases is applicable to real-world situations. In this context the most challenging research effort remains the formulation of appropriate closure schemes for mass and momentum ( and energy) fluxes at the REW scale. It is recognized that the schemes proposed for the closure of the fluxes in this paper are subject to limitations but are sufficient to expose the philosophy and the essential working principles. The advantages of the particular spatial discretization and the current limitations of the closure schemes are highlighted. In this context it is pointed out which way future research should go to consolidate the REW approach as a more general and scale-independent modeling philosophy for hydrological systems.

DT Article
DE facies modeling; geological reservoir; GANs; karst cave;

AB We present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based 3D reservoir simulation framework, GANSim-3D, where the generator is progressively trained to capture geological patterns and relationships between various input conditioning data and output earth models, and is thus able to directly produce multiple 3D realistic and conditional earth models from given conditioning data. Conditioning data can include 3D sparse well facies data, probability maps, and global features, such as facies proportion. The generator only includes 3D convolutional layers, and once trained on a data set consisting of small-size data cubes, it can be used for geomodeling of 3D reservoirs of large arbitrary sizes by simply extending the inputs. To illustrate how GANSim-3D is practically used and to verify GANSim-3D, a field karst cave reservoir in Tahe area of China is used as an example. The 3D well facies data and 3D probability map of caves obtained from geophysical interpretation are taken as conditioning data. First, we create training, validation, and test datasets consisting of 64 x 64 x 64-size 3D cave facies models integrating field geological patterns, 3D well facies data, and 3D probability maps. Then, the 3D generator is trained and evaluated with various metrics. Next, we apply the pretrained generator for conditional geomodeling of two field cave reservoirs of size 64 x 64 x 64 and 336 x 256 x 96, respectively. The produced reservoir realizations prove to be diverse, consistent with field geological patterns and field conditioning data, and robust to noise in the 3D probability maps. Each realization with 336 x 256 x 96 cells only takes 0.988 s using 1 GPU.

TI A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF FREE SURFACE-SEEPAGE FACE RELATIONSHIP
   UNDER STEADY-STATE FLOW CONDITIONS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SATURATED-UNSATURATED FLOW; DEFORMABLE POROUS-MEDIA; MODEL
AB The relationship between free surface and seepage face under steady conditions of flow has been analyzed for radial and planar flow configurations. The numerical studies, carried out with a saturated-unsaturated flow model, included the simulation of a series of experimental observations documented by Hall (1955). The numerical analysis took into consideration effects of capillary fringe, model geometry, as well as converging and diverging patterns of flow. For the control series of three cases studied, discharge rates, free surface location, seepage face height and the spatial distribution of potentials closely matched the experimental observations. Additional parametric studies showed that converging patterns of flow favor more pronounced development of seepage face than divergent flows. In two-dimensional planar flow, larger drawdowns tend to favor relatively more pronounced development of seepage face. Comparison of the detailed simulation results (taking unsaturated flow into consideration) with results generated using Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions suggest that the latter may provide discharge estimates that are in error by 12 to 20% both for radial and for two-dimensional planar flows.

AB The relationship between solute concentrations and discharge can inform an integrated understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes at watershed scales. Recent work from multiple catchments has shown that there is typically little variation in concentration relative to large variations in discharge. This pattern has been described as chemostatic behavior. Pond Branch, a forested headwater catchment in Maryland, has been monitored for stream nitrate (NO3-) concentrations at weekly intervals for 14years. In the growing season and autumn of 2011 a high-frequency optical NO3- sensor was used to supplement the long-term weekly data. In this watershed, long-term weekly data show that NO3- concentrations decrease with increasing discharge whereas 6months of 15-minute sensor observed concentrations reveal a more chemostatic behavior. High-frequency NO3- concentrations from the sensor collected during different storm events reveal variable concentration-discharge patterns highlighting the importance of high resolution data and ecohydrological drivers in controlling solute export for biologically reactive solutes such as NO3-.

AB Investigation of the variations in runoff, sediment load, and their dynamic relation is conducive to understanding hydrological regime changes and supporting channel regulation and fluvial management. This study is undertaken in the Xihanshui catchment, which is known for its high sediment-laden in the Jialing River of the Yangtze River basin, southern China, to evaluate the change characteristics of runoff, sediment load, and their relationship at multi-temporal scales from 1966 to 2016. The results showed that runoff changed significantly for more months, whereas the significant changes in monthly sediment load occurred from April to September. The contributions of runoff in summer and autumn and sediment load in summer to their annual value changes were greater. Annual runoff and sediment load in the Xihanshui catchment both exhibited significant decreasing trends (p < 0.05) with a significant mutation in 1993 (p < 0.05). The average annual runoff in the change period (1994-2016) decreased by 49.58% and annual sediment load displayed a substantial decline with a reduction of 77.77% in comparison with the reference period (1966-1993) due to climate change and intensive human activity. The power functions were satisfactory to describe annual and extreme monthly runoff-sediment relationships, whereas the monthly runoff-sediment relationship and extreme monthly sediment-runoff relationship were changeable. Spatially, annual runoff-sediment relationship alteration could be partly attributed to sediment load changes in the upstream area and runoff variations in the downstream region. Three quantitative methods revealed that the main driver for significant reductions of annual runoff and sediment load is the human activity dominated by soil and water conservation measures, while climate change only contributed 22.73%-38.99% (mean 32.07%) to the total runoff reduction and 3.39%-35.56% (mean 17.32%) to the total decrease in sediment load.

AB A holistic approach to groundwater sustainability considers the hydrological, ecological, socio-economic and technological aspects of groundwater utilization. Exploitable groundwater should be determined by physical analysis, as well as by social compromises within a community. In this work, an integrated surface water-groundwater model, SWAT-MODFLOW, is used to examine changes in hydrological components due to various groundwater pumping scenarios in the Mihocheon watershed of South Korea. Under a total groundwater abstraction of 104 mm, which is slightly less than the amount currently permissible by law, a change in storage levels of -16 mm occurred. This abstraction value, which corresponds to 33% of the annual recharge, may be an exploitable groundwater reserve available to Cheongju City, Korea.

AB In forested catchments, the exceedance of rainfall and antecedent water storage thresholds is often required for runoff generation, yet to our knowledge these threshold relationships remain undescribed in tropical dry forest catchments. We, therefore, identified the controls of streamflow activation and the timing and magnitude of runoff in a tropical dry forest catchment near the Pacific coast of central Mexico. During a 52 day transition phase from the dry to wet season, soil water movement was dominated by vertical flow which continued until a threshold soil moisture content of 26% was reached at 100 cm below the surface. This satisfied a 162 mm storage deficit and activated streamflow, likely through lateral subsurface flow pathways. High antecedent soil water conditions were maintained during the wet phase but had a weak influence on stormflow. We identified a threshold value of 289 mm of summed rainfall and antecedent soil water needed to generate >4 mm of stormflow per event. Above this threshold, stormflow response and magnitude was almost entirely governed by rainfall event characteristics and not antecedent soil moisture conditions. Our results show that over the course of the wet season in tropical dry forests the dominant controls on runoff generation changed from antecedent soil water and storage to the depth of rainfall.

AB Laboratory experiments were performed with nearly uniform fluvial gravel (D-50=9 mm, D-10=5 mm and D-90=13 mm) to analyse the relationship between stream power and bed load transport rate in gravel-bed braided rivers at high grain Reynolds numbers. The values of the unit-width dimensionless bed-load rate q(b)* and unit-width dimensionless stream power omega* were evaluated in equilibrium conditions based on ten different experimental runs. Then, they were plotted along with values obtained during particularly representative field studies documented in the literature, and a regression law was derived. For comparison, a regression analysis was performed using the data obtained from laboratory experiments characterized by smaller grain sizes and, therefore, referring to relatively low grain Reynolds numbers. A numerical integration of Exner's equation was performed to reconstruct the local and time-dependent functional dependence of q(b)* and w*. The results led to the following conclusions: 1) At equilibrium, the reach averaged bed load transport rate is related to the reach-averaged stream power by different regression laws at high and low grain Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the transition from bed to suspended load transport is accelerated by low Re*, with the corresponding bed load discharge increasing with stream power at a lower, linear rate. 2) When tested against the gravel laboratory measurements, the high Re* power law derived in the present study performs considerably better than do previous formulas. 3) The longitudinal variability of the section-averaged equilibrium stream power is much more pronounced than that characterizing the bed load rate, at least for high Re*. Thus, the stream power and its local-scale heterogeneity seem to be directly responsible for transverse sediment re-distribution and, ultimately, for the determination of the spatial and temporal scales that characterize the gravel bedforms. 4) Finally, the stochastic interpretation of the wetted bed elevation function mapped in a particularly representative sample run reveals that gravel-bed transport and braiding are associated with the persistence of multiple equilibrium energy states due to the presence of truly non-stationary, local-scale pseudo-periodicity.

TI A THEORY OF FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID MODEL
AB A local flood warning system typically serves a small community situated in a headwater area and exposed to flash floods or rapid riverine floods. Forecasts of such flood events are characterized by short lead times and large uncertainties, A Bayesian theory is formulated for a local flood warning system built of three functional components: monitor, forecaster, and decider. The theory offers a modeling framework and mathematical concepts necessary for (1) developing optimal decision rules for issuing warnings based on imperfect forecasts, (2) evaluating system performance statistically, and (3) computing the ex ante economic benefits from a system.

AB This paper focuses on a regionalization attempt to partly solve data limitation problems in statistical analysis of high flows to derive discharge-duration-frequency (QDF) relationships. The analysis is based on 24 selected catchments in the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) in East Africa. Characteristics of the theoretical QDF relationships were parameterized to capture their slopes of extreme value distributions (evd), tail behaviour and scaling measures. To enable QDF estimates to be obtained for ungauged catchments, interdependence relationships between the QDF parameters were identified, and regional regression models were developed to explain the regional difference in these parameters from physiographic characteristics. In validation of the regression models, from the lowest (5 years) to the highest (25 years) return periods considered, the percentage bias in the QDF estimates ranged from -2% for the 5-year return period to 27% for 25-year return period.

TI Erodibility of road batters under simulated rainfall
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Rainfall simulation experiments on road batters in a forest catchment in New South Wales, Australia, demonstrated the limits of small scale erosion studies. Comparable erodibility studies were carried out on road surfaces, road batters constructed of soil, bedrock and unconsolidated materials and the forest surfaces. There was no significant difference in sediment loss between any type of site, nor was there any significant relationship between sediment loss and either slope, materials or vegetation cover. The difficulties in obtaining any relationships between sediment loss, slope, cover and material type have implications for the usefulness of models which attempt to predict soil losses, as well as for future experimental work of this type.

AB Among countries with river basin organizations to manage their water resources, Spain's experience is one of the longest. One of the first basin agencies established in Spain was for the Guadalquivir River in the south. A case study of that river basin and its management indicates how basin management is shaped by political economy factors such as the historical path of the agency's evolution, the basin agency's relationships with central government and with regional or local governments, the patterns of water user representation within the agency, and developments in water law and policy external to the basin agency. The case raises questions about whether and how integrated water resources management at the river basin scale is implemented, even in locations where basin agencies already exist. It also suggests that the politics of management at the river basin level will affect the implementation of national water policies intended to promote integrated management.

AB The absorption and scattering coefficients in the euphotic zone of oligotrophic Lake Taupo, New Zealand, were measured at 19 stations across the 620 km(2) lake in late fall during the period of mixed layer deepening and development of the annual phytoplankton maximum. These coefficients were subsequently related to the water content of colored dissolved organic matter ( CDOM), phytoplankton, and nonalgal particles via measurements of the absorption spectra of these optically active substances and of chlorophyll a and suspended particle concentrations. Measurements of the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (K-d) and of reflectance (L-u/E-d) revealed that the clear blue waters of Lake Taupo had a minimum K-d of 0.09 m(-1) at 500 nm and maximum reflectance at 490 nm. The measured K-d and L-u/E-d were well described by modeled spectra that were computed using a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight) assuming relatively low values for the backscattering ratio (0.008-0.014). The relationships established here between the optical properties and optically active substances were consistent with previous observations in case 2 marine waters, and they will provide a basis for prediction of eutrophication, climate, and other environmental effects on the blueness and transparency of large oligotrophic lakes.

AB Hydrological connectivity describes the physical coupling (linkages) of different elements within a landscape regarding (sub-) surface flows. A firm understanding of hydrological connectivity is important for catchment management applications, for example, habitat and species protection, and for flood resistance and resilience improvement. Thinking about (geomorphological) systems as networks can lead to new insights, which has also been recognized within the scientific community, seeing the recent increase in the use of network (graph) theory within the geosciences. Network theory supports the analysis and understanding of complex systems by providing data structures for modelling objects and their linkages, and a versatile toolbox to quantitatively appraise network structure and properties. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify overland flow connectivity dynamics on hillslopes in a humid sub-Mediterranean environment by using a combination of high-resolution digital-terrain models, overland flow sensors and a network approach. Results showed that there are significant differences between overland flow connectivity on agricultural areas and semi-natural shrubs areas. Significant positive correlations between connectivity and precipitation characteristics were found. Significant negative correlations between connectivity and soil moisture were found, most likely because of soil water repellency and/or soil surface crusting. The combination of structural networks and dynamic networks for determining potential connectivity and actual connectivity proved a powerful tool for analysing overland flow connectivity.

ID GROUNDWATER AGE; SYSTEMS; MODELS; TRANSPORT; FLOW
AB Although the concepts of age, survival, and transit time have been widely used in many fields, including population dynamics, chemical engineering, and hydrology, a comprehensive mathematical framework is still missing. Here we discuss several relationships among these quantities by starting from the evolution equation for the joint distribution of age and survival, from which the equations for age and survival time readily follow. It also becomes apparent how the statistical dependence between age and survival is directly related to either the age dependence of the loss function or the survival-time dependence of the input function. The solution of the joint distribution equation also allows us to obtain the relationships between the age at exit (or death) and the survival time at input (or birth), as well as to stress the symmetries of the various distributions under time reversal. The transit time is then obtained as a sum of the age and survival time, and its properties are discussed along with the general relationships between their mean values. The special case of steady state case is analyzed in detail. Some examples, inspired by hydrologic applications, are presented to illustrate the theory with the specific results.

ID FLUVIAL SYSTEMS; LANDSCAPE
AB The tributary-trunk stream relationship is investigated with respect to hyperconcentrated flows and coupled wind-water processes in the Yellow River, China. Ten small tributaries that drain only 3% of the total drainage area of the trunk stream transport large amounts of relatively coarse sediment from the desert to the trunk stream during hyperconcentrated floods. The resultant strong sedimentation often jams the trunk stream, leading to serious disasters. This study reveals the cause of this interesting phenomenon and proposes countermeasures for disaster reduction. A typical sediment-jamming event (SJE) in July 1989 was thoroughly analysed based on the observational data, including the beginning, development and final stages of the event. An index of the geomorphologic effectiveness of the tributary on the trunk stream and a number of indices describing SJEs and the influencing factors are adopted, based on which a discrimination relationship for the occurrence of SJEs is established and some statistical relationships are also established. The SJE's hydrological and geomorphologic impacts are discussed at short timescales (from several days to one month) and at long time scales (up to 46years). The results may help to gain a new insight into the study of the tributary-trunk stream relationship, and provide useful information for sediment management and disaster-reduction planning in the drainage basin. Countermeasures are suggested to reduce the channel sedimentation and the risk of sediment-jamming disaters.

AB A new methodology is developed to extract tidal network from hydrodynamic conditions, and use data derived from numerical modeling or field observations to test the hypothesis that tidal networks are characterized by scale-invariant properties. Different tidal network configurations have been obtained from long-term numerical simulations in an idealized basin. These simulations show the influence of hydrodynamic conditions (tidal range, TR) and sediment (grain size sediment, D-50) on the final configuration of the network. One of the signatures of scale-invariant behavior is related to the presence of a power law relationship in the probability distribution of geometrical characteristics. For each model configuration and field site, the probability distribution of drainage area and the drainage volume has been calculated, and in both cases tidal networks show scale-invariant characteristics. After assessing the sensitivity of the results, an energy expenditure analysis shows that tidal basins evolve toward a state with less morphodynamic activity, with a lower energy expenditure compare with the initial state.

AB Extreme flows are key components of river flow regimes that affect manifold hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes with societal relevance. One fundamental characteristic of extreme flows in river basins is that they exhibit scaling properties which can be identified through scaling (power) laws. Understanding the physical mechanisms behind such scaling laws is a continuing challenge in hydrology, with potential implications for the prediction of river flow regimes in a changing environment and ungauged basins. After highlighting that the scaling properties are sensitive to environmental change, we develop a physical interpretation of how temporal changes in scaling exponents relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows. Regulation is defined here as the basins' capacity to either dampen high flows or to enhance low flows. Further, we use this framework to infer temporal changes in the regulation capacity of five large basins in tropical South America. Our results indicate that, during the last few decades, the Amazon river basin has been reducing its capacity to enhance low flows, likely as a consequence of pronounced environmental change in its south and south-eastern sub-basins. The proposed framework is widely applicable to different basins, and provides foundations for using scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation, particularly relevant for identifying and managing hydrological consequences of environmental change.

AB The problem of transmission of pressure head through the zone of tension saturation in the Lisse effect (LE), i.e., the rapid response of groundwater level to pressurized pore air in the unsaturated zone, is investigated theoretically and experimentally. From the law of conservation of energy and the continuity equation, a one-dimensional diffusion equation is derived for transmission of pressure head through the zone of tension saturation. The solution to the equation is the pressure head at any point below the upper boundary of the zone of tension saturation and at any time after the compressed pore air pressure is imposed on the boundary. The key parameter, which determines the behaviour of transmission of pressure head, is the newly proposed pressure head diffusivity coefficient. The theoretical results agree with the experimental results, obtained from laboratory column experiments in three physically different soils.

AB We experimentally and numerically study the influence of gravity and finite-size effects on the pressure-saturation relationship in a given porous medium during slow drainage. The effect of gravity is systematically varied by tilting the system relative to the horizontal configuration. The use of a quasi two-dimensional porous media allows for direct spatial monitoring of the saturation. Exploiting the fractal nature of the invasion structure, we obtain a relationship between the final saturation and the Bond number SnwF=Bo0.097 using percolation theory. Moreover, the saturation, pressure, and Bond number are functionally related, allowing for pressure-saturation curves to collapse onto a single master curve, parameterized by the representative elementary volume size and by the Bond and capillary numbers. This allows to upscale the pressure-saturation curves measured in a laboratory to large representative elementary volumes used in reservoir simulations. The large-scale behavior of these curves follows a simple relationship, depending on Bond and capillary numbers, and on the flow direction. The size distribution of trapped defending fluid clusters is also shown to contain information on past fluid flow and can be used as a marker of past flow speed and direction.

TI Laplace equation and Faraday's lines of force
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Boundary-value problems involve two dependent variables: a potential function and a stream function. They can be approached in two mutually independent ways. The first, introduced by Laplace, involves spatial gradients at a point. Inspired by Faraday, Maxwell introduced the other, visualizing the flow domain as a collection of flow tubes and isopotential surfaces. Boundary-value problems intrinsically entail coupled treatment (or, equivalently, optimization) of potential and stream functions. Historically, potential theory avoided the cumbersome optimization task through ingenious techniques such as conformal mapping and Green's functions. Laplace's point-based approach and Maxwell's global approach each provides its own unique insights into boundary-value problems. Commonly, Laplace's equation is solved either algebraically or with approximate numerical methods. Maxwell's geometry-based approach opens up novel possibilities of direct optimization, providing an independent logical basis for numerical models, rather than treating them as approximate solvers of the differential equation. Whereas points, gradients, and Darcy's law are central to posing problems on the basis of Laplace's approach, flow tubes, potential differences, and the mathematical form of Ohm's law are central to posing them in natural coordinates oriented along flow paths. Besides being of philosophical interest, optimization algorithms can provide advantages that complement the power of classical numerical models. In the spirit of Maxwell, who eloquently spoke for a balance between abstract mathematical symbolism and observable attributes of concrete objects, this paper is an examination of the central ideas of the two approaches, and a reflection on how Maxwell's integral visualization may be practically put to use in a world of digital computers.

AB This is the first part of a two-part paper presenting a new method for treating convective-dispersive transport. The motivation for developing this technique arises from the demands of performing a risk assessment for a nuclear waste repository. These demands include computational efficiency over a relatively large range of Peclet numbers, the ability to handle chains of decaying radionuclides with rather extreme contrasts in both solution velocities and half lives, and the ability to treat leach- or solubility-limited sources. To the extent it has been tested to date, the distributed velocity method (DVM) appears to satisfy these demands. This part contains an overall introduction and presents the mathematical theory, numerical implementation, and example results.

The principal advantage of percolation theory is that it provides universal laws which determine the geometrical and physical properties of the system. This survey discusses developments and results in percolation theory to date, and identifies aspects relevant to problems in groundwater hydrology. The methods of percolation theory are discussed, previous applications of the theory to hydrological problems are reviewed, and future directions for study are suggested.

AB This paper presents a formulation accounting for the effect of delayed drainage phenomenon (DDP) on the breakthrough of contaminant flux in an aquitard, by considering the movement of soil particles, porosity variation, hydraulic head variation, and transient flow during the consolidation. The water flow equation in an aquitard was based on the Terzaghi's consolidation theory, and the contaminant transport equation was derived on the basis of the mass balance law. Two cases were used to illustrate the effect of DDP on the contaminant transport in an aquitard of small deformation. It is found that the breakthrough time of contaminant in an aquitard is very long, which is mainly ascribed to the low permeability of aquitard and sorption of soil particles. It is also found that the increase of depletion, which is in general induced by the increase of thickness and specific storativity and the decrease of hydraulic conductivity, enhances the impact of DDP on the contaminant transport in an aquitard. A larger delay index (styled-content style-type="mathematics(0)) of DDP gives a greater delay breakthrough time (DBT) of solute transport in an aquitard, which controls the difference of the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in aquitards with and without the occurrence of DDP. For the cases where advection plays a dominant role during the process of solute transport, styled-content style-type="mathematics">(0) styled-content is almost linearly correlated with DBT, and the ratio of DBT over the breakthrough time without consideration of DDP also approximately shows a linear relationship with the ratio of specific storativity to porosity, given a fixed drawdown in the adjacent aquifer with the sorption being ignored.

AB A thorough understanding of rainfall recharge processes and their controlling factors is essential for management of groundwater systems. This study investigates the effects of various meteorological and hydrogeological factors on the gross recharge percentages, the rainfall -recharge relationships and the recharge threshold values for unconfined sandy aquifers under an equatorial climate. Among the meteorological factors investigated, rainfall intensity was found to have the most significant impact on the gross recharge rate. The effects of potential evaporation rate, relative humidity and air temperature on the gross recharge percentage were significant when the vadose zone thickness is larger than 2-5 m. The recharge threshold values were found to depend strongly on the vadose zone thickness. The rainfall -recharge relationships could generally be well defined by a normal-log relationship. The rainfall -recharge relationships derived here are applicable to yield estimates of gross recharge percentages for unconfined sandy aquifers under an equatorial climate, using rainfall intensity and vadose zone thickness as input variables. In this study, a theory was developed and validated to provide physical explanations for the observations, based on the residence time of the percolated rainwater within the vadose zone. Among the soil hydraulic parameters tested, porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were found to have the most pronounced effects on the gross recharge percentage. Utilizing the sensitivity results and the theory derived, an approach was developed for extending the application of the derived rainfall -recharge relationships to other sand textures. The approach was found to be capable of producing rough and fast estimations of gross recharge percentage for other sand textures. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Studying the tailing behavior of breakthrough curves ( BTCs) is useful in the characterization of anomalous transport, matrix diffusion, and kinetic sorption. We analyze how BTCs of nonreactive and sorbing tracers behave at late time in well-to-well flow fields in homogeneous media. In the absence of regional flow, an asymptotic solution is derived for the traveltime distribution which follows a power law with exponent -4/3 at late times. With regional flow, the traveltime distribution exhibits a power law with exponent -4/3 over a certain period of time, followed by exponential decay. Dispersion influences the early time behavior but has little effect on the late-time tailing. We also consider the BTC tailing of tracers undergoing kinetic sorption and diffusive mass transfer into immobile regions. If the memory function characterizing sorption kinetics is exponential, the late-time behavior of the BTC is controlled by the traveltime distribution and thus follows a power law with exponent -4/3. In case of a matrix diffusion model, the memory function exhibits a power law with exponent -1/2, and the BTC in the dipole flow field follows a power law with exponent -7/6 in an intermediate time range, which differs from the exponent of -3/2 observed in uniform flow. Our analysis demonstrates that the flow configuration has to be considered when the tailing behavior of BTCs is used to characterize mass transfer kinetics. In particular, truncating a well-to-well tracer test at times where the traveltime distribution still follows the power law behavior may lead to the erroneous interpretation that the power law tailing of the BTC is caused by matrix diffusion.

AB Using the Shannon entropy, the space-time variability of rainfall and streamflow was assessed for daily rainfall and streamflow data for a 10-year period from 189 stations in the northeastern region of Brazil. Mean values of marginal entropy were computed for all observation stations and entropy maps were then constructed for delineating annual and seasonal characteristics of rainfall and streamflow. The Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate the long-term trend in marginal entropy as well as relative entropy for two sample stations. The marginal entropy values of rainfall and streamflow were higher for locations and periods with the highest amounts of rainfall. The entropy values were higher where rainfall was higher. This was because the probability distributions of rainfall and the resulting streamflow were more uniform and less skewed. The Shannon entropy produced spatial patterns which led to a better understanding of rainfall and streamflow characteristics throughout the northeastern region of Brazil. The total relative entropy indicated that rainfall and streamflow carried the same information content at annual and rainy season time scales.

AB This study applies image well theory to estimate the stream depletion rate (SDR) due to pumping near a meandering stream with a clogged streambed treated as the Robin condition. The stream is considered as an irregular boundary represented by discrete nodes. Image wells are arranged along the stream and near those nodes. On the basis of the Theis (1935) solution and the principle of superposition, the solution for the aquifer drawdown subject to the stream can then be expressed as the sum of the Theis solution and a simple series representing the effect of those image wells. The discharge rates of the image wells are determined by solving a system of equations obtained by substituting the drawdown solution into the Robin condition. Quantitative criteria for assessing the applicability of the image well theory are provided. On the basis of the drawdown solution and Darcy's law, the analytical solution for SDR can then be obtained. A finite element solution is also developed to verify the SDR solution. Temporal SDR distributions predicted by both the analytical solution and finite element solution agree well over the entire period except at late time when the stream filtration rate approaches the pumping rate (i.e., SDR 1). It is found that a meandering stream has a significant effect on SDR compared with a rectilinear one and the effect should be taken into account in estimating SDR.

AB A complementary relationship evaporation model has been proposed and verified based on evaluations of the advection-aridity model and the Granger's complementary relationship model (Granger model) in dimensionless forms. Normalized by Penman potential evaporation, the Granger model and the advection-aridity model have been transformed into similar dimensionless forms. Evaporation ratio (ratio of actual evaporation to Penman potential evaporation) has been expressed as a function of dimensionless variable based on radiation and atmospheric conditions. Similar dimensionless variables for the different functions have been used in the two models. By referring to the dimensionless variable from the advection-aridity model and the function from the Granger model, a new model to estimate actual evaporation was proposed. The performance of the new model has been validated by the observed data from four sites under different land covers. The new model is an enhanced Granger model with better evaporation prediction over the aforementioned different land covers. It also offers more stable optimized parameters in a grassland site than the Granger model. The new model somewhat approximates the advection-aridity model under neither too wet nor too dry conditions, but without its system bias. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Stream Gauge Calibration of a Cave Stream Using Water Temperature
   Variability as a Tracer
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW VELOCITY; HEAT; RESISTANCE; TRANSPORT
AB Calibration of stream gauging stations involves water velocity measurements at various water levels to obtain discharge and to determine the rating curve. This process is laborious, often logistically challenging, or even impossible for streams that are only accessible at low flow. Here, we present an alternative method to obtain mean stream velocity by matching temperature variation patterns measured at two positions in the stream. Such water temperature variations are caused by snow melt or rainfall events and serve as natural tracers. The method is successfully applied to a karst cave stream that is only accessible at lowest flow. The installed high-precision data loggers provide sufficient data to obtain a relationship between water depth and mean velocity. The approximate rating curve, based on reach mean channel width, agrees well with results from dye tracer experiments. This cave stream shows the typical features of a steep step-pool stream such as a power law relation between mean velocity and discharge.

ID MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Genetic algorithms, founded upon the principle of evolution, are applicable to many optimization problems, especially popular for solving parameter optimization problems. Reservoir operating rule curves are the most common way for guiding and managing the reservoir operation. These rule curves traditionally are derived through intensive simulation techniques. The main aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of two genetic algorithms (GAs), i.e., binary coded and real coded, to derive multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves. The curves are assumed to be piecewise linear functions where the coordinates of their inflection points are the unknowns and we want to optimize system performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods are tested on the operation of the Shih-Men reservoir in Taiwan. The current M-5 operating curves of the Shih-Men reservoir are also evaluated. The results show that the GAs provide an adequate, effective and robust way for searching the rule curves. Both sets of operating rule curves obtained from GAs have better performance, in terms of water release deficit and hydropower, than the current M-5 operating rule curves, while the real-coded GA is more efficient than the binary-coded GA.

AB Movement of colloids in the subsurface is a concern because mobile colloids may enhance the transport of contaminants. The excessive time required to conduct flow and transport experiments in porous media led to the use of centrifuges to evaluate subsurface transport processes. The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of centrifuges to study colloid transport in saturated porous media. We used a geocentrifuge to run colloid transport experiments under different centrifugal accelerations up to 20 g. Colloids of different densities were used: polystyrene (1.05 g/cm(3)), silica (2 g/cm(3)), and hematite (5.26 g/cm(3)). Deposition coefficients were obtained from the colloid breakthrough curves. We used filtration theory and a theory based on sedimentation-diffusion to derive functional relationships between centrifugal acceleration and colloid and porous media properties, which allow us to predict the effect of acceleration on colloid transport. Comparison of experimental deposition coefficients with predictions based on filtration theory showed that filtration theory accurately predicted the behavior of polystyrene at higher accelerations but underpredicted colloid deposition for silica and hematite at accelerations higher than similar to 10 g. The sedimentation-diffusion theory allows us to determine whether a system is dominated by sedimentation or diffusion, or is in a transitional state. Theoretical predictions of colloid deposition in a porous medium agreed well with experiments, suggesting that the theory can be used to delineate when centrifugal acceleration will alter colloid transport in flow through column studies conducted in a centrifuge. Common subsurface colloids, such as iron oxides and aluminosilicates, can be affected at accelerations that are used in geocentrifuge transport studies (5 to 300 g). Even colloids with low specific densities, such as polystyrene, will be affected by centrifugal accelerations if their size is large.

AB This study presents a simple rainfall-discharge analysis for the Andit Tid, Anjeni, and Maybar watersheds of northern Ethiopia. The Soil Conservation Research Programme (SCRP) established monitoring stations in each of these sites during the 1980s, with climate and stream flow measurements being recorded up to the present. To show how these data could be used to provide insight into catchment-level runoff mechanisms, simple linear relationships between effective precipitation and runoff are developed for each watershed, with the conclusion that all three watersheds exhibit consistent hydrologic behaviour after approximately 500 mm of cumulative effective seasonal rainfall has fallen since the beginning of season. After the 500 mm rainfall threshold is reached, approximately 50% of any further precipitation on these watersheds will directly contribute to catchment runoff.

AB The effects of rainfall intensity on stemflow production as described in the literature are quite inconsistent (increase, decrease, or no clear relationship) due to complex interactions between rainfall characteristics, and the effect of raindrop size on stemflow production has rarely been explored. Here we conducted field rainfall simulation experiments on two dominant xerophytic shrubs (Caragana korshinskii and Artemisia ordosica) in northwesten China to quantitatively examine the relationship between rainfall intensity and stemflow production, and to test whether larger raindrops result in a decrease in stemflow production. We found that (1) stemflow production increased with rainfall intensity until reaching a threshold value and then began to decrease, and (2) stemflow showed a significant (P < .01) linear decrease with increasing raindrop size. Our study is useful to reconcile the disputed relationships between rainfall intensity and stemflow production, and provides a basis for a quantitative evaluation to fill the knowledge gap regarding how raindrop size determines stemflow production.

AB Changes in monthly streamflow and the potential influences and feedbacks of agricultural activities are investigated. Significant decreases in streamflow are observed in northern China, including the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe river basins, while in southern China streamflow increases significantly in the Yangtze, Pearl and South river basins. This spatial pattern of changes in streamflow indicates that the imbalance in water resources between northern (dry) and southern (wet) China has increased during past decades. On the one hand, available water resources are a controlling factor determining the expansion of irrigated land and the structure of crop plantation (i.e. rice, wheat, corn or bean); on the other hand, crop planting structure and effective irrigated areas are important determinants of changes in streamflow. The increasing effective irrigation and rice planting areas in northern China may increase water withdrawal from rivers, causing subsequent decreases in streamflow, while in southeastern China, decreasing effective irrigation areas enhance the increases in streamflow.

AB Breakthrough pressure and permeability control the structural sealing capacity of mudrocks in hydrocarbon reservoirs and CO2 sequestration sites. Breakthrough pressure studies show a wide array of results due to the natural heterogeneity of mudrocks. This includes the effects of variability in grain size distribution, fine sediment fraction, and mineral composition. Resedimentation techniques have been widely applied to the study of mudrock permeability but little work focused on breakthrough pressure. Here we perform a parametric study on breakthrough pressure and permeability in resedimented mudrocks using samples composed of ternary mixtures of kaolinite, quartz, and lime. The texture, or grain size distributions, and composition, or mineralogical concentration, of our mudrock fabric is systematically varied. We show that lime is effective in cementing resedimented samples, producing mechanically competent mudrocks and allowing for robust mercury injection capillary porosimetry. We observed that breakthrough pressure increases and permeability decreases with fine-grained void ratio, rather than bulk void ratio, according to power-law relationships. The fine-grained void ratio is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to volume of fine grains where the size of the fine grains is controlled by the structure of the coarse-grained percolating network. These relationships can be used to estimate the sealing capacity of shaly sandstones and sandy mudrocks and highlight the variability of transport properties in coarse-fine sediment mixtures.

AB This paper presents the applicability of neural network (NN) modelling for forecasting and filtering problems. The multilayer feedforward (MLFF) network was first constructed to forecast the tidal-level variations at the mouth of the River Chao Phraya in Thailand. Unlike the well-known conventional harmonic analysis, the NN model uses a set of previous data for learning and then forecasting directly the time-series of tidal levels. It was found that lead time of I to 24 hourly tidal levels can be predicted successfully using only a short-time hourly learning data. The MLFF network was further used to establish a stage-discharge relationship for the tidal river. The results show a considerably better performance of the NN model over the conventional models. In addition, the stage-discharge relationship obtained by the NN model can indicate reasonably well the important behaviour of the tidal influences. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID MODEL; PROPAGATION; PREDICTION; DISPERSION; CANOPY
AB Suspended vegetation in open channels retards flow, which, as a result the vertical distribution of streamwise velocities, will deviate from the classic logarithmic law. To clearly understand the hydraulic properties of turbulent flow in an open channel with suspended vegetation, we analyzed hydraulic mechanisms by vertically dividing the flow region into three parts extending from the channel bed to the water surface: a basal non-vegetated layer, an internal vegetation layer and an upper vegetation layer. For each layer, the streamwise velocity was obtained by mathematically solving the momentum equations. Mixing length theory was adopted to determine the shear stress in the internal and non-vegetation layers, and some parameters were determined using published data from Plew's detailed laboratory measurements. The good agreement between the analytically and experimentally predicted vertical distributions of streamwise velocity indicated that the three-layer model is both applicable and reliable.

AB In recent years, the water conflict between competing users in the middle and lower reaches of the Heihe River has intensified, causing severe social, economic, and ecological problems. This research aims to alleviate water conflicts between multiple objectives that consider eight cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin to be the regulatory bodies using the optimal operation model and fuzzy optimization evaluation model. The innovative approach combining the parallel mechanism with optimization algorithms (i.e., Flower Pollination Algorithm and Non-dominated Neighbor Immune Algorithm) is proposed to solve the optimal operation models, analyze the time distribution laws of water supply dilemma and the transformation rules among three objectives (power generation, irrigation, and ecology). Based on the evaluation indicator system and subjective and objective comprehensive weighting methods (i.e., Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy Weight Method), a fuzzy optimization evaluation model is applied to search for the optimal dispatching scheme for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. Results indicate several findings. First, the Parallel Flower Pollination Algorithm produces high precision and stability with outstanding calculation efficiency. Second, the period of the water supply dilemma is October and next April, and the annual water supply dilemma is affected by the frequency of incoming water. Third, the competitive relationship between irrigation and ecology is the strongest, followed by the relationship between ecology and power generation, the relationship between ecology and power generation is relatively weak. Fourth, the optimal dispatching scheme in each typical year is the scheme with the ratio values of the transformation coefficients among power generation, irrigation, and ecological objectives the closest to 1:1:1, respectively. It is conducive to scientifically guiding the dispatch of water resources in the Heihe River Basin, alleviating water conflicts, and ensuring socio-economic development and ecological safety.

TI Entropy theory-based criterion for hydrometric network evaluation and
   design: Maximum information minimum redundancy
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Hydrometric information constitutes the fundamental input for planning, design, operation, and management of water resources systems. How to optimally site monitoring gauges such that they are effective and efficient in gathering the hydrometric information or data has received considerable attention. This paper presents a generic approach for the design (or evaluation) of hydrometric networks. First, an entropy theory-based criterion, named as maximum information minimum redundancy (MIMR), is proposed. The MIMR criterion maximizes the joint entropy of stations within the optimal set, and the transinformation between stations within and outside of the optimal set. Meanwhile, it insures that the optimal set contains minimum duplicated information. An easy-to-implement greedy ranking algorithm is developed to accomplish the MIMR selection. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of MIMR in hydrometric network evaluation and design. We also compare the MIMR selection with another entropy-based approach. Results illustrate that MIMR is apt at finding stations with high information content, and locating independent stations. The proposed approach is suitable for design (or evaluation) of any type of hydrometric network.

TI Game theory and risk-based leveed river system planning with
   noncooperation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; POLICIES; DESIGN
AB Optimal risk-based levee designs are usually developed for economic efficiency. However, in river systems with multiple levees, the planning and maintenance of different levees are controlled by different agencies or groups. For example, along many rivers, levees on opposite riverbanks constitute a simple leveed river system with each levee designed and controlled separately. Collaborative planning of the two levees can be economically optimal for the whole system. Independent and self-interested landholders on opposite riversides often are willing to separately determine their individual optimal levee plans, resulting in a less efficient leveed river system from an overall society-wide perspective (the tragedy of commons). We apply game theory to simple leveed river system planning where landholders on each riverside independently determine their optimal risk-based levee plans. Outcomes from noncooperative games are analyzed and compared with the overall economically optimal outcome, which minimizes net flood cost system-wide. The system-wide economically optimal solution generally transfers residual flood risk to the lower-valued side of the river, but is often impractical without compensating for flood risk transfer to improve outcomes for all individuals involved. Such compensation can be determined and implemented with landholders' agreements on collaboration to develop an economically optimal plan. By examining iterative multiple-shot noncooperative games with reversible and irreversible decisions, the costs of myopia for the future in making levee planning decisions show the significance of considering the externalities and evolution path of dynamic water resource problems to improve decision-making.

AB The objective of this article is to study the temporal variations in the hydrometeorological parameters and to identify the tendencies in the rainfall-runoff relationship of the Wadi Sebdou basin, a sub-basin of Tafna, situated in northwestern Algeria. Based on rainfall (1941-2012) and hydrometric data (1972-2012), statistical tests were used to identify the abrupt breaks and to evaluate the hydrometeorological deficits. The results revealed a modification of the rainfall regime distinctly manifested by a downward trend that arose in the mid-1970s, with a 25% reduction. Moreover, the reduction of flow in the 40-year period exceedsed 58%, with an abrupt break detected at the beginning of the 1980s. The identification of trends in the rainfall-runoff relationship was carried out by application of the crossed simulations approach, using the GR2M model, over several 5-year sub-periods. A period of non-stationarity of the rainfall-runoff relationship was highlighted in the period 1985-2004, indicating a downward trend of the monthly runoff of the Wadi Sebdou basin.

TI Potential theory for dual-depth subsurface drainage of ponded land
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Dual-depth subsurface drainage is considered to be more effective in removing excess water from soil than,single-depth drainage, but this problem has not been analyzed in detail. Therefore, assuming that uniform, water-saturated soil covered by ponded water and overlying an impervious barrier is drained by equally spaced, alternating deep circular drain tubes, existing potential flow theory for a single-depth drainage system was extended. Sample calculations with the newly derived equations show that a dual-depth subsurface drainage system can be highly effective to remove excess water from soil. For example, a relative drain discharge of 160% is calculated when new drain tubes, added at the 0.60 m depth, are placed midway between the original drain tubes, which are 25 m apart and at the 1.20 m depth. In this calculation we have assumed that the impervious layer is at the 3.0 m depth, the radius of the tubes is 0.05 m, the soil hydraulic conductivity is 1 m/d, and the thickness of the ponded water is 0.0 m. For the same conditions, but with the additional tubes at the 1.20 m depth (same depth as original tubes), the relative drain discharge becomes nearly 200%, and with the additional tubes at the 2.40 depth (1.20 m below original tubes) it is more than 250%. When the impervious layer is at a greater depth and when the original drain spacing is more than 25.0 m, the relative drain discharge becomes even larger. The effectiveness of the dual-depth tube system becomes particularly large, if the second tube system is placed below the level of the first one.

AB In natural and restored rivers, protruding river-bed elements can cause complex flow patterns. We hypothesize that, particularly at very low flows, solute spreading in such streams is controlled by different mechanisms than at high flows, questioning existing parameterizations. We investigate two-dimensional flow and transport in a synthetic channel with rough bathymetry under low-flow conditions with a numerical model solving the full shallow-water equations. Recirculation cells form behind protruding bed elements and trap water, macroscopically acting as transient-storage domain. We fit the one-dimensional mobile-immobile transport model to the concentration breakthrough curves of the two-dimensional model and relate the fitted parameters to easy-to-measure properties of the stream. The velocity in the mobile domain undergoes a power-law relation with the discharge and the channel slope, differing from the relationship expected for normal flow in streams with large water depths. Both the fitted dispersion coefficient and the mass-transfer coefficient between the mobile and immobile domains scale linearly with the velocity in the mobile domain. The ratio of immobile to mobile storage volumes beta first increases then decreases with increasing discharge. We suggest measuring the surface area of bed elements protruding the water surface and that of the open water. The product of the corresponding area ratio with the velocity exerts a power-law control on beta. Altogether, we can relate the coefficients of the mobile-immobile transport model to a few easy-to-measure properties of the stream. The findings of the present work contribute to the understanding of surface transient storage in natural and restored streams.

   HETEROGENEITY; BEHAVIOR; DRAINAGE; SCALE
AB We introduce a simple method to measure the relative permeability of supercritical CO2 in low-permeability rocks. The method is built on the assumption of the stability of formed CO2 percolation pathway under lowered pressure drops. Initially, a continuous CO2 flow pathway is created under a relatively high-pressure drop. Then, several subsequent steps of lowered pressure drops are performed while monitoring the associated flow rates. When the pressure drop is lower than a threshold value, the created flow pathway is assumed to be adequately stable and does not vary significantly during successive flows, with the average saturation and flow rate achieving a quasi steady state. The relative permeability of CO2 is then calculated from the relationship between the pressure drop and flow rate at several lowered pressure drops according to the extended form of Darcy's law. We demonstrate this method using both numerical modeling and an experimental test using X-ray CT imaging. The results indicate the validity of the assumption for the stability of flow pathway under lowered pressure drops. A linear relationship between the lowered pressure drops and the corresponding CO2 flow rate is found. Furthermore, the measurement results suggest that the relative permeability of CO2 can still be high in low-permeability rocks if the CO2 saturation is higher than the threshold value required to build a flow pathway. The proposed method is important for measuring the pathway-flow relative permeability of nonwetting fluids in low-permeability rocks.

AB A stochastic model is developed for the analysis of the traveltime distribution f(tau) in a hillslope. The latter is described as made up from a surficial soil underlain by a less permeable subsoil or bedrock. The heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity K is described as a stationary random space function, and the model is based on the Lagrangian representation of transport. A first-order approach in the log conductivity variance is adopted in order to get closed form solutions for the principal statistical moments of the traveltime. Our analysis indicates that the soil is mainly responsible for the early branch of f(tau), i.e., the rapid release of solute which preferentially moves through the upper soil. The early branch of f(tau) is a power law, with exponent variable between -1 and -0.5; the behavior is mainly determined by unsaturated transport. The subsoil response is slower than that of the soil. The subsoil is mainly responsible for the tail of f(tau), which in many cases resembles the classic linear reservoir model. The resulting shape for f(tau) is similar to the Gamma distribution. Analysis of the f(tau) moments indicates that the mean traveltime is weakly dependent on the hillslope size. The traveltime variance is ruled by the distribution of distances of the injected solute from the river; the effect is coined as source zone dispersion. The spreading due to the K heterogeneity is less important and obscured by source zone dispersion. The model is tested against the numerical simulation of Fiori and Russo (2008) with reasonably good agreement, with no fitting procedure.

AB In 2007, the Texas legislature created a program to identify environmental flow standards statewide through the coordinated efforts of scientific and stakeholder groups and rulemaking by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. To aid in this task, a Hydrology-based Environmental Flow Regime (HEFR) method was developed that combines a suite of user-customizable hydrologic statistics with an implementation framework. Following the concepts of the Natural Flow Paradigm, the methodology includes the separation of a long-term hydrograph into key flow components (e.g. subsistence, base, high-flow pulse and overbank) defined by the Texas Instream Flow Program. Seasonal, annual and inter-annual flow component statistics were then coupled with biology, water quality and geomorphology overlays, where available, and with implementation rules applied to example large-scale water supply projects to support development of environmental flow standards for use in water rights permit conditions. The HEFR methodology and resulting flow recommendations are compared to two contemporary in-stream flow studies and adopted environmental flow standards. Subsistence flows were fairly similar. Baseflows were in a similar range, but fewer than three seasonal levels have sometimes been specified in in-stream flow studies. Episodic events are quite different in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration and applicable number.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Editorial Material
ID WATER; HEAT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; FLUXES; GRASS; SOIL
AB The generalized complementary relationship (GCR) model of Brutsaert (2015) has been widely applied to estimate land surface evapotranspiration (E) over Chinese eastern monsoon region, Loess Plateau and Australia. However, Crago et al. (2016, hereinafter C16) recently noted a deficiency in one of his boundary conditions and proposed a novel approach to improve it. The key of this approach is to determine the ratio (x(min)) of the potential evapotranspiration (E-po) to the apparent potential evapotranspiration for an entirely dry surface (E-pads) at which E tends to be vanishing. As seen, the physically reasonable range of x(min) should be between 0 and 1. The present comment reports that the x(min) in C16 may become invalid under conditions of relatively strong available energy but weak winds if E-pads is calculated by the mass-transfer-based method, thereby causing unrealistic estimation of E. A more preferable way to determine E-pads is still based on the traditional Penman-based equation with consideration of the characteristics of dry air in which E-pads occurs.

AB We present a new approach for the analysis and modeling of catchment rainfall-runoff relationships that uses as predictor variables input history summary variables only. The latter are defined as linear combinations of inputs at a given number of previous time steps. This transforms the dynamic identification problem into a static one. As the identification algorithm we use regression trees, which act as a nonlinear nonparametric model. The original algorithm is adapted to account for serial correlation in variables. The new method is applied to two subcatchments of the U. S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Andrews Experimental Forest Watershed (Oregon, United States). Simple and interpretable tree models explain more than 80% of the initial deviance of the observations in both calibration and validation. This suggests that the selected variables have a good predictive power and that further modeling attempts using them are warranted. The models show a distinct pattern of the selected explanatory variables. Applications of the method include data quality control, comparative analysis, assessment of hydrological change, and multicriterion evaluation of parametric hydrological models.

AB The Complementary Relationship (CR) between actual and potential evaporation offers an attractive framework for estimating actual evaporation of drying land surfaces from simple meteorological measurements. Land surfaces are often heterogeneous with variable soil types, land cover, and local hydrologic conditions that give rise to spatially variable evaporation dynamics. The main aim is to incorporate effects of spatial heterogeneities on estimates of actual evaporation in the CR framework. The study extends the physically based approach of Aminzadeh et al. (2016) and proposes upscaling schemes for land-atmosphere interactions affecting reference evaporation from heterogeneous surfaces comprised of vegetation and bare soil patches. For small-scale surface heterogeneity relative to the extent of convective boundary layer (CBL), area-averaged atmospheric boundary conditions were imposed over the domain of interest to integrate contributions from patches with different dynamics. For large-scale heterogeneity (large patches relative to the scale of the mean CBL), fluxes from each patch were weighted by their respective areas. Preliminary results are in reasonable agreement with available field measurements and illustrate various effects of heterogeneous surface evaporative fluxes on the CR response. The results also highlight hidden dynamics not captured by standard CR, such as ability of vegetated patches to support steady evaporative fluxes until the onset of water stress while bare soil has already dried out. The study provides new insights into the roles of different vegetation types, land cover fraction, and atmospheric conditions on regional CR behavior hence advancing predictive capabilities of actual evapotranspiration from spatially heterogeneous land surfaces.

ID EQUATIONS
AB Mathematical relationships have been developed for reaeration rate coefficient (K-a) by various researchers. These relationships have a number of variables such as depth, velocity, width, slope, Froud number, molecular diffusion coefficient, kinematic viscosity and the gas-transfer Reynolds number. From these variables, 29 relations have been developed and divided into four groups. To evaluate their predictive capability for highly variable flow rivers receiving high pollution loads form large cities, these relationships have been used to model dissolved oxygen (DO) in the River Ravi. Such rivers are either saturated with DO during high flows or anaerobic during critical low-flow conditions. The evaluation is based on the agreement between model DO values calculated using K-a obtained from the available equations and the measured DO concentrations in the river samples in terms of sum of square of residuals (SSR) and coefficient of determination (R-2). It has been found that in general, the group of equations containing depth and velocity as the only two variables affecting K-a performed better than the equations in other groups as reflected by lower SSR and higher R-2 values. The study results also reveal that the turbulence-based reaeration rate coefficient equation containing additional variables also resulted in close agreement between DO model results and the measured values. The study results identify the most important parameters affecting the reaeration rate coefficient and the suitability of various K-a relationships as well for rivers with highly variable flows.

AB The hyporheic zone is often a critical component of river systems. Hyporheic exchange is generally forced by variation in riverbed topography such as due to bed forms. Most previous research on bed form-driven hyporheic flow has focused on two-dimensional (2-D) dunes and ripples, while little has been done on their three-dimensional (3-D) counterparts. Here we compared hyporheic exchange and associated metrics for a previously studied pair of corresponding 2-D and 3-D bed forms. To accomplish this, a series of multiphysics computational fluid dynamics models were conducted both in 2-D and 3-D with similar open channel Reynolds numbers (Re). Results show that the pressure gradient along the sediment-water interface is highly sensitive to the spatial structure of bed forms, which consequently determines hyporheic flow dynamics. Hyporheic flux is a function of Re for both 2-D and 3-D dunes via a power law; however, the equivalent 3-D dunes have a higher flux since the 3-D form induces more drag. The hyporheic zone depths and volumes are only slightly different with the 3-D case having a larger volume. The mean fluid residence times for both cases are related to Re by an inverse power law relationship, with the 3-D dune having smaller residence times at moderate to high Re. The effects of increasing flux on residence time in 3-D dunes are partly modulated by a slightly increasing hyporheic volume. Our results suggest that a 2-D idealization is a reasonable approximation for the more complex 3-D situation if local details are unimportant but that development of predictive models for mean fluxes and residence times, which are critical for biogeochemical processes, based on 2-D models may be insufficient.

AB The dynamic relationships between water flux and storage, together with the associated water ages and speed of hydrological responses (as proxies for velocity and celerity respectively) are fundamental to understanding how catchments react to hydroclimate perturbations, such as floods and droughts. Using results from a calibrated, tracer-aided ecohydrological model (EcH(2)O-iso) we analyzed the dynamics of storage-flux-age-response time (RT) interactions at scales that resolve the internal heterogeneity of these non-stationary relationships. EcH(2)O-iso has previously shown an adequate representation of ecohydrological flux partitioning and storage dynamics (celerity), and water ages (velocity) over 11-year at Demnitzer Millcreek catchment (DMC, 66 km(2)), a drought-sensitive, lowland catchment in Germany. The 11-year period had marked hydroclimatic contrasts facilitating the evaluation of flux-storage-age-RT dynamics under different wetness anomalies. Our results show that the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture and ecohydrological partitioning dynamics reflect both land use (especially forest cover) and distinct soil units (i.e., brown earth vs. podzolic soils). Spatial differences in RTs of storage were driven by rapid soil evaporation and transpiration responses to rainfall, which revealed a divergence of transpiration ages from RTs. RTs of groundwater and streamflow were fast (days), but mediation by soil water storage dynamics caused marked separation from water ages (years-decades) of deeper flow paths. Analysis of RTs and ages revealed a degradation of process representation with coarsening model spatial resolution. This study uses novel analysis of the spatio-temporal interactions of flux-storage-age-RT from a model to understand the sensitivity and resilience of catchment functionality to hydroclimatic perturbations.

AB Multidisciplinary models are useful for integrating different disciplines when addressing water planning and management problems. We combine water resources management, water quality and habitat analysis tools that were developed with the decision support system AQUATOOL at the basin scale. The water management model solves the allocation problem through network flow optimization and considers the environmental flows in some river stretches. Once volumes and flows are estimated, the water quality model is applied. Furthermore, the flows are evaluated from an ecological perspective using time series of aquatic species habitat indicators. This approach was applied in the Tormes River Water System, where agricultural demands jeopardize the environmental needs of the river ecosystem. Additionally, water quality problems in the lower part of the river result from wastewater loading and agricultural pollution. Our methodological framework can be used to define water management rules that maintain water supply, aquatic ecosystem and legal standards of water quality. The integration of ecological and water management criteria in a software platform with objective criteria and heuristic optimization procedures allows realistic assessment and application of environmental flows to be made. Here, we improve the general methodological framework by assessing the hydrological alteration of selected environmental flow regime scenarios.

AB Characterizing the response of a catchment to rainfall, in terms of the production of runoff vs the interception, transpiration and evaporation of water, is the first important step in understanding water resource availability in a catchment. This is particularly important in small semi-arid catchments, where a few intense rainfall events may generate much of the season's runoff. The ephemeral Zhulube catchment (30 km(2)) in the northern Limpopo basin was instrumented and modelled in order to elucidate the dominant hydrological processes. Discharge events were disconnected, with short recession curves, probably caused by the shallow soils in the Tshazi sub-catchment, which dry out rapidly, and the presence of a dambo in the Gobalidanke sub-catchment. Two different flow event types were observed, with the larger floods showing longer recessions being associated with higher (antecedent) precipitation. The differences could be related to: (a) intensity of rainfall, or (b) different soil conditions. Interception is an important process in the water balance of the catchment, accounting for an estimated 32% of rainfall in the 2007/08 season, but as much as 56% in the drier 2006/07 season. An extended version of the HBV model was developed (designated HBVx), introducing an interception storage and with all routines run in semi-distributed mode. After extensive manual calibration, the HBVx simulation satisfactorily showed the disconnected nature of the flows. The generally low Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients can be explained by the model failing to simulate the two different observed flow types differently. The importance of incorporating interception into rainfall-runoff is demonstrated by the substantial improvement in objective function values obtained. This exceeds the gains made by changing from lumped to semi-distributed mode, supported by 1 000 000 Monte Carlo simulations. There was also an important improvement in the daily volume error. The best simulation, supported by field observations in the Gobalidanke sub-catchment, suggested that discharge was driven mainly by flow from saturation overland flow. Hortonian overland flow, as interpreted from field observations in the Tshazi sub-catchment, was not simulated so well. A limitation of the model is its inability to address temporal variability in soil characteristics and more complex runoff generation processes. The model suggests episodic groundwater recharge with annual recharge of 100 mm year(-1), which is similar to that reported by other studies in Zimbabwe.

AB In this study, a fully-coupled surfacesubsurface, distributed, physics-based hydrological model was calibrated using the pilot-point method. A minimum variance field rule was included in the objective function to regularize the extensive calibration exercise that included 74 parameters (72 associated with pilot points and two spatially-invariant channel parameters). Because the overland and vadose zone systems are not in permanent hydrological connection, the information contained in the observation points may not be accessible by the pilot points at all times, rendering them insensitive to the observations and hindering the calibration process. An analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of parameter sensitivities was done to explore how the information contained in local observations spreads from the observation points to the pilot points, where parameter values are identified. The results show that the channel flow time series is valuable to identify the parameters at all pilot-point locations, indicating that the information in channel flow propagates to the entire basin. However, information in soil moisture measurements is of local extent and thus only valuable to identify the parameters at locations close to the observation point.

AB An HBV rainfall-runoff model was applied to test the influence of climatic characteristics on model parameter values. The methodology consisted of the calibration and cross-validation of the HBV model on a series of 5-year periods for four selected catchments (Axe, Kamp, Wieprz and Wimmera). The model parameters were optimized using the SCEM-UA method which allowed for their uncertainty also to be assessed. Nine climatic indices were selected for the analysis of their influence on model parameters, and divided into water-related and temperature-related indices. This allowed the dependence of HBV model parameters on climate characteristics to be explored following their response to climate change conditioned on the catchment's physical characteristics. The Pearson correlation coefficient and weighted Pearson correlation coefficient were used to test the dependence. Most parameters showed a statistically significant dependence on several climatic indices in all catchments. The study shows that the results of the correlation analysis with and without parametric uncertainty taken into account differ significantly.

AB In scientific vocabulary, the term process is used to denote change in time. Even a stationary process describes a system changing in time, rather than a static one that keeps a constant state all the time. However, this is often missed, which has led to misuse of the term nonstationarity as a synonym of change. A simple rule to avoid such misuse is to answer the question: can the change be predicted in deterministic terms? Only if the answer is positive is it legitimate to invoke nonstationarity. In addition, we should have in mind that models are made to simulate the future rather than to describe the past; the past is characterized by observations (data). Usually future changes are not deterministically predictable and thus the models should, on the one hand, be stationary and, on the other hand, describe in stochastic terms the full variability, originating from all agents of change. Even if the past evolution of the process of interest contains changes explainable in deterministic terms (e.g. urbanization), it is better to describe the future conditions in stationary terms, after stationarizing the past observations, i.e. adapting them to represent the future conditions.

AB A new three-scale model is proposed to describe the movement of ionic species of different valences in swelling clays characterized by three separate length scales (nano, micro, and macro) and two levels of porosity (nano-and micropores). At the finest (nano) scale the medium is treated as charged clay particles saturated by aqueous electrolyte solution containing monovalent and divalent ions forming the electrical double layer. A new constitutive law is constructed for the disjoining pressure based on the numerical resolution of non-local problem at the nanoscale which, in contrast to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory for point charge ions, is capable of capturing the short-range interactions between the ions due to their finite size. At the intermediate scale (microscale), the two-phase homogenized particle/electrolyte solution system is represented by swollen clay clusters (or aggregates) with the nanoscale disjoining pressure incorporated in a modified form of Terzaghi's effective principle. At the macroscale,the electro-chemical-mechanical couplings within clay clusters is homogenized with the ion transport in the bulk fluid lying in the micro pores. The resultant macroscopic picture is governed by a three-scale model wherein ion transport takes place in the bulk solution strongly coupled with the mechanics of the clay clusters which play the role of sources/sinks of mass to the bulk fluid associated with ion adsorption/desorption in the electrical double layer at the nanoscale. Within the context of the quasi-steady version of the multiscale model, wherein the electrolyte solution in the nanopores is assumed at instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium with the bulk fluid in the micropores, we build-up numerically the ion-adsorption isotherms along with the constitutive law of the retardation coefficients of monovalent and divalent ions. In addition, the constitutive law for the macroscopic swelling pressure is reconstructed numerically showing patterns of attractive forces between particles for bivalent ions for particular ranges of bulk concentrations. The three-scale model is applied to numerically simulate ion diffusion in a compacted clay liner underneath a sanitary landfill. Owing to the distinct constitutive behavior of the swelling pressure and partition coefficient for each ionic species, different compaction regimes and diffusion/adsorption patterns, with totally different characteristic time scales, are observed for sodium and calcium migration in the clay liner.

AB Prolonged periods of extremely high temperatures with lack of precipitation mark heatwaves that pose health risks and damage ecosystems via rapid soil water depletion and reduced evaporative cooling. Identifying the conditions for the onset of heatwaves and their effects on land-atmosphere energy and mass fluxes remains a challenge. We propose using the generalized complementary relationship (CR) to estimate actual evaporation from heterogeneous landscapes overlain by different vegetation types (i.e., grasslands and forests) and quantify responses to radiation and air temperature anomalies. A strong correlation between air temperature and sensible heat flux anomalies deduced from FLUXNET data suggests that abrupt exceedances of sensible heat flux above climatological means are indicators for the onset of heatwaves. We capitalize on the coupling between latent and sensible heat fluxes and their links to soil moisture availability within the CR framework to predict anomalous increases in regional sensible heat flux associated with soil water depletion (low precipitation) and extreme evaporative demand (hot air and high radiation). The systematic and energy-constrained framework based on the CR concept provides insights into the triggering and feedbacks associated with heatwaves and hydro-climatic extremes such as regional droughts.

AB This paper presents a model to predict optimum vegetation characteristics in water stressed conditions. Starting point is the principle of homeostasis of water flow through the soil- vegetation- atmosphere continuum. Combining this with a biochemical model for photosynthesis, a relationship between photosynthetic capacity, stomatal regulation, and hydraulic properties of the vegetation is derived. Optimum photosynthetic capacity and internal carbon dioxide concentration are calculated using the assumption that growth is maximized. This optimality hypothesis is applied for three scenarios which are increasingly realistic. Optimum parameters reflect a strategy to deal with two tradeoffs: the trade- off between fast growth and avoidance of drought and between a high photosynthetic capacity and avoidance of high respiration losses. The theory predicts general boundary conditions for growth but does not consider effects of competition between species, fires, pest, and diseases or other limitations that occur locally. In a companion paper the theory is evaluated using a data set collected in sub- Mediterranean vegetation.

AB Open water evaporation and macrophyte transpiration rates were analyzed in a semi-arid, freshwater wetland in Central Spain over two meteorological periods between 1993 and 1998. The aim was identifying the importance of these variables in the dynamics of evapotranspiration in different water level scenarios. Throughout the vegetation growth period, transpiration versus evaporation ratios were about 2 for cut-sedge, 1 for reed and 0.5 for cattail, but these values declined significantly when calculated on a yearly basis. Open water area to macrophyte cover ratios showed significant dependence on inundation. Increased vegetation cover did not result in a statistically significant reduction of evapotranspiration, but it did increase the transpiration to evaporation ratio. Increased open water area resulted in increased wetland evapotranspiration. The results indicate that Linacre's theory needs to be modified to take into account emergent macrophyte strategies to flood tolerance and plant physiological traits. The authors provide a conceptual model to explain wetland evapotranspiration dynamics in relation to vegetation cover, physiological strategies and inundation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study used streamflow recession analysis to assess changes in groundwater-streamflow relationships using streamflow data. The groundwater response to climate and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes was considered as a variable in the recession analysis. The results could thus be compared with the integrated impact to assess the consistency of these effects on the catchment discharge processes. The results showed that the recession characteristics are linked to regional topography and streamflow condition. Variation of storage-discharge sensitivities in most catchments was not linked to the variation of groundwater due to the lower capacity of groundwater contribution. The quantified impacts aided in assessing the relationship between climate, land cover, groundwater storage and discharge. This study provides a simple explanation of the effects of environmental coevolution on storage-discharge processes.

AB The relationship between stream water mean transit time (MTT), catchment geology, and landscape structure is still poorly characterized. Here, we present a new simple index that builds on the Jackson, Bitew, and Du (2014) index that focuses specifically on permeability contrasts at the soil-bedrock interface and digital elevation model-based physical flow path measurements to identify broad landscape trends of moisture redistribution in the subsurface of steep wet headwater catchments. We use this index to explore the relationship between geology, landscape structure, and water transit time through the lens of landscape anisotropy. We hypothesize that catchments with a greater tendency to shed water laterally will correlate with younger stream water MTT and catchments with a greater tendency to infiltrate water vertically will correlate with older stream water MTT. We tested the new index at eight geologically diverse Pacific Rim catchments in Oregon, Japan, and New Zealand. The new index explained 77% of the variability in measured stream water MTT across these varied sites. These findings suggest that critical zone anisotropy and catchment form are first-order controls on the time scales over which catchments store and release their water and that a simple index may usefully capture this relationship.

TI EVALUATION OF MUNICIPAL WATER-SUPPLY OPERATING RULES USING
   STOCHASTIC-DOMINANCE
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEM
AB A procedure for evaluating and selecting among alternative rules for operating a municipal water supply system is outlined in this study.  It is assumed that monthly water demands and supplies are random.  The total cost, however, is affected by both current month and future water allocation decisions with respect to the operation of facilities.  A perfect foresight model using mixed integer programming is developed and applied to 36 years of historical demand and supply data.  Using the solutions to this model, several simple operating rules are derived.  These rules are applied to the historical data to simulate system operation, and cumulative distribution of net revenue for each rule is derived.  Based on first- and second-degree stochastic dominance criteria, the performance of alternative rules are evaluated.  The procedure is also repeated with a set of generated data sequences to check the consistency of the solutions.  Average reductions of up to 11% in annual net revenues from those of a perfect foresight model are observed, for various operating rules.  Using stochastically dominant rules, annual revenues can be increased by 5% on the average from a commonly used rule based on unit cost.

AB The understanding of solute dispersion in unsaturated porous media is still nascent. This work focuses on the measurement of solute dispersion in porous media at various levels of pore-volume saturation and on the parameterization of longitudinal dispersivity in terms of the saturation ratio and a soil's textural characteristics. The dispersion coefficient was determined in partly saturated columns packed with Toyoura sand or glass beads under steady state flow. A 0.0282 N sodium chloride solution was used as a nonreactive tracer in a series of laboratory experiments in which, for a fixed water content, the average pore-water velocity was varied. The column experiments showed that the dispersion coefficient increases linearly with increasing water velocity for a fixed water content and that the slope of the dispersion coefficient versus water velocity relationship diminishes as the water content is increased. The Peclet number (Pe) was fitted to the experimental tracer data by a nonlinear function Pe = aS(r)(b), in which S-r is the saturation ratio and a and b are textured-dependent parameters. The dispersivity (alpha, in centimeters) of the test columns' porous media was then estimated in terms of the saturation ratio and the median grain size (d(50), in centimeters) by the power law alpha = d(50)/Pe = d(50)/aS(r)(b), which provides a specific functional relationship among a porous medium's dispersion properties, the saturation ratio, and the medium's textural characteristics.

AB The optimization of large-scale reservoir system is time-consuming due to its intrinsic characteristics of non-commensurable objectives and high dimensionality. One way to solve the problem is to employ an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm in the derivation of large-scale reservoir operating rules. In this study, the Weighted Multi-Objective Adaptive Surrogate Model Optimization (WMO-ASMO) algorithm is used. It consists of three steps: (1) simplifying the large-scale reservoir operating rules by the aggregation-decomposition model, (2) identifying the most sensitive parameters through multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) for dimensional reduction, and (3) reducing computational cost and speeding the searching process by WMO-ASMO, embedded with weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGAII). The intercomparison of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII), WNSGAII and WMO-ASMO are conducted in the large-scale reservoir system of Xijiang river basin in China. Results indicate that: (1) WNSGAII surpasses NSGAII in the median of annual power generation, increased by 1.03% (from 523.29 to 528.67 billion kWh), and the median of ecological index, optimized by 3.87% (from 1.879 to 1.809) with 500 simulations, because of the weighted crowding distance and (2) WMO-ASMO outperforms NSGAII and WNSGAII in terms of better solutions (annual power generation (530.032 billion kW h) and ecological index (1.675)) with 1000 simulations and computational time reduced by 25% (from 10 h to 8 h) with 500 simulations. Therefore, the proposed method is proved to be more efficient and could provide better Pareto frontier. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a fuzzy rule-based approach applied for reconstruction of missing precipitation events. The working rules are formulated from a set of past observations using an adaptive algorithm. A case study is carried out using the data from three precipitation stations in northern Italy. The study evaluates the performance of this approach compared with an artificial neural network and a traditional statistical approach. The results indicate that, within the parameter sub-space where its rules are trained, the fuzzy rule-based model provided solutions with low mean square error between observations and predictions. The problems that have yet to be addressed are overfitting and applicability outside the range of training data.

AB Gas diffusion modeling in percolation clusters provides a theoretical framework to address gas transport in porous materials and soils. Applying this methodology, above the percolation threshold the air-filled porosity dependence of the gas diffusion in porous media follows universal scaling, a power law in the air-filled porosity (less a threshold value) with an exponent of 2.0. We evaluated our hypothesis using 71 experiments (632 data points) including repacked, undisturbed, and field measurements available in the literature. For this purpose, we digitized D-p/D-0 (where D-p and D-0 are gas diffusion coefficients in porous medium and free space, respectively) and epsilon (air-filled porosity) values from graphs presented in seven published papers. We found that 66 experiments out of 71 followed universal scaling with the exponent 2, evidence that our percolation-based approach is robust. Integrating percolation and effective medium theories produced a numerical prefactor whose value depends on the air-filled porosity threshold and the air-filled porosity value above which the behavior of gas diffusion crosses over from percolation to effective medium.

AB We present a novel hydraulic tomography procedure, which is based on a travel-time based inversion and application of pilot points. The travel-time based inversion allows for the reconstruction of a diffusivity distribution, which displays the dominant structural elements of a heterogeneous aquifer. This information is used to guide pilot point based inversion of hydraulic conductivity distribution. We utilize the diffusivity distribution to optimize the spatial positions of the pilot points and the relationships among them. For the implementation of the relationships, graph theory is applied. The associated high-computational effort was encountered with subspace regularization and parallel computing. The developed inverse methodology was successfully applied to a three-dimensional sedimentary aquifer analogue. The validation shows that the sequential procedure strongly improves the misfit between predicted and true pressure response in comparison to the results, only when travel-time inversion is employed.

AB Water indicators and indices are useful tools to assess river basin performance, that is, to measure whether the basin operates satisfactorily under a wide range of possible future demands and hydrological conditions. Spanish regulations assess the performance of water demands by using reliability indicators (RIs), established by law in 2008. This article raises the possibility of updating RIs by comparing them with sustainability indicators (SIs). SIs are widely used for the assessment of river basin performance and several policy scenarios. We applied a water allocation model to the Guadiana River basin in Spain to compare indicators under three scenarios. The study was framed within the science of socio-hydrology, combining the physical environment of a water system with its influence on social aspects. SIs gave better results than RIs when comparing future scenarios. We also propose the introduction of a vulnerability indicator into Spanish regulations.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Editorial Material
ID DYNAMICAL-SYSTEM COMPONENTS; RIGOROUS FORMALISM; WATER; MODELS; FLOW
AB The concept of causal interactions between components is an integral part of hydrology and Earth system sciences. Modelers, decision makers, scientists, and other water resources stakeholders all utilize some notion of cause-and-effect to understand processes, make decisions, and infer how systems react to change. However, there are different perspectives on the meaning of causality in complex systems and, further, different frameworks and methodologies with which to detect causal interactions. We propose here that information theory (IT) provides a compelling framework for the detection of causality and discuss approaches for several levels of analyses that capture interactions that range from pairwise to multivariate in nature. We illustrate these types of analyses with an example based on weather station time series variables, in which variables may interact pairwise or jointly and on short to long time scales. In general, many unsolved or even unanticipated questions in the hydrologic sciences could benefit from this perspective.

ID INFORMATION-THEORY
AB This paper, the second in the series, uses the entropy theory to describe the spatial variability of groundwater quality data sets. The application of the entropy theory is illustrated using the chloride observations obtained from a network of groundwater quality monitoring wells in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. The application involves calculating information measures, such as transinformation, the information transfer index and the correlation coefficient. These measures are calculated using a discrete approach, in which contingency tables are used. An exponential decay fitting approach was applied to the discrete models. The analysis shows that transinformation, as a function of distance, can be represented by the exponential decay curve. It also indicates that, for the data used in this study, the transinformation model is superior to the correlation model for characterizing the spatial variability.

AB The balance equations for mass and momentum, averaged over the scale of a watershed entity, need to be supplemented with constitutive equations relating flow velocities, pressure potential differences, as well as mass and force exchanges within and across the boundaries of a watershed. In this paper, the procedure for the derivation of such constitutive relationships is described in detail. This procedure is based on the method pioneered by Coleman and Noll through exploitation of the second law of thermodynamics acting as a constraint-type relationship. The method is illustrated by its application to some common situations occurring in real world watersheds. Thermodynamically admissible and physically consistent constitutive relationships for mass exchange terms among the subregions constituting the watershed (subsurface zones, overland flow regions, channel) are proposed. These constitutive equations are subsequently combined with equations of mass balance for the subregions. In addition, constitutive relationships for forces exchanged amongst the subregions are also derived within the same thermodynamic framework. It is shown that, after linearisation of the latter constitutive relations in terms of the velocity, a watershed-scale Darcy's law governing flow in the unsaturated and saturated zones can be obtained. For the overland flow, a second order constitutive relationship with respect to velocity is proposed for the momentum exchange terms, leading to a watershed-scale Chezy formula. For the channel network REW-scale Saint-Venant equations are derived. Thus, within the framework of this approach new relationships governing exchange terms for mass and momentum are obtained and, moreover, some well-known experimental results are derived in a rigorous manner.

AB Recent studies on the relationships between catchment storage and water ages using Travel Time Distributions (TTDs), Residence Time Distributions (RTDs), and StorAge Selection (SAS) functions have led to the hypothesis that streamflow preferentially mobilizes younger water when catchment storage is high. This so-called "Inverse Storage Effect" (ISE) needs further evaluation in more catchments with diverse climates and physiographical features. In this work, we assessed the validity of the ISE in WS10 (H. J. Andrews forest, Oregon, USA), a forested headwater catchment in a Mediterranean climate. A conceptual model of the catchment, developed based on experimental observations of water flow paths in WS10, was calibrated to streamflow and delta O-18 in streamflow. Based on the calibrated model results, we determined RTDs, and streamflow TTDs and SAS functions by assuming that the soil reservoir and the groundwater reservoir act as well-mixed systems. The streamflow SAS functions and travel time dynamics showed that the ISE generally applies in WS10. Yet, during transitions from dry summer periods to wet winter periods and vice versa, the marked seasonal climate caused rapid and strong storage variations in the catchment, which led to deviations from the ISE. The seasonality of streamflow travel times in WS10 is the result of the seasonal contributions of younger water from the hillslopes added to the rather constant groundwater contributions of older water. The streamflow SAS functions were able to capture the relative importance of contrasting flow paths in the soils and in the bedrock highlighted by previous studies in WS10.

AB The complex conductivity of soils remains poorly known despite the growing importance of this method in hydrogeophysics. In order to fill this gap of knowledge, we investigate the complex conductivity of 71 soils samples (including four peat samples) and one clean sand in the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 45 kHz. The soil samples are saturated with six different NaCl brines with conductivities (0.031, 0.53, 1.15, 5.7, 14.7, and 22 S m(-1), NaCl, 25 degrees C) in order to determine their intrinsic formation factor and surface conductivity. This data set is used to test the predictions of the dynamic Stern polarization model of porous media in terms of relationship between the quadrature conductivity and the surface conductivity. We also investigate the relationship between the normalized chargeability (the difference of in-phase conductivity between two frequencies) and the quadrature conductivity at the geometric mean frequency. This data set confirms the relationships between the surface conductivity, the quadrature conductivity, and the normalized chargeability. The normalized chargeability depends linearly on the cation exchange capacity and specific surface area while the chargeability shows no dependence on these parameters. These new data and the dynamic Stern layer polarization model are observed to be mutually consistent. Traditionally, in hydrogeophysics, surface conductivity is neglected in the analysis of resistivity data. The relationships we have developed can be used in field conditions to avoid neglecting surface conductivity in the interpretation of DC resistivity tomograms. We also investigate the effects of temperature and saturation and, here again, the dynamic Stern layer predictions and the experimental observations are mutually consistent.
   Plain Language Summary Geophysical methods are increasingly popular in agriculture. Usually, DC (DIrect Current) resistivity is the preferred method but the interpretation of resistivity data suffers a major flaw: the inability to distinguish between bulk and surface conductivity. This has yield to unrealistc interpretation schemes in hydrogeophysics and an abuse of Archie's law. We propose a way to cure this flaw by extending the DC resistivity method to what is called induced polarization. This paper is the first work entirely focused on the study of induced polarization of soils including a comparison with a mechanistic model and a study of the influence of both temperature and saturation.

AB Current physically based overland flow erosion models for rangeland application do not separate disturbed and undisturbed conditions in modeling concentrated flow erosion. In this study, concentrated flow simulations on disturbed and undisturbed rangelands were used to estimate the erodibility and to evaluate the performance of linear and power law equations that describe the relationship between erosion rate and several hydraulic parameters. None of the hydraulic parameters consistently predicted the detachment capacity well for all sites, however, stream power performed better than most of other hydraulic parameters. Using power law functions did not improve the detachment relation with respect to that of the linear function. Concentrated flow erodibility increased significantly when a site was exposed to a disturbance such as fire or tree encroachment into sagebrush steppe. This study showed that burning increases erosion by amplifying the erosive power of overland flow through removing obstacles and by changing the soil properties affecting erodibility itself. However, the magnitude of fire impact varied among sites due to inherent differences in site characteristics and variability in burn severity. In most cases we observed concentrated flow erodibility had a high value at overland flow initiation and then started to decline with time due to reduction of sediment availability. Thus we developed an empirical function to predict erodibility variation within a runoff event as a function of cumulative unit discharge. Empirical equations were also developed to predict erodibility variation with time postdisturbance as a function of readily available vegetation cover and surface soil texture data.

   FRAMEWORK
AB The aim of this paper is to assess the scaling properties of heavy point rainfall with respect to duration. In the region of interest, the probability distribution tails of hourly to daily rainfall display log-log linearity. The log-log linearity of tails is a feature of fat-tailed distributions. The conservation of this property throughout the scales will be investigated in the framework of scale-invariant analysis. Evidence of the scaling of heavy rainfall is shown for one particularly long rainfall series through the conservation of the survival probability shape at durations in the range 1-24 h. An objective method is implemented to estimate the hyperbolic-tail parameters of rainfall distributions. This method is automatized and detects the lower bound above which the distributions exhibit power law tails and determines the power law exponent a using a maximum likelihood estimator. The application of unbiased estimation methods and scale-invariant properties for the estimation of the power law exponent provides a significant reduction of the intergage power law variability. This achievement is essential for a correct use of geostatistical approaches to interpolate the power law parameters at ungaged sites. The method is then applied to the rain gage network in the Cevennes-Vivarais region, a Mediterranean mountainous region located in southern France. The maps show thicker rainfall distribution tails in the flat area between the seashore and the foothill. It is shown that in a flat region closer to the Mediterranean Sea the rainfall distribution tails are hyperbolic and the power law exponent is quasi-constant with duration, whereas, over the mountain, the power law behavior is less defined. The physical reasons for such results and the consequences for the statistical modeling of heavy rainfall are then discussed, providing an innovative point of view for the comprehension of the rainfall extremes behavior at different temporal scales.

AB As an important indicator of pollutant transport and dispersion conditions in lakes, the water exchange capacity of large shallow lakes has always been a focus in research on lake hydrodynamic and water environment. Poyang Lake is a large shallow lake and also the largest freshwater lake in China, which is being given prominent environmental and ecological status. Poyang Lake's hydrological situation fluctuates dramatically and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of its water exchange capacity are complicated. In this paper, water age was selected to describe the water exchange capacity of Poyang Lake, and a water age model of Poyang Lake was established. With the water age model, the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of water age of Poyang Lake were studied and the law of response of the water age to the evolution of River-Lake relationship between Yangtze River and Poyang Lake and the proposed Poyang Lake Water Conservancy Hub was analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The water age of Poyang Lake demonstrates significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, that is, the water age in summer and autumn is obviously higher than that in winter and spring and the water age in the disc-shaped lake and lake bay area is obviously higher than that in the main river channel and beach; (2) The water stage at Hukou and catchment inflow are the main factors affecting the water age of Poyang Lake and the influence of the water stage at Hukou on the water age of Poyang Lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow, and the higher water stage at Hukou, the higher the water age of Poyang Lake, while the higher the catchment inflow, the lower the water age of Poyang Lake; (3) After 2003, the water age of Poyang Lake decreases with the evolution of River-Lake relationship and the most significant decrease happens in autumn; (4) The proposed Poyang Lake Water Conservancy Hub may increase the water age of Poyang Lake to some extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in Poyang Lake. This study can provide a scientific base for the water environment management of Poyang Lake and provide a reference for research on water exchange capacity of other large shallow lakes.

AB The 1-D and single layer combination-based energy balance Penman-Monteith (PM) model has limitations in practical application due to the lack of canopy resistance (r(c)) data for different vegetation surfaces. r(c) could be estimated by inversion of the PM model if the actual evapotranspiration (E-Ta) rate is known, but this approach has its own set of issues. Instead, an empirical method of estimating r(c) is suggested in this study. We investigated the relationships between primary micrometeorological parameters and r(c) and developed seven models to estimate r(c) for a nonstressed maize canopy on an hourly time step using a generalized-linear modeling approach. The most complex r(c) model uses net radiation (R-n), air temperature (T-a), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), relative humidity (RH), wind speed at 3 m (u(3)), aerodynamic resistance (r(a)), leaf area index (LAI), and solar zenith angle (Theta). The simplest model requires R-n, T-a, and RH. We present the practical implementation of all models via experimental validation using scaled up r(c) data obtained from the dynamic diffusion porometer-measured leaf stomatal resistance through an extensive field campaign in 2006. For further validation, we estimated E-Ta by solving the PM model using the modeled r(c) from all seven models and compared the PM E-Ta estimates with the Bowen ratio energy balance system (BREBS)-measured E-Ta for an independent data set in 2005. The relationships between hourly r(c) versus T-a, RH, VPD, R-n, incoming shortwave radiation (R-s), u(3), wind direction, LAI, Theta, and r(a) were presented and discussed. We demonstrated the negative impact of exclusion of LAI when modeling r(c), whereas exclusion of r(a) and Theta did not impact the performance of the r(c) models. Compared to the calibration results, the validation root mean square difference between observed and modeled r(c) increased by 5 s m(-1) for all r(c) models developed, ranging from 9.9 s m(-1) for the most complex model to 22.8 s m(-1) for the simplest model, as compared with the observed r(c). The validation r(2) values were close to 0.70 for all models, and the modeling efficiency ranged from 0.61 for the most complex model to -1.09 for the simplest model. There was a strong agreement between the BREBS-measured and the PM-estimated E-Ta using modeled r(c). These findings can aid in the selection of a suitable model based on the availability and quality of the input data to predict r(c) for one-step application of the PM model to estimate E-Ta for a nonstressed maize canopy.

ID GLACIAL LAKE MISSOULA
AB Observations from the jokulhlaup from Grimsvotn in Vatnajokull, southeastern Iceland, in 1996 indicate that the jokulhlaup was initiated by the movement of a localised pressure wave that travelled 50 km in 10 h from Grimsvotn to the terminus, forming a subglacial pathway along the glacier bed. Shortly after this wave reached tire terminus, the jokulhlaup was flowing at a high discharge through a tunnel that would have needed much longer time to form by ice melting as assumed in existing theories of jokulhlaups. Frozen sediments formed in crevasses and frazil ice on the surface of the flood waters indicate the flow of supercooled water in the terminus region, demonstrating that the rate of heat transfer from subglacial flood water to the overlying ice is greatly underestimated in current theories.

AB In two-phase flow through porous media, the percolating pathways can be hydrodynamically split into the flowing and stagnant regions. The highly variable velocity field in the pore space filled by the carrier fluid leads to significant differences in the transport time scales in the two regions that cannot be explained by the Fickian (Gaussian) advection-dispersion equation. In contrast with the Darcy-scale studies, up to now, relatively limited pore-scale studies have been devoted to the characterization of transport properties in two-phase flow. In this paper, we report on the results of computer simulation of advection-dispersion transport in steady state two-phase flow through porous media using a pore network model, employed as an upscaling tool. The simulation results are upscaled to directly estimate the Darcy-scale transport coefficients and properties, namely, stagnant saturation, the mass transfer coefficient between the flowing and stagnant regions, and the longitudinal dispersion in the flowing regions. The mobile-immobile model, one of the most commonly used models for simulating non-Fickian transport in porous media, is used to estimate the transport properties using the inverse modeling of effluent concentration profiles. The disagreement between the directly estimated parameters and those obtained by the mobile-immobile-based inverse modeling implies fundamental shortcomings of the latter for describing transport in two-phase flow. The simulation results indicate that the relative permeabilities may be used to obtain accurate estimates of the stagnant saturation, which link two-phase Darcy's law and transport.
   Plain Language Summary Solute transport in two-phase flow through porous media is an important topic for many industrial and natural processes such as nutrient transport in partially saturated soils in agriculture, transport of chemicals in oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery, or in soil remediation. Modeling multiphase flow and transport in different applications is essential to improve the design and operational condition. Hence, the predictive capabilities of such models need to be improved. To evaluate the assumptions embedded in one of the most commonly used theories, referred to as the mobile-immobile theory, we have performed pore-scale simulations of these physical processes. By upscaling the simulation results, we directly estimated the transport properties and compared them with the inverse modeling results using the mobile-immobile theory. There is a significant discrepancy between the directly and indirectly estimated results that imply the potential shortcomings in the mobile-immobile theory. Moreover, it has been discussed that potentially the two-phase relative permeability data can be used as a proxy to estimate the stagnant (immobile) saturation that will link two-phase Darcy theory with the transport models.

AB The long-term evaluation of regional-scale groundwater quality needs efficient upscaling methods for transient flow. Upscaling techniques, such as the Multirate Mass Transfer (MRMT) method with constant upscaling parameters, have been used for transport with steady-state flow, yet the upscaling parameters (i.e., rate coefficients) may be time dependent. This study proposed and validated an adaptive MRMT (aMMT) method by allowing the mass transfer coefficients in MRMT to change with the flow field. Advective-dispersive contaminant transport simulated in a 3-D heterogeneous medium was used as a reference solution. Equivalent transport under homogeneous flow conditions was evaluated by applying the MRMT and aMMT models for upscaling. The relationship between mass transfer coefficients and flow rates was fitted under steady-state flow driven by various hydraulic gradients. A power law relationship was obtained, which was then used to update the mass transfer coefficients in each stress period under transient flow conditions in the aMMT method. Results indicated that for advection-dominated transport, both the MRMT and aMMT methods can upscale the anomalous transport dynamics affected by subgrid heterogeneity under transient flow conditions. Whereas for diffusion-dominated systems, the MRMT model failed to capture the tails of tracer breakthrough curves after the boundary condition changed, but the results from the aMMT model were significantly improved. However, if the overall flow direction changed, both MRMT and aMMT failed to represent the breakthrough curve tail generated by the heterogeneous system. The results point toward a promising path for upscaling transport in complex aquifers with transient flow.

AB Classic extreme value theory provides asymptotic distributions of block maxima (BM) Y or peaks over threshold (POT). However, as BM and POT are relatively small subsets of the values assumed by the parent process Z, alternative approaches have been proposed to make inferences on extremes by using intermediate values and non-asymptotic models. In this study, we investigate the finite sample theory of extremes based on order statistics, and present a set of results enabling the analysis of the properties of non-asymptotic distributions of BM in finite-size blocks of data under the assumption that the parent process Z has stationary temporal dependence. In particular, we suggest the beta-binomial distribution (F-beta B) as a suitable approximation of the marginal distribution of order statistics and BM under dependence, thus generalizing the theoretical results available under independence. We demonstrate the usefulness of the F-beta B, distribution in three conceptual applications of hydrological interest. Firstly, we review the so-called Complete Time-series Analysis (CTA) framework, showing that the differences between F-Y and F-Z are due to the inherent theoretical nature of the processes Y and Z and the different probabilistic failure scenarios described by F-Y and F-Z. Secondly, we provide a theoretical rule to select the number of the largest maxima (LM) and over-threshold exceedances (OT) required to approximate the desired portion of the upper tail of F-Z with specified accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the F-beta B, distribution offers an interpretation and generalization of the so-called metastatistical extreme value (MEV) framework and its simplified version (SMEV), avoiding the use of high-dimensional joint distributions and preliminary data thresholding and declustering. All methodological results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations involving widely used stochastic processes with persistence. Real-world stream flow data are also analyzed as proof of concept.

AB Streams and rivers are important pathways for the export of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is strongly associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water, but the ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable between watersheds. In this study, the HgD:DOC ratios from 19 watersheds were evaluated with respect to Hg wet deposition and watershed soil organic carbon (SOC) content. On a subset of sites where data were available, DOC quality measured by specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm, was considered as an additional factor that may influence HgD:DOC. No significant relationship was found between Hg wet deposition and HgD:DOC, but SOC content (g m-2) was able to explain 81% of the variance in the HgD:DOC ratio (ng mg -1) following the form: HgD:DOC-17.8*S0C *41. The inclusion of DOC quality as a secondary predictor variable explained only an additional 1% of the variance. A mathematical framework to interpret the observed power -law relationship between HgD:DOC and SOC suggests Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively large carbon pools. With SOC as a primary factor controlling the association of HgD with DOC, SOC data sets may be utilized to predict stream HgD:DOC ratios on a more geographically widespread basis. In watersheds where DOC data are available, estimates of HgD may be readily obtained. Future Hg emissions policies must consider soil -mediated processes that affect the transport of Hg and DOC from terrestrial watersheds to streams for accurate predictions of water quality impacts.

AB A three-scale model for flow in karst conduit networks in fractured carbonates is rigorously constructed based on a reiterated homogenization procedure. The first upscaling, performed from the high-fidelity flow model, is based on sequential partially and fully topological model reduction procedures considering two discrete networks of solution-enlarged fractures and conduits. The subsequent macroscopization procedure projects the reduced model into the cells of a coarse computational grid, where homogenized equivalent properties are numerically constructed. Such a two-level upscaling gives rise to a macroscopic flow model characterized by mass-transfer functions between the geological structures. A notable consequence of the approach proposed herein is the appearance of a new karst index concept, whose underlying physics relies on the generalization of the traditional Peaceman's theory of well index. Such a concept rules the mass exchange between conduits and matrix and can be extended to the general scenario of coupled flow in multi-branch karst conduit systems, displaying general noncircular cross sections and surrounding damage zones. The downscaling representation for the karst index can be further explored to improve accuracy of the exchange coefficient between the geological objects. Numerical experiments are carried-out showing the magnitude of the index for certain conduit and fracture arrangements, along with illustrating the impact upon flow patterns.

AB Groundwater age and life expectancy probability density functions (pdf) have been defined, and solved in a general three-dimensional context by means of forward and backward advection-dispersion equations [Cornaton F, Perrochet P. Groundwater age, life expectancy and transit time distributions in advective-dispersive systems; 1. Generalized reservoir theory. Adv Water Res (xxxx)]. The discharge and recharge zones transit time pdfs were then derived by applying the reservoir theory (RT) to the global system, thus considering as ensemble the union of all inlet boundaries on one hand, and the union of all outlet boundaries on the other hand. The main advantages in using the RT to calculate the transit time pdf is that the outlet boundary geometry does not represent a computational limiting factor (e.g. outlets of small sizes), since the methodology is based on the integration over the entire domain of each age, or life expectancy, occurrence. In the present paper, we extend the applicability of the RT to sub-drainage basins of groundwater reservoirs by treating the reservoir flow systems as compartments which transfer the water fluxes to a particular discharge zone, and inside which mixing and dispersion processes can take place. Drainage basins are defined by the field of probability of exit at outlet. In this way, we make the RT applicable to each sub-drainage system of an aquifer of arbitrary complexity and configuration. The case of the well-head protection problem is taken as illustrative example, and sensitivity analysis of the effect of pore velocity variations on the simulated ages is carried out.

AB A geologic perspective on stochastic subsurface hydrology offers insights on representativeness of prominent field experiments and their general relevance to other hydrogeologic settings. Although the gains in understanding afforded by some 30 years of research in stochastic hydrogeology have been important and even essential, adoption of the technologies and insights by practitioners has been limited, due in part to a lack of geologic context in both the field and theoretical studies. In general, unintentional, biased sampling of hydraulic conductivity (K) using mainly hydrologic, well-based methods has resulted in the tacit assumption by many in the community that the subsurface is much less heterogeneous than in reality. Origins of the bias range from perspectives that are limited by scale and the separation of disciplines (geology, soils, aquifer hydrology, groundwater hydraulics, etc.). Consequences include a misfit between stochastic hydrogeology research results and the needs of, for example, practitioners who are dealing with local plume site cleanup that is often severely hampered by very low velocities in the very aquitard facies that are commonly overlooked or missing from low-variance stochastic models or theories. We suggest that answers to many of the problems exposed by stochastic hydrogeology research can be found through greater geologic integration into the analyses, including the recognition of not only the nearly ubiquitously high variances of K but also the strong tendency for the good connectivity of the high-K facies when spatially persistent geologic unconformities are absent. We further suggest that although such integration may appear to make the contaminant transport problem more complex, expensive and intractable, it may in fact lead to greater simplification and more reliable, less expensive site characterizations and models.

AB Predicting future surpluses or shortages of water is a long-standing problem having considerable ramifications to water management across the world. Any prediction model for a natural system such as one that estimates water surpluses or shortages requires a two-step approach. These are the following: first, identify and select meaningful predictor variables from a large number of potential predictors and second, formulate an accurate, efficient, and robust predictive model between selected predictors and the response. Recognizing that the timescales at which a response may operate is usually different from that of the predictors being identified, we introduce here a wavelet-based unique variance transformation to each of the multiple predictor variables in the system which ensures an improved regression relationship to the modeled response. All existing methods assume no change in predictors even if they characterize variability at markedly different timescales, a deficiency that is addressed using the variance-transformed predictor which can explain maximal information in an associated response. Using this unique variance transformation, additional predictor variables can be selected by assessing their ability to characterize residual information in the response that accounts for the effect of preidentified predictors. We demonstrate the utility of the wavelet-based method using synthetically generated data sets from known linear and nonlinear systems with parametric and nonparametric predictive models. Applications to a dynamic system and a real-world example to downscale a drought indicator over the Sydney region confirm its utility in an applied setting.

AB Increases in human water consumption (HWC) and consequent degradation of the ecological environment are common in arid regions. Understanding the mechanisms behind these processes is important for sustainable development. Analyses of changes in HWC between alternating wet and dry periods are carried out in four arid inland basins in Central Asia and China (Syr Darya, Tarim, Heihe and Shulehe river basins). Based on runoff records, the presence of an asymmetric HWC response is proved (p < 0.01), with an increase in HWC during wet periods and a muted decrease during subsequent dry periods. This behaviour is interpreted by invoking theories from behavioural economics at the individual and community levels. A simple model based on these theories is shown to be able to reproduce the observed dynamics and is used to discuss the importance of strengthening institutional factors for water sustainability.

AB Under the background of global warming, the acceleration of water cycle process will aggravate the risk of hydrological drought in the river basin. The Yellow River basin (YRB) is the most severely affected area by drought in China's major river basins, so it is particularly important to comprehensively evaluate the hydrological drought and explore its relationships with meteorological drought in the YRB. In this study, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) was adopted as a hydrological drought index, and the evolution characteristics of hydrological drought were comprehensively evaluated in the YRB from 1961 to 2015. The duration and severity of hydrological drought events were identified based on run theory, and the copula functions with the highest goodness of fit (GOF) were used to investigate the drought return period. Finally, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was adopted as a meteorological drought index, and the relationships between hydrological and meteorological drought were revealed by cross wavelet transform method. The results indicated that: (1) drought showed an increasing trend in the YRB from 1961 to 2015, while the worst drought occurred in 1997; (2) the trend characteristic of drought was different in each subzone; (3) the most severe drought lasted for 32 months, with drought severity of 43.29, and drought return period of 23.26 years; (4) Frank-copula was considered to be the best-fitted copula function in the YRB; and (5) the cross wavelet transform illustrated that there was a positive correlation between hydrological and meteorological drought, and the phase angle relationships indicated that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought in the YRB.

AB The near-constant Si concentration under varying discharge observed in Gordon Gulch of the Boulder Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) indicates that the silica fluxes are strongly controlled by discharge. To identify the mechanisms supplying increased Si at high discharge (Q), we examine Si-Al-Fe-Ge in soils, streams, and groundwaters. We identify bedrock weathering in groundwater and colloidal transport as the two end-members that supply Si to the system. During base flow, streamflow is derived from groundwater, and weathering of feldspar is the main source of Si with a Ge/Si ratio 0.2-0.5 mu mol/mol and low dissolved Al and Fe. The groundwater data are consistent with incongruent weathering of feldspar as the main source of dissolved Si. As discharge increases, Si-Al-Fe-bearing colloids are mobilized and the Ge/Si ratio of the stream rises to 3.0 mu mol/mol. Mineralogical analysis using XRD identified Al-Si phases including kaolinite, illite, and quartz in the colloidal size fraction (0.45 mu m). The Ge/Si ratio of stream and soil colloids is approximate to 3.8 mu mol/mol. The mechanism of colloidal transport with increasing discharge can account for the concentration-discharge (C-Q) patterns of Si, Al, and Fe with near-zero or positive power law slopes observed in the Gordon Gulch catchment. Anomalously high Ge/Si ratios also identified a third end-member resulting from coal fly ash deposition during the winter and spring. Wind trajectories during 2012, correlation between Ge/Si and mml:msubsupSO42- /mml:msubsup, and comparison to atmospheric deposition data imply contamination from nearby coal fired power plant operations.

AB Droughts have a dominant three-dimensional (3-D) spatiotemporal structure typically spanning hundreds of kilometers and often lasting for months to years. Here, we introduced a novel framework to explore the 3-D structure of the evolution of droughts based on network theory concepts. The proposed framework is applied to identify critical source regions responsible for large-scale drought onsets during 1901-2014 for the North American continent using the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI). We built a spatial network connecting the drought onset timings for the North American continent. Using a spatially weighted network partitioning algorithm, the whole continent is then classified into regional spatial drought networks (RSN), where droughts are more likely to propagate within these regional systems. Finally, a customized network metric was applied to identify locations (source regions) where the drought onsets further propagate to other areas within the regional spatial network. Our results indicated that the West coast, Texas coastal region, and Southeastern Arkansas as major source regions through which atmospheric drought propagates to Western, South Central, and Eastern North America. The formation of drought source regions are due to presence of high pressure ridges and anomalous wind patterns. Furthermore, our results indicate that the drought propagation from these source regions may be due to inadequate moisture transport. The proposed framework can help to develop an early warning detection system for droughts and other spatially extensive extreme events such as heatwaves and floods.

AB Bed form geometry and dynamics in a straight section of the Elbe River in Germany is analyzed considering the measured bed surfaces as two-dimensional random fields of bed elevations. Statistically derived roughness parameters are evaluated from high-resolution digital elevation models, which were available for a range of flow rates from low flows to floods. The key results relate to the identification of characteristic scaling regions in the bed surface spectra, and to observed relationships between water discharge and both the standard deviation and a factor of the "-3" spectral law of bed elevations. Two-dimensional second-order structure functions of bed elevations are also analyzed to gain further insight into the spatial structure of sand wave beds. In addition, the interrelations between flow rate hysteresis and the statistical structure of bed forms, as well as effects of channel modification by groynes, are highlighted and discussed. The reported results demonstrate that statistical parameters of bed forms may be used for characterization and prediction of flow-dependent sand bed roughness.

AB Entrapped air in soils beneath the water table is one of the key factors controlling the hydraulic behavior under conditions of ponded infiltration, in perched waters, and in unconfined aquifers. The term quasi-saturated soils defines the soils with entrapped air, and the term quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity defines the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and entrapped air content. This paper focuses on an investigation of how entrapped air, along with other factors, affects the three-stage temporal behavior of the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils. During the first stage the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils decreases by as much as 5-8 times, presumably because mobile entrapped air blocks the largest pores. During the second stage, as the mobile entrapped air is discharged from the core, the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils slowly increases. When the mobile air is removed, the remaining immobile entrapped air is discharged as a dissolved phase, and the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity increases rapidly by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, essentially reaching the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity. During the third stage the hydraulic conductivity is decreased to minimum values. The effects of sealing at the soil surface and microbiological activities are assumed to be major factors in the final decrease of the hydraulic conductivity. This three-stage temporal behavior of percolation in loam soils is repeatable. A new power law and an exponential relationship are proposed to describe the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity of loams as a function of the entrapped air content.

TI Streamflow Recession Analysis Using Water Height
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RATING CURVES; SCALE; PARAMETER; MODELS; FLOOD
AB Recession analysis is widely used for characterizing aquifer and basin properties based on the falling limb of the hydrograph. However, recession analysis using streamflow discharge requires a relationship (the rating curve) between simultaneous measurements of water height, h, and discharge, Q, across a wide range of flows, which is expensive to obtain, and changes in time. We leverage the relationship between h and Q (typical power law) to perform recession analysis using h directly, thus permitting identification of transient flow regimes, where only h is available. Recession analysis evaluates the rate of change in discharge, -dQ/dt, as a function of discharge, Q, in a bilogarithmic plot where the slope, b, contains information about aquifer characteristics. While values of b are not conserved when replacing Q with h, we find that the variability in values of b within and between events is captured in recession analysis for both Q and h. For example, when considering individual recessions from a large number of watersheds, a change from a smaller b at high discharge/stage to a larger b at lower discharge/stage occurs in most watersheds and suggests a transition to a more long-lasting, and less drought-sensitive, baseflow regime. With the advent of low-cost reliable pressure loggers, as well as satellites that provide global reporting of river stage, recession analysis using water height expands the number of river systems where recession analysis can be conducted and provides the potential for insights into the variability of watershed drainage characteristics without the need for a discharge record.

AB Water temperature is fundamental to understand the functioning of aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of warm water discharge from a nuclear power plant on the water surface temperature (WST) of a reservoir. Using a 6-year Landsat-derived WST dataset, which includes 3 years of the power plant being in operation (2013-2015) and 3 years in which the power plant was not functioning (2016-2018), the effect of the thermal pollution was assessed. The results show that, although the warm water discharge did not reveal a statistically significant increase on the mean WST of the reservoir (p > 0.05), multi-temporal Landsat imagery revealed that the power plant generated a local thermal impact. This was the principal heat flux following a dissipation line that was wide near the cooling channel and expanding towards the rest of the reservoir.

TI A stochastic approach to analyze trade-offs and risks associated with
   large-scale water resources systems
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID OPERATION; MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; POLICIES
AB [1] Water resources development projects often involve multiple and conflicting objectives as well as stochastic hydrologic inputs. Multiobjective optimization techniques can be used to identify noninferior solutions and to construct a trade-off relationship between conflicting objectives. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing trade-offs and risks associated with large-scale water resource projects under hydrologic uncertainty. The proposed methodology relies on the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) model to derive monthly or weekly operating rules for multipurpose multireservoir systems taking into account the stochasticity of the inflows, irrigation water withdrawals, minimum/maximum flow requirements for navigation, fishing, and/or for ecological purposes. In SDDP, release decisions are chosen so as to minimize the operating costs of a hydrothermal electrical system. Irrigation water demands and other operating constraints are imposed on the system through the SDDP model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with the Southeastern Anatolia Development project, commonly called GAP, in Turkey. The GAP is a multidimensional development project involving primarily the production of hydroelectricity and irrigation. Simulation results using 50 hydrologic scenarios show that the complete development of the irrigation projects would reduce the total energy output by 6.5% and will increase the risk of not meeting minimum outflow at the Syrian border from 5% to 25%.

AB The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 degrees C during the test period (DL: 1.78 degrees C, PB: 2.03 degrees C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.

AB The predictions of two recent and two classical mathematical models are compared with experimentally measured three-phase relative permeabilities. Experimentally determined constitutive relationships in two-phase systems were used as model input parameters to numerically predict relative permeabilities (k(r)) in three-phase systems. Then the estimated results were compared with experimental three-phase permeabilities measured along decreas-ing water saturation/decreasing oil saturation/increasing gas saturation (DDI) paths. The results of the individual models to each of the three fluids involved (water, oil, and gas) were analyzed in detail. The simulated results showed that the Total Differential (TD) compatible model overestimates significantly both the global mobilities as well as the relative phase permeabilities in the three-phase system. There was improvement in the prediction with the TD compatible model when experimental data were used to locally impose the global mobility and fractional water and gas fluxes in the ternary diagram. Globally, the best prediction of the measured k(r) values was obtained with the so-called mechanistic model. However, its numerical implementation requires a preliminary calibration of the relative phase permeabilities in a three-phase system against experimental data along one DDI path to quantify the required six characteristic coefficients. In contrast to the TD compatible model, which by construction does not exhibit any numerical instabilities, elliptic zones in the water-oil (NAPL)-gas ternary diagram were identified in the mechanistic model.

AB Rills often act as sediment sources and the dominant sediment and water transport mechanism for hillslopes. Six experiments were conducted on two soils and a uniform sand using three experimental methodologies, The results of this study challenge the assumption often used in hydrologic and erosion models that relationships derived for sheet flow or larger channel flow are applicable to actively eroding rills. Velocity did not vary with slope, and Reynolds number was not a consistent predictor of hydraulic friction. This result was due to interactions of slope gradient, flow rate, erosion, and the formation of rill roughness, bed structures, and head cuts. A relationship for rill flow velocities was proposed, Stream power was found to be a consistent and appropriate predictor for unit sediment load for the entire data set, while other hydraulic variables were not. The data for stream power and sediment load fit the form of a logistic curve (r(2)=0.93), which is promising relative to recently proposed erosion models which are based on probabilistic particle threshold theory.

ID RELIABILITY; DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION
AB Complex Network Theory (CNT) studies network models and centrality metrics to deal with reliability/vulnerability assessment in networked systems. Classic CNT analyses evaluate the impact of failure of single vertices/edge elements on system connectivity assuming that all vertices/nodes have the same relevance. In Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), the Isolation Valve System (IVS) plays a crucial role for system reliability because a pipe failure asks for valves shutdown to isolate that pipe, usually requiring the isolation of a larger network segment, having its intrinsic relevance. This circumstance makes classic connectivity analyses and metrics of CNT misleading in reliability assessment of WDN. This work proposes a novel approach to analyze IVS, which is based on the construction of the graph of segments and isolation valves generated by the IVS. The application of the recently proposed relevance-based (WDN-tailored) betweenness centrality to such graph is used to rank the importance of segments and isolation valves. Two WDNs of different sizes are used to demonstrate and discuss the strategy also from a practical perspective.

DT Editorial Material
AB Liu et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026292) provide comments on two papers introducing the rescaled Complementary Relationship (CR) of evaporation. Four concerns regarding the rescaled CR were raised and are addressed herein. Specifically, it is shown here that (1) the rescaled CR is not simply an asymmetric advection-aridity model; (2) a discontinuity in the slope of the rescaled CR at the point where evaporation is zero is not problematic because that point represents a true minimum value; (3) a particular formulation of the rescaled CR presented in an earlier paper was not recommended by the present authors, but was simply intended to illustrate that a range of boundary conditions can be accommodated; and (4) while behavior of the model advocated by Liu et al. 2020) can be modified to match the lower limit introduced by the rescaled CR, there is little theoretical justification or practical utility for doing so. Inherent in several of the concerns seems to be a misconception held by the authors of the Comment regarding the nature of the lower limit in the rescaled CR. Once this misconception is addressed, none of the concerns represent a weakness in the rescaled CR concept.

AB Water impoundment by dams strongly affects the river natural flow regime, its attributes and the related ecosystem biodiversity. Fostering the sustainability of water uses e.g., hydropower systems thus implies searching for innovative operational policies able to generate Dynamic Environmental Flows (DEF) that mimic natural flow variability. The objective of this study is to propose a Direct Policy Search (DPS) framework based on defining dynamic flow release rules to improve the global efficiency of storage systems. The water allocation policies proposed for dammed systems are an extension of previously developed flow redistribution rules for small hydropower plants by Razurel et al. (2016). The mathematical form of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution applied to lake equations for the stored water in the dam is used to formulate non-proportional redistribution rules that partition the flow for energy production and environmental use. While energy production is computed from technical data, riverine ecological benefits associated with DEF are computed by integrating the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) for fishes with Richter's hydrological indicators. Then, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to build ecological versus economic efficiency plot and locate its (Pareto) frontier. This study benchmarks two MOEAs (NSGA II and Borg MOEA) and compares their efficiency in terms of the quality of Pareto's frontier and computational cost. A detailed analysis of dam characteristics is performed to examine their impact on the global system efficiency and choice of the best redistribution rule. Finally, it is found that non-proportional flow releases can statistically improve the global efficiency, specifically the ecological one, of the hydropower system when compared to constant minimal flows.

AB Central Asia is one of the regions with the highest probability of conflicts over water. Kazakhstan is the main Central Asian economic power and therefore it is important to understand how the country's water management policy is influencing water availability in the other Central Asian states. Already, the Central Asian economies are developing under increasing water deficiency, resulting in developmental problems. The main reasons for this are increasing political tensions and worsening ecological and socio-economic conditions. Kazakhstan was the first country in Central Asia to develop the pre-requisites for a transition towards integrated water resources management (IWRM). Therefore, Kazakhstan has potential to lead the development of transboundary water integration between all Central Asian states. A scenario for successful regional cooperation on water management in Central Asia involves establishing legal mechanisms for water management following international water law, assistance by international agencies and donors, and integrated social, economic and environmental methodology.

AB The present study proposes two analytical solutions for a layered ponded ditch drainage system with Dirichlet and lagging Robin boundary conditions. The flow domain is assumed to be saturated, layered, and anisotropic. The first analytical model considers flow to a ditch drainage network from a ponded field through a two-layered soil considering the Dirichlet boundary condition, whereas the second model is developed considering a lagging Robin condition at the ditch face and surface of the soil. The study highlights that the lagging Robin condition can better mimic the actual flow scenario as compared to the standard Robin boundary condition. A comparison study has been carried out to assess the top layer's permissible depth under which a homogeneous drainage system with Robin boundary condition can approximate a layered drainage system. Further, the residence time distributions are observed to follow power-law-like distributions with heavier tails for both single and two-layered ditch drainage systems.

AB Nutrient loadings in many river catchments continue to increase due to rapid expansion of agriculture, urban and industrial development, and population growth. Nutrient enrichment of water bodies has intensified eutrophication which degrades water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, we carried out a trend analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) catchment using a novel approach to analyse nutrient time series. Seasonal analysis of trends at each of the water quality stations was performed to determine the relationships between annual flow regimes and nutrient loads in the catchment, in particular, the influence of the high spring runoff on nutrient export. Decadal analysis was also performed to determine the long-term relationships of nutrients with anthropogenic changes in the catchment. Although it was found that seasonal and historical variability of nutrient load trends is mainly determined by streamflow regime changes, there is evidence that increases in nitrogen concentration can also be attributed to anthropogenic changes.

AB This work is the eighth in a series that develops the fundamental aspects of the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) that allows for a systematic increase in the scale at which multiphase transport phenomena are modeled in porous medium systems. In these systems, the explicit locations of interfaces between phases and common curves, where three or more interfaces meet, are not considered at scales above the microscale. Rather, the densities of these quantities arise as areas per volume or length per volume. Modeling of the dynamics of these measures is an important challenge for robust models of flow and transport phenomena in porous medium systems, as the extent of these regions can have important implications for mass, momentum, and energy transport between and among phases, and formulation of a capillary pressure relation with minimal hysteresis. These densities do not exist at the microscale, where the interfaces and common curves correspond to particular locations. Therefore, it is necessary for a well-developed macroscale theory to provide evolution equations that describe the dynamics of interface and common curve densities. Here we point out the challenges and pitfalls in producing such evolution equations, develop a set of such equations based on averaging theorems, and identify the terms that require particular attention in experimental and computational efforts to parameterize the equations. We use the evolution equations developed to specify a closed two-fluid-phase flow model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most studies of land-atmosphere coupling have focused on bivariate linear statistics like correlation. However, more complex dependencies exist, including nonlinear relationships between components of land-atmosphere coupling and the transmutability of relationships between soil moisture and surface heat fluxes under different environmental conditions. In this study, a technique called multivariate mutual information, based on information theory, is proposed to quantify how surface heat fluxes depend on both surface energy and wetness conditions, that is, net radiation and soil moisture, seasonally across the globe using reanalysis data. Such interdependency is then decomposed into linear and nonlinear contributions, which are further decomposed as different components explainable as the unique contribution from individual surface conditions, redundant contributions shared by both surface conditions, and the synergistic contribution from the concurrent action of net radiation and soil moisture. In reanalysis data, the dependency linearly contributed from soil moisture bears a similar global pattern to previously identified hot spots of coupling. The linear unique contributions of net radiation and soil moisture are mainly nonoverlapping, which suggests two separate regimes are governed by either energy or water limitations. These patterns persist when the nonlinearity is superimposed, thus reinforcing the validity of the land-atmospheric coupling hot spot paradigm and the spatial division of energy-limited as well as water-limited regions. Nevertheless, strong nonlinear relationships are detected, particularly over subtropical regions. Synergistic components are found across the globe, implying widespread multidimensional physical relationships among net radiation, soil moisture, and surface heat fluxes that previously had only been inferred locally.

AB Managing water resources systems usually involves conflicts. Behaviors of stakeholders, who might be willing to contribute to improvements and reach a win-win situation, sometimes result in worse conditions for all parties. Game theory can identify and interpret the behaviors of parties to water resource problems and describe how interactions of different parties who give priority to their own objectives, rather than system's objective, result in a system's evolution. Outcomes predicted by game theory often differ from results suggested by optimization methods which assume all parties are willing to act towards the best system-wide outcome. This study reviews applicability of game theory to water resources management and conflict resolution through a series of non-cooperative water resource games. The paper illustrates the dynamic structure of water resource problems and the importance of considering the game's evolution path while studying such problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI Functional Topology of Evolving Urban Drainage Networks

ID TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; FRACTAL DIMENSION; CHANNEL NETWORKS; DESIGN;

AB We investigated the scaling and topology of engineered urban drainage networks (UDNs) in two cities, and further examined UDN evolution over decades. UDN scaling was analyzed using two power law scaling characteristics widely employed for river networks: (1) Hack's law of length (L)-area (A) [L alpha A(h)] and (2) exceedance probability distribution of upstream contributing area (delta) [P(A >= delta) similar to a delta(-epsilon)]. For the smallest UDNs (< 2 km(2)), length-area scales linearly (h similar to 1), but power law scaling (h similar to 0.6) emerges as the UDNs grow. While P(A >= delta) plots for river networks are abruptly truncated, those for UDNs display exponential tempering [P(A >= delta) = a delta(-epsilon) exp (-c delta) ]. The tempering parameter c decreases as the UDNs grow, implying that the distribution evolves in time to resemble those for river networks. However, the power law exponent E for large UDNs tends to be greater than the range reported for river networks. Differences in generative processes and engineering design constraints contribute to observed differences in the evolution of UDNs and river networks, including subnet heterogeneity and nonrandom branching.
   Plain Language Summary We show that urban drainage networks (UDNs) evolve to the state topologically similar to rivers: UDNs exhibit self-similarity as they grow beyond a small threshold size, like river networks. We present the gradual emergence of two power laws for UDNs - Hack's law and the size distribution - during decadal growth of two distinct cities. Although an initial UDN reflects the strong influence of engineering design, expanding UDN along with urban growth leads to a scale-invariant topology. The power laws emerge during growth with exponents similar to those seen for rivers. The inevitability of the self-similar topology has significant implications for managing urban drainage infrastructure in the rapidly urbanizing world, with increasing demands on reliable provision of critical services to growing populations.

AB Theoretical approaches to magnitude-frequency analysis (MFA) of sediment transport in channels couple continuous flow probability density functions (PDFs) with power law flow-sediment transport relations (rating curves) to produce closed-form equations relating MFA metrics such as the effective discharge, Q(eff), and fraction of sediment transported by discharges greater than Q(eff), f+, to statistical moments of the flow PDF and rating curve parameters. These approaches have proven useful in understanding the theoretical drivers behind the magnitude and frequency of sediment transport. However, some of their basic assumptions and findings may not apply to natural rivers and streams with more complex flow-sediment transport relationships or management and design scenarios, which have finite time horizons. We use simple numerical experiments to test the validity of theoretical MFA approaches in predicting the magnitude and frequency of sediment transport. Median values of Q(eff) and f+ generated from repeated, synthetic, finite flow series diverge from those produced with theoretical approaches using the same underlying flow PDF. The closed-form relation for f+ is a monotonically increasing function of flow variance. However, using finite flow series, we find that f+ increases with flow variance to a threshold that increases with flow record length. By introducing a sediment entrainment threshold, we present a physical mechanism for the observed diverging relationship between Q(eff) and flow variance in fine and coarse-bed channels. Our work shows that through complex and threshold-driven relationships sediment transport mode, channel morphology, flow variance, and flow record length all interact to influence estimates of what flow frequencies are most responsible for transporting sediment in alluvial channels.

AB Although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between hydrological drought (HD) and meteorological drought (MD) in different regions, few studies have examined the influence of reservoir operations during drought periods on such relationships, particularly at multiple time scales. This study presents a useful framework to examine the influences of reservoir operation rules during drought periods on the multi-scale correlations between HD and MD. Two standardized drought indices (Standardized Streamfiow Index (SSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)) with different timescales (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months) were used to compare the pre-reservoir and post-reservoir periods. Also, a simple algorithm was proposed to examine the difference value (D-value) between the inflow and outflow under different reservoir operation rules and it was used to evaluate the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought on the correlation of the HD and MD. Monthly streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 and monthly inflow and outflow records of a large reservoir (Xinfengjiang reservoir) during 1974-2009 in the basin of the Dongjiang River in south China were used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis methodology. The results indicate that (1) the reservoir operations during the post-reservoir period (1974-2015) exerted a significant influence (positive impact) on the evolution of the short-term (1 and 3 months) HD by reducing the drought duration and alleviating its magnitude and altered the linear correlation between the HD and MD compared to the pre-reservoir period (1960-1972). However, the effects on the long-term (e.g., 12 and 24 months) HD and its correlation with the MD were not apparent. (2) The impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought condition on the relationship between the HD and MD were clearly different from those under normal rules. This study provides additional information for policy-makers to regarding reservoir management during a drought.

AB Spectral multi-scaling postulates a power-law type of scaling of spectral distribution functions of stationary processes of spatial averages, over nested and geometrically similar sub-regions of the spatial parameter space of a given spatio-temporal random field. Presently a new framework is formulated for down-scaling processes of spatial averages, following naturally from the postulate of spectral multi-scaling, and key ingredients required for its implementation are described. Moreover, results from an extensive diagnostic study are presented, seeking statistical evidence supportive of spectral multi-scaling. Such evidence emerges from two sources of data. One is a 13 year long historical record of radar observations of rainfall in southeastern UK (Chenies radar), with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (5 min) resolution. The other is an ensemble of rain rate fields simulated by a spatio-temporal random pulse model fitted to the historical data. The results are consistent between historical and simulated rainfall data, indicating frequency-dependent scaling relationships interpreted as evidence of spectral multi-scaling across a range of spatial scales.

AB This study predicts future variations in simulated water balance components of Nam Co Lake under projected climate change scenarios using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model in conjunction with the degree-day melt (DDM) model coupled with the glacier volume-area scaling law. We deduced that the water balance of Nam Co Lake will increase under all selected representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, but it will become negative from 2073 onward (under RCP8.5). Compared to 1981-2010, from 2011 to 2100, the projected Nam Co Lake levels show an increase at a rate of 0.63, 0.70, and 0.41 m/a under RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively, with an area expansion of 778, 855, and 537 km(2) and a corresponding water volume increase of 155, 17, and 94 km(3), respectively; from 2011 to 2100, the lake area will expand by 38.6%, 42.4%, and 26.6% under RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
ID ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS
AB To investigate the consequences of climate change on the water budget in small catchments, it is necessary to know the change of local precipitation and temperature. General Circulation Models (GCM) cannot provide regional climate parameters yet, because of their coarse resolution and imprecise modelling of precipitation. Therefore downscaling of precipitation and temperature has to be carried out from the GCM grids to a small scale of a Few square kilometres. Daily rainfall and temperature are modelled as processes conditioned on atmospheric circulation. Rainfall is linked to the circulation patterns (CPs) using conditional probabilities and conditional rainfall amount distribution. Both temperature and precipitation are downscaled to several locations simultaneously taking into account the CP dependent spatial correlation. Temperature is modelled using a simple autoregressive approach, conditioned on atmospheric circulation and local areal precipitation. The model uses the classification scheme of the German Weather Service and a fuzzy rule-based classification. It was applied in the Aller catchment for validation using observed rainfall and temperature, and observed classified geopotential pressure heights. GCM scenarios of the ECHAM model were used to make climate change predictions (using classified GCM geopotential heights); simulated values agree fairly well with historical data. Results for different GCM scenarios are shown.

AB Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

AB [1] We present a coupling between the one-dimensional Richards equation for vertical unsaturated flow and the one-dimensional hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation (HSB) for lateral saturated flow along complex hillslopes. Here the capillary fringe is included in the flow domain as an integral part of the Boussinesq aquifer. The coupling allows quantitative investigation of the role of unsaturated storage in the relationship between rainfall and recharge. The coupled model ( HSB coupled) is compared to the original HSB model ( HSB original) and a three-dimensional Richards equation ( RE) based model ( taken to be the benchmark) on a set of seven synthetic hillslopes, ranging from convergent to divergent. Using HSB original, the water tables are overestimated and the outflow rates are generally underestimated, and there is no delay between rainfall and recharge. The coupled model, however, shows a remarkably good match with the RE model in terms of outflow rates, and the delay between rainfall and recharge is captured well. We also see a clear improvement in the match to the water tables, even though the values are still overestimated for some hillslope shapes, in particular the convergent slopes. We show that for the hillslope configurations and scenarios examined in this paper it is possible to reproduce hydrographs and water table dynamics with a good degree of accuracy using a low-dimensional hydrological model.

   VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; ALGORITHM
AB Adequate and accurate hydrologic information from optimal hydrometric networks is an essential part of effective water resources management. Although the key hydrologic processes in the water cycle are interconnected, hydrometric networks (e.g., streamflow, precipitation, groundwater level) have been routinely designed individually. A decision support framework is proposed for integrated design of multivariable hydrometric networks. The proposed method is applied to design optimal precipitation and streamflow networks simultaneously. The epsilon-dominance hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm was combined with Shannon entropy of information theory to design and evaluate hydrometric networks. Specifically, the joint entropy from the combined networks was maximized to provide the most information, and the total correlation was minimized to reduce redundant information. To further optimize the efficiency between the networks, they were designed by maximizing the conditional entropy of the streamflow network given the information of the precipitation network. Compared to the traditional individual variable design approach, the integrated multivariable design method was able to determine more efficient optimal networks by avoiding the redundant stations. Additionally, four quantization cases were compared to evaluate their effects on the entropy calculations and the determination of the optimal networks. The evaluation results indicate that the quantization methods should be selected after careful consideration for each design problem since the station rankings and the optimal networks can change accordingly.

AB The similarity of catchment responses is a fundamental issue for regionalization studies, and hydrograph attributes (i.e., Discharge Peak, Volume, and Duration) can reveal the signature and the synthesis of local scale processes. Here, we focus the attention on the "compatibility" between catchments, viz. on the possibility to transfer, from one catchment to another, the information about the dependence structures at play. In particular, we statistically investigate the possible relationships between the features of different Basin Scenarios (characterized via the Concentration Time T-c and the Curve Number CN) and the corresponding dependence structures ruling the joint statistics of Discharge, Volume, and Duration. Given a large set of synthetic runoff time series, generated via a rainfall-runoff model, recent non-parametric tests, based on empirical copulas, are used to compare the dependence structures associated with different soil uses and concentration times. The results indicate how the hydrological properties may affect the dependence structure. The outcomes of the investigation could be particularly effective in two practical applications: (1) for determining the degree of compatibility of the dependence structures associated with different basin scenarios, and (2) for enriching scanty data bases, in order to improve the estimation of multivariate copulas.

AB The temporal variation in the specific sediment yield in the Wadi Mouilah basin in northwestern Algeria was determined using data obtained between 1977 and 1995. The results show that, contrary to previous estimations, the watershed is not subject to significant degradation. This is due to its lithology and configuration. The average specific sediment yield over IS years of measurement is only 165 t km(-2) year(-1), of which, over 65% occurs in the autumn. Moreover, 97% of solid transport occurs during the brief floods whose peak discharge determines the liquid and solid contributions. Furthermore, the relationship between the flow and the specific sediment yield, at the annual level, highlights a significant departure from relationships suggested for watersheds similar to Wadi Mouilah.

AB Stochastic simulation of multivariate hydrologic variables has a key role in evaluating alternative designs and operation rules of hydrologic facilities. The recently developed decomposition analysis, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), allows us to apply the simple univariate time series model to each extracted component by: (1) decomposing multivariate time series into independent components with ICA; (2) modelling and generating each component independently; and (3) mixing the generated components to come back to observational domain. However, we illustrate in the current study that fitting a univariate time series model to each extracted component might end up with the underestimation of the serial dependence that the observation data might contain. A alternative for parameter estimation is suggested to preserve the serial dependence of the observation variable using the relationship between the observation variable and the decomposed variable. The case study of the Upper Colorado River basin shows that some improvement is made through the suggested alternative. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Changes in streamflow are an important area of ongoing research in the hydrologic sciences. To better understand spatial patterns in past changes in streamflow, we examined relationships between watershed-scale spatial characteristics and trends in streamflow. Trends in streamflow were identified by analyzing mean daily flow observations between 1940 and 2009 from 967 U.S. Geological Survey stream gages. Results indicated that streamflow across the continental U.S., as a whole, increased while becoming less extreme between 1940 and 2009. However, substantial departures from the continental U.S. (CONUS) scale pattern occurred at the regional scale, including increased annual maxima, decreased annual minima, overall drying trends, and changes in streamflow variability. A subset of watersheds belonging to a reference data set exhibited significantly smaller trend magnitudes than those observed in nonreference watersheds. Boosted regression tree models were applied to examine the influence of watershed characteristics on streamflow trend magnitudes at both the CONUS and regional scale. Geographic location was found to be of particular importance at the CONUS scale while local variability in hydroclimate and topography tended to have a strong influence on regional-scale patterns in streamflow trends. This methodology facilitates detailed, data-driven analyses of how the characteristics of individual watersheds interact with large-scale hydroclimate forces to influence how changes in streamflow manifest.

AB This study investigated the lake-aquifer hydraulic interactions in Lake Urmia (LU) as the second largest hypersaline lake in the world. Due to the scarcity of hydrogeological data required for modelling, a method based on Darcy's Law and lake water budget was used to quantify the lake-aquifer interaction. Long-term ground- and satellite-based hydrological datasets over the time frame 2001-2019 were used. Results indicate that the groundwater flux between LU and the aquifers controls 18.74 +/- 1.67% of the lake's water storage. While 10 out of 14 adjacent aquifers recharge LU at a rate of less than 180 m(3)/m.month, one phreatic aquifer recharges the LU up to 1400 m(3)/m.month. Two aquifers are recharged from the seawater of LU at a rate of 110-640 m(3)/m.month. The results of this study lead to a holistic understanding of the hydraulic interaction of LU-aquifers, which is essential for the sustainable management of both settings.

AB If management of water resources is to fully take into account the requirements of the environment, it will benefit from quantitative predictions of the ecological effects of river flow alterations. A significant relationship between flow reductions caused by groundwater abstraction and ecological conditions (as measured by relevant biotic indices) has been shown in streams in the midlands of England. In this article, we combine this relationship with hydrological indices derived from calibrated regional groundwater models to assess river reaches that are likely to be ecologically impacted by abstraction and might consequently be at risk of failing to meet EC Water Framework Directive standards. We demonstrate the application of this method within the framework of the Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) approach to making water resource decisions. We provide examples of how this approach can be used to assess the implications of different groundwater abstraction scenarios for river water bodies.

AB Changes in streamwater chemistry have frequently been used to understand the storage and release of water and solutes at the catchment scale. Streamwater chemistry typically varies in space and time, depending on sources, mobilization mechanisms, and pathways of water and solutes. However, less is known about the role of lateral hydrologic connectivity and how it may influence streamwater chemistry and solute export patterns under different wetness conditions. This study analyses long-term low-frequency data from four UK catchments using antecedent catchment wetness as proxy for lateral hydrologic connectivity. We demonstrate that solute mobilization mechanisms can vary depending on catchment wetness, as different catchment areas become hydrologically connected to or disconnected from streams. We show that flow and streamwater chemistry are mostly decoupled under dry conditions, leading to stronger impacts of the heterogeneity in solute sources on mobilization patterns during dry conditions compared to wet conditions. Our results demonstrate that the lateral and vertical distributions of solutes need to be integrated and considered together with the temporally variable hydrologic connectivity of these lateral areas to the stream when assessing streamwater chemistry. This combined analysis thus enables inferences regarding the lateral distribution of solutes throughout the catchment; it also indicates that a better understanding of the relationship between lateral hydrologic connectivity and the lateral and vertical distributions of solute concentrations can help to identify particularly vulnerable points in the catchment and their potential polluting effects on streams.

   SELECTION
AB Data collection is a critical activity in the management of water systems because it supports informed decision making. Data are collected by means of monitoring networks in which water level gauges are of particular interest because of their implications for flood management. This paper introduces a number of modifications to previously published methods that use information theory to design hydrological monitoring networks in order to make the methods applicable to the design of water level monitors for highly controlled polder systems. The new contributions include the use of a hydrodynamic model for entropy analysis, the introduction of the quantization concept to filter out noisy time series, and the use of total correlation to evaluate the performance of three different pairwise dependence criteria. The resulting approach, water level monitoring design in polders (WMP), is applied to a polder in the Pijnacker region, Netherlands. Results show that relatively few monitors are adequate to collect the information of a polder area in spite of its large number of target water levels. It is found, in addition, that the directional information transfer DITYX is more effective in finding independent monitors, whereas DITXY is better for locating sets of monitors with high joint information content. WMP proves to be a suitable and simple method as part of the design of monitoring networks for polder systems.

AB Strains of Dehalococcoides are the only microbes known that can completely dechlorinate PCE, TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride to ethylene. Either naturally occurring strains or bioaugmentation cultures of Dehalococcoides are widely used for in situ bioremediation of contaminated groundwater. Naturally occurring strains have an important role in natural attenuation of PCE, TCE, cis-DCE, and vinyl chloride in groundwater. This study evaluated the relationship between selected biogeochemical parameters and the presence of Dehalococcoides DNA in field-scale plumes. A total of 81 monitoring wells were sampled from 15 groundwater plumes at 10 locations across the United States (one sample per monitoring well). The presence of Dehalococcoides DNA was determined with an assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DNA primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Dehalococcoides. The groundwater samples were also analyzed for concentrations of O-2, NO3-1 plus NO2-1 - N, CH4, H-2, Fe (II), SO4-2, TOC, Cl-1, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds and for alkalinity, ORP, electrical conductivity, pH, and temperature. Dehalococcoides DNA was unequivocally detected in 26 wells, most of which exhibited methanogenic conditions. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare the distribution of each parameter in water where Dehalococcoides DNA was present to the distribution where Dehalococcoides DNA was absent. The only parameters for which the distributions were different at 95% confidence were NO3-1 plus NO2-1 - N, CH4, and ORP. Using these three statistically significant geochemical parameters as descriptors, a predictive model for the presence of Dehalococcoides DNA was developed using logistic regression with a binary response. Under conditions where data of direct biochemical assay are not available a calculated probability could be used to properly calibrate computer models of natural attenuation.

AB Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are a standard tool in urban water resources engineering and management. They express how return levels of extreme rainfall intensity vary with duration. The simple scaling property of extreme rainfall intensity, with respect to duration, determines the form of IDF relationships. It is supposed that the annual maximum intensity follows the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. As well known, for simple scaling processes, the location parameter and scale parameter of the GEV distribution obey a power law with the same exponent. Although, the simple scaling hypothesis is commonly used as a suitable working assumption, the multiscaling approach provides a more general framework. We present a new IDF relationship that has been formulated on the basis of the multiscaling property. It turns out that the GEV parameters (location and scale) have a different scaling exponent. Next, we apply a Bayesian framework to estimate the multiscaling GEV model and to choose the most appropriate model. It is shown that the model performance increases when using the multiscaling approach. The new model for IDF curves reproduces the data very well and has a reasonable degree of complexity without overfitting on the data.

AB What implications do societies' risk perceptions have for flood losses? This study uses a stylized, socio-hydrological model to simulate the mutual feedbacks between human societies and flood events. It integrates hydrological modelling with cultural theory and proposes four ideal types of society that reflect existing dominant risk perception and management: risk neglecting, risk monitoring, risk downplaying and risk controlling societies. We explore the consequent trajectories of flood risk generated by the interactions between floods and people for these ideal types of society over time. The results suggest that flood losses are substantially reduced when awareness-raising attitudes are promoted through inclusive, participatory approaches in the community. In contrast, societies that rely on top-down hierarchies and structural measures to protect settlements on floodplains may still suffer significant losses during extreme events. This study illustrates how predictions formed through social science theories can be applied and tested in hydrological modelling.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in governing the land surface energy budget, and measurements or estimates of LST are an integral part of many land surface models and methods to estimate land surface sensible heat (H) and latent heat fluxes. In particular, the LST anchors the potential temperature profile in Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, from which H can be derived. Brutsaert has made important contributions to our understanding the nature of surface temperature measurements as well as the practical but theoretically sound use of LST in this framework. His work has coincided with the wide-spread availability of remotely sensed LST measurements. Use of remotely sensed LST estimates inevitably involves complicating factors, such as: varying spatial and temporal scales in measurements, theory, and models; spatial variability of LST and H; the relationship between measurements of LST and the temperature felt by the atmosphere; and the need to correct satellite-based radiometric LST measurements for the radiative effects of the atmosphere. This paper reviews the progress made in research in these areas by tracing and commenting on Brutsaert's contributions.

AB Previous studies have examined in-depth the dispersion mechanisms in natural catchments. In contrast, these dispersion mechanisms have been studied little in urban catchments, where artificial transport elements and morphological arrangements are expected to modify travel times and mobilize excess rainfall from spatially distributed impervious sites. This has the ability to modify the variance of the catchment's travel times and hence the total dispersion. This work quantifies the dispersion mechanisms in an urban catchment using the theory of transport by travel times as represented by the Urban Morpho-climatic Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (U-McIUH) model. The U-McIUH computes travel times based on kinematic wave theory and accounts explicitly for the path heterogeneities and altered connectivity patterns characteristic of an urban drainage network. The analysis is illustrated using the Aubiniere urban catchment in France as a case study. We found that kinematic dispersion is dominant for small rainfall intensities, whereas geomorphologic dispersion becomes more dominant for larger intensities. The total dispersion scales with the drainage area in a power law fashion. The kinematic dispersion is dominant across spatial scales up to a threshold of approximately 2-3 km(2), after which the geomorphologic dispersion becomes more dominant. Overall, overland flow is responsible for most of the dispersion in the catchment, while conduits tend to counteract the increase of the geomorphologic dispersion with a negative kinematic dispersion. Further study with other catchments is needed to asses if the latter is a general feature of urban drainage networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate representation of the Earth's surface plays a vital role in soil erosion modelling. Topography is parameterized in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and Revised USLE (RUSLE) by the topographic (LS) factor. For slope gradients of < 20%, soil loss values are similar for both models, but when the gradient is increased, RUSLE estimates are only half of those of USLE. The study aims to assess the validity of this statement for complex hillslope profiles. To that end, both models were applied at eight diverse mountainous sub-watersheds. The USLE and RUSLE indices were estimated utilizing the SEAGIS model and a European dataset, respectively.LSfactors were in a 3:1 ratio (i.e. USLE:RUSLE) considering the entire basin area. For areas with slopes <20%, gross erosion estimates of both models converged. Sites of strong relief (>20%) USLE yielded significantly higher values than RUSLE.

AB A watershed management program is usually based on the results of watershed modeling. Accurate modeling results are decided by the appropriate parameters and input data. Rainfall is the most important input for watershed modeling. Precipitation characteristics, such as rainfall intensity and duration, usually exhibit significant spatial variation, even within small watersheds. Therefore, properly describing the spatial variation of rainfall is essential for predicting the water movement in a watershed. Varied circumstances require a variety of suitable methods for interpolating and estimating precipitation. In this study, a modified method, combining the inverse distance method and fuzzy theory, was applied to precipitation interpolation. Meanwhile, genetic algorithm (GA) was used to determine the parameters of fuzzy membership functions, which represent the relationship between the location without rainfall records and its surrounding rainfall gauges. The objective in the optimization process is to minimize the estimated error of precipitation. The results show that the estimated error is usually reduced by this method. Particularly, when there are large and irregular elevation differences between the interpolated area and its vicinal rainfall gauging stations, it is important to consider the effect of elevation differences, in addition to the effect of horizontal distances. Reliable modeling results can substantially lower the cost for the watershed management strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The complex phenomenon of water erosion in river basins is examined. The approach adopted aimed to (a) quantify erosion at several spatial scales, using the Wischmeier method, rainfall simulation over 1 and 87 m(2) plots, experimental basins, small darns and a reservoir, and (b) to seek the regression model which best explains the relationship between sediment transport and flow rates for the different forms of erosion. The marl zone, which is the main source of sediment for the reservoir and represents a fifth of the total area of the Mina basin in Algeria, was the experimental area. The results show that, considering the complexity of the factors, it is impossible to extrapolate at different scales. The power model characterizes the relationship between sediment transport and flow rates, whatever the spatial scale considered.

AB In recent years, higher-order geostatistical methods have been used for modeling of a wide variety of large-scale porous media, such as groundwater aquifers and oil reservoirs. Their popularity stems from their ability to account for qualitative data and the great flexibility that they offer for conditioning the models to hard (quantitative) data, which endow them with the capability for generating realistic realizations of porous formations with very complex channels, as well as features that are mainly a barrier to fluid flow. One group of such models consists of pattern-based methods that use a set of data points for generating stochastic realizations by which the large-scale structure and highly-connected features are reproduced accurately. The cross correlation-based simulation (CCSIM) algorithm, proposed previously by the authors, is a member of this group that has been shown to be capable of simulating multimillion cell models in a matter of a few CPU seconds. The method is, however, sensitive to pattern's specifications, such as boundaries and the number of replicates. In this paper the original CCSIM algorithm is reconsidered and two significant improvements are proposed for accurately reproducing large-scale patterns of heterogeneities in porous media. First, an effective boundary-correction method based on the graph theory is presented by which one identifies the optimal cutting path/surface for removing the patchiness and discontinuities in the realization of a porous medium. Next, a new pattern adjustment method is proposed that automatically transfers the features in a pattern to one that seamlessly matches the surrounding patterns. The original CCSIM algorithm is then combined with the two methods and is tested using various complex two- and three-dimensional examples. It should, however, be emphasized that the methods that we propose in this paper are applicable to other pattern-based geostatistical simulation methods.

AB The variation of hydrological processes has been extensively discussed worldwide, yet little is known about the relative impact of human activities, and the precipitation-water level relationship in urbanized, watery areas. Thus, the change in water level and the influential variables are analysed for 1960-2014 in the urbanized and watery Taihu Basin, China. The results indicate that the water level displays a significant increasing trend. Furthermore, low-oscillation and high-oscillation periods were found to have occurred in the 1960s-1970s and 2000s, respectively, by the quantile perturbation method. A strong relationship was shown between water level and precipitation in the 1960s-1980s, especially in the flood season. Since then, human activities, such as land-use change, river system degradation and hydrological structures, have played distinct roles and caused more than 82% of the annual and flood-seasonal water level variation. The results may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological processes and provide a good reference for flood control.

AB Advances in the traditional method of subsurface porous clay pipe irrigation rely on knowledge of the distribution of water in the soil. Knowing the relationships among the hydraulic and physical parameters in the system is important for both the design and management of the system. To simulate the infiltration from the porous clay pipe and predict the wetted zone geometry in the soil, a computer model is developed herein. Laboratory experiments were conducted on soil samples representing two different soil textures in a specially designed bin to understand the flow phenomenon and to validate the developed model. In a given soil texture, the installation depth of the pipe and the volume of water applied in the soil are the major factors affecting the wetted zone. The relationships among various parameters, namely lateral spacing, installation depth, irrigation run time, hydraulic conductivity of the body of the pipe, and hydraulic head in the system, were established using the developed model.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) from riparian vegetation can be difficult to estimate due to relatively abundant water supply, spatial vegetation heterogeneity, and interactions with anthropogenic influences such as shallower groundwater tables, increased salinity, and nonpoint source pollution induced by irrigation. In semiarid south-eastern Colorado, reliable ET estimates are scarce for the riparian corridor that borders the Arkansas River. This work investigates relationships between the riparian ecosystem along the Arkansas River and an underlying alluvial aquifer using ET estimates from remotely sensed data and modelled water table depths. Results from a calibrated, finite-difference groundwater model are used to estimate weekly water table fluctuations in the riparian ecosystem from 1999 to 2009, and estimates of ET are calculated using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model with over 200 Landsat scenes covering over 30 km(2) of riparian ecosystem along a 70-km stretch of the river. Comparison of calculated monthly SSEBop ET to estimated alfalfa reference ET from local micrometeorological station data indicated statistically significant high linear correspondence (R-2 = .87). Daily calculated SSEBop ET showed statistically significant moderate linear correspondence with data from a local weighing lysimeter (R-2 = .59). Simulated monthly SSEBop ET values were larger in drier years compared with wetter years, and ET variability was also larger in drier years. Peak ET most commonly occurred during the month of June for all 11 years of analysis. Relationships between ET and water table depth showed that peak monthly ET was highest when groundwater depths were less than about 3 m, and ET values were significantly lower for groundwater depths greater than 3 m. Negative sample Spearman correlation highlighted riparian corridor locations where ET increased as a result of decreased groundwater depths across years with different hydroclimatic conditions. This study shows how a combination of remotely sensed riparian ET estimates and a regional groundwater model can improve our understanding of linkages between riparian consumptive use and near-river groundwater conditions influenced by irrigation return flow and different climatic drivers.

AB This paper presents a hybrid approach for stormwater runoff modelling and pollutant load estimation in a hilly catchment. The stormwater runoff hydrograph was simulated by developing a conceptual hybrid model (HM) using transfer function. Model parameters were estimated by non-linear optimization. The simulated runoff hydrographs showed an excellent match with the observed data. Next, a relationship was developed between runoff and pollutant load and the developed relationship was used for estimation of pollutant load. A novelty of this hybrid approach is that it could bring out a generic HM. By using the derived model, the pollutant load was successfully predicted from simulated runoff (R-2 > 0.75) by considering rainfall as the only input. In addition, assessment, characterization and analysis of the first flush of urban runoff also form part of the study. The HM was tested and validated by applying it to 25 storm events monitored during two monsoon seasons in the Nainital Lake catchment (approx. 1900 m a.m.s.l.), India.

AB The often observed tailing of tracer breakthrough curves is caused by a multitude of mass transfer processes taking place over multiple scales. Yet, in some cases, it is convenient to fit a transport model with a single-rate mass transfer coefficient that lumps all the non-Fickian observed behavior. Since mass transfer processes take place at all characteristic times, the single-rate mass transfer coefficient derived from measurements in the laboratory or in the field vary with time omega(t). The literature review and tracer experiments compiled by Haggerty et al. (2004) from a number of sites worldwide suggest that the characteristic mass transfer time, which is proportional to omega(t)(-1), scales as a power law of the advective and experiment duration. This paper studies the mathematical equivalence between the multirate mass transfer model (MRMT) and a time-dependent single-rate mass transfer model (t-SRMT). In doing this, we provide new insights into the previously observed scale-dependence of mass transfer coefficients. The memory function, g(t), which is the most salient feature of the MRMT model, determines the influence of the past values of concentrations on its present state. We found that the t-SRMT model can also be expressed by means of a memory function phi(t, tau) In this case, though the memory function is nonstationary, meaning that in general it cannot be written as phi(t-tau). Nevertheless, the full behavior of the concentrations using a single time-dependent rate omega(t) is approximately analogous to that of the MRMT model provided that the equality omega(t)= -dIn g(t)/dt holds and the field capacity is properly chosen. This relationship suggests that when the memory function is a power law, g(t)similar to t(1-k), the equivalent mass transfer coefficient scales as omega(t)similar to t(-1), nicely fitting without calibration the estimated mass transfer coefficients compiled by Haggerty et al. (2004).

AB Single-well pressure-diffusion simulators enable improved quantitative understanding of hydraulic-testing measurements in the presence of arbitrary spatial variations of rock properties. Simulators of this type implement robust numerical algorithms which are often computationally expensive, thereby making the solution of the forward modeling problem onerous and inefficient. We introduce a time-domain perturbation theory for anisotropic permeable media to efficiently and accurately approximate the transient pressure response of spatially complex aquifers. Although theoretically valid for any spatially dependent rock/fluid property, our single-phase flow study emphasizes arbitrary spatial variations of permeability and anisotropy, which constitute key objectives of hydraulic-testing operations. Contrary to time-honored techniques, the perturbation method invokes pressure-flow deconvolution to compute the background medium's permeability sensitivity function (PSF) with a single numerical simulation run. Subsequently, the first-order term of the perturbed solution is obtained by solving an integral equation that weighs the spatial variations of permeability with the spatial-dependent and time-dependent PSF. Finally, discrete convolution transforms the constant-flow approximation to arbitrary multirate conditions. Multidimensional numerical simulation studies for a wide range of single-well field conditions indicate that perturbed solutions can be computed in less than a few CPU seconds with relative errors in pressure of <5%, corresponding to perturbations in background permeability of up to two orders of magnitude. Our work confirms that the proposed joint perturbation-convolution (JPC) method is an efficient alternative to analytical and numerical solutions for accurate modeling of pressure-diffusion phenomena induced by Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions.

AB [1] A fractal mobile/immobile model for solute transport assumes power law waiting times in the immobile zone, leading to a fractional time derivative in the model equations. The equations are equivalent to previous models of mobile/immobile transport with power law memory functions and are the limiting equations that govern continuous time random walks with heavy tailed random waiting times. The solution is gained by performing an integral transform on the solution of any boundary value problem for transport in the absence of an immobile phase. In this regard, the output from a multidimensional numerical model can be transformed to include the effect of a fractal immobile phase. The solutions capture the anomalous behavior of tracer plumes in heterogeneous aquifers, including power law breakthrough curves at late time, and power law decline in the measured mobile mass. The MADE site mobile tritium mass decline is consistent with a fractional time derivative of order gamma = 0.33, while Haggerty et al.' s [2002] stream tracer test is well modeled by a fractional time derivative of order gamma = 0.3.

AB In this study, annual and seasonal precipitation trend analysis was performed in the Euphrates-Tigris basin, Turkey, using innovative trend analysis (ITA) and discrete wavelet transformation. In this context, it was seen that there is a downward trend in winter, spring and annual precipitation, whereas precipitation has an increasing tendency in summer and autumn seasons, in the greater part of the basin. When annual and seasonal data were decomposed into wavelet components, the most significant trends were observed for high-periodic wavelet components, such as D3 (8-year), D4 (16-year) and D5 (32-year), where these components represent the periods of the precipitation data. Then, the relationship between North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and trend in precipitation was investigated. In this regard, it was found that there could be a significant relationship between the NAO and precipitation trends of the Euphrates-Tigris basin, especially in winter, based on the wavelet ITA.

AB Novel modelling was utilised in the present study to reveal significant relationships between the abundance of the Australian freshwater stream-specialist fish Galaxias olidus and metrics defining flow regimes across a region dominated by temporary streams. It was revealed that increases in total abundance were linked to metrics (both 1- and 3-year periods) that indicate greater water availability and the persistence of water in pools across the year, namely the average duration of zero-flow days over the low-flow season (negatively) and total duration of bankfull flows across the year (positively). The analysis identified 3-year metrics as being more important to the abundance of 0+ fish rather than annual ones. Taken together, these findings describing the flow requirements of a stream specialist will help to guide implementation of environmental flows, but will also highlight the need for continued exploration of flow-ecology relationships.

AB Groundwater quality problems have emerged in many geographical areas due to natural environmental processes and human intervention in the geosystems. Hydrogeochemical appraisal of fluoride contaminated groundwater in Mehsana District, Gujarat State, India is carried out by means of groundwater quality investigations together with X-ray diffraction analysis of soil samples in the delineated high fluoride areas. Results show that fluoride has negative relationships with calcium, whereas relationships with sodium, alkalinity and sulphate are positive. Results obtained from aqueous speciation modelling using PHREEQC reveal that the groundwater is undersaturated with fluorite and oversaturated with calcite. The factor analysis indicates that sodium plus potassium bicarbonate groundwater have high factor loading for fluoride, whereas that for calcium chloride and magnesium chloride groundwater is low. The plausible geochemical reactions in the study area are precipitation of calcite and dissolution of dolomite, carbon dioxide and sulphate minerals with ion exchange.

AB Am understanding of hydrology is a prerequisite for ensuring the successful management, conservation and restoration of wetland environments. Frequently, however, little is known about historical hydrological conditions, such as water levels, within wetlands. Moreover, many channel and ditch systems in wetlands arc not routinely monitored, except perhaps for research purposes. A methodology is presented herein which makes use of satellite imagery to indirectly provide remotely sensed observations of water levels within channels and ditches. Using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and simultaneous ground-based measurements of water levels, statistical relationships are established between satellite-derived effective wet ditch widths and measured water levels in the drainage system of the Elmley Marshes, southeast England. These relationships can be used subsequently to estimate historical ditch water levels and to monitor contemporary ditch water levels in the wetland. The study shows that satellite imagery has much to offer in monitoring changes in the hydrological regime of wetlands and in providing complimentary approaches to field monitoring.

However, neural networks with strong form (partial differential equations) theoretical guidance have limited performance when strong discontinuity exists in the solution spaces, such as pressure discontinuity at sources/sinks in subsurface flow problems. In this study, we take advantage of weak form formulation and domain decomposition to deal with such difficulties. We propose two strategies based on our previously developed weak form Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN-wf) to solve diffusivity equations with point sinks of either Dirichlet or Neumann type. Surrogate models are trained for well placement optimization and uncertainty analysis. Good agreement with numerical results is observed at lower computational costs, whereas strong form TgNN fails to provide satisfactory results, indicating the superiority of weak form formulation when solving discontinuous problems.

AB A simple and efficient procedure for incorporating the effects of stream channel geometry in the distributed modeling of catchment dynamics is developed. At-a-station and downstream fluvial relationships are combined and the obtained laws of variability in space and time for water-surface width and wetted perimeter are incorporated into a diffusion wave routing model based on the Muskingum-Cunge method with variable parameters. The parameterization obtained is applied to the approximately 840-km(2) Sieve catchment (Central Italian Apennines) to test the possibility bf estimating channel geometry parameters from cross-section surveys and to assess the impact of dynamic variations in the channel geometry on catchment dynamics. The use of the estimated channel geometry in surface runoff routing produces a significant improvement in the flood hydrograph description at the catchment outlet with respect to less detailed network parameterizations. In addition, the results obtained from a "downstream" analysis of the velocity fie:ld indicate that the stream characteristics related to the locally varying cross-section shape may have a strong control on flow velocities, and thus they should be monitored and synthesized for a comprehensive description of the distributed catchment dynamics.

AB This study, for the first time, assesses the impact of critical environmental factors on groundwater using Bayesian network (BN) integrated with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and develops a groundwater vulnerability map. The considered environmental factors are divided into the following categories: physical (rainfall, temperature (Tmax/Tmin), relative humidity (RHmax/RHmin)), water use and demand (surface water availability (SW) and number of tubewells (NTW)), agriculture and land use (total irrigated area (TIA), total cropped area (TCA), and total area sown (TAS)), and population. Results show a negative relationship of rainfall, RHmax/RHmin, and SW and a positive relationship of the remaining variables with groundwater. Elasticities demonstrate that a 1% change in SW (rainfall), major contributors, results in a decrease by 0.64% (0.55%) in groundwater in Bahawalpur (Multan). A 1% change in population (NTW), major consumers, results in an increase by 0.74% (0.70%) in depth to water table (DWT) across Jhang (Khanewal). The vulnerability map shows that high and very high vulnerability classes account for more than 50% of the total area of Punjab.

AB Beneficiaries of common pool resources (CPRs) may select available noncooperative and regulatory exogenous institutions for managing the resource, as well as cooperative management institutions. All these institutions may increase the long-term gains, prolong the life of the resource, and help to escape the tragedy of the commons trap. Cooperative game theory approaches can serve as the backbone of cooperative CPR management institutions. This paper formulates and applies several commonly used cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, namely, the core, Nash-Harsanyi, Shapley, and nucleolus. Through a numerical groundwater example, we show how CPR users can share the gains obtained from cooperation in a fair and efficient manner based on these cooperative solution concepts (management institutions). Although, based on their fairness rationales, various cooperative management institutions may suggest different allocations that are potentially acceptable to the users, these allocation solutions may not be stable as some users may find them unfair. This paper discusses how different methods, such as application of the plurality rule and power index, stability index, and propensity to disrupt concepts, can help identify the most stable and likely solutions for enforcing cooperation among the CPR beneficiaries. Furthermore, how the noncooperative managerial characteristics of the CPR users can affect the stability and acceptability of the different cooperative CPR management institutions is discussed, providing valuable policy insights for cooperative CPR management at community levels.

AB Understanding and modeling precipitation isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) patterns for large regions of the globe requires quantifying processes governing continental-scale climatology and hydrology. In this study, we have evaluated the extent to which inclusion of monthly moisture source temperature and moisture source locations in the Rayleigh distillation model aid in reproducing the relationships between monthly time series of precipitation isotope (delta O-18) values and temperature across the contiguous United States. The steepest isotope-temperature slopes (0.5%-0.6% delta O-18/degrees C) and greatest delta O-18 value correlations with temperature (r(2) = 0.5-0.8), derived from 5 continuous years of the data from the United States Network for Isotopes in Precipitation, occurred in the high altitudes of the Rocky Mountains and the upper Great Lakes region. The isotope-temperature slopes derived from the site-specific time series were consistently lower along the coastal regions of the United States as were the coefficients of determination. The low coastal isotope-temperature slopes are not easily explained by the simple Rayleigh model that uses condensation temperatures as the primary driver of precipitation isotopes. However, the Raleigh model equipped with moisture source temperatures defined by seasonal temperature oscillations and migrating moisture source locations provides a robust replication of the delta O-18-temperature slopes along coastal regions. These findings emphasize the importance of moisture sources conditions when interpreting palaeoclimate proxies (i.e., tree rings, ice cores, etc.), and argue that moisture source dynamics should always be included in models that use isotopes as diagnostic tools in testing hydrologic models.

AB In this article, the effects of different diverging-converging pore geometries were investigated, and the microscale fluid flow and effective hydraulic properties from these pores were compared with that of a pipe from viscous to inertial laminar flow regimes. The flow fields are obtained using computational fluid dynamics, and the comparative analysis is based on a new dimensionless hydraulic shape factor beta, which is the "specific surface" scaled by the length of pores. Results from all diverging-converging pores show an inverse pattern in velocity and vorticity distributions relative to the pipe flow. The hydraulic conductivity K of all pores is dependent on and can be predicted from beta with a power function with an exponent of 3/2. The differences in K are due to the differences in distribution of local friction drag on the pore walls. At Reynolds number (Re) similar to 0 flows, viscous eddies are found to exist almost in all pores in different sizes, but not in the pipe. Eddies grow when Re -> 1 and leads to the failure of Darcy's law. During non-Darcy or Forchheimer flows, the apparent hydraulic conductivity K-a decreases due to the growth of eddies, which constricts the bulk flow region. At Re > 1, the rate of decrease in K-a increases, and at Re >> 1, it decreases to where the change in K-a approximate to 0, and flows once again exhibits a Darcy-type relationship. The degree of nonlinearity during non-Darcy flow decreases for pores with increasing beta. The nonlinear flow behavior becomes weaker as beta increases to its maximum value in the pipe, which shows no nonlinearity in the flow; in essence, Darcy's law stays valid in the pipe at all laminar flow conditions. The diverging-converging geometry in pores plays a critical role in modifying the intrapore fluid flow, implying that this property should be incorporated in effective larger-scale models, e.g., pore-network models.

AB Sediment is a major source of non-point pollution. Suspended sediment can transport nutrients, toxicants and pesticides, and can contribute to eutrophication of rivers and lakes. Modeling suspended sediment in rivers is of particular importance in the field of environmental science and engineering. However, understanding and quantifying nonlinear interactions between river discharge and sediment dynamics has always been a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a parsimonious probabilistic model to describe the relationship between Suspended Sediment Load (SSL) and discharge volume. This model, rooted in multivariate probability theory and Bayesian Network, infers conditional marginal distribution of SSL for a given discharge level. The proposed framework relaxes the need for detailed information about the physical characteristics of the watershed, climatic forcings, and the nature of rainfall-runoff transformation, by drawing samples from the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the underlying process (here, discharge and SSL data). Discharge and SSL PDFs can be simplified into a joint distribution that describes the relationship between SSL and discharge, in which the latter acts as a proxy for different predictors of SSL. The joint distribution is created based on historical discharge and SSL data, and stores information about the discharge-SSL relationship and sediment transport process of the watershed of interest. We test this framework for seven major rivers in the U.S., results of which show promising performance to predict SSL and its likelihood given different discharge levels.

AB Power law tailing is often observed in the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of tracer tests. Tailing is attributed to heterogeneity of aquifer properties and cannot be properly modeled by means of the homogeneous advection-dispersion equation. Mass transfer models (e. g., continuous time random walk method, multirate mass transfer, or fractional-order advection-dispersion equations) using memory have been widely applied for reproducing observed tails. The relationship between memory parameters obtained from BTC fitting and the parameters characterizing the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties is still unclear. Here we investigate the conditions under which heterogeneity produces the type of tailing observed in the field and how memory functions are influenced by measurable heterogeneity parameters (e. g., variance, variogram, or integral scale of the underlying transmissivity field). We find that the slope of a BTC in a log-log plot is mainly influenced by the connectivity of the underlying permeability field but is insensitive to its variance. The slope BTC reaches asymptotically 2 as connectivity increases. We conclude that an appropriate choice of the memory function allows reproducing the spreading caused by hydraulic heterogeneity but not necessarily the rate of mixing.

AB Information on the amount of water held by woodchips in the field is needed to assess environmental risks when they are kept in stockpiles or for inferring their efficiency as denitrifying bioreactors. Reflectometry is a widely used method for estimating volumetric water content (theta) in permeable media, but material-specific calibration functions should be developed. This study aimed at developing relationships between the bulk dielectric permittivity (root epsilon(b)) and theta in woodchips considering their particle size distribution (PSD), temperature (T) and the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air (root epsilon(sa)). The root epsilon(b) of fine, medium and coarse PSDs were measured with CS616-L water content reflectometers up to theta of 0.83 cm(3)/cm(3) and at T (degrees C) of 10 degrees, 24 degrees, 37 degrees, 55 degrees and 70 degrees. Calibration equations were developed using a multivariate power law function fitted to the data with a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure. The best fit (R-2 = 0.96; RMSE = 0.04 cm(3)/cm(3)) was obtained for the fine PSD (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09); while medium (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09) and coarse (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.03) PSDs were more influenced by T and the presence of large air voids (R-2 similar to 0.92; RMSE - 0.06 cm(3)/cm(3)). A modified calibration equation independent of PSD (root epsilon(sa) = 1) reduced only slightly the goodness-of-fit (R-2 = 0.90; RMSE = 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3)). The equations developed in this study are well suited for field applications as they cover a wider range of theta than previously published functions and they are applicable within the range of T found in field applications.

AB Droughts can have serious negative impacts on the water quality needed for irrigated agriculture. The Metropolitan region of Chile is a relevant producer of high-value crops and is prone to droughts. Standardized Drought Indices were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts for the period from 1985 to 2015. To understand the relationship between droughts and water quality, we evaluated the correlations between daily discharge and surface water quality observations. The threshold level method was used to compare physicochemical parameters during hydrological drought periods with the Chilean water quality thresholds for agricultural uses. A significant (p < 0.05) negative relationship between discharge and electrical conductivity and major ions was found in most of the basin. Hydrological stations located in irrigation districts exceeded the official thresholds for these parameters during hydrological drought periods seriously threatening irrigated agriculture of the region.

AB An experiment on water discharge gauging and suspended sediment sampling performed in the Amazon River basin on 24 March 1995, during a rising-water period is described. The experiment involved different devices, including an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) for water discharge measurements. From the different samplers used, one specially built for the HiBAm project was tested successfully. An attempted use of the relationship between the ADCP signal and the total suspended sediment (TSS) was performed for sediment yield calculations. Different calculation methods were used with the TSS data obtained by the samplers and the results are discussed. The mean water discharge (Q) and TSS sediment yield (Qs) results were 172400 m(3) s(-1) and 3.15x10(6) t day(-1), respectively. A relationship between the Qs value at depth and the surface Qs value is also proposed.

ID VARIABLE WIDTH; CHANNELS; INSTABILITY; SEDIMENT; EVOLUTION; GROWTH
AB We report on a multidecadal analysis of alternate bar dynamics in a 41.7 km reach of the Alpine Rhine River, which represents an almost unique example of a regulated river with fixed levees, straight reaches, and regular bends in which alternate gravel bars spontaneously formed and migrated for more than a century. The analysis is based on freely available Landsat imagery, which provided an accurate and frequent survey of the dynamics of the alternate bar configuration since 1984. Bars were characterized in terms of wavelength, migration, and height. Longitudinal and temporal patterns are investigated as a function of flood occurrence and magnitude and in relation to the presence of local planform discontinuities (bends and ramps) that may affect their dynamics. Bars in the upper part of the reach are mostly steady and relatively long (about 13 channel widths); bars in the lower part of the reach are migrating and shorter (about 9 channel widths). Bar height is rather uniform along the reach, ranging between 3 and 4 m. The temporally long hydrological data set allowed the investigation of bar migration during flood events, showing that bars migrate faster for intermediate floods. The observed relationship between bar migration and wavelength was consistent with linear theories for free migrating and steady forced bars in straight channels. The comparison of theories with observations highlights the key role of theories to support interpretation of observations, for a better understanding of the morphodynamic processes controlling bar formation and dynamics.

ID SORPTION
AB Mass conservation in the extended coordinates of space, time, and one or more exposure-time dimensions is used as a basis for the development of equations that govern the evolution of residence-time distributions of material undergoing convective-dispersive reactive transport to particular phases or states involved in the mass transfer reactions. The validity of using a continuous motion in the new exposure-time coordinate for tracking material residence-time distributions is placed in the context of the no-recrossing rule of transition state theory and arises from the representation of the reaction as a series of Bernoulli trials. A set of constitutive laws are given for describing some of the different ways in which material residence times and thus memory may be accounted. The model approach is illustrated through generalization of the conventional two-site reactive transport model to include memory of phase association. The resulting forms of the two-site model with memory are expressed and examined in light of the no-recrossing assumption.

AB Two methods for generating streamflow forecasts in a Sahelian watershed, the Sirba basin, were compared. The direct method used a linear relationship to relate sea-surface temperature to annual streamflow, and then disaggregated on a monthly time scale. The indirect method used a linear relationship to generate annual precipitation forecasts, a temporal disaggregation to generate daily precipitation and the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to generate monthly streamflow. The accuracy of the forecasts was assessed using the coefficient of determination, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and the Hit score, and their economic value was evaluated using the cost/loss ratio method. The results revealed that the indirect method was slightly more effective than the direct method. However, the direct method achieved higher economic value in the majority of cost/loss situations, allowed for predictions with longer lead times and required less information.

AB Present infrastructure design is primarily based on rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with so-called stationary assumption. However, in recent years, the extreme precipitation events are increasing due to global climate change and creating non-stationarity in the series. Based on recent theoretical developments in the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), recent studies proposed a methodology for developing non-stationary rainfall IDF curve by incorporating trend in the parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution using Time covariate. But, the covariate Time may not be the best covariate and it is important to analyze all possible covariates and find the best covariate to model non-stationarity. In this study, five physical processes, namely, urbanization, local temperature changes, global warming, El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are used as covariates. Based on these five covariates and their possible combinations, sixty-two non-stationary GEV models are constructed. In addition, two non-stationary GEV models based on Time covariate and one stationary GEV model are also constructed. The best model for each duration rainfall series is chosen based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). From the findings of this study, it is observed that the local processes (i.e., Urbanization, local temperature changes) are the best covariate for short duration rainfall and global processes (i.e., Global warming, ENSO cycle and IOD) are the best covariate for the long duration rainfall of the Hyderabad city, India. Furthermore, the covariate Time is never qualified as the best covariate. In addition, the identified best covariates are further used to develop non-stationary rainfall IDF curves of the Hyderabad city. The proposed methodology can be applied to other situations to develop the non-stationary IDF curves based on the best covariate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological data of a drained tropical peat catchment have been analysed through conventional quantitative hydrological approaches to characterize its hydrological behaviours and changes due to continuous drainage for a long period. The results show that the hydrology of the catchment is extremely dynamic and the catchment is flashy in nature. A decreasing trend in peak flow amount and an increasing trend in baseflow amount was observed in the catchment, indicating that continuous drainage has reduced the risk of both flooding and water scarcity in the catchment. Correlation analysis among rainfall, runoff and groundwater table reveals that saturation excess-near surface flow is the dominant mechanism responsible for rapid runoff generation in the catchment. Therefore, any physical alterations or disturbances to the upper part of the peat profile would definitely affect the overall hydrological behaviour of the peat catchment.

TI Inferring subsurface heterogeneity from push-drift tracer tests
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SINGLE-WELL; BEHAVIOR; VELOCITY; AQUIFER
AB We consider the late-time tailing in a tracer test performed with a push-drift methodology (i.e., quasi-radial injection followed by drift under natural gradient). Numerical simulations of such tests are performed on 1000 multi-Gaussian 2-D log-hydraulic conductivity field realizations of varying heterogeneity, each under eight distinct mean flow directions. The ensemble pdfs of solute return times are found to exhibit power law tails for each considered variance of the log-hydraulic conductivity field, sigma(2)(inK). The tail exponent is found to relate straightforwardly to sigma(2)(inK) and, within the parameter space we explored, to be independent of push-phase pumping rate, pumping duration, and local-scale dispersivity. We conjecture that individual push-drift tracer tests in wells with screened intervals much greater than the vertical correlation length of the aquifer will exhibit quasi-ergodicity and that their tail exponent may be used to infer sigma(2)(inK). We calibrate a predictive relationship of this sort from our Monte Carlo study, and apply it to data from a push-drift test performed at a site of approximately known heterogeneity-closely matching the existing best estimate of heterogeneity.

   HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AT LOW WATER CONTENTS

AB Predicting contaminant migration within the vadose zone, for performance or risk assessment, requires estimates of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for field soils. Hydraulic conductivities, K, were experimentally determined as a function of volumetric moisture content, theta, for Hanford sediments. The steady state head control method and an ultracentrifuge method were used to measure K(theta) in the laboratory for 22 soil samples. The van Genuchten model was used to fit mathematical functions to the laboratory-measured moisture retention data. Unsaturated conductivities estimated by the van Genuchten-Mualem predictive model, using the fitted moisture retention curve and measured saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, were compared to those obtained by a scaled-predictive method that uses a single K(theta) measurement as a match point near the dry regime. In general, the measured K values and those predicted from van Genuchten-Mualem relationships showed considerable disagreement. This suggests that the use of laboratory-measured K-s results in an inadequate characterization of K(theta) for the desired range of moisture content. Deviations between the measured and predicted K were particularly severe at relatively low moisture contents; for some samples, there were differences in excess of 2 orders of magnitude at low theta. However, use of the game moisture retention curve-fitting parameters and a single steady state head control-based K(theta) measurement near the dry regime resulted in considerable improvement. In fact, for the coarse-textured soils considered in this study, results indicate that a K(theta) measurement near the dry regime must be used to obtain reliable estimates of unsaturated K at low theta. The study provided important insight on application of two different experimental techniques of measuring unsaturated conductivities.

AB The two-phase flow properties of natural rocks depend strongly on their pore structure and wettability, both of which are often heterogeneous throughout the rock. To better understand and predict these properties, image-based models are being developed. Resulting simulations are however problematic in several important classes of rocks with broad pore-size distributions. We present a new multiscale pore network model to simulate secondary waterflooding in these rocks, which may undergo wettability alteration after primary drainage. This novel approach permits to include the effect of microporosity on the imbibition sequence without the need to describe each individual micropore. Instead, we show that fluid transport through unresolved pores can be taken into account in an upscaled fashion, by the inclusion of symbolic links between macropores, resulting in strongly decreased computational demands. Rules to describe the behavior of these links in the quasistatic invasion sequence are derived from percolation theory. The model is validated by comparison to a fully detailed network representation, which takes each separate micropore into account. Strongly and weakly water-and oil-wet simulations show good results, as do mixed-wettability scenarios with different pore-scale wettability distributions. We also show simulations on a network extracted from a micro-CT scan of Estaillades limestone, which yields good agreement with water-wet and mixed-wet experimental results.

AB Power-law scaling is an ubiquitous feature of the power spectrum of streamflow on the daily to monthly timescales where the spectrum is most strongly affected by hydrologic catchment-scale processes. Numerous mechanistic explanations for the emergence of this power-law scaling have been proposed. This study employs empirical spectra obtained for eight river basins in the South Eastern US and synthetic spectra generated from a range of proposed mechanisms to explore these explanations. The empirical analysis suggested that streamflow spectra were characterized by multiple power-law scaling regimes with high-frequency exponents alpha in the range -1 to -5. In the studied basins, alpha tended to increase with drainage area. The power-law generating mechanisms analyzed included linear and non-linear catchment water balance arguments, power-law recession behavior, autonomous and non-autonomous responses of channel hydraulics and the n-fold convolution of linear reservoirs underpinning Dooge or Nash hydrographs. Of these mechanisms, only n-fold convolutions with n = 2 or 3 generated power spectra with features that were consistent with the empirical cases. If the effects of daily streamflow sampling on truncating power spectra were considered, then the trends in alpha with drainage area were also consistent with this mechanism. Generalizing the linear convolution approach to a network of reservoirs with randomly distributed parameters preserved the features of the power spectrum and maintained consistency with empirical spectra.

AB Quantifying reservoir water balance is an essential process for the efficient management of water resources. Water level records are often the only data available for reservoir analysis, which causes an ill-posed problem in water resource system planning. This study proposes an analytical framework to estimate reservoir inflow and outflow from water level observations using hydrological models and reasoning carefully derived from expert knowledge and soft data. Partial reservoir inflow hydrographs were constructed from water level observations using a continuity equation and knowledge-based constraints developed for periods of no spillway discharge. A bucket-type rainfall-runoff model was then calibrated to the partial inflow hydrographs. Finally, a complete reservoir inflow hydrograph was constructed using the calibrated models, which were then employed to estimate detailed reservoir outflow components under a full water balance relationship between inflow, outflow, water levels, and reservoir operation rules. The proposed solution for the ill-posed water balance equation outperformed conventional (benchmark) approaches in accuracy and uncertainty in its application to agricultural reservoirs. This study demonstrates how hydrological modeling and reasoning, which are discreetly designed based on expert knowledge, can help to solve the ill-posed water balance equation by creating supplementary information regarding the problem. The proposed framework is expected to assist in reconstructing reservoir routing processes using water level observations for hydrological analysis and water resource management planning.

AB Snow cover plays an important role in hydrological modelling and influences the energy balance. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products are widely used for snow cover monitoring; however, the cloud cover causes a discontinuity in spatial and temporal scale. Therefore, we have implemented a composite (five-step) methodology for cloud removal over the Karakoram and Himalayan (KH) region during 2000-2019. The cloud-gap-filled snow cover area (SCA) was compared with Landsat-8 data, and the relationship with in situ observations (snowfall and temperature) was examined. The annual SCA illustrates an increasing trend for the entire KH except in the eastern Himalayas. The snow cover day and nine snow cover timing indices were assessed to explore the snow cover characteristics. The relationships between SCA and meteorological variables were evaluated, suggesting a higher correlation with temperature and shortwave radiation. A sensitivity analysis was performed, indicating higher sensitivity of SCA to radiation than to other selected variables.

AB The advent of in situ optical sensors that can collect sub-daily measurements of nutrients and turbidity in flowing water bodies has yielded comparatively much larger water quality data sets than were previously available. With these newly available data sets, there has been increased interest in studying event-based concentration-discharge (c-Q) relationships to infer the sources and pathways of various watershed constituents during storms. With water quality data sets increasingly growing in size and scope, the need to automate the processing and analyses of such data has become apparent. However, consensus on storm event delineation methods as they pertain to c-Q analysis is currently lacking, and methodological details, including parameter values, are sometimes unreported in the literature. Here, we present an open-source workflow using the programming language R that automates the processing of sub-daily c-Q data to analyze event-based hysteresis patterns. Briefly, the workflow accepts a time series of concentration and discharge data, extracts stormflow from streamflow, delineates storm events and then evaluates c-Q relationships using widely applied metrics like the hysteresis index (HI) and the flushing index (FI). We applied the workflow to three watersheds in the mid-Atlantic United States, including a 0.4-km(2) agricultural watershed, a 150-km(2) urbanizing watershed and a 29 940-km(2) mixed land use river basin. Sub-daily sensor-based nutrient concentrations and discharge data were collected in each watershed. Using the small agricultural watershed as an example, we demonstrate the step-by-step application of the workflow. We then present results from the larger watersheds as a means for comparison and to illustrate the flexibility of the code. We believe that this rapid approach to event-based c-Q analysis will allow scientists and practitioners more time to focus on interpreting results, and promote greater scientific reproducibility. Likewise, we conclude this Scientific Briefing with suggested future improvements to the workflow to increase the automation of data analyses and reproducibility.

TI Experimental investigation of dynamic effects in capillary pressure:
   Grain size dependency and upscaling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB The macroscopic flow equations used to predict two-phase flow typically utilizes a capillary pressure-saturation relationship determined under equilibrium conditions. Theoretical reasoning, experimental evidence, and numerical modeling results have indicated that when one fluid phase replaces another fluid, this relationship may not be unique but may depend on the rate at which the phase saturations change in response to changes in phase pressures. This nonuniqueness likely depends on a variety of factors including soil-fluid properties and possibly physical scale. To quantify this dependency experimentally, direct measurements of equilibrium and dynamic capillary pressure-saturation relationships were developed for two Ottawa sands with different grain sizes using a 20 cm long column. A number of replicate air-water experiments were conducted to facilitate statistical comparison of capillary pressure-saturation relationships. Water and air pressures and phase saturations were measured at three different vertical locations in the sand column under different desaturation rates (1) to measure local capillary pressure-saturation relationships (static and dynamic); (2) to quantify the dynamic coefficient tau, a measure of the magnitude of observed dynamic effects, as a function of water saturation for different grain sizes and desaturation rates; (3) to investigate the importance of grain size on measured dynamic effects; and (4) to assess the importance of sample scale on the magnitude of dynamic effects in capillary pressure. A comparison of the static and dynamic P-c-S-w relationships showed that at a given water saturation, capillary pressure measured under transient water drainage conditions is statistically larger than capillary pressure measured under equilibrium or static conditions, consistent with thermodynamic theory. The dynamic coefficient iota, used in the expression relating the static and dynamic capillary pressures to the desaturation rate was dependant on porous media mean grain size but not on the desaturation rate. Results also suggest that the magnitude of the dynamic coefficient did not increase with the increased averaging volume considered in this study, as has been reported in the literature. This work suggests that dynamic effects in capillary pressure should be included in numerical models used to predict multiphase flow in systems when saturations change rapidly, particularly in fine-grained soil systems (e. g., CO2 sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, air sparging for remediation).

AB Understanding of the relationship between precipitation and the associated sources of moisture is essential to the improvement of our comprehension of the global water cycle. The observation of precipitation is one of the major challenges in the study of climate, as is the proper assignment of the sources of moisture that account for that precipitation. A stark contrast in the amounts of available information on precipitation may be seen in the cases of Central America and the northern part of South America. The main areas of precipitation in tropical America are described, and the moisture sources for these areas are identified by means of a Lagrangian approach presented with an example application. A strong relationship exists between the identified sources of moisture and the distribution of precipitation in the locations in question. The Caribbean Sea and the tropical Atlantic are highlighted as the main sources of moisture for the regions of highest precipitation in tropical America. Regional low-level winds play a major role in transport of moisture from the adjacent oceanic regions.

AB River deltas are densely populated regions of the world with vulnerable groundwater reserves. Contamination of these groundwater aquifers via saline water intrusion and pollutant transport is a growing threat due to both anthropogenic and climate changes. The arrangement and composition of subsurface sediment is known to have a significant impact on aquifer contamination; however, developing accurate depictions of the subsurface is challenging. In this work, we explore the relationship between surface and subsurface properties and identify the metrics most sensitive to different forcing conditions. To do so, we simulate river delta evolution with the rule-based numerical model, DeltaRCM, and test the influence of input sand fraction and steady sea level rise (SLR) on delta evolution. From the model outputs, we measure a variety of surface and subsurface metrics chosen based on their applicability to imagery and modeling results. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is then used to quantitatively gauge which metrics are most indicative of the imposed forcings. Both qualitative observations and the KL divergence analysis suggest that estimates of subsurface connectivity can be constrained using surface information. In particular, more variable shoreline roughness values and higher surface wetted fraction values correspond to increased subsurface connectivity. These findings complement traditional methods of estimating subsurface structure in river-dominated delta systems and represent a step toward the identification of a direct link between surface observations and subsurface form.

AB As climate changes, perennial headwater streams could become intermittent and intermittent rivers could dry more often due to more severe droughts. A modelling framework supported by field observations was applied to assess the probability of drying in headwaters at the regional scale (P-D) under climate change. Empirical relationships between severity of low flows and observed proportions of no-flow states have been calibrated for 22 hydro-ecoregions under present conditions. These relationships were applied using daily discharge data on a large set of gauging stations simulated by the Modele du Genie Rural a 6 parametres Journalier (GR6J) hydrological model under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results suggest a more contrasting spatial pattern in the future than under current conditions. Noteworthy changes include increases in drying extent and duration, particularly in regions with historically high probabilities of drying and changes in seasonality in Alpine regions. Aquatic ecosystems will experience unprecedented hydrological conditions, which might lead to losses of ecosystem functions.

AB Household water treatment (HWT) can tackle the issue of consuming unsafe drinking water at home. While household socio-economic characteristics are often assumed to influence the psychology of HWT use, no study has rigorously tested such an assumption. We aim to fill the gap by a cross-sectional study in a rural area in Sumba Timur, Indonesia (N= 256). Using mediation analysis, we demonstrated that psychosocial factors mediated the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and the use of household water treatment, and socio-economic characteristics strongly influenced the psychology of household water treatment usage. The use of HWT asked from different angles allowed more degrees of freedom to better assess the true status of the HWT usage, via the principal component of the answers. This paper concludes that "causal" relationship pathway from socio-economic characteristics to the use of HWT via psychosocial factors is a realistic assumption when assessing the influence of socio-economic characteristics on HWT.

AB This study focuses on the spatial variations in vegetative roughness associated with morphological channel adjustments due to the presence of check dams in Mediterranean torrential streams. Manning's n values were estimated using methods established by previous studies of submerged and non-submerged vegetation in laboratory flume experiments and field work. The results showed a linear decrease in shrub density and rate of variation of the roughness coefficient versus degree of submergence with increasing distance upstream from the check dam, while downstream, the filling of the check dam and the bed incision had the most influence. A regression analysis was applied by fitting the data to different models: relationships between Manning's n and the flow velocity were found to be of the power type for shrubs in all upstream sections, while relationships of flow velocity versus hydraulic radius in the sections closest to check dams showed a good fit to second-order polynomial equations.

AB The modelling of soil loss and investigation of urban hydrology and wet weather pollution in Malaysia requires the definition of rainfall parameters for the region. In this study, an inexpensive method was applied to establish the influence of raindrop diameter on kinetics and rain intensity in Skudai, Peninsular Malaysia, as a prelude to wider regional research. Raindrop sizes vary from less than 1.2mm to as big as 7.0mm, with median raindrop diameters of 2.51mm and a mean diameter of 2.56mm. The median raindrop diameter-intensity relationship correlates strongly using power and exponential equations, with coefficients of determination of 0.75 and 0.73, respectively. The kinetic energy-intensity relationship fits an exponential function and also a linear equation with R(2)values of0.49 and 0.34, respectively. An average rain kinetic energy of 30Jm(-2)mm(-1) was recorded. This research leads to an objective reclassification of rainfall intensities in the region.

AB Rainfall-runoff models are frequently used in flood-risk management and flood forecasting. In this study, we present a rainfall-runoff model for the prediction of hourly rates based on the technique of artificial neural networks (ANN). This model was developed and applied on the Eure basin in northwest France with the aim of overcoming the problems due to the nonlinearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship and the inaccuracy of the data collected. The development of this model required several steps in which we were able to determine the model parameters required for understanding the level of hydrological complexity and the production of information required for forecasting. The process resulted in an ANN model that could produce effective flood forecasts, in several seconds, to a forecast horizon of 48 h. These results confirm that ANN models can play an important role in forecasting, being able to model the nonlinearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship that is encountered in certain basins.

   Uniform Recharge" by Wu et al.

AB By neglecting unsaturated flow, Wu et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023070) claimed that the zero volumetric discharge at the upstream boundary results in two possible boundary conditions of either zero groundwater table or zero seepage velocity based on the original Dupuit-Boussinesq theory. They further concluded that a steeper and/or shallower aquifer has a zero-groundwater table if the downstream groundwater table is shallower. Here we point out that the conceptual model adopted by Wu et al. (2018) not reasonable and the results are quite different from those with unsaturated flow considered in the real hillslope aquifer. Specifically, the water table at the upstream boundary could be positive or negative due to the lateral unsaturated flow effect, and hence, the seepage velocity must be set to zero to satisfy the zero discharge boundary condition at the upstream boundary. In addition, the zero groundwater table cannot ensure a zero discharge at the upstream boundary. Furthermore, we argue that the discharge with respect to the groundwater table is linearly distributed along the slope distance only when both saturated and unsaturated flows are considered. The saturated flow discharge itself is not distributed linearly. Our comment highlights the importance of unsaturated flow in studying steady groundwater flow in an unconfined sloping aquifer with uniform recharge using the Dupuit-Boussinesq theory.

DE probabilistic conceptual model; stationarity hypothesis; human activity;
   runoff variations; copula function
AB A new probabilistic conceptual model, named the Assessment Model of Human Impact on Runoff Based on Stationarity Hypothesis (AMHIRBSH), was developed to attribute runoff variations to human activities through evaluating the changes in the runoff-runoff relationship (i.e. that between runoff of different watersheds). The AMHIRBSH was then applied to the Baiyangdian drainage basin, North China. After applying the Mann-Kendall test for trend and the Pettitt test for breakpoint, the runoff over the Baiyangdian drainage basin was shown to have had a breakpoint in approximately 1979, which split the time series into a baseline period (pre-1979) and an altered period (post-1979). The runoff was greatly reduced between these two periods. The runoff-runoff relationship of the Wangkuai and Xidayang sub-watersheds was evaluated using a copula function which showed it to have a non-stationarity degree of 35.64%, likely induced by massive afforestation programmes. This method provides an innovative perspective for attributing runoff variations to human activities.

AB Several models for simulation of water balance processes in semi-arid mountainous basins were developed by coupling different modules of existing water balance models (WBM). Snow accumulation and snowmelt rate relationships extracted from the McCabe-Markstrom, Guo, Rao-Al Wagdany and WASMOD-M WBMs, originally developed for basins with humid climate, were coupled with the Jazim WBM, primarily developed for arid basins. Karaj Basin, central Iran, with snowy autumn-winter and dry summer periods, was selected to assess model performance. The model parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). All coupled models performed better than the non-modified (original) WBMs in the study basin. The coupled Jazim-McCabe-Markstrom model provided the best performance in simulating low and high monthly flows. It estimated the snowmelt runoff values more accurately than other proposed coupled models because the linear relationships used in the snow module of the McCabe-Markstrom model are more compatible with snow variations in the Karaj Basin.

AB Cellular Automata (CA) are particularly suitable for physically-based modelling of complex hydrological processes due to their inherent aptitude for parallel computing. Nevertheless, other CA specific features like asynchronism could be exploited to enhance further the computational efficiency. This note introduces an innovative activation/deactivation rule enabling for the first time the practical application of asynchronous CA to subsurface flow problems. The asynchronism rule, consisting of a threshold depending on the spatial total hydraulic head difference between each automaton and its neighbourhood, was implemented in the new OpenCAL parallel software library using the Extended CA (XCA) paradigm. It was tested performing hundreds of wet front propagation simulations in a comprehensive probabilistic framework, considering several thresholds and addressing both two and three-dimensional domains with heterogeneous hydraulic properties. Furthermore, realistic simulations of a drip-irrigated field entailing combined infiltration/exfiltration cycles were carried out. The application of the asynchronism rule generated considerable computational benefits for all the test cases, even adopting low threshold values, reducing the elapsed time by up to 80-85% while preserving numerical accuracy. In particular, the three-dimensional simulation of the drip-irrigated field demonstrated the practical relevance of the approach. The computational improvement produced by the combined effect of parallel computing and the proposed asynchronism strategy enables increased space-time resolution on wider study areas and further developments focusing on the simulation of computationally demanding relevant processes.

AB A parametric rule for multireservoir system operation is formulated and tested. It is a generalization of the well-known space rule of simultaneously accounting for various system operating goals, in addition to the standard goal of avoiding unnecessary spills, including avoiding leakage losses, avoiding conveyance problems, taking into account the impacts of the reservoir system topology, and assuring satisfaction of secondary uses. Theoretical values of the rule's parameters for each one of these isolated goals are derived. In practice, parameters are evaluated to optimize one or more objective functions selected by the user. The rule is embedded in a simulation model so that optimization requires repeated simulations of the system operation with specific values of the parameters each time. The rule is tested on the case of the multireservoir water supply system of the city of Athens, Greece, which is driven by all of the operating goals listed above. Two problems at the system design level are tackled. First, the total release from the system is maximized for a selected level of failure probability. Second, the annual operating cost is minimized for given levels of water demand and failure probability. A detailed simulation model is used in the case study. Sensitivity analysis of the rule's parameters revealed a subset of insensitive parameters that allowed for rule simplification. Finally, the rule is validated through comparison with a number of heuristic rules also applied to the test case.

AB This work is the ninth in a series of papers on the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) approach for modeling flow and transport phenomena in multiscale porous medium systems. A fundamental approach is developed to model the transition region between a two-fluid-phase porous medium system and a single-fluid-phase system, including species transport. A general model formulation is developed along with an entropy inequality to guide the specification of closure relations. The general model formulation and entropy inequality are then used to specify a closed system. The transition region model developed in this work is a generalization and extension of coupling conditions commonly used in sharp interface models. The theoretical framework has multiple areas of potential applicability including terrestrial-atmospheric contact zones, surface water-sediment interface zones, and industrial drying processes.

AB This paper reconciles the state-of-the-art observations and simulations of evapotranspiration (ET) temporal variability through a diagnostic framework composed of an observation-model-theory triplet. Specifically, a confirmed theoretical tool, Evapotranspiration Temporal VARiance Decomposition (EVARD), is used as a benchmark to estimate ET monthly variance (sigma ET2) across the contiguous United States (CONUS) with inputs including hydroclimatic observations, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-based terrestrial water storage, four observation-based products (ET(RSUW)by the University of Washington, ET(RSMOD16)from MOD16 Global Terrestrial ET Data Set, ET(FLUXNET)upscaled from of fluxtower observations, and ET(GLEAM)from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model), and four operational land surface models (LSMs: MOSAIC, NOAH, NOAH-MP, and VIC). Five experiments are systematically designed to evaluate and diagnose possible errors and uncertainties in ET temporal variance estimated by the four observation-based ET products and the four LSM simulations. Based on the results of these experiments, the following diagnostic hypotheses regarding the uncertainty of the observation-based ET products are illustrated: ET(RSUW)captures the high sigma ET2 signals in the Midwest with negligible bias and moderate uncertainty over the contiguous United States; ET(FLUXNET)systematically underestimates sigma ET2 over CONUS but with the lowest level of uncertainty; ET(RSMOD16)has medium bias with the highest level of uncertainty, and the spatial distribution of high sigma ET2 signal from ET(RSMOD16)is different from other estimates;ET(GLEAM)has slight negative bias and medium uncertainty, and sigma ET2 in the West Coast is smaller than that from ETVARD. Regarding the LSMs, it is found that any of the four LSMs can be the best depending on a certain set of reference observations. The study reveals that LSMs have shown a reasonably worthy, though not perfect, capability in estimating ET and its variability in regions/aquifers with limited human interference. However, RS-based observations and theoretical estimates suggest that all the four LSMs examined in this study are not able to accurately predict the ET variability in regions/aquifers heavily influenced by human activities like Central Valley and High Plains aquifers; they all underestimate ET variability along the West Coast due to seasonal vegetation responses to Mediterranean climate and human water use. In addition, LSMs underestimate intraannual ET variance in California and the High Plains with underestimated terrestrial storage change components in ET variance, due to the inappropriate representation of groundwater pumping and its impact on ET and other hydrologic processes. This paper urges advancing hydrologic knowledge by finding congruence among models, data, and theories.

AB The empirical proportionality relationship, which indicates that the ratio of cumulative surface runoff and infiltration to their corresponding potentials are equal, is the basis of the extensively used Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. The objective of this paper is to provide the physical basis of the SCS-CN method and its proportionality hypothesis from the infiltration excess runoff generation perspective. To achieve this purpose, an analytical solution of Richards' equation is derived for ponded infiltration in shallow water table environment under the following boundary conditions: (1) the soil is saturated at the land surface; and (2) there is a no-flux boundary which moves downward. The solution is established based on the assumptions of negligible gravitational effect, constant soil water diffusivity, and hydrostatic soil moisture profile between the no-flux boundary and water table. Based on the derived analytical solution, the proportionality hypothesis is a reasonable approximation for rainfall partitioning at the early stage of ponded infiltration in areas with a shallow water table for coarse textured soils.

TI Impact of an unstressed canopy conductance on the Bouchet-Morton
   complementary relationship

   VEGETATION; CLIMATE; WATER
AB [1] Indirect methods of quantifying evapotranspiration (lambda E-a) are sought since regional estimations of lambda E-a require prohibitive instrumentation or highly parameterized and data-intensive land surface models ( e. g., involving temporally and spatially varying soil moisture, soil hydraulic properties, and vegetation properties). Complementary relationship (CR) models, based on Bouchet's hypothesis, are one such method of estimating lambda E-a from routinely measured meteorological variables. Bouchet's CR states that given a change in regional surface moisture availability (M-A), changes in lambda E-a are reflected in changes in potential evapotranspiration (lambda E-p), such that lambda E-a + lambda E-p = 2 lambda E-0, where lambda E-0 is an assumed equilibrium condition at which lambda E-a = lambda E-p = lambda E-0 given sufficiently large M-A. Whereas lambda E-p conceptually includes a transpiration component, the treatment of vegetation in existing CR applications varies from neglecting it to indirectly accounting for it through recalibration of Penman's empirical wind function. We utilize the First International Land Surface Climatology Field Experiment ( FIFE) data set to demonstrate that inclusion of a maximum (i.e., unstressed) canopy conductance (g(c,max)) in a Penman equation with stability-corrected atmospheric conductance (i.e., replacing the Penman equation with an unstressed Penman - Monteith equation) significantly improves both CR convergence and symmetry. Inclusion of g(c,max) results in more accurate lambda E-a estimates than are found with the Penman equation ( using either Monin - Obukhov atmospheric conductance or using empirical wind functions in the literature). The proposed method also performs better than the 1992 advection-aridity CR method, modified to include atmospheric stability effects, which attributes noncomplementarity to horizontal advection and corrects for it by adjusting lambda E-0 by the magnitude of the potential sensible heat flux (\H-p\), found from the surface energy balance of the lambda E-p calculation. In the proposed method a similar energy balance adjustment occurs naturally because the finite canopy conductance causes an increase of surface temperature and sensible heat flux in the lambda E-p energy balance calculation. The proposed method is consistent with CR explanations that rely on feedbacks with the boundary layer vapor pressure deficit since the impact of such changes on both lambda E-p and lambda E-a would be modulated by stomatal conductance.

AB Measurements made in the past few decades undeniably indicate change in the climate. The most visible sign of global climate change is air temperature, while less visible indicators include changes in river water temperatures. Changes in river temperature can significantly affect the environment, primarily the biosphere. The physical, biological and chemical characteristics of the river are directly affected by water temperature, although estimation of this relationship presents a complex problem. Although river temperature is influenced by hydrological and meteorological factors, the purpose of this study is to model daily water temperature using only one known parameter, mean air temperature. The relationship between the daily mean air and daily water temperature of the River Drava in Croatia is analysed using linear regression, stochastic modelling or nonlinear regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed-forward neural networks. The results indicate that the MLP models are much better models which can be used for the estimation and prediction of daily mean river temperature.

AB The intensive research of recent years on climate change has led to the strong conclusion that climate has always, throughout the Earth's history, changed irregularly on all time scales. Climate changes are closely related to the Hurst phenomenon, which has been detected in many long hydroclimatic time series and is stochastically equivalent to a simple scaling behaviour of climate variability over time scale. The climate variability, anthropogenic or natural, increases the uncertainty of the hydrological processes. It is shown that hydrological statistics, the branch of hydrology that deals with uncertainty, in its current state is not consistent with the varying character of climate. Typical statistics used in hydrology such as means, variances, cross- and auto-correlations and Hurst coefficients, and the variability thereof, are revisited under the hypothesis of a varying climate following a simple scaling law, and new estimators are studied which, in many cases, differ dramatically from the classical ones. The new statistical framework is applied to real-world examples for typical tasks such as estimation and hypothesis testing where, again, the results depart significantly from those of the classical statistics.

AB Understanding of rainfall-runoff model performance under non-stationary hydroclimatic conditions is limited. This study compared lumped (IHACRES), semi-distributed (HEC-HMS) and fully-distributed (SWATgrid) hydrological models to determine which most realistically simulates runoff in catchments where non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff relationships exists. The models were calibrated and validated under different hydroclimatic conditions (Average, Wet and Dry) for two heterogeneous catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). SWATgrid realistically simulates runoff in the smaller catchment under most hydroclimatic conditions but fails when the model is calibrated in Dry conditions and validated in Wet. All three models perform poorly in the larger catchment irrespective of hydroclimatic conditions. This highlights the need for more research aimed at improving the ability of hydrological models to realistically incorporate the physical processes causing non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff relationships. Although the study is focussed on SEA, the insights gained are useful for all regions which experience large hydroclimatic variability and multi-year/decadal droughts.

AB The temporal dynamics of stream networks are vitally important for understanding hydrologic processes including surface water and groundwater interaction and hydrograph recession. However, observations of wet channel networks are limited, especially in headwater catchments. Near-infrared LiDAR data provide an opportunity to map wet channel networks owing to the fine spatial resolution and strong absorption of light energy by water surfaces. A systematic method is developed to map wet channel networks by integrating elevation and signal intensity of ground returns. The signal intensity thresholds for identifying wet pixels are extracted from frequency distributions of intensity return within the convergent topography extent using a Gaussian mixture model. Moreover, the concept of edge in digital image processing, defined based on the intensity gradient, is utilized to enhance detection of small wet channels. The developed method is applied to the Lake Tahoe area based on eight LiDAR snapshots during recession periods in five watersheds. A power law relationship between streamflow and wetted channel length during recession periods is derived, and the scaling exponent (L proportional to Q(0.44)) is within the range of reported values from fieldwork in other regions.

AB Exploring water fluxes between hydrological model (HM) components is essential to assess and improve model realism. Many classical metrics for HM diagnosis rely solely on streamflow and hence provide limited insights into model performance across processes. This study applies an information theory measure known as "transfer entropy" (TE) to systematically quantify the transfer of information among major HM components. To test and demonstrate the benefits of TE, we use the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) model to mimic and compare four commonly used HM structures, VIC, PRMS, SACRAMENTO, and TOPMODEL, across 671 catchments spanning a variety of hydrologic regimes in the conterminous United States. We explore connections between HM components and catchment landscape characteristics (e.g., climate, topography, soil, and vegetation) and characterize their nonlinear associations using distance correlation and Spearman correlation coefficients. Our results indicate that while the information transferred from precipitation to runoff is similar across model structures (likely as a result of calibration), the information transferred among other components can vary significantly from a FUSE structure to another. We find that aridity, precipitation duration and frequency, snow fraction, mean elevation, forest area, and leaf area index are often significantly associated with TE between the main HM components. We propose that the presence of meaningful nonlinear associations can be used to diagnose process representation in HMs. Our results highlight the necessity to enhance the conventional streamflow-only calibration approach for a more realistic representation of water dynamics in the models.

AB The rise in river stage (water depth) can lead to disastrous floodplain inundation. On the basis of hydraulic simulation data, this study proposes novel data-analytical methods to infer the threshold river stage and detect floodplain inundation. A quasi-Muskingum model is derived from the classical Muskingum model to characterise the relationship between upstream and downstream river stages. Based on this model, F-test and modified Akaike information criterion AIC(c) are introduced to test if there is a change of the upstream-downstream relationship. Furthermore, a bootstrap-based calibration-validation experiment is set up to evaluate the performance of the quasi-Muskingum model. The proposed methods are applied to a case study of the 1991 and 2001 floods in the Flinders and Norman Rivers in Northern Australia. The results show that floodplain inundation does change the upstream-downstream relationship as it drastically alters the stage-discharge relationship. To combine the quasi-Muskingum model with F-test and AIC(c) facilitates an efficient approach to detect the change and infer the threshold river stage. The analytical testing is in concert with visual examination - the time when the river stage becomes higher than the detected threshold coincides with the beginning of floodplain inundation. Despite the change, the quasi-Muskingum model effectively captures the upstream-downstream relationship and requires a small number of samples in calibration. This study highlights the effectiveness of the data-analytical methods in dealing with the change of the upstream-downstream relationship. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this paper is to determine uncertainty in the gauged range of the stage-gauged discharge relationship for 622 rating curves from 171 Australian Bureau of Meteorology Hydrologic Reference streamgauging Stations (HRS). Water agencies use many methods to establish rating curves. Here we adopt a consistent method across all stations and develop rating curves based on Chebyshev polynomials, and estimate uncertainties from standard regression errors in which residuals from the polynomials are adjusted to ensure they are homoscedastic and normally distributed. Uncertainty in input water level is also taken into account. The median uncertainties in mean response of the available gauged discharge relationship at median daily discharges for the HRS dataset range from +4.5 to -4.2% (95% confidence band) and for individual gaugings from +29 to -22% incorporating a water level uncertainty of +/- 4 mm. The uncertainties estimated are consistent with values estimated in Australia and elsewhere.

AB Understanding concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are essential for predicting chemical weathering and biogeochemical cycling under changing climate and anthropogenic conditions. Contrasting C-Q relationships have been observed widely, yet a mechanistic framework that can interpret diverse patterns remains elusive. This work hypothesizes that seemingly disparate C-Q patterns are driven by switching dominance of end-member source waters and their chemical contrasts arising from subsurface biogeochemical heterogeneity. We use data from Coal Creek, a high-elevation mountainous catchment in Colorado, and a recently developed watershed reactive transport model (BioRT-Flux-PIHM). Sensitivity analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations (500 cases) show that reaction kinetics and thermodynamics and distribution of source materials across depths govern the chemistry gradients of shallow soil water and deeper groundwater entering the stream. The alternating dominance of organic-poor yet geo-solute-rich groundwater under dry conditions and organic-rich yet geo-solute-poor soil water during spring melt leads to the flushing pattern of dissolved organic carbon and the dilution pattern of geogenic solutes (e.g., Na, Ca, and Mg). In addition, the extent of concentration contrasts regulates the power law slopes (b) of C-Q patterns via a general equation bmin. At low ratios of soil water versus groundwater concentrations (C-ratio=C-sw/C-gw<0.6), dilution occurs; at high ratios (C-ratio>1.8), flushing arises; chemostasis occurs in between. This equation quantitatively interprets b values of 11 solutes (dissolved organic carbon, dissolved P, NO3-, K, Si, Ca, Mg, Na, Al, Mn, and Fe) from three catchments (Coal Creek, Shale Hills, and Plynlimon) of differing climate, geologic, and land cover conditions. This indicates potentially broad regulation of subsurface biogeochemical heterogeneity in determining C-Q patterns and wide applications of this equation in quantifying b values, which can have broad implications for predicting chemical weathering and biogeochemical transformation at the watershed scale.

ID PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES; WATER EROSION
AB Two mathematical models were used to estimate the annual sediment yield resulting from rainfall and runoff at the outlet of the Nestos River basin (Toxotes, Thrace, Greece). The models were applied to that part of the Nestos River basin (838 km(2)) which lies downstream of three dams. Both models consist of three sub-models: a simplified rainfall-runoff submodel, a physically-based surface erosion submodel and a sediment transport submodel for streams. The two models differ only in the surface erosion submodel: that of the first model is based on the relationships of Poesen (1985) for splash detachment and splash transport, while the corresponding submodel of the second model is based on the relationships of Schmidt (1992) for the momentum flux exerted by the droplets and the momentum flux exerted by the overland flow. The degree of conformity between the annual values of sediment yield at the basin outlet according to both models is satisfactory.

AB The adjustment of local vegetation conditions to limiting soil water by either maximizing productivity or minimizing water stress has been an area of central interest in ecohydrology since Eagleson's classic study. This work has typically been limited to consider one-dimensional exchange and cycling within patches and has not incorporated the effects of lateral redistribution of soil moisture, coupled ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling, and vegetation allocation processes along topographic gradients. We extend this theory to the hillslope and catchment scale, with in situ and downslope feedbacks between water, carbon and nutrient cycling within a fully transient, distributed model. We explore whether ecosystem patches linked along hydrologic flow paths as a catena evolve to form an emergent pattern optimized to local climate and topographic conditions. Lateral hydrologic connectivity of a small catchment is calibrated with streamflow data and further tested with measured soil moisture patterns. Then, the spatial gradient of vegetation density within a small catchment estimated with fine-resolution satellite imagery and field measurements is evaluated with simulated vegetation growth patterns from different root depth and allocation strategies as a function of hillslope position. This is also supported by the correspondence of modeled and field measured spatial patterns of root depths and catchment-level aboveground vegetation productivity. We test whether the simulated spatial pattern of vegetation corresponds to measured canopy patterns and an optimal state relative to a set of ecosystem processes, defined as maximizing ecosystem productivity and water use efficiency at the catchment scale. Optimal carbon uptake ranges show effective compromises between multiple resources (water, light, and nutrients), modulated by vegetation allocation dynamics along hillslope gradient.

AB The complementary relationship (CR) between potential evaporation (LEp) and actual evaporation (LE) is widely used to explain the evaporation paradox and to estimate LE, in which wet environment evaporation (LEw) is usually calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation. However, in many studies on the CR, it has been found that the Priestley-Taylor parameter is not a constant. Through seasonal variation of for estimating LEw in the CR, this paper analyses its seasonal variability. Based on flux observation data at two flux experiment sites (Kogma in Thailand and Weishan in China) in the Asian monsoon region, seasonal variability of the CR is detected, i.e. the value is larger in winter than in summer. This seasonal variability might be caused by seasonal variability in the transport of water vapor and sensible heat between oceans and continent. The monsoon increases air humidity and lowers air temperature in summer, which leads to a decrease in ; it increases atmospheric air temperature and vapor content in winter, increasing . Nevertheless, during May-September, has a range of 1.06-1.16 at the Kogma site and 1.00-1.36 at the Weishan site, which is approximate to the typical range 1.1-1.4.

AB Travel time and time of concentration T-c are important time parameters in hydrological designs. Although T-c is the time for the runoff to travel to the outlet from the most remote part of the catchment, most researchers have used an indirect method such as hydrograph analysis to estimate T-c. A quasi two-dimensional diffusion wave model with particle tracking for overland flow was developed to determine the travel time, and validated for runoff discharges, velocities, and depths. Travel times for 85%, 95% and 100% of particles arrival at the outlet of impervious surfaces (i.e. T-t(85), T-t(95), and T-t(100)) were determined for 530 model runs. The correlations between these travel times and T-c estimated from hydrograph analysis showed a significant agreement between T-c and T-t(85). All the travel times showed nonlinear relationships with the input variables (plot length, slope, roughness coefficient, and effective rainfall intensity) but showed linear relationships with each other.

AB The aim of this paper is to understand the causal factors controlling the relationship between flood peaks and volumes in a regional context. A case study is performed based on 330 catchments in Austria ranging from 6 to 500km(2) in size. Maximum annual flood discharges are compared with the associated flood volumes, and the consistency of the peak-volume relationship is quantified by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The results indicate that climate-related factors are more important than catchment-related factors in controlling the consistency. Spearman rank correlation coefficients typically range from about 0.2 in the high alpine catchments to about 0.8 in the lowlands. The weak dependence in the high alpine catchments is due to the mix of flood types, including long-duration snowmelt, synoptic floods and flash floods. In the lowlands, the flood durations vary less in a given catchment which is related to the filtering of the distribution of all storms by the catchment response time to produce the distribution of flood producing storms.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are often used to quantify source water contributions and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments, especially during discrete hydrological events. Yet, the interpretation of C-Q hysteresis is often confounded by complexity of the critical zone, such as numerous source waters and hydrochemical nonstationarity. Consequently, researchers must often ignore important runoff pathways and geochemical sources/sinks, especially the hyporheic zone because it lacks a distinct hydrochemical signature. Such simplifications limit efforts to identify processes responsible for the transience of C-Q hysteresis over time. To address these limitations, we leverage the hydrologic simplicity and long-term, high-frequency Q and electrical conductivity (EC) data from streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. In this two end-member system, EC can serve as a proxy for the concentration of solutes derived from the hyporheic zone. We utilize a novel approach to decompose loops into subhysteretic EC-Q dynamics to identify individual mechanisms governing hysteresis across a wide range of timescales. We find that hydrologic and hydraulic processes govern EC response to diel and seasonal Q variability and that the effects of hyporheic mixing processes on C-Q transience differ in short and long streams. We also observe that variable hyporheic turnover rates govern EC-Q patterns at daily to interannual timescales. Last, subhysteretic analysis reveals a period of interannual freshening of glacial meltwater streams related to the effects of unsteady flow on hyporheic exchange. The subhysteretic analysis framework we introduce may be applied more broadly to constrain the processes controlling C-Q transience and advance understanding of catchment evolution.

AB The present study investigates the potential of coupled Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based surface soil moisture data assimilation for improving the streamflow simulations. For this purpose, synthetic and real data assimilation experiments were carried out using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in two different sub-catchments lying in the Krishna River basin, India. Here, the satellite-based surface soil moisture estimates from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) are used for assimilation. Results of the synthetic experiment show that the use of physically based SMAR scheme coupled with EnkF for updating profile soil moisture has better ability to improve the surface flow, groundwater flow and consequently streamflow over the covariance-based updates using EnKF only. Likewise, the real data assimilation experiment also shows SMAR-EnKF assimilation strategy performs better than the EnKF only updates for simulating streamflow. However, in both the synthetic as well as real data experiment, the improvements are only moderate. This restricted success in improving streamflow simulations indicate that updating only the soil moisture through any updating scheme adopted here is not sufficient to reduce the effect of the errors in model forcing on subsequent simulation days.

AB An area of rainforest in Trinidad (10 degrees N, 61 degrees W) is remarkably rich in biodiversity, and receives the highest amount of rainfall in the island due to its orography and the dominant northeast trade winds. However, a year-round transfer of water from its pristine rivers is likely in the future, with ecological consequences. The results of a pilot study are presented, based on a simple, and graphical, segment-scale multi-objective methodology for the estimation of the optimal instream flow of the 13 rivers in this area. This methodology is based on a dimensionless ecohydrological factor, A, which enables the required hydraulic mean depth at a river cross-section to be expressed in terms of the average species length at maturity for a target group of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles. Moreover, the methodology considers the socio-economic cost of ecological degradation brought about by streamflow abstraction, as well as the economic benefit of the same. An example illustrates the estimation of optimal instream flow for a value of A and, thereby, the corresponding optimal river intake operating rule, based on the hydraulic characteristics of a 0.1 km segment of one of the rivers, for the 20-year average dry (January-May) and wet (June-December) seasons. The limitations of the pilot study, and areas for further research, are also highlighted with a hope that it will ultimately evolve into a decision-making tool for water resources management.

AB Observations from the Goodwin Creek experimental watershed (GCEW), Mississippi show that peak-discharge Q(A) and drainage area A are related, on average, by a power law or scaling relationship, Q(A) = alpha A(0), during single rainfall-runoff events. Observations also show that alpha and theta change between events, and, based on a recent analysis of 148 events, observations indicate that X and 0 change because of corresponding changes in the depth, duration, and spatial variability of excess-rainfall. To improve our physical understanding of these observations, a 5-step framework for diagnosing observed power laws, or other space-time patterns in a basin, is articulated and applied to GCEW using a combination of analysis and numerical simulations. Diagnostic results indicate how the power laws are connected to physical conditions and processes. Derived expressions for alpha and theta show that if excess-rainfall depth is fixed then there is a decreasing concave relationship between a and excess-rainfall duration, and an increasing and slightly convex relationship between alpha and excess rainfall duration. These trends are consistent with observations only when hillslope velocity nu(h) is given a physically realistic value near 0.1 m/s. If nu(h) >> 0.1 m/s, then the predicted trends deviate from observed trends. Results also suggest that trends in alpha and theta can be impacted by the dependence of nu(h) and link velocity nu(1) on excess-rainfall rate. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the past decades much progress has been made in the development of computer based methods for parameter and predictive uncertainty estimation of hydrologic models. The goal of this paper is twofold. As part of this special anniversary issue we first shortly review the most important historical developments in hydrologic model calibration and uncertainty analysis that has led to current perspectives. Then, we introduce theory, concepts and simulation results of a novel data assimilation scheme for joint inference of model parameters and state variables. This Particle-DREAM method combines the strengths of sequential Monte Carlo sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and is especially designed for treatment of forcing, parameter, model structural and calibration data error. Two different variants of Particle-DREAM are presented to satisfy assumptions regarding the temporal behavior of the model parameters. Simulation results using a 40-dimensional atmospheric "toy" model, the Lorenz attractor and a rainfall-runoff model show that Particle-DREAM, P-DREAM((VP)) and P-DREAM((IP)) require far fewer particles than current state-of-the-art filters to closely track the evolving target distribution of interest, and provide important insights into the information content of discharge data and non-stationarity of model parameters. Our development follows formal Bayes, yet Particle-DREAM and its variants readily accommodate hydrologic signatures, informal likelihood functions or other (in) sufficient statistics if those better represent the salient features of the calibration data and simulation model used.

AB Statistical relationships between annual floods at 200 long-term (85-127 years of record) streamgauges in the coterminous United States and the global mean carbon dioxide concentration ( GMCO2) record are explored. The streamgauge locations are limited to those with little or no regulation or urban development. The coterminous US is divided into four large regions and stationary bootstrapping is used to evaluate if the patterns of these statistical associations are significantly different from what would be expected under the null hypothesis that flood magnitudes are independent of GMCO2. In none of the four regions defined in this study is there strong statistical evidence for flood magnitudes increasing with increasing GMCO2. One region, the southwest, showed a statistically significant negative relationship between GMCO2 and flood magnitudes. The statistical methods applied compensate both for the inter-site correlation of flood magnitudes and the shorter-term ( up to a few decades) serial correlation of floods.

AB This paper, the first in a series of two, applies the entropy (or information) theory to describe the spatial variability of synthetic data that can represent spatially correlated groundwater quality data. The application involves calculating information measures such as transinformation, the information transfer index and the correlation coefficient. These measures are calculated using discrete and analytical approaches. The discrete approach uses the contingency table and the analytical approach uses the normal probability density function. The discrete and analytical approaches are found to be in reasonable agreement. The analysis shows that transinformation is useful and comparable with correlation to characterize the spatial variability of the synthetic data set, which is correlated with distance.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the regionalization method on the basis of a combination of a parsimonious model structure and a multi-objective calibration technique. For this study, 12 gauged catchments in the Republic of Korea were used. The parsimonious model structure, requiring minimal input data, was used to avoid adverse effects arising from model complexity, over-parameterization and data requirements. The IHACRES rainfall-runoff model was applied to represent the dynamic response characteristics of catchments in Korea. A multi-objective approach was adopted to reduce the predictive uncertainty arising from the calibration of a rainfall-runoff model, by increasing the amount of information retrieved from the available data. The regional relationships (or models) between the model parameters and the catchment attributes were established via a multiple regression approach, incorporating correlation analysis and stepwise regression on linear and logarithmic scales. The impacts of the parameters, calibrated by the multi-objective approach, on the adequacy of regional relationships were assessed by comparison with impacts obtained by the single-objective approach. The regional relationships were well defined, despite limited available data. The drainage area, the effective soil depth, the mean catchment slope and the catchment gradient appeared to be the main factors for describing the hydrologic response characteristics in the areas studied. The overall model performance of the regional models based on the multi-objective approach was good, producing reasonable results for high and low flows and for the overall water balance, simultaneously. The regional models based on the single-objective approach yielded accurate predictions in high flows but showed limited predictive capability for low flows and the overall water balance. This was due to the optimal model parameter estimates when using a single-objective measure. The parameters calibrated by the single-objective approach decreased the predictability of the regional models. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Based on a Chinese saying: "Even a clever housewife cannot cook a meal without rice", a simple categorization of the methods for Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) is proposed, including: Borrowing, obtaining hydrological information by transplanting measurements from a similar basin, or extrapolating/interpolating the data from neighbouring catchments; Substituting, finding substitutes either from the ungauged basin or from donating area(s); and Generating, obtaining data via field or laboratory observations. The Substituting category is classified further into: S1, substitution only from within the ungauged basin using fully process-based models without calibration; S2-1, from similar gauged basins using established index/distribution; S2-2, from various gauged basins using regression and/or process-based relationships between the climate/catchment features and hydrological signatures (CCH), and S3, from the information beyond the CCH relationship. Based on a review, the Darwinian S2-2 and Newtonian S1 were found to be the two most popular methods, both for China and worldwide PUB.

AB Both concentration-discharge relation and end-member mixing analysis were explored to elucidate the connectivity of hydrologic and hydrochemical processes using chemical data collected during 2006-2008 at Happy Isles (468 km(2)), Pohono Bridge (833 km(2)), and Briceburg (1873 km(2)) in the snowmelt-fed mid-Merced River basin, augmented by chemical data collected by the USGS during 1990-2014 at Happy Isles. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) in streamflow was dominated by a well-defined power law relation, with the magnitude of exponent (0.02-0.6) and R-2 values (p<0.001) lower on rising than falling limbs. Concentrations of conservative solutes in streamflow resulted from mixing of two end-members at Happy Isles and Pohono Bridge and three at Briceburg, with relatively constant solute concentrations in end-members. The fractional contribution of groundwater was higher on rising than falling limbs at all basin scales. The relationship between the fractional contributions of subsurface flow and groundwater and streamflow (F-Q) followed the same relation as C-Q as a result of end-member mixing. The F-Q relation was used as a simple model to simulate subsurface flow and groundwater discharges to Happy Isles from 1990 to 2014 and was successfully validated by solute concentrations measured by the USGS. It was also demonstrated that the consistency of F-Q and C-Q relations is applicable to other catchments where end-members and the C-Q relationships are well defined, suggesting hydrologic and hydrochemical processes are strongly coupled and mutually predictable. Combining concentration-discharge and end-member mixing analyses could be used as a diagnostic tool to understand streamflow generation and hydrochemical controls in catchment hydrologic studies.

ID CROSS-VALIDATION
AB Bilinear surface smoothing is an alternative concept that provides flexible means for spatial interpolation. Interpolation is accomplished by means of fitting a bilinear surface into a regression model with known break points and adjustable smoothing terms. Additionally, as an option, the incorporation, in an objective manner, of the influence of an explanatory variable available at a considerable denser dataset is possible. The parameters involved in each case (with or without an explanatory variable) are determined by a nonparametric approach based on the generalized cross-validation (GCV) methodology. A convenient search technique for the smoothing parameters was achieved by transforming them in terms of tension parameters, with values restricted in the interval [0, 1). The mathematical framework, the computational implementation and details concerning both versions of the methodology, as well as practical aspects of their application are presented and discussed. In a companion paper, examples using both synthesized and real-world (hydrological) data are presented to illustrate the methodology. The proposed mathematical framework constitutes a simple alternative to existing spatial interpolation methodologies.

AB The Rational Formula is the most applied equation in practical hydrology due to its simplicity and the effective compromise between theory and data availability. Although the Rational Formula has several drawbacks, it is reliable and surprisingly accurate considering the paucity of input information. However, after more than a century, the recent progress in computational ability, theory and large-scale monitoring compel us to try to suggest a more advanced yet still empirical procedure for estimating peak discharge in small and ungauged basins. In this paper, an alternative empirical procedure is described and discussed, and then a discussion as to whether the Rational Formula is still necessary is presented. The presented methodology integrates the three standard steps of the common event-based approach (design hyetograph, rainfall excess and rainfall-runoff transformation) accurately adapted for application with a lack of observed data. The proposed procedure requires the same input information as necessary for application of the Rational Formula (soil properties, intensity-duration-frequency rainfall curves and T-c) and provides both the peak discharge and the design hydrograph shape and, most importantly, reduces the subjectivity of the hydrologist in its application.

TI Groundwater flow, transport, and residence times through

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NON-FICKIAN TRANSPORT; ENERGY
AB In this paper, we investigate the effects of systematic and local heterogeneity on groundwater flow, transport, and residence time distributions (RTDs) of basins where groundwater flow is topography driven. Systematic heterogeneity is represented by an exponentially depth-decreasing hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and local heterogeneity is represented by the dispersivity. The RTDs for both a simple basin with one flow system and a basin with nested local and regional systems gradually evolve to a power law RTD with more pronounced systematic heterogeneity. Exponential decrease of poromechanical properties enhances shallow circulation and subdues deep and regional flows leading to longer flushing times for the large part of the domain, while the shallower portions flush solutes rapidly. Therefore, deeper basins lead to more persistent and pronounced power law RTDs when the poromechanical properties systematically decrease with depth. Separate contributions to the RTD due to stagnation zones associated with local flow cells and due to deeper immobile zones were identified; each leads to a different tailing behavior. Local heterogeneity slightly enhances the power law RTD by causing the tailing to begin earlier but does not affect the late time portion of the RTD. Systematic depth-dependent heterogeneity is an important factor controlling the circulation and associated RTDs of subsurface fluids. It contributes significantly to generation of power law RTDs.

AB Studying the hysteretic relationships embedded in high-frequency suspended-sediment concentration and river discharge data over 600(+) storm events provides insight into the drivers and sources of riverine sediment during storm events. However, the literature to date remains limited to a simple visual classification system (linear, clockwise, counter-clockwise, and figure-eight patterns) or the collapse of hysteresis patterns to an index. This study leverages 3 years of suspended-sediment and discharge data to show proof-of-concept for automating the classification and assessment of event sediment dynamics using machine learning. Across all catchment sites, 600(+) storm events were captured and classified into 14 hysteresis patterns. Event classification was automated using a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), a type of artificial neural network, trained on 2-D images of the suspended-sediment discharge (hysteresis) plots. Expansion of the hysteresis patterns to 14 classes allowed for new insight into drivers of the sediment-discharge event dynamics including spatial scale, antecedent conditions, hydrology, and rainfall. The probabilistic RBM correctly classified hysteresis patterns (to the exact class or next most similar class) 70% of the time. With increased availability of high-frequency sensor data, this approach can be used to inform watershed management efforts to identify sediment sources and reduce fine sediment export.

AB Groundwater monitoring networks are direct sources of information for revealing subsurface system dynamic processes. However, designing such networks is difficult due to uncertainties in the spatial heterogeneity of aquifer parameters such as permeability (k). This study combines deep learning and information theory with an optimization framework to address network design problems in heterogeneous aquifer systems. The framework first employs a generative adversarial network to parameterize heterogeneous k distribution using a low-dimensional latent representation. Then, surrogate models are developed based on the deep neural networks to perform uncertainty quantification of pressure heads and solute concentrations at locations of pre-designed candidate monitoring stations. The monitoring stations are then ranked using the greedy search algorithm based on the maximum information minimum redundancy (MIMR) criterion. In order to depict the importance of each candidate monitoring location, the hotspot maps of the selection probability (P-s) are derived from MIMR repetition results. Comprehensive monitoring networks derived from the hotspot maps are then conducted as the final monitoring stations to improve monitoring information compared to MIMR results. Additionally, nine entropy quantization strategies are compared to evaluate their effects on monitoring network optimization results. Results indicate that caution should be taken when selecting entropy quantization strategies to achieve the accuracy required for model calibration and to improve the efficiency of monitoring optimization. Considering high-dimensional uncertainties associated with aquifer parameters, the developed framework can provide important insights for monitoring network designs in various earth observational projects.

AB Using daily suspended sediment and water discharge data, we calculated the current mean annual runoff and Specific Suspended Sediment Yield (SSY) for 66 mountainous and piedmont catchments in Chile. These catchments are located from the extreme north of Chile to Southern Patagonia and cover an exceptionally wide range of climates, slopes, and vegetation. The SSY ranges mainly between 0 and 700 t km(-2) year(-1) with some exceptions as high as 1780 t km(-2) year(-1). The SSY increases between the extreme north and 33 degrees S and then decreases toward the south. Sediment and water discharge north of 33 degrees S occur mainly during summer. Farther south the contribution of winter precipitation increases and predominates. When the SSY database is correlated with topographic, climatic and vegetation indices, it is found to correlate significantly with runoff and mean slope only. In order to concentrate on erosion processes in the mountain range, 32 mountainous catchments were selected along a strong north-south SSY gradient between 27 degrees S and 40 degrees S. From north to south, SSY increases strongly with runoff and then decreases, even while runoff keeps increasing. In catchments where SSY is low, although runoff is high, the mean slope is less than 40% and the vegetation cover is greater than 8%. For the other catchments, runoff variations explain 67% of the variance in sediment yields. Thus, SSY seems to be controlled by vegetation cover and slope thresholds. In addition, SSY also correlates with glacier cover. However, a correlation between SSY and seismicity, although possible, is ambiguous.

AB Breakthrough curves (BTCs) observed during tracer tests in highly heterogeneous aquifers display strong tailing. Power laws are popular models for both the empirical fitting of these curves, and the prediction of transport using upscaling models based on best-fitted estimated parameters (e.g. the power law slope or exponent). The predictive capacity of power law based upscaling models can be however questioned due to the difficulties to link model parameters with the aquifers' physical properties. This work analyzes two aspects that can limit the use of power laws as effective predictive tools: (a) the implication of statistical subsampling, which often renders power laws undistinguishable from other heavily tailed distributions, such as the logarithmic (LOG); (b) the difficulties to reconcile fitting parameters obtained from models with different formulations, such as the presence of a late-time cutoff in the power law model. Two rigorous and systematic stochastic analyses, one based on benchmark distributions and the other on BTCs obtained from transport simulations, are considered. It is found that a power law model without cutoff (PL) results in best-fitted exponents (aPL) falling in the range of typical experimental values reported in the literature (1.5 < alpha(PL) < 4). The PL exponent tends to lower values as the tailing becomes heavier. Strong fluctuations occur when the number of samples is limited, due to the effects of subsampling. On the other hand, when the power law model embeds a cutoff (PLCO), the best-fitted exponent (aCO) is insensitive to the degree of tailing and to the effects of subsampling and tends to a constant alpha(CO) approximate to 1. In the PLCO model, the cutoff rate (lambda) is the parameter that fully reproduces the persistence of the tailing and is shown to be inversely correlated to the LOG scale parameter (i.e. with the skewness of the distribution). The theoretical results are consistent with the fitting analysis of a tracer test performed during the MADE-5 experiment. It is shown that a simple mechanistic upscaling model based on the PLCO formulation is able to predict the ensemble of BTCs from the stochastic transport simulations without the need of any fitted parameters. The model embeds the constant alpha(CO) = 1 and relies on a stratified description of the transport mechanisms to estimate lambda. The PL fails to reproduce the ensemble of BTCs at late time, while the LOG model provides consistent results as the PLCO model, however without a clear mechanistic link between physical properties and model parameters. It is concluded that, while all parametric models may work equally well (or equally wrong) for the empirical fitting of the experimental BTCs tails due to the effects of subsampling, for predictive purposes this is not true. A careful selection of the proper heavily tailed models and corresponding parameters is required to ensure physically-based transport predictions.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB We study the influence of topography on groundwater fluxes and water table depths across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Groundwater tables are often conceptualized as subdued replicas of topography. While it is well known that groundwater configuration is also controlled by geology and climate, nonlinear interactions between these drivers within large real-world systems are not well understood and are difficult to characterize given sparse groundwater observations. We address this limitation using the fully integrated physical hydrology model ParFlow to directly simulate groundwater fluxes and water table depths within a complex heterogeneous domain that incorporates all three primary groundwater drivers. Analysis is based on a first of its kind, continental-scale, high-resolution (1 km), groundwater-surface water simulation spanning more than 6.3 million km(2). Results show that groundwater fluxes are most strongly driven by topographic gradients (as opposed to gradients in pressure head) in humid regions with small topographic gradients or low conductivity. These regions are generally consistent with the topographically controlled groundwater regions identified in previous studies. However, we also show that areas where topographic slopes drive groundwater flux do not generally have strong correlations between water table depth and elevation. Nonlinear relationships between topography and water table depth are consistent with groundwater flow systems that are dominated by local convergence and could also be influenced by local variability in geology and climate. One of the strengths of the numerical modeling approach is its ability to evaluate continental-scale groundwater behavior at a high resolution not possible with other techniques.

AB Systematic experimental deviations from theoretical predictions for water retention characteristics of fractal porous media develop at a moisture content, theta(d). Below theta(d) larger suction pressures are required than would otherwise be predicted from the implied fractal pore-size distribution. Inferred values of theta(d) were shown to be compatible with observed values of the volumetric moisture content, theta(t), at which solute diffusion vanishes. The comparison was based on an accurate phenomenological result for theta(1). The approximate equivalence of the two moisture contents was interpreted in the context of continuum percolation theory (at low moisture contents, below a critical volume fraction of water, alpha(c), connections for capillary flow are interrupted, leading to a near vanishing of solute diffusion and increasing enormously the time required for equilibration to new pressures). The experimental results for theta(d) are now investigated to determine whether their values are generally compatible with theoretically based estimates for alpha(c). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degree of hydrological connectivity is mainly determined by the spatial organisation of heterogeneity. A meaningful and aggregate abstraction of spatial patterns is one of the promising means to gain fundamental insights into this complex interaction and can, moreover, be used as a tool to acquire a profound understanding of the major controls of catchment hydrology. In order to disclose such controls, pattern-process relationships and the explanatory power of landscape metrics were tested by simulating the runoff of differently patterned virtual basins, generated by neutral landscape models and fractal networks and solved by a surface hydrological model composed of kinematic wave routing and Green-Ampt infiltration. A total of 23 landscape metrics quantified the spatial patterns and were subsequently related to the functional connectivity, assessed as the proportion of internal runoff generation constituting the hydrological response at the outlet. Landscape metrics allowed the identification of dominant features of heterogeneity that explained the observed connectivity, and to disclose changes in control with class abundance. Therefore, landscape metrics are a useful tool for basin comparison and classification in terms of the dominant processes and the corresponding model structure requirements.

   MODELS; MATRIX
AB Fractures can have variable effects on fluid flow in a porous rock. Moderately conductive fractures may enhance the rock's overall effective permeability, while highly conductive fractures may completely dominate fluid transport. Fluid flow modeling is important to quantify the impact of fractures on the performance of a reservoir. However, simulating fluid flow is computationally intensive due to the heterogeneities introduced by the fracture network. In this work, complex fracture patterns are simplified using hybrid implicit-explicit representations to yield a computationally tractable model. Hybrid modeling requires the selection of a partitioning size to group fractures by size. Small fractures are upscaled with the rock matrix; large fractures are explicitly represented. Our study shows that, given a naturally fractured reservoir, an upper limit exists for the partitioning size and that this threshold partitioning size can be determined without trial and error. Using artificial and realistic fracture patterns, we created hybrid models using different partitioning sizes and subjected them to pressure drawdowns. Simulated production rates were compared against reference results obtained from simulations on the original fracture patterns. Beyond a threshold partitioning size unique to each fracture pattern, hybrid model results deviate significantly from reference solutions. The threshold is identified from the relationship between upscaled permeabilities and partitioning sizes and corresponds to the point where the effective permeability of small fractures begins to increase rapidly. The permeability-size relationship is obtained using numerical flow-based upscaling. For uniformly distributed fractures with no abutment relationships, the effective medium theory is shown to generate accurate permeability-size relationships.
   Plain Language Summary Naturally fractured reservoirs are exploited in several industries as they (1) may contain oil and gas, (2) can also be used to extract heat from underground, (3) form pathways for groundwater to flow, and (4) can be used to store CO 2 and mitigate climate change. As such, it is important to predict how fluids will move through such reservoirs. This is difficult because fractured reservoirs contain fractures that differ greatly in size. One approach that alleviates this problem is to represent the rock and smaller fractures by an equivalent porous medium that has a comparable flow behavior. Our study finds that this approach works, but there is a limit to what can be considered small. When this simplification is applied to fractures that are larger than the limit, the resulting equivalent representation fails to capture the correct flow behavior. We show that the limit can be predetermined by studying how the equivalent rock properties change with the size range of small fractures. We also show that this procedure can be carried out efficiently using a technique based on the effective medium theory. The findings in this study will allow industry practitioners to systematically simplify their fractured reservoir flow modeling problems.

AB Suspended sediment and bedload discharges in sand-bed rivers shape semi-arid landscapes and impact sediment delivery from these landscapes, but are still incompletely understood. Suspended sediment and bedload fluxes of the intermittent Exu River, Brazil, were sampled by direct measurements. The highest suspended sediment concentration observed was 4847.4 mg L-1 and this value was possibly associated with the entrainment of sediment that was deposited in the preceding year. The bedload flux was well related to the stream power and the river efficiently transported all available bedload with a mean rate of 0.0047 kg m(-1) s(-1), and the percentage of bedload to suspended sediment varied between 4 and 12.72. The bed sediment of Exu River was prone to entrainment and showed a proclivity for transport. Thus, sand-bed and gravel-bed rivers of arid environments seem to exhibit the same mobility in the absence of armour layer.

AB The very nature of weather forecasts and verifications and the way they are used make it impossible for one single or absolute standard of evaluation. However, little research has been conducted on verifying deterministic multi-category forecasts, which is based on the attribute of uncertainty. The authors propose a new approach using two mutual information theory-based scores for assessing the comprehensive uncertainty of all categories and the uncertainty for a certain category in deterministic multi-category precipitation forecasts, respectively. Specifically, the comprehensive uncertainty is defined as the average reduction in uncertainty about the observations resulting from the use of a predictive model to provide all categories forecasts; the uncertainty of a certain category is defined as the reduction in uncertainty about the observations resulting from the use of a predictive model to provide a certain category forecast. By applying the proposed approach and traditional verification methods, the four precipitation forecasting products from the China Meteorological Administration, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and United Kingdom Meteorological Office were verified in the Dahuofang Reservoir Drainage Basin, China. The results indicate that: (a) the proposed approach can better capture the changing patterns of uncertainties with lead times and distinguish the forecasting performance among different forecast products; (b) the proposed approach is resistant to the extreme bias; (c) the proposed approach needs a careful choice of bin width; and (d) the bias analysis is necessary before verifying the uncertainties in precipitation forecasts.

AB A simple bundle of triangular tubes model is employed to calculate specific interfacial area for primary drainage, imbibition, and secondary drainage for mixed-wet conditions. In this model, only the interfaces between bulk and corner fluid are contributory to the interfacial area. Accurate expressions for the capillary entry pressures are employed, which account for the possibility of hinging interfaces in the corners due to contact angle hysteresis. The results show that very different trends in the specific interfacial area versus saturation curves can occur during imbibition, depending on the advancing contact angle and the reversal point after primary drainage. For water-wet conditions, interfacial area scanning curves coincide with the bounding imbibition curve, while for oil-wet conditions, the scanning curves may cross each other because of the impact that hinging interfaces in the pore corners have on the invasion order of the pore sizes. Analytical expressions for specific interfacial area as a function of saturation and capillary pressure are derived for primary drainage of triangular tubes. Approximate correlations for interfacial area as a function of saturation are suggested for the subsequent imbibition and drainage processes. The correlations are fitted to the simulated data, and good agreement is obtained. We also demonstrate that hysteresis remains present in the relationship between interfacial area, capillary pressure, and saturation when contact angle hysteresis is assumed. Hysteresis may be significant for both water-wet and mixed-wet conditions. A more sophisticated model is required to examine if this is also the case when hysteresis is caused by phase entrapment.

AB For many basins, identifying changes to water quality over time and understanding current hydrologic processes are hindered by fragmented and discontinuous water-quality and hydrology data. In the coal mined region of the New River basin and Indian Fork sub-basin, muted and pronounced changes, respectively, to concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships were identified using linear regression on log-transformed historical (1970s-1980s) and recent (2000s) water-quality and streamflow data. Changes to C-Q relationships were related to coal mining histories and shifts in land use. Hysteresis plots of individual storms from 2007 (New River) and the fall of 2009 (Indian Fork) were used to understand current hydrologic processes in the basins. In the New River, storm magnitude was found to be closely related to the reversal of loop rotation in hysteresis plots; a peak-flow threshold of 25 cubic meters per second (m(3)/s) segregates hysteresis patterns into clockwise and counterclockwise rotational groups. Small storms with peak flow less than 25 m(3)/s often resulted in dilution of constituent concentrations in headwater tributaries like Indian Fork and concentration of constituents downstream in the mainstem of the New River. Conceptual two or three component mixing models for the basins were used to infer the influence of water derived from spoil material on water quality. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil moisture estimates obtained over large spatial areas will become increasingly available through current and upcoming satellite missions and from numerous land surface parameterization schemes run at global- and continental-scale resolutions. The goal of this research was to evaluate the potential for using macroscale estimates of soil moisture for enhancing streamflow forecasts. Towards this research objective, monthly streamflow estimates were obtained from over 50 gauge locations within the Nelson basin, Canada, for the period 1979-1999. For each streamflow record, multiple linear regression models were used to remove components of the streamflow signal related to previous streamflow, climate teleconnections (e.g. ENSO and AO) and snow water equivalence. Correlations were then assessed between the macroscale soil moisture estimates and the residuals of the multiple linear regression analysis over lead times of one, two and three months. At the one- and two-month lead time, statistically significant relationships between soil moisture and the residuals of streamflow are observed over a large proportion of the gauging locations. The number of catchments with statistically significant relationships decreases significantly after two months and particularly in the months of April-June. This study demonstrates that available macroscale estimates of soil moisture have the potential to enhance streamflow prediction, although further study is suggested to improve upon the soil moisture estimates and their application in a forecast system.

AB We investigate the statistical properties of a Lagrangian random variable beta[T/L], which has been shown to quantify hydrodynamic impact on retention [Cvetkovic et al., 1999], using Monte Carlo simulations of flow and transport in a single fracture. The "local cubic law'' of water flow is generalized to a power law Qsimilar tob(n), where Q is the flow rate, b is the half aperture, and nless than or equal to3. Simulations of flow and particle transport are carried out assuming "local cubic law'' (n=3) and "local quadratic law'' (n=2), and for two typical flow configurations: uniform flow and radially converging flow. We find that beta is related to tau as betasimilar totau(m), where m is dependent on the power n and the configuration of flow and transport. Simulation results for uniform flow indicate that betasimilar totau(n/n-1) for a small source section; as the source section increases, we have the convergence to betasimilar totau. For radially converging flow, we find betasimilar totau for a small source section and a convergence to beta=const for an increasing source section. Simulation results for both flow configurations are consistent with the results for a homogeneous fracture. The results for a homogeneous fracture provide reasonable bounds for simulated beta. The correlation between beta and Q is relatively weak for all cases studied.

AB Joint multifractal spectrum analysis (JMS) is an effective approach for investigation of relationship among hydrological variables and is regarded as one potential way to reveal nonlinear relationship in hydrology. In this study, the joint multifractal spectrum analysis was for the first time used to analyze soil moisture-soil temperature-precipitation (SM-ST-P) relationship. Pearson's linear correlation coefficient considering lag effects and scale effects was also applied for the aims of comparison. Soil data were collected at four sites in Tibet and three depths for each site (10 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm) at 2-hourly frequency from November 2016 to November 2017. Correlation analysis showed that the coefficients varied at every measurement point but failed to provide general and comprehensive analysis of SM-ST-P relationship. On the contrary, multifractal spectra of SM-ST-P confirmed that the relationship was strong for all measurement points. Furthermore, JMS analysis provided holistic results including verification of multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship, relationship evaluation for each part of variables separately (high value, middle value, low value), intuitive diagrammatic comparison of SM-ST and SM-P relationships, etc. Seasonal JMS analysis was adopted to investigate the freezing-thawing process in the study area as well. The multifractal spectra of frozen soil site and no frozen soil site are totally different for dry cold period but similar for rainy warm period. The difference in multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship with and without frozen soil presented the latent application of JMS to quantitatively detect the process of frozen soil. This study implied the capability of JMS analysis in hydrology, especially for multivariable relationship like SM-ST-P relationship.

AB A 3-D refractive-index matching Lagrangian particle tracking (3D-RIM-LPT) system was developed to study the filtration and the clogging process inside a homogeneous porous medium. A small subset of particles flowing through the porous medium was dyed and tracked. As this subset was randomly chosen, its dynamics is representative of all the rest. The statistics of particle locations, number, and velocity were obtained as functions of different volumetric concentrations. It is found that in our system the clogging time decays with the particle concentration following a power law relationship. As the concentration increases, there is a transition from depth filtration to cake filtration. At high concentration, more clogged pores lead to frequent flow redirections and more transverse migrations of particles. In addition, the velocity distribution in the transverse direction is symmetrical around zero, and it is slightly more intermittent than the random Gaussian curve due to particle-particle and particle-grain interactions. In contrast, as clogging develops, the longitudinal velocity of particles along the mean flow direction peaks near zero because of many trapped particles. But at the same time, the remaining open pores will experience larger pressure and, as a result, particles through those pores tend to have larger longitudinal velocities.

AB A theory for the movement of suspendible sediment through the floodplain of a simple actively migrating river is developed. The floodplain is represented as a series of sediment storage reservoirs, each incorporating multiple bends of a river. Independent models for floodplain sediment deposition and for subsequent removal of sediment by lateral channel migration allow the volume of sediment stored in the floodplain (and the associated average floodplain elevation) to change over time and down the valley. At a given quasi-steady discharge, deposition depends on a simple one-dimensional partition between channel and floodplain discharge and on suspended sediment concentration (one size class) which varies along the reach depending on lateral supply and floodplain history. Sediment supply is specified at the upstream end of the reach using a suspended sediment rating curve. Long-term average overbank deposition rates are approximated by weighting multiple steady state solutions using a flow duration curve. The channel bed elevation of the system is assumed to be fixed, and tributaries are handled using simple lateral source terms. The interaction between the submodels is such that under constant boundary conditions, the channel evolves toward a state of geomorphic equilibrium where the volume of sediment added to the floodplain by overbank deposition just balances the volume removed by channel migration. The model is easily adapted to track conservative suspended sediment tracer material concentration as such material moves through the channel/floodplain system.

AB The suspended sediment load in a river is an indicator of its health. Yet, the direct measurement of suspended sediment load is difficult. Most assessments of suspended sediment load are therefore estimated from relationships developed between suspended sediment concentration and discharge, as sediment rating curves. However, these are not able to provide sufficiently accurate results. The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of the sediment rating curve in the educational forest watershed of Tarbiat Modares University in northern Iran. Water and suspended sediment sampling were conducted via depth-integration at daily and storm-wise scales, and the samples were analysed through decantation procedure. Towards this attempt, various sediment rating curves were examined for different data sets classified on the basis of various governing conditions. The relationships between study variables were assessed by applying a bivariate regression method and descriptive statistics. The results of fitting rating curves on suspended sediment and water discharge, with respective averages of 1.256 +/- 2.835 g L-1 and 0.556 +/- 0.444 m(3) s(-1), verified that no sediment rating curve could be reliably used for the study area. Scrutinizing the results also verified that the data stratification and increasing time resolution led to better model performance, though their accuracy has not been statistically and logically tested.

AB There has been considerable research on modelling various aspects of drought such as identification and prediction of its duration and severity. The term severity has various connotations in drought literature such as in hydrological drought, where it is defined as the Cumulative shortage or the deficit sum with reference to a pre-specified truncation level. In meteorological drought, the severity has rather been defined in the form of indices such as the Palmer drought severity index. There exist a variety of techniques and methods to analyse the duration and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts through probability characterization of low flows, time series methods, synthetic data generation, theory of runs, multiple regression, group theory, pattern recognition and neural network methods. Agricultural droughts arc analysed based on soil moisture modelling concepts with crop yield considerations and using multiple linear regression techniques. The prediction aspects of drought duration are developed better than the drought severity aspects, These latter need to be improved because information on drought severity is of paramount practical importance and forms an essential part of the design process of storage facilities for abatement of droughts. A major challenge of drought research is to develop suitable methods and techniques for forecasting the onset and termination points of droughts. An equally challenging task is the dissemination of drought research results for practical usage and wider applications.

AB Critical path analysis (CPA) is a method for estimating macroscopic transport coefficients of heterogeneous materials that are highly disordered at the micro-scale. Developed originally to model conduction in semiconductors, numerous researchers have noted that CPA might also have relevance to flow and transport processes in porous media. However, the results of several numerical investigations of critical path analysis on pore network models raise questions about the applicability of CPA to porous media. Among other things, these studies found that (i) in well-connected 3D networks, CPA predictions were inaccurate and became worse when heterogeneity was increased; and (ii) CPA could not fully explain the transport properties of 2D networks. To better understand the applicability of CPA to porous media, we made numerical computations of permeability and electrical conductivity on 2D and 3D networks with differing pore-size distributions and geometries. A new CPA model for the relationship between the permeability and electrical conductivity was found to be in good agreement with numerical data, and to be a significant improvement over a classical CPA model. In sufficiently disordered 3D networks, the new CPA prediction was within +/- 20% of the true value, and was nearly optimal in terms of minimizing the squared prediction errors across differing network configurations. The agreement of CPA predictions with 2D network computations was similarly good, although 2D networks are in general not well-suited for evaluating CPA. Numerical transport coefficients derived for regular 3D networks of slit-shaped pores were found to be in better agreement with experimental data from rock samples than were coefficients derived for networks of cylindrical pores.

AB Sao Miguel Island (Azores) has been affected by hundreds of destructive landslide episodes in the last five centuries, triggered either by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or rainfall episodes, which were responsible for many deaths and very important economic losses.
   Among the instability causes, meteorological factors are of primary importance on Povoacao County, namely the high recurrence rate of calamitous rainfall triggering landslides. The most recent catastrophic episode took place on the 31st October 1997 when almost 1000 soil slips and debris flows were triggered, and 29 people died in the Ribeira Quente village.
   The role of rainfall on regional landslide activity was analysed applying cumulative rainfall methods. The method comprises the reconstruction of both absolute and calibrated antecedent rainfalls associated with each major landslide event. The critical rainfall combination (amount-duration) responsible for each landslide event was assessed and a rainfall critical threshold for landslide occurrence was calculated. Rainfall-triggered landslides in the study area are ruled by the function I=144.06 D (- 0.5551), and they are related both to short duration precipitation events (1 - 3 days) with high average intensity (between 78 and 144 mm/day) and long-lasting rainfall episodes (1 - 5 months) with a lower intensity (between 9 and 22 mm/day).
   The impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the regional precipitation regime was evaluated. It is shown that the monthly precipitation of Sao Miguel is largely modulated by the NAO mode presenting a significant negative correlation with the NAO index. This result arises from the NAO control on the travelling latitude of most storm tracks that cross the Northern Atlantic Ocean. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Least marginal environmental impact rule for reservoir development
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB The needs of reservoirs grow with population, standard of living, urbanization in the form of water supply, flood control, hydroelectric generation, navigation, recreation etc. Their development inevitably involves a substantial degree of environmental impact. The impact of reservoirs, on an average, increases in an exponential way with their size. If the marginal net benefit were assessed at the margin of the capacity, many giant reservoirs for primarily hydroelectric purpose would not be justified when the negative environmental impacts are counted. The reservoir size should not exceed the size whose marginal negative environmental impact becomes more than that of any alternative means elsewhere that can provide the same level of incremental gain in the global objectives. This is called the least marginal environmental impact rule. In order to make such a rule operational, many alternative means should be made available that can be sought along a holistic approach to water problems, that is, integrated water resources management, where a reservoir is only one of many options to be chosen.

AB The sorptivity S quantifies the effect of capillarity on liquid movement in a porous material. For liquid infiltration into an initially dry material, S is a parameter that is contingent on both liquid and material properties as well as the maximum liquid content behind the infiltrating front, 0,. Scaling analyses are used to derive a dimensionless, intrinsic sorptivity S* that is constant for different liquids, Miller-similar materials and different values of theta(m). The analyses confirm that S is dependent on beta(1/2), where beta = cos phi is a measure of the wettability of the liquid. They also indicate a power law relationship between S and S-e(av), the average liquid saturation behind the infiltrating front. Seventeen water and eleven Soltrol 220 horizontal infiltration experiments are reported in uniform, dry sand. Test results show that water is partially wetting in the sand. They also confirm that S alpha S-e(av)(d), where d = 3.2 for the experimental conditions. The usefulness of a general, dimensionless Boltzmann variable is demonstrated to normalize infiltration profiles for the different liquids. An approximate method for sorptivity calculation is shown to provide an accurate estimate of S*. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WATER STORAGE; GROUNDWATER; PERMEABILITY; DEPTH
AB Estimation of hydraulic properties in the field is usually small-scale and not cost-effective. This paper proposes an innovative method for estimating hydraulic diffusivity at regional scale. Monthly groundwater storage change over the period from 2003 to 2013 is first estimated from GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS). Assuming that the aquifer system is unconfined and the hydraulic properties are uniform in a geographical cell, the water balance principle and Darcy's law are used to establish a relation between groundwater storage and hydraulic diffusivity. The value of hydraulic diffusivity is then adjusted using the generalized least squares and linear correlation method. This GRACE-derived hydraulic diffusivity estimation method, or GHDE method for short, is first verified with a hypothetical case and then applied in the Beishan area with available field-measured hydraulic conductivity data. The hypothetical case study demonstrates that the method works perfectly if the TWS data are error free. The Beishan case study illustrates that the estimated hydraulic diffusivities using the GHDE method correlate reasonably well with field test results, suggesting that this method is applicable. The accuracy of this method is constrained by the resolution of the GRACE-derived TWS data and is most suitable for very large scale groundwater problems due to the current accuracy of the GRACE data.

AB Conventionally, soil moisture dynamics are mathematically modeled by the Richardson-Richards equation, whose derivation is based on the conservation of mass and the Buckingham-Darcy law. However, it is complicated and even impossible to finish such rigorous derivations based on physical principles due to the complexity and uncertainties in the vadose zone. In this work, we propose a data-driven sparse regression framework. For the first time, we discover the time-dependent nonlinear soil moisture flow equation from only volumetric water content observations. The framework leverages linear approximations and group sparsity techniques. Except for a few assumptions, it requires no prior information, including a specific constitutive relationship model, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Several numerical experiments are tested to demonstrate that the framework successfully discovers the underlying soil moisture flow equation from data and tends to discover the parsimonious equation governed by dominant physical processes. Besides, the identified nonlinear coefficients, which represent soil hydraulic properties, fit well with the actual coefficients, although they deviate slightly at near-saturated ends. The results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework under various scenarios. Despite being based on a homogeneous soil assumption, this study provides a new perspective for deriving soil moisture flow governing equations.

AB Since the early 1980s the southeastern part of Turkey has experienced major land use changes because of increasing irrigation. To determine the influence of large-scale irrigation on surface hydrologic fluxes, we investigated feedback mechanisms between the land surface and atmosphere within the framework of Bouchet's complementary relationship between potential and actual evapotranspiration. Using 23 years of meteorological observations of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiation within the advection-aridity model (which is built on the complementary theory), we found that potential evaporation has decreased over 50%, from about 14 mm d(-1) to about 7 mm d(-1), paralleling the increase in irrigated acreage over the same period. Pan evaporation data show a similar trend. The observed decline in potential evaporation is a direct result of decreases in wind speed and, to a lesser degree, increases in humidity. A comparison between reference values of evapotranspiration obtained from irrigation water use and evapotranspiration estimates from the advection-aridity method show a reasonable correlation (root-mean-square error=1.1 mm d(-1)), especially for large values of both variables. These results suggest that the rapid expansion of irrigation in southeastern Turkey has strongly modified the lower atmosphere in a way that appears consistent with Bouchet's complementary theory.

DT Article
AB The Operation Sources of the WWF (Worldwide Fund for Wildlife) in Belgium is an environmental educational campaign focused on the groundwater quality. It involves pupils in the fifth and sixth grades of primary school in Belgium. Since 1994, several hundred analyses of nitrate have been carried out using colorimetric test strips at numerous springs and wells throughout Belgium. At the end of each campaign, the point sources of water surveyed were recorded on a map of Belgium, using different colours to indicate their range of nitrate concentration. The educational objective having been fulfilled, in order to validate these maps it was necessary to verify for each visited point source the relationship between its actual nitrate concentration (mg l(-1)) and its colour on the map. To this end, verification was carried out on 308 point sources chosen at random from those tested. The statistical analysis shows that the relationship between the results of the colorimetric in situ tests and corresponding laboratory control checks is highly significant. This result warrants further investigations, notably the use of regional information to qualify a poorly surveyed source point and also to check the temporal changes of the maps.

AB We evaluate the welfare consequences of the new U. S. arsenic standard for drinking water, using contingent valuation survey and recent cost data for the small rural community water systems in Minnesota that have had arsenic levels above the new standard prior to its implementation. Using variation in actual arsenic levels and an elicitation method that recognizes the dependence of welfare values on both ambient arsenic concentrations and self-protection levels, the welfare values of the new arsenic rule are estimated at $6-$23 per household per year for communities with less than 10 mu g/L of arsenic currently in their water and $31-$78 for communities with more than 10 mu g/L of arsenic. Given cost estimates of $230-$2,006 and the fact that a substantial portion of the cost needs to be internally financed, the new rule may have substantially negative welfare consequences for a number of small communities.

AB There exists an impressive body of experimental evidence confirming the existence of power law relationships between various rainfall related variables. Many of these variables (such as rain rate, radar reflectivity factor and kinetic energy flux density) have a direct relevance for hydrology and related disciplines (hydrometeorology, soil erosion). There is one fundamental property of rainfall which ties all these variables together, namely the raindrop size distribution. It is the purpose of this article to explain (1) that there exist two fundamentally different forms of the raindrop size distribution, (2) how various hydrologically relevant rainfall variables are related to both these forms, and (3) how the coefficients of power law relationships between such rainfall variables are determined by the parameters of these two forms of the raindrop size distribution. The classical exponential raindrop size distribution is used as an example of a family of raindrop size distributions. Three groups of rainfall related variables are considered, namely properties of individual raindrops (size, speed, volume, mass, momentum and kinetic energy), rainfall integral variables (raindrop concentration, raindrop arrival rate, liquid rainwater content, rain rate, rainfall pressure, rainfall power and radar reflectivity factor) and characteristic Sizes (median-volume diameter, volume-weighted mean diameter and mean-volume diameter). Six different consistent sets of power law relationships between these rainfall related variables and rain rate are presented, based on different assumptions regarding the rain rate dependence of the parameters of the raindrop size distribution.

AB Short-term weather forecasts have the potential to improve reservoir operations for both flood control and water supply objectives, especially in regions currently relying on fixed seasonal flood pools to mitigate risk. The successful development of forecast-based policies should integrate uncertainty from modern forecast products to create unambiguous rules that can be tested on out-of-sample periods. This study investigates the potential for such operating policies to improve water supply efficiency while maintaining flood protection, combining state-of-the-art weather hindcasts with downstream conjunctive use to transfer surplus flood releases to groundwater storage. Because available weather hindcasts are relatively short (10-20 years), we propose a novel statistical framework to develop synthetic forecasts over longer periods of the historical record. Operating rules are trained with a recently developed policy search framework in which decision rules are structured as binary trees. Policies are developed for a range of scenarios with varying forecast skill and conjunctive use capacity, using Folsom Reservoir, California, as a case study. Results suggest that the combination of conjunctive use and short-term weather forecasts can substantially improve both water supply and flood control objectives by allowing storage to remain high until forecasts trigger a release. Further, increased conjunctive use capacity reduces the importance of forecast skill, since surface storage can be moved to groundwater during the flood season without losing water supply. This analysis serves the development of forecast-based operating policies for large, multipurpose reservoirs in California and other regions with similar flood hydroclimatology.

TI On Hack's law
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID CHANNEL NETWORKS; RIVER NETWORKS; ENERGY; BASINS
AB Hack's law is reviewed, emphasizing its implications for the elongation of river basins as well as its connections with their fractal characteristics. The relation between Hack's law and the internal structure of river basins is investigated experimentally through digital elevation models. It is found that Hack's exponent, elongation, and some relevant fractal characters are closely related. The self-affine character of basin boundaries is shown to be connected to the power law decay of the probability of total contributing areas at any link and to Hack's law. An explanation for Hack's law is derived from scaling arguments. From the results we suggest that a statistical framework referring to the scaling invariance of the entire basin structure should be used in the interpretation of Hack's law.

AB Understanding whether a positive or negative correlation between actual (E) and potential (E-p) evaporation is of great importance in detecting changes of E from E-p. In this study, such correlation was evaluated via the linear regression slope (k) between E and E-p derived from a nonlinear complementary relationship model. k varies with the relative degree of variability in the radiation term (E-rad) and aerodynamic term (E-aero) of E-p, and is further affected by water availability. The sign of k is always positive under conditions with high E-rad variability but at the same time with low E-aero variability (commonly true on an hourly basis). Under conditions with high E-aero variability but at the same time with low E-rad variability, the sign of k tends to change from negative to positive with more readily water availability. On a daily or annual basis, the sign of k would be related with water availability. Under water-limited conditions, the E-aero variability is more significant than the E-rad variability, and negative k is expected. Under energy-limited conditions, the E-rad variability is compared to or even much obvious than the E-aero variability, and positive k is expected. This implies a negative correlation between E and E-p under water-limited conditions but a positive correlation under energy-limited conditions on the daily or annual basis. The above analysis is confirmed in a grassland site in Northeast China at daily and half-hourly time scales. The correlation between annual E and E-p over China was evaluated using data of 690 meteorological stations from 1956 to 2005. The k values change from negative in arid regions to positive in humid regions. According to k and the decreasing trends in annual E-p, it is deduced that E increased for most stations in arid regions but decreased for most stations in humid regions.

AB A procedure to identify sets of operational rules for gated spillways for optimal flood routing management of artificial reservoirs is proposed. The flood retention storage of a dam having a gated flood spillway is divided into 15 sub-storages whose surface elevations are identified as critical levels. The most suitable operation set for the downstream conditions and for the dam can be chosen from many derived operation sets. The spillway gates are operated in an optimum way for any floods from very small magnitudes to the probable maximum flood (PMF), without having to forecast the actual magnitude of the incoming flood hydrograph. Decision floods are formed by dividing the PMF into 15 sub-hydrographs by 5 and 10% increments in the ranges 5-50% and 50-100% of the PMF, respectively. Many potential spillway gate openings from closed to fully open are chosen initially. As a result of a series of routing simulations of 15 decision floods, a set of 15 gate openings is determined such that all floods from very small magnitudes to the PMF may be routed without overtopping the dam crest. Next, a few more 15-stage operation rules are determined such that the gate openings of the initial stages are decreased as their critical levels are increased stepwise, with the objective of attenuating smaller floods more effectively and releasing higher outflows for larger floods close to and including the PMF. The developed model is applied to the Catalan and Aslantas dams in Turkey, both of which serve for flood mitigation as well as hydropower generation.

   On propose une procedure pour identifier des ensembles de regles operationnelles de deversoirs a vannes pour la gestion du transfert des crues dans des reservoirs artificiels. Le volume de retention des crues d'un barrage ayant un evacuateur de crues a vannes est divise en 15 sous-stockages dont les niveaux sont identifies comme des niveaux critiques. L'ensemble de manOEuvres le plus approprie pour les conditions en aval et pour le barrage peut etre choisi parmi de nombreux jeux de manOEuvres possibles. Les vannes de l'evacuateur sont manOEuvrees de maniere optimale pour toute crue, allant d'une crue de tres petite amplitude a la crue maximale probable (CMP), sans avoir a prevoir l'ampleur reelle de l'hydrogramme de crue entrant. Les crues de decision sont produites en divisant la CMP en 15 sous-hydrogrammes par increments de 5 et 10% dans les gammes de 5-50% et 50-100% de la CMP, respectivement. De nombreuses ouvertures potentielles de vannes du deversoir, de la position fermee a completement ouverte, sont choisies au depart. Resultat d'une serie de simulations du transfert de 15 crues de decision, un ensemble de 15 ouvertures de vannes est determine, de telle sorte qu'elles puissent transferer toutes les crues, depuis les crues de tres petite amplitude a la CMP, sans debordement au-dessus de la crete du barrage. Ensuite, quelques regles de manOEuvre a 15 niveaux sont determinees de telle sorte que les ouvertures des vannes des premiers niveaux soient reduites a mesure que leurs niveaux critiques sont augmentes par palier, avec l'objectif d'attenuer plus efficacement les crues de moindre importance et de relacher des debits plus eleves pour les crues plus importantes, proches ou egales a la CMP. Le modele developpe est applique aux barrages Catalan et Aslantas en Turquie, les deux servant a l'ecretement des crues, ainsi qu'a la production d'hydroelectricite.

AB During the week of 9-15 September 2013, about 44 cm of rain fell across Boulder County, Colorado, USA, representing a very rare precipitation event. The resultant streamflows corresponded to an extreme event not seen since the historical flood of 1894. For the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (BcCZO), this event provided an opportunity to study the effect of extreme rainfall on solute concentration-discharge relationships and biogeochemical processes. We measured weathering-derived lithologic solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Si) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations at two sites on Boulder Creek during the recession of peak flow. We also isolated four distinct fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for chemical characterization. At the upper and lower sites, all solutes had their highest concentration at peak flow. At the upper site, which represented a mostly forested catchment, the concentrations of lithologic solutes decreased slightly during flood recession. In contrast, DOC and K concentrations decreased by a factor of three. At the lower site within the urban corridor, concentration of lithologic solutes decreased substantially for a few days before rebounding, whereas the DOC and K concentrations continued to decrease. Additionally, we found spatiotemporal trends in the chemical quality of DOM that were consistent with a limited reservoir of soluble organic matter in surficial soils becoming depleted and deeper layers of the Critical Zone contributing DOM during the flood recession. Overall, these results suggest that despite the extreme flood event, concentration-discharge relationships were similar to typical snowmelt periods in this Rocky Mountain region.

AB During the investigation of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), the low-resistivity anomalies in the detection profile have been widely considered to be caused by the hydrocarbon degradation by-products. However, these low-resistivity anomalies are a comprehensive reflection of the formation's electrical characteristics. In this study, we used ERT and geochemical methods to investigate a hydrocarbon-contaminated site that has been abandoned for more than 30 years. There are several obvious low resistivity anomalies in the site, which are related to hydrocarbon mineralization. Based on the law of Waxman and Smits, a petrophysical relationship formula suitable for this specific site was fitted, and the true resistivity after inversion was input into the formula to calculate the pore water resistivity. The electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water was isolated, and the distribution of the by-product plume was determined based on the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water. Based on mineralogical identification and geochemical data analysis, the biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon mineralization was clarified. The degradation by-products (Fe2+ and H+) are the controlling factors that lead to changes in the groundwater resistivity. Based on electrochemical experiments and titration analysis experiments, the quantitative relationship between the low resistivity anomalies of the pore water and the degradation by-products (Fe2+ and H+) was established, and the biodegradation model was used to calculate the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by-product plume. The results show that the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by-product plume determined from the ERT detection results in the selected study area is approximately 2.8% of the total hydrocarbon content. Although this is a rough estimate based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ERT detection results, it improves our understanding of the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites and provides convincing data to support future estimations of the site's natural attenuation time.

   Greece
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL

ID INDEX; PRECIPITATION; REGIONS
AB There is an escalation in the frequency and severity of extreme events due to a number of environmental and/or anthropogenic factors. Droughts and exceptionally wet periods are regional phenomena, which are considered as major environmental extremes, especially in semiarid regions of the world, such as Greece. The development of severity-duration-frequency (SDF) relationships of droughts and wet periods over Greece is important in contemporary hydroclimatic and agroclimatic design and planning in the country. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is used for a quantitative description of droughts and wet periods. Statistical tests and visual inspection indicate that the EV1 (Gumbel) frequency distribution fits satisfactorily all the identified durations of droughts and wet periods, respectively. Moreover, the SDF curves show that decreasing frequencies (i.e. increasing recurrence intervals) correspond to increasing severities of droughts and wet periods, respectively. The developed SDF relationships are used to produce tables and isoseverity maps of Greece for each identified duration and all the selected return periods or frequencies, which constitute an essential aid for design purposes. The results of the study indicate that there is a decreasing pattern of the severities of droughts and wet periods from west to east and that, for similar durations and return periods, the wet spells are, in general, more extreme than droughts in Greece.

AB MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a new generation remote sensing (RS) sensor and its applications in hydrology and water resources have attracted much attention. To overcome the problems of slow response in flood disaster monitoring based on traditional RS techniques in China, the Flood Disaster Monitoring and Assessing System (FDMAS), based on MODIS and a Geographic Information System (GIS), was designed and applied to Dongting Lake, Hunan Province, China. The storage curve of Dongting Lake for 1995 was obtained using 1:10 000 topographic map data and then a relationship between water level at the Chenglingji hydrological station and lake area was derived. A new relationship between water level and lake area was obtained by processing MODIS images of Dongting Lake from April 2002 to April 2003 and the influence of lake area variation on water level was analysed with the 1996 flood data. It was found that the water level reduction reached 0.64 m for the 1996 flood if the original lake area curve was replaced with the area curve of 2002. This illustrates that the flood water level has been considerably reduced as a result of the increased area of Dongting Lake since the Chinese Central Government's "return land to lake" policy took effect in 1998.

AB In the Central Andes of Argentina (30-37 degrees S), snowmelt is the main source of freshwater, an essential natural resource for similar to 2.2 million people in the adjacent arid lowlands. In this region, Laguna Llancanelo collects the water inputs from the Malargue endorheic basin. Previous studies concerning the annual and intra-annual variations of this lagoon and its relationship with regional climate are rare. We obtained a monthly record for the Laguna Llancanelo area (LLA, 1984-2013) using the modified normalized difference water index derived from Landsat images. Monthly LLA ranges between 35 km(2) and 411km(2) and is significantly related to variations of the Rio Malargue, the main snow-fed tributary to the lagoon. There is no long-term relationship between LLA and local rainfall, but rapid increases in LLA result from heavy rainfall around the lagoon. Conversely, rapid reductions in LLA encompass periods with both reduced discharge from the Rio Malargue and low local rainfall. The LLA integrates moisture of both Pacific (snowfall in the upper Andes) and Atlantic (lowland rainfall) origins; therefore, we propose using LLA as an indicator of regional water balance.

AB Decision-making in reservoir operation has become easy and understandable with the use of fuzzy logic models, which represent the knowledge in terms of interpretable linguistic rules. However, the improvement in interpretability with increase in number of fuzzy sets ('low', 'high', etc) comes with the disadvantage of increase in number of rules that are difficult to comprehend by decision makers. In this study, a clustering-based novel approach is suggested to provide the operators with a limited number of most meaningful operating rules. A single triangular fuzzy set is adopted for different variables in each cluster, which are fine-tuned with genetic algorithm (GA) to meet the desired objective. The results are compared with the multi fuzzy set fuzzy logic model through a case study in the Pilavakkal reservoir system in Tamilnadu State, India. The results obtained are highly encouraging with a smaller set of rules representing the actual fuzzy logic system. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The effect of water content on NaCl transport in unsaturated porous media was investigated under steady state flow conditions for water contents ranging between full saturation and 15% by volume. The experiments were conducted in a 25 cm column packed with homogeneous sand. Results of the experiments indicate that solute transport in unsaturated porous media is subject to greater velocity variations and slower solute mixing than one in saturated media. As a result, NaCl breakthrough curves (BTCs) show earlier initial arrival and greater tailing and variance as the average water content decreases. These results suggest that transport processes in our experiments have not fully developed to the Fickian regime at lower water contents. Because the classical convection-dispersion equation does not adequately describe the movement of solutes under the pre-Fickian regime, a mobile-immobile model was employed to reproduce the BTCs obtained under unsaturated conditions. In general, the results indicate that at lower water contents the medium has a greater fraction of immobile water, higher dispersion, and slower mass transfer between the mobile and immobile regions. A power law relationship between dispersion and water content-normalized velocities was found to exist for our experiments and other experiments reported in the literature using different porous media. Thus we suggest dispersivity is not only a function of properties of the media but also of water content.

AB Network flow models were used to simulate the flow of CO2-saturated brine in the pore networks corresponding to three different sandstones. The simulations were used to study upscaling of anorthite and kaolinite reaction rates from pore to core scales. Unique to our simulations is the use of computed tomography to capture the mineral distribution in the samples as well as the sample pore network. The upscaled reaction rates determined from these simulations incorporate mass balance principles and microscale reaction rate laws and capture the physical, mineral, and flow heterogeneities in the network. These upscaled rates were compared with upscaled rates predicted by a continuum model and by a volume-averaged-concentration method. For the anorthite reaction, which remains far from equilibrium, the volume-averaged reaction rate exceeded the reaction rate of the network model by 18% to 46%. While the continuum model rate also exceeded the network model rate by -1% to 53%, its predicted values were generally better than the volume-averaged method. The kaolinite reaction is near equilibrium and is heavily influenced by the form of the microscale rate law in the precipitation regime. Three alternate rate laws were tested, which produced significantly different predictions for the bulk reaction rates. For all three rate laws, continuum and volume-averaged reaction rates incorrectly predicted the magnitude of the kaolinite reaction rate (disagreements of -700% to 55%), and the predicted reaction type, dissolution versus precipitation, was also often opposite to that of the network model. Finally, for both anorthite and kaolinite, all upscaled reaction rates showed significant flow rate dependence.

AB In this article, an open channel flow resistance equation, deduced applying dimensional analysis and incomplete self-similarity condition for the flow velocity distribution, was tested using measurements carried out in a full-scale channel equipped with three types of riparian plants (Salix alba L., Salix caprea L. and Alnus glutinosa L.). In the experimental channel, having banks lined with boulders, the vegetation branches were anchored in a concrete bottom. For each species, the measurements were carried out with plants having different amounts of leaves, different plant density and plant area index. The relationship between the scale factor Gamma of the velocity profile and the Froude number was separately calibrated by measurements carried out without and with vegetation. The component of Darcy-Weisbach friction factor corresponding to the riparian vegetation f(v) was calculated as the difference between the measured friction factor value (channel grain roughness + vegetation) and that calculated for the channel without vegetation in the same hydraulic conditions. Using these f(v) values, the relationship between the scale factor Gamma and the Froude number was calibrated. In this last relationship, a scaling coefficient a varying with the investigated vegetation type was introduced. This coefficient, as expected, gives the highest friction factor values for vegetation having branches with leaves. The theoretical flow resistance law, coupled with the relationship for estimating the Gamma function having a scaling coefficient different for each investigated vegetation type, allowed an accurate estimate of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (errors less than or equal to 20% for 82.6% of the investigated cases). Finally, for the investigated vegetation species that are characterized by a condition with few leaves or leafless, the scaling coefficient a resulted strongly related to the bending stiffness. This analysis demonstrated that the highest Darcy-Weisbach friction factors correspond to vegetation species characterized by the highest values of bending stiffness. The friction factor values calculated for this last condition are characterized by errors that were less than or equal to +/- 20% for 90.6% of cases.

TI Optimal reservoir operation considering the water quality issues: A
   stochastic conflict resolution approach
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB [ 1] In this study, an algorithm combining a water quality simulation model and a deterministic/stochastic conflict resolution technique is developed for determining optimal reservoir operating rules. As different decision makers and stakeholders are involved in reservoir operation, the Nash bargaining theory is used to resolve the existing conflict of interests. The utility functions of the proposed models are developed on the basis of the reliability of the water supply to downstream demands, water storage, and the quality of the withdrawn water. The expected value on the Nash product is considered as the objective function of the stochastic model, which can incorporate the inherent uncertainty of reservoir inflow. A water quality simulation model is also developed to simulate the thermal stratification cycle and the reservoir discharge quality through a selective withdrawal structure. The optimization models are solved using a new version of genetic algorithms called varying chromosome length genetic algorithm (VLGA). In this algorithm the chromosome length is sequentially increased to provide a good initial solution for the final traditional GA-based optimization model. The proposed stochastic optimization model can also reduce the computational burden of the previously proposed models such as stochastic dynamic programming ( SDP) by reducing the number of state transitions in each stage. The proposed models which are called VLGAQ and SVLGAQ are applied to the 15-Khordad Reservoir in the central part of Iran. The results show that the proposed models can reduce the salinity of allocated water to different water demands as well as the salinity buildup in the reservoir.

AB Direct measurement of discharge in a stream is not only difficult and time consuming but also expensive. Therefore, the discharge in a stream is related to the stage through a number of carefully measured discharge values. A relationship between stages and corresponding measured discharges is usually derived using various graphical and analytical methods. As the relationship between stages and measured discharges is not linear, conventional methods based on least squares regression analysis for fitting a relationship are unable to model the non-linearity in the relationship and spatially in the cases when hysteresis is present in the data. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy inference system for modeling stage-discharge relationships and the investigations are illustrated by application of the model to observed gauge and discharges of various gauging stations in Narmada river system, India. A step by step procedure for developing TS fuzzy model is also presented. The results show that the TS fuzzy modeling approach is superior than the conventional and artificial neural network (ANN) based approaches. Comparison of the models on hypothetical data set also reveals that the fuzzy logic based approach is also able to model the hysteresis effect (loop rating curve) more accurately than the ANN approach.

AB Intermittent rivers are prevalent in many countries across Europe, but little is known about the temporal evolution of intermittence and its relationship with climate variability. Trend analysis of the annual and seasonal number of zero-flow days, the maximum duration of dry spells and the mean date of the zero-flow events is performed on a database of 452 rivers with varying degrees of intermittence between 1970 and 2010. The relationships between flow intermittence and climate are investigated using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and climate indices describing large-scale atmospheric circulation. The results indicate a strong spatial variability of the seasonal patterns of intermittence and the annual and seasonal number of zero-flow days, highlighting the controls exerted by local catchment properties. Most of the detected trends indicate an increasing number of zero-flow days, which also tend to occur earlier in the year, particularly in southern Europe. The SPEI is found to be strongly related to the annual and seasonal zero-flow day occurrence in more than half of the stations for different accumulation times between 12 and 24 months. Conversely, there is a weaker dependence of river intermittence with large-scale circulation indices. Overall, these results suggest increased water stress in intermittent rivers that may affect their biota and biochemistry and also reduce available water resources.

AB In radar hydrology the relationship between the reflectivity factor (Z) and the rainfall intensity (R) is generally assumed to follow a power law of which the parameters change both in space and time and depend on the drop size distribution (DSD). Based on disdrometer data, this study tries to improve our understanding of the temporal variability of the power-law relationship between Z and R using a scaling-law formalism for the raindrop size distribution proposed in previous contributions. In particular, this study focuses on the inter-event variability of Z-R coefficients and associated DSD-parameters and their relationship to the type of precipitation. This is crucial for developing improved quantitative precipitation estimation algorithms for extreme, flash flood triggering rainfall.
   Within the DSD scaling-law framework a new normalized parameter estimation method is presented, which calculates significantly faster than the original method and leads to bulk event estimates of the DSD-parameters and associated Z-R coefficients. Based on a 2.5-year disdrometer dataset collected in the Cevennes-Vivarais region in the south of France, comprising a total of 70 events, it is shown that the quality of the resulting Z-R relationships obtained by the new method compares well to two standard least-squares fitting techniques. A major benefit of the new implementation, as compared to such purely statistical methods, is that it also provides information concerning the properties of the DSD.
   For each of the 70 events this study also estimates the convective activity based on a threshold technique. Results show that convective events generally tend to have smaller Z-R exponents, which is assumed to result from an increased amount of drop interaction. For stratiform events, a much larger range in exponents is obtained, which is thought to depend on differences in meteorological origin (snow vs. ice). For the types of precipitation events observed in the Cevennes region, for a given value of the exponent, the prefactor of the Z-R relation tends to be larger for the more convective type of events. This emphasizes the different meteorological origin of the heavy rainfall observed in the south of France as compared to other regions of the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Because of the possibility of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, the predictive performance of a complex systems model is not by itself a reliable indicator of hypothesis quality for the purposes of scientific learning about processes. The predictive performance of a structurally adequate model should be an emergent property of its functional performance. In this context, any Pareto trade-off between measures of predictive performance versus functional performance indicates process-level error in the model; this trade-off, if it exists, indicates that the model's predictions are right for the wrong functional reasons. This paper demonstrates a novel concept based on information theory that is capable of attributing observed errors to specific processes. To demonstrate that the concept and method hold true for models and observations of real systems, we employ a minimal single-parameter-variation sensitivity analysis using a sophisticated ecohydrology model, MLCan, for a well-monitored field site (Bondville IL Ameriflux Soybean). We identify both functional and predictive error in MLCan, and also evidence of the hypothesized tradeoffs between the two. This trade-off indicates structural error within MLCan. For example, the sensible heat flux process can be calibrated to achieve good predictive performance at the cost of poor functional performance. In contrast, we find little structural error for processes driven by solar radiation, which appear "right for the right reasons." This method could be applied broadly to pinpoint process error and structural error in a wide range of system models, beyond the ecohydrological scope demonstrated here.

AB We have developed a new approach for generating pore throat cross sections of various shapes based on distributions of shape factors and radii of inscribed circles. These distributions are obtained from analysis of grains packing. General formulas for calculating geometrical properties and entry capillary pressure for given shape factor and inscribed circle radius are developed. These relationships are employed in a pore network, which has a number of special features. In particular, it is highly flexible in terms of location of pore bodies, variable coordination number, as well as variable cross-sectional shapes. The pore network model is employed for simulating the equilibrium distribution of two fluids in a granular porous medium, under both drainage and imbibition conditions. The pore network model is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental data of quasi-static drainage and imbibition experiments in a glass bead medium. The pore-level topology and geometrical description of pore bodies and pore throats, essential for building the network, are rigorously extracted from experimental data using image analysis (3DMA-Rock software). Calculated capillary pressure-saturation (P-c - S-w) and specific interfacial area-saturation (a(nw) - S-w) curves show very good agreement with measured ones, for both drainage and imbibition. We show that the shape factor can significantly influence the form of macroscopic P-c - S-w and a(nw) - S-w curves, if the length and volumes associated to the pore throats are considerable. Furthermore, using continuous generation of shape factor distribution, the model can be validated against the grain size distribution. After validating the model against experiments, in addition to primary and main curves, we simulate many scanning curves to generate P-c - S-w - a(nw) surfaces for drainage and imbibition, separately. Results show that these two surfaces lie very close to each other, and the average normalized difference is small, in the range of simulations uncertainty. Our results illustrate that P-c - S-w - a(nw) surfaces show very little hysteresis and, therefore, specific interfacial area can be considered as an essential variable for reducing or eliminating the hysteresis observed in P-c - S-w curves.

AB A basic equation governing the steady-state flow around a single crack in an infinite porous body is given. The flow through the crack obeys to the Poiseuille's law and the matrix has an anisotropic permeability. A semi-analytical solution is established for this equation in the case of elliptical disc-shaped crack. This solution takes a closed-form expression for the case of superconducting circular cracks. The results are compared to those obtained for flattened ellipsoidal inclusions obeying to the Darcy's flow law, which are in some works supposed to represent the cracks. It is shown that the flow solution for an elliptical disc-shaped crack obeying the Poiseuille's law is different from that obtained as the limiting case of flattened ellipsoidal inclusions. The results are then used to establish dilute Mori-Tanaka and self-consistent estimates of the effective permeability of porous media containing Poiseuille's type elliptical cracks.

ID PRECIPITATION; MOMENTS; CURVES
AB Extreme rainfall series (ERS) are treated as successive-duration events of from 5 min to 24 h in most parts of the world. In Turkey, as in European countries, the ERS of standard durations of 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min, and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 h are recorded, and these sample series are analysed to ultimately determine the depth-duration-frequency (DDF) relationships. If a probability distribution function (pdf) is used for these ERS, the frequency curves in the form of graphical quantile functions may intersect each other at high return periods, due to possible data recording errors, and an extreme rainfall magnitude of a longer duration may turn out to be smaller than that of a shorter duration beyond some high return period. In this study: (a) the criteria of divergence of the quantile functions of various pdfs used in frequency analyses of ERS are depicted; (b) necessary and sufficient conditions for divergence of the quantile functions and ultimately of the DDF curves are analytically deduced; (c) scaling relationships between conventional statistics and rainstorm durations, and between probability-weighted moments and rainstorm durations, are investigated; (d) necessary adjustments to the parameters of four commonly-used pdfs are shown; and (e) a comprehensive example using rainfall data recorded at the Florya gauging station (Istanbul, Turkey) is presented.

AB In arid and semi-arid areas, characterized by limited and often torrential rainfall, climatic factors play an essential role in explaining soil loss at the basin scale. Indeed, the largest share of solid materials export occurs during floods. The present study deals with the evaluation and quantification of sediment transport in the Wadi El Hammam basin, a large sub-basin of the Macta watershed characterized by strong rates of erosion. The sensitivity of rocks to erosion, the intensity of rainfall, and the human-induced alterations to the flow regime explain why the flux of suspended solids (SS) transported by the Wadi El Hammam may reach very high values. The sediment budget related to the of rainfall-runoff-sediment transport process shows good relationships, especially between the equivalent discharge (Q) and the quantity of sediment transported (C). Statistical models to reproduce SS flux are presented. After calibration and validation of models at the measured time scales, they are used to reconstruct time series of SS flux estimated from historical data of water discharge and rainfall., The relationship C-Q was modelled at the flood scale and adjusted by a power function Y = aX(b); statistical analysis of the constant a and exponent b was used to explain the behaviour of these two parameters and lead to a better understanding of the practical and theoretical aspects of the processes at work in the watershed.

AB [1] Methods for obtaining estimates of seepage into drifts and tunnels excavated in unsaturated fractured rocks are of interest for engineering and environmental applications. For uniform porous media a tunnel surface may present a capillary barrier promoting water diversion around the opening through the porous matrix, hence reducing seepage into the opening. The presence of fractures intersecting the opening complicates flow behavior and presents a challenge to seepage prediction. We present a simple and physically based model for seepage estimation that preserves key physical processes associated with fracture flow, while avoiding complexity of detailed fracture network characterization. The processes of film and capillary-driven flows are combined with a geometrically tractable representation of the dual-continuum fractured rock with two disparate populations of matrix pores and fracture apertures. The large disparity in capillary forces between matrix and fractures rules out matrix seepage based on Philip's theory. We obtain estimates of seepage fraction for a given percolation flux from consideration of the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture domain only. Similar to previous studies, the new model shows existence of a percolation threshold for onset of seepage. The new model also exhibits a steep increase in seepage with increase in percolation flux that reflects the role of fracture film flow. In addition to consideration of physically based flow processes, computations for the proposed analytical model can be performed with common spreadsheet software, which is a distinct advantage over numerical equivalent porous media approaches that require a powerful computational environment, excessive computation time, and thorough characterization of the fracture domain.

TI Assessing local planning to control groundwater depletion: California as
   a microcosm of global issues
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Groundwater pumping has caused excessive groundwater depletion around the world, yet regulating pumping remains a profound challenge. California uses more groundwater than any other U. S. state, and serves as a microcosm of the adverse effects of pumping felt worldwide-land subsidence, impaired water quality, and damaged ecosystems, all against the looming threat of climate change. The state largely entrusts the control of depletion to the local level. This study uses internationally accepted water resources planning theories systematically to investigate three key aspects of controlling groundwater depletion in California, with an emphasis on local-level action: (a) making decisions and engaging stakeholders; (b) monitoring groundwater; and (c) using mandatory, fee-based and voluntary approaches to control groundwater depletion (e. g., pumping restrictions, pumping fees, and education about water conservation, respectively). The methodology used is the social science-derived technique of content analysis, which involves using a coding scheme to record these three elements in local rules and plans, and State legislation, then analyzing patterns and trends. The study finds that Californian local groundwater managers rarely use, or plan to use, mandatory and fee-based measures to control groundwater depletion. Most use only voluntary approaches or infrastructure to attempt to reduce depletion, regardless of whether they have more severe groundwater problems, or problems which are more likely to have irreversible adverse effects. The study suggests legal reforms to the local groundwater planning system, drawing upon its empirical findings. Considering the content of these recommendations may also benefit other jurisdictions that use a local groundwater management planning paradigm.

AB Hydrological drought evolution (development and recovery) is directly related to the amount of precipitation transformed into effective streamflow. However, how hydrological drought alters the precipitation-streamflow relationship, and how the precipitation-streamflow relationship affects the hydrological drought development and recovery require more in-depth research. We present a detailed assessment of the effects of hydrological drought propagation on the precipitation-streamflow relationship. We propose the concept of effective streamflow-precipitation ratio (ESPR), which is defined as the amount of precipitation in the current month that is converted to effective streamflow relative to that of the previous month, for hydrological drought propagation assessment. Long-term unregulated streamflow and precipitation data from six hydrometric stations in different countries (China, USA, and Australia) were used to investigate the proposed concept. The results show that hydrological drought causes a significant decrease in the precipitation-streamflow correlation and coefficient of determination. However, the changes in the precipitation-streamflow relationship are substantially different during the hydrological drought development and recovery stages. In our study areas, the precipitationstreamflow relationship was weakened by 60%, mainly during the hydrological drought development rather than recovery. The ESPR values during the hydrological drought development are substantially lower than those of the recovery period, suggesting insufficient precipitation leads to little to no streamflow especially during the drought development period. Additionally, the larger the ESPR during hydrological drought evolution, the faster the hydrological drought recovery will occur and vice versa. This study provides insights into the drivers of hydrological drought evolution by connecting with the changes in precipitation-streamflow relationship.

AB Meteorological drought is the fuse of hydrological drought, and understanding the propagation mechanisms from meteorological to hydrological drought is of great significance to the monitoring and prevention of hydrological drought. Besides the linear dependence, this study thoroughly investigated the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought by introducing the nonlinear dependence with directed information transfer index (DITI) for the first time. In this study, the standardized precipitation index and the standardized runoff index were used to represent meteorological drought and hydrological drought, respectively. A new drought response time (DRT) evaluation system was constructed based on the maximum Pearson correlation coefficient and DITI, simultaneously considering the linear and nonlinear relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought. Moreover, the relationships of drought characteristics (duration and severity) between these two types of drought were established by using run theory and mathematical function, and the trigger thresholds from meteorological to hydrological drought were then determined. The results indicate that: (a) the effective drought propagation rate was mainly affected by the characteristics of meteorological drought events and the sensitivity of hydrological drought to meteorological drought; (b) the DRT in the Pearl River Basin (PRB) was mainly concentrated in 2-5 months, and the drought translation rate in the PRB was relatively large; and (c) the duration of hydrological drought events was longer in the sub-regions with smaller meteorological drought trigger thresholds.

TI Empirical comparison of various methods for training feed-forward neural
   networks for salinity forecasting
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID LEARNING RATE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; PARAMETERS
AB Feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) are being used increasingly to model water resources variables. In this technical note, six methods for optimizing the connection weights of feedforward ANNs are investigated in terms of generalization ability, parsimony, and training speed. These include the generalized delta (GD) rule, the normalized cumulative delta (NCD) rule, the delta-bar-delta (DBD) algorithm, the extended-delta-bar-delta (EDBD) algorithm, the QuickProp (QP) algorithm, and the MaxProp (MP) algorithm. Each of these algorithms is applied to a particular case study, the forecasting of salinity in the River Murray at Murray Bridge, South Australia. Thirty models are developed for each algorithm, starting from different positions in weight space. The results obtained indicate that the generalization ability of the first-order methods investigated (i.e., GD, NCD, DBD, and EDBD) is better than that of the second-order algorithms (i.e., QP and MP). When the prediction errors are averaged over the 30 trials carried out, the performance of the first-order methods in which the size of the steps taken in weight space is automatically adjusted in response to changes in the error surface (i.e., DBD and EDBD) is better than that obtained when predetermined step sizes are used (i.e., GD and NCD). However, the reverse applies when the best forecasts of the 30 trials are considered. The results obtained indicate that the EDBD algorithm is the most parsimonious and the MP algorithm is the least parsimonious. It was found that any impact different learning rules have on training speed is masked by the effect of epoch size and the number of hidden nodes required for optimal model performance.

AB The aim of this study is to examine whether the climatic driving forces can describe the observed variability in the frequency of flooding over the central United States. Results are based on daily streamflow records from 774 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stations with at least 50 years of data and ending no earlier than 2011. Five climate indices related to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are used in this study: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA). A peak-over-threshold approach is used to identify flood peaks, and the relationship between the frequency of flood events and climate indices is investigated using Poisson regression.
   The results of this work indicate that climate variability can play a significant role in explaining the variations in the frequency of flooding over the central United States. Different climate modes are related to the frequency of flood events over different parts of the domain and for different seasons, with PNA playing an overall dominant role. Analyses related to flood events are extended to examine climate controls on heavy precipitation over the same area. We find that the variability of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can influence the frequency of heavy precipitation days in a manner similar to what was found for flooding. Therefore, these results suggest that the recent observed variability in the frequency of flood events and heavy precipitation over the central United States can be largely attributed to the variability in the climate system.

   ENERGY-BALANCE; WATER; EQUATIONS; TRENDS
AB In response to a decline in pan evaporation over the last 60 years under global warming of water bodies, we designed an experiment with water bodies heated naturally to different temperatures to investigate the physics of pan evaporation and explore the effect of water temperature. In this study, we developed a new aerodynamic model for pan evaporation by combining a free convention sub-model that couples Fick's First Law of Diffusion with boundary layer theory and a forced convection sub-model based on convection mass transfer. Both the improved aerodynamic model and the two sub-models have a higher accuracy and stability (|PBIAS| < 6%, root mean squared Error [RMSE] < 0.65 mm d(-1), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] > 0.8). Sensitivity analysis shows that water temperature is the most sensitive parameter to evaporation (S-1 = 0.58, S-T = 0.78). The mechanism of rising water temperature on evaporation is not only due to the strengthening in mass diffusion (under windless conditions), but also in the promotion in mass convection (under windy conditions). The integrated effects of mass diffusion and mass convection could result in an increase in evaporation of 0.8 mm d(-1), as mean water temperature rises by 1 degrees C. These results would be useful for evaporation estimation of the warming global water.

ID SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; DETACHMENT; FLOW
AB A new stochastic method of detachment rate estimation was used in erosion modelling. This method was based on calculating the probability of driving forces exceeding resistance forces in the interaction of oscillating flow and structured soil. Knowledge of the probability density functions for flow velocity, soil cohesion, aggregate size and soil integrity makes it possible to calculate theoretically the erosion rate of cohesive soil for any combination of these stochastic variables. The proposed theory explains the variability in relationships between rate of detachment and flow velocity. With flow velocity, detachment rate increases more rapidly for more integrated soil with higher cohesion and larger aggregates. This theory also shows the great difference between soil erosion type for relatively high and relatively low flow velocities, and explains rather high errors, even with detailed models, in the calculation of low soil erosion rate.

AB This study aimed to assess the long term variability of the rainfall and streamflow in Thuchila river, southern Malawi, from 1985 to 2016. Trends of monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall and streamflow of Thuchila river were analyzed using Mann-Kendall and Pettit tests at a 5% significance level. The annual, wet, and dry season rainfall in the catchment revealed a statistically non-significant decreasing trend. The monthly rainfall showed statistically non-significant decreasing trends except for April, June, and October. The annual and dry season streamflow exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend, whereas the wet season revealed a non-significant increasing trend. Sen's slope results were all in agreement with the Mann-Kendall findings. The Pettit test detected different change points for both rainfall and streamflow in the catchment. The dominant change points of decreasing trends appeared between 2005 and 2007. During this period, the country experienced extreme weather events that affected the rainfall pattern. Pearson correlation coefficient was also employed to understand the relationship between rainfall and streamflow. The correlation analysis of the monthly, annual, and seasonal levels showed a linear relationship between rainfall and streamflow in the catchment. The results revealed that the rainfall influenced the streamflow changes of Thuchila river. This vital information about the trends of the streamflow and rainfall in Thuchila catchment plays a crucial role in catchment management.

TI Hedging rule for reservoir operations: 2. A numerical model
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-SUPPLY OPERATIONS; RELIABILITY; DROUGHT; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION;
   PERFORMANCE; STORAGE
AB [1] Optimization models for reservoir operation analysis usually use a heuristic algorithm to search for the hedging rule. This paper presents a method that derives a hedging rule from theoretical analysis ( J.-Y. You and X. Cai, 2008) with an explicit two-period Markov hydrology model, a particular form of nonlinear utility function, and a given inflow probability distribution. The unique procedure is to embed hedging rule derivation based on the marginal utility principle into reservoir operation simulation. The simulation method embedded with the optimization principle for hedging rule derivation will avoid both the inaccuracy problem caused by trail and error with traditional simulation models and the computational difficulty ("curse of dimensionality'') with optimization models. Results show utility improvement with the hedging policy compared to the standard operation policy ( SOP), considering factors such as reservoir capacity, inflow level and uncertainty, price elasticity and discount rate. Following the theoretical analysis presented in the companion paper, the condition for hedging application, the starting water availability and ending water availability for hedging, is reexamined with the numerical example; the probabilistic performance of hedging and SOP regarding water supply reliability is compared; and some findings from the theoretical analysis are verified numerically.

TI Temporally Variable Stream Width and Surface Area Distributions in a

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DRAINAGE DENSITY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; RUNOFF; NETWORKS; GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Headwater stream networks expand and contract in response to event-driven and seasonal catchment wetness conditions. This dynamic behavior drives variability in the width, length, and surface area of streams, important parameters for constraining a range of ecological and biogeochemical processes, such as atmospheric gas exchange. While the longitudinal expansion and contraction of streams has been studied for some time, variability in stream widths remains poorly understood. Recent studies have found that stream widths at average baseflow conditions follow a log-normal frequency distribution across diverse physiographies. To examine how the distribution of widths varies with flow conditions, we surveyed stream widths 12 times across a 48.4-ha research watershed, located in the Duke Forest in central North Carolina, USA. Here, we show that as runoff increased from the 37th to 99th percentiles of flow, flowing streams widened across the network ("lateral expansion") and streamflow simultaneously extended upstream to reactivate dry channels ("longitudinal expansion"). In general, as runoff increased, the marginal increase in stream surface area was equally divided between longitudinal and lateral expansion. Even so, the median stream width widens on average with increasing runoff, suggesting that longitudinal and lateral expansion affect the distribution of stream width differently. We find that the form of the relationship between stream width and runoff is a power law, which can be used to refine models for surface area estimation.

AB Spectral multiscaling postulates a power-law type of scaling of spectral distribution functions of stationary processes of spatial averages or their temporal accumulations, over nested and geometrically similar sub-regions of the spatial parameter space of a given spatio-temporal random field. Presently, the validity of this property is investigated using time series of spatio-temporal accumulations of rain rate fields measured by a network of Doppler radars covering the region of Iowa. Statistical evidence of spectral multiscaling is gathered and discussed through a systematic study of appropriate regression diagnostics, using two records of data. One is a 120-month record of hourly (60-min) accumulations of spatially averaged rain rate on square pixels of side length 4 km, comprising a rectangular grid of dimension 80 x 160 covering almost the entire State of Iowa. The other is a 74-month record of quarterly (15-min) accumulations of spatially averaged rain rate on square pixels of side length 1 km, comprising a rectangular grid of dimension 68 x 106 over the Cedar River basin in eastern Iowa. The diagnostic results indicate frequency-dependent scaling relationships interpreted as evidence of spectral multiscaling across a range of spatial scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent revisions to the definition of the 'waters of the United States' (WOTUS) have considerably altered how wetlands are federally regulated under the Clean Water Act. The two most recent modifications to WOTUS, the Clean Water Rule (CWR) and the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), represent two opposing approaches to the federal wetland policy. The impacts of these two rules on the regulation of wetlands have as of yet been poorly characterized at broad spatial scales. Using New York State (NYS) as a case study, we evaluated the jurisdictional statuses of more than 253 000 wetlands under the CWR and the NWPR to assess the landscape-scale effects of WOTUS re-definitions. We found that statewide and within each of NYS's hydrologic regions, the NWPR protects fewer wetlands and less total wetland area than the CWR. The efficacy of the two regulations varied considerably in space across NYS, highlighting the need for comprehensive, nationwide assessments of wetland policy outcomes. We also observed that both rules produced non-uniform patterns in jurisdiction across a range of landscape positions and wetland sizes, preferentially protecting large wetlands close to the stream network. This effect was particularly pronounced under the NWPR, which excludes all geographically isolated wetlands from protection. Our findings in NYS emphasize the existence of unique patterns in protected wetlands across spatial scales, highlighting the value in applying geospatial analyses to evaluate environmental policy.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is applied to measure flow patterns in natural, water-saturated, rough-walled rock fractures. From three-dimensional water density and velocity vector images the fracture morphology and flow patterns are determined. The parabolic nature and asymmetry of the velocity;profiles, and thus the accuracy of local cubic law flow rate predictions, Vary greatly. This depends on the degree of wall roughness. Particularly complex flow patterns are found in one sample which contains a sharp fracture wall discontinuity. A power law for the flow rate versus aperture for the low-flow region was found without considering the hydraulic gradients.

AB This study develops configurational entropy theory (CET) for monthly streamflow forecasting. The theory is comprised of three main parts: (1) determination of spectral density (2) determination of parameters by cepstrum analysis, and (3) extension of autocorrelation function. Comparison with the Burg entropy theory (BET) shows that CET yields higher resolution spectral density with more accurate location of spectral peaks. Cepstrum analysis yields more accurate parameters than the Levinson algorithm in the autoregressive (AR) method and the Levinson-Burg algorithm in BET. CET is tested using monthly streamflow data from 19 river basins covering a broad range of physiographic characteristics. Testing shows that CET captures streamflow seasonality and satisfactorily forecasts both high and low flows. High flows are satisfactorily forecasted with the coefficient of determination (r(2)) higher than 0.92 for one year ahead of time, with r(2) higher than 0.85 for two years ahead of time, and up to 60 months ahead with r(2) higher than 0.80. However, low flows are forecasted with r(2) higher than 0.50 for one year ahead time. When relative drainage area is considered for analyzing streamflow characteristics and spectral patterns, it is found that upstream streamflow is forecasted more accurately (r(2) = 0.84) than downstream streamflow (r(2) = 0.75). Residuals of forecasted values relative to observed values are found to follow normal distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evaluation of a recession-based top-down model for distributed hourly runoff simulation in macroscale mountainous catchments is rare in the literature. We evaluated such a model for a 3090km(2) boreal catchment and its internal sub-catchments. The main research question is how the model performs when parameters are either estimated from streamflow recession or obtained by calibration. The model reproduced observed streamflow hydrographs (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency up to 0.83) and flow duration curves. Transferability of parameters to the sub-catchments validates the performance of the model, and indicates an opportunity for prediction in ungauged sites. However, the cases of parameter estimation and calibration excluding the effects of runoff routing underestimate peak flows. The lower end of the recession and the minimum length of recession segments included are the main sources of uncertainty for parameter estimation. Despite the small number of calibrated parameters, the model is susceptible to parameter uncertainty and identifiability problems.

AB This article reports the results of a field investigation aimed to characterize the morphology of both rills monitored at Sparacia experimental area and two ephemeral gullies (EGs) located in the Tremamargi basin, Sicily, Italy. At first, the available literature data together with the measurements carried out in this investigation were used to show that the EG length is a key parameter for the estimation of the eroded volume. Then, the comparison among the pairs length and volume corresponding to measured rills, EGs and gullies showed that the exponent of the power relationship is independent of the channelized erosion type (rill, EG and gully), while a different scale factor has to be used for each erosion process. Finally, a single relationship applicable to all channelized erosion processes was deduced applying the dimensional analysis and the self-similarity theory. Copyright.

AB We present a unified asymptotic theory of rainfall extremes including annual maxima, excesses above high thresholds, and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves that builds on previous findings and derive new nonasymptotic results. The analysis is based on stationary multifractal representations of rainfall and produces extensions of the familiar results from extreme value (EV) and extreme excess (EE) theories. The latter results apply to the T-yr maximum as T ->infinity and the excess above z as z ->infinity. By exploiting the scaling relationship among the distributions of rainfall intensity for different averaging durations d, the multifractal asymptotics include, in addition, results in the small-scale limits d -> 0 and (d -> 0, T proportional to d(-alpha) -> infinity) with alpha > 0. In all cases, the maximum distributions are of the generalized extreme value (GEV) type, but the index k depends on the limit considered. Multifractal models also produce asymptotic scaling results for the IDF curves. For the nonasymptotic case (d and T finite), we obtain accurate approximations of the IDF curves and derive a semitheoretical formula for the index k of the GEV model that best approximates the distribution of the annual maximum over a finite range of return-period intensities. The nonasymptotic analysis explains several observed deviations of rainfall extremes from the asymptotic predictions, such as the tendency of k to decrease as the averaging duration d increases and the tendency of the IDF curves to converge as d or the return period T increase.

AB Earth system models synthesize the science of interactions amongst multiple biophysical and, increasingly, human processes across a wide range of scales. Ecohydrologic models are a subset of earth system models that focus particularly on the complex interactions between ecosystem processes and the storage and flux of water. Ecohydrologic models often focus at scales where direct observations occur: plots, hillslopes, streams, and watersheds, as well as where land and resource management decisions are implemented. These models complement field-based and data-driven science by combining theory, empirical relationships derived from observation and new data to create virtual laboratories. Ecohydrologic models are tools that managers can use to ask "what if" questions and domain scientists can use to explore the implications of new theory or measurements. Recent decades have seen substantial advances in ecohydrologic models, building on both new domain science and advances in software engineering and data availability. The increasing sophistication of ecohydrologic models however, presents a barrier to their widespread use and credibility. Their complexity, often encoding 100s of relationships, means that they are effectively "black boxes," at least for most users, sometimes even to the teams of researchers that contribute to their design. This opacity complicates the interpretation of model results. For models to effectively advance our understanding of how plants and water interact, we must improve how we visualize not only model outputs, but also the underlying theories that are encoded within the models. In this paper, we outline a framework for increasing the usefulness of ecohydrologic models through better visualization. We outline four complementary approaches, ranging from simple best practices that leverage existing technologies, to ideas that would engage novel software engineering and cutting edge human-computer interface design. Our goal is to open the ecohydrologic model black box in ways that will engage multiple audiences, from novices to model developers, and support learning, new discovery, and environmental problem solving.

AB Around 2 million people in the Pacific depend on rainwater collection for their drinking water, however these systems often struggle to provide sufficient quantities of water year round. This study examined the performance of 1,878 rainwater tanks across 19 islands in Vanuatu to assess whether the likelihood of a sufficient year-round supply of drinking water differed between village-level rainwater tanks used communally and private rainwater tanks owned by individual households (i.e., self-supply). More than half of the tanks assessed failed to provide a sufficient supply of water year round. Compared with communal rainwater tanks, private rainwater tanks had significantly higher odds of a sufficient year-round supply of water (adjusted odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.24-2.09, p < 0.001). This relationship was evident when adjusting for village-level clustering, year of installation, presence of other improved water sources, tank volume, number of users, and a proxy indicator for rainfall. Private rainwater tanks outperformed communal rainwater tanks irrespective of whether communal tanks were managed by a community-based committee. The findings support the notion that in some circumstances private property rights can help avert resource depletion, and that household self-supply is capable of delivering a more reliable water supply than community-based management. However, the study design was unable to rule out differences in roof catchment area as a factor influencing the results. Further work is needed to confirm and elucidate the mechanisms by which private ownership facilitates a year-round supply and understand the wider advantages and disadvantages of self-supply.

AB High-frequency monitoring was conducted to quantify the frequency and controlling factors of preferential flow (PF) in a monsoon-influenced sub-humid mountainous catchment (6.48 km(2)) of Northern China. Rainfall was measured using nine bucket raingauges. Soil moisture probes were set up at 12 sites to observe the PF. Overall, 129 rainfall events were identified during the years 2014-2016. The average PF occurrence was 41%, which increased to 71% during heavy rainfall events (>20 mm) revealing a strong influence of the amount and intensity of rainfall. The study also revealed that the PF increased with antecedent soil moisture. Soil moisture was much higher on flat sites compared to sloping sites, providing evidence that the topography has a strong influence on rainfall infiltration and runoff which, subsequently, influence soil moisture variation and the occurrence of PF. Our findings provide valuable insights into the hydrological processes for studies in regions with similar environmental conditions.

AB This study proposes a new methodology for estimating the additional shear strength (or cohesion) exerted by vegetation roots on slope stability analysis within a coupled hydrological-stability model. The mechanical root cohesion is estimated within a Fiber Bundle Model framework that allows for the evaluation of the root strength as a function of stress-strain relationships of populations of fibers. The use of such model requires the knowledge of the root architecture. A branching topology model based on Leonardo's rule is developed, providing an estimation of the amount of roots and the distribution of diameters with depth. The proposed methodology has been implemented into an existing distributed hydrological-stability model able to simulate the dynamics of factor of safety as a function of soil moisture dynamics. The model also accounts for the hydrological effects of vegetation, which reduces soil water content via root water uptake, thus increasing the stability. The entire methodology has been tested in a synthetic hillslope with two configurations of vegetation type, i.e., trees and shrubs, which have been compared to a configuration without vegetation. The vegetation has been characterized using roots data of two mediterranean plant species. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the topological model in accurately reproducing the observed root structure of the analyzed species. For the environmental setting modeled, the effects of root uptake might be more significant than the mechanical reinforcement; the additional resistance depends strictly on the vegetation root depth. Finally, for the simulated climatic environment, landslides are seasonal, in agreement with past observations.

AB A one-dimensional steady-state model was constructed and used to Study vertical profiles of longitudinalvelocities in open channel flows through, and above, submerged vegetation. The eddy viscosity was evaluated by using the analogue of the mixing length theory. The model of water velocity profiles takes into account the surface roughness of the channel bottom and the drag exerted by submerged flexible sterns. The verification of the calculated velocity profiles was carried Out based on data obtained in laboratory experiments. The proportionality coefficients for the analogue of the mixing length formulae in both layers-within homogenous flexible sterns and above them-were determined.

AB The saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil, K-s, is a critical parameter in hydrological models that remains notoriously difficult to predict. In this study, we test the capability of a model based on percolation theory and critical path analysis to estimate K-s measured on 95 undisturbed soil cores collected from contrasting soil types. One parameter (the pore geometry factor) was derived by model fitting, while the remaining two parameters (the critical pore diameter, d(c), and the effective porosity) were derived from X-ray computed tomography measurements. The model gave a highly significant fit to the K-s measurements (p<0.0001) although only 47% of the variation was explained and the fitted pore geometry factor was approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than various theoretical values obtained for idealized porous media and pore network models. Apart from assumptions in the model that might not hold in reality, this could also be attributed to experimental error induced by, for example, air entrapment and changes in the soil pore structure occurring during sample presaturation and the measurement of K-s. Variation in the critical pore diameter, d(c), was the dominant source of variation in K-s, which suggests that d(c) is a suitable length scale for predicting soil permeability. Thus, from the point of view of pedotransfer functions, it could be worthwhile to direct future research toward exploring the correlations of d(c) with basic soil properties and site attributes.

AB A new equation for the collector efficiency (h) of the colloid filtration theory (CFT) is developed via nonlinear regression on the numerical data generated by a large number of Lagrangian simulations conducted in Happel's sphere-in-cell porous media model over a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions. The new equation expands the range of CFT's applicability in the natural subsurface primarily by accommodating departures from power law dependence of h on the Peclet and gravity numbers, a necessary but as of yet unavailable feature for applying CFT to large-scale field transport (e. g., of nanoparticles, radionuclides, or genetically modified organisms) under low groundwater velocity conditions. The new equation also departs from prior equations for colloids in the nanoparticle size range at all fluid velocities. These departures are particularly relevant to subsurface colloid and colloid-facilitated transport where low permeabilities and/or hydraulic gradients lead to low groundwater velocities and/or to nanoparticle fate and transport in porous media in general. We also note the importance of consistency in the conceptualization of particle flux through the single collector model on which most h equations are based for the purpose of attaining a mechanistic understanding of the transport and attachment steps of deposition. A lack of sufficient data for small particles and low velocities warrants further experiments to draw more definitive and comprehensive conclusions regarding the most significant discrepancies between the available equations.

AB Much of the nonlinearity and uncertainty regarding the flood process is because hydrologic data required for estimation are often tremendously difficult to obtain. This study employed a back-propagation network (BPN) as the main structure in flood forecasting to learn and to demonstrate the sophisticated nonlinear mapping relationship. However, a deterministic BPN model implies high uncertainty and poor consistency for verification work even when the learning performance is satisfactory for flood forecasting. Therefore, a novel procedure was proposed in this investigation which integrates linear transfer function (LTF) and self-organizing map (SOM) to efficiently determine the intervals of weights and biases of a flood forecasting neural network to avoid the above problems. A SOM network with classification ability was applied to the Solutions and parameters of the BPN model in the learning stage, to classify the network parameter rules and to obtain the winning parameters. The outcomes from the previous stage were then used as the ranges of the parameters in the recall stage. Finally, a case Study was carried Out in Wu-Shi basin to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The validity and applicability of various methods to infer hydraulic properties of sloping aquifers in alpine settings using the power law relationship between the discharge recession and its first time derivative is explored. For this purpose, a synthetic spring catchment implemented in the numerical groundwater flow model MODFLOW as well as the example of a relict rock glacier in an alpine setting is examined. The various approaches are found to differ particularly in the late time domain, whereas most of them agree fairly well in the early time domain and at the transition point between the two time domains. As the early recession may be affected by uncertainties from inappropriate initial conditions, it is proposed to use the transition point for estimating aquifer thickness and transmissivity. Using only prolonged winter recessions in the analysis of the field data from the relict rock glacier yields estimates of aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity consistent with results from a geophysical survey and tracer tests, respectively. In the other seasons, the recession is frequently interrupted by minor recharge events, and using the lower envelope of the entire data is found to yield estimates that are too high in the given case. It is thus recommended to focus on the winter recession in the analysis of hydrograph data from alpine settings.

TI An Approximate Model for Predicting the Specific Yield Under Periodic

AB Predicting specific yield for a given aquifer remains a great challenge due to its dynamic characteristics, especially under periodic (e.g., seasonal and diurnal) groundwater level fluctuations. In this study, a dimensionless period of groundwater level fluctuations, which depends on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, the length of the groundwater level fluctuation period, and the soil water retention properties, is first introduced. Then, the relationship between the predicted specific yield and the dimensionless period of groundwater level fluctuations is defined based on the theory of variably saturated flow. The proposed approximate formula is tested by series of simulations of variably saturated flow within homogeneous and isotropic porous media with the Hydrus-1D program. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate an invariant relationship between the predicted specific yield and the dimensionless period for a wide range of changes in the dimensionless period of groundwater level oscillations. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the dependence of the predicted specific yield on the van Genuchten parameters indicates the applicability of estimating the specific yield via van Genuchten parameters, which can be predicted by the soil texture classes for a given length of the oscillation period and a known saturated hydraulic conductivity in the zone of groundwater level fluctuations. The proposed model can be used for predicting the dynamics of the specific yield under seasonal or diurnal groundwater level fluctuations.

AB We present a multi-objective, multi-stage stochastic programming with recourse model for reservoir management and operation, where we use utility theory to select the best compromise solution from the Pareto front. A multi-stage streamflow scenario tree is generated first by the neural gas method. Then the Pareto front at each stage is produced by a modified constrained NSGA-II. A single best compromise solution on the Pareto front must be selected for the immediate stage and the model moves forward one stage and is re-optimized over a moving planning horizon of fixed duration. A key contribution of this study is the selection of the best compromise solution, which is achieved by a proposed linear spline utility function allied with regression. Our proposed utility function has the following advantages: (a) It satisfies the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution, (b) it does not rely on the pre-specified weight or goal, and (c) it selects the best compromise solution that is likely to fall in the "knee regions" of the Pareto front. We apply the proposed optimization model to the Three Gorges Reservoir in China. The two conflicting objectives are (a) maximizing the total expected energy output in the planning horizon, and (b) maximizing the average expected ecological benefits in the planning horizon. The results show that the proposed model produces the optimal water release policy successfully under different hydrological scenarios, considering both the inflow uncertainty and the tradeoff between the two conflicting objectives.

AB Twenty conservative tracer injections were carried, out in the same reach of a small woodland stream in order to determine how variation in discharge and leaf accumulation affect stream hydraulic parameters. The injections were made at various discharge rates ranging from 2.6 to 40 l/s. Five of the injections were made during late autumn, when there were large accumulations of leaves in the stream. Estimates of hydraulic parameters were made by fitting a transient storage solute transport model to conservative tracer concentration profiles. Velocity increased almost linearly with increasing discharge, indicating a decline in the Darcy friction factor. Dispersion also increased with increasing discharge, especially for the lower flow injections. The relative size of the storage zone was small (similar to 0.1). There was no definable relationship between discharge and the relative storage zone size, but the rates of exchange between the storage zone and the main channel increased markedly with increasing discharge. The presence of large accumulations of leaves had a clear effect on the hydraulic characteristics of the stream, producing much higher friction factors, larger storage zone sizes and lower velocity than would have been predicted by discharge alone.

AB The geographic variability in the partitioning of precipitation into surface runoff (Q) and evapotranspiration (ET) is fundamental to understanding regional water availability. The Budyko equation suggests this partitioning is strictly a function of aridity, yet observed deviations from this relationship for individual watersheds impede using the framework to model surface water balance in ungauged catchments and under future climate and land use scenarios. A set of climatic, physiographic, and vegetation metrics were used to model the spatial variability in the partitioning of precipitation for 211 watersheds across the contiguous United States (CONUS) within Budyko's framework through the free parameter . A generalized additive model found that four widely available variables, precipitation seasonality, the ratio of soil water holding capacity to precipitation, topographic slope, and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, explained 81.2% of the variability in . The model applied to the Budyko equation explained 97% of the spatial variability in long-term Q for an independent set of watersheds. The model was also applied to estimate the long-term water balance across the CONUS for both contemporary and mid-21st century conditions. The modeled partitioning of observed precipitation to Q and ET compared favorably across the CONUS with estimates from more sophisticated land-surface modeling efforts. For mid-21st century conditions, the model simulated an increase in the fraction of precipitation used by ET across the CONUS with declines in Q for much of the eastern CONUS and mountainous watersheds across the western United States.

AB Effect of climate change and catchment change on the long-term water balance is of considerable interest at a range of spatial scales. The total differential of runoff within the Budyko framework, which has been widely used to attribute the change in runoff to the effect of climate and catchment changes, is not precise in which there is always some residual between the observed and estimated change in runoff. The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a new partition method based on the Budyko complementary relationship for runoff. Algebraic identities have ensured that the change in runoff can be decomposed into two components precisely without any residuals using this complementary method. In addition, the complementary method allows estimation of the upper and lower bounds of the climate effect and catchment effect. The new method was compared with the total differential method and an extrapolation method for 15 catchments in Australia. Results show that the average range of the catchment effect using the complementary method was 6.7 mm for 14 of the 15 catchments, which is much smaller than that estimated with the total differential method (51.5 mm). The average of the upper and lower bounds was shown to be in good agreement with the effect of climate and catchment changes estimated using the extrapolation method (R-2=0.98 for both). Correlation analysis indicates that the average of these bounds is the best estimate of the magnitude of the climate and catchment effect for the 15 catchments examined.

AB Characterizing the spatial dynamics of soil moisture fields is a key issue in hydrology, offering an avenue to improve our understanding of complex land surface-atmosphere interactions. In this paper, the statistical structure of soil moisture patterns is examined using modelled soil moisture obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) at 0.125 degrees resolution. The study focuses on the vertically averaged soil moisture in the top 10 cm and 100 cm layers. The two variables display a weak dependence for lower values of surface soil moisture, with the strength of the relationship increasing with the water content of the top layer. In both cases, the variance of the soil moisture follows a power law decay as a function of the averaging area. The superficial layer shows a lower degree of spatial organization and higher temporal variability, which is reflected in rapid changes in time of the slope of the scaling functions of the soil moisture variance. Conversely, the soil moisture in the top 100 cm has lower variability in time and larger spatial correlation. The scaling of these patterns was found to be controlled by the changes in the soil water content. Results have implications for the downscaling of soil moisture to prevent model bias.

AB Surface saturated areas are key features in generating run-off. A detailed characterization of the expansion and contraction of surface saturation in riparian zones and its connectivity to the stream is fundamental to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow generation processes. In this first contribution of a series of two papers, we used ground-based thermal infrared imagery for characterizing riparian surface saturation seasonal dynamics of seven different riparian areas in the Weierbach catchment (0.42 km(2)), a small forested catchment in Luxembourg. We collected biweekly panoramic images of the seven areas over a period of 2 years. We identified the extension of saturation in each collected panoramic image (i.e., percentage of pixels corresponding to saturated surfaces in each riparian area) to generate time series of surface saturation. Riparian surface saturation in all areas was seasonally variable, and its dynamics were in accordance with lower hillslope groundwater level fluctuations. Surface saturation in the different areas related to catchment outlet discharge through power law relationships. Differences in these relationships for different areas could be associated with the location of the areas along the stream network and to a possible influence of local riparian morphology on the development of surface saturation, suggesting a certain degree of intracatchment heterogeneity. This study paves the way for a subsequent investigation of the spatio-temporal variability of streamflow generation in the catchment, presented in our second contribution.

AB Soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) represent the relationship between suction and water content in unsaturated soils. The SWCCs exhibit hysteresis during wetting-drying cycles; however, the empirical expressions used to describe SWCCs have typically ignored the hysteresis. Additionally, the shape of the SWCC will vary depending on the void ratio of the soil and changes resulting from soil skeleton deformations, which may also show hysteretic behavior under various loading conditions. Therefore, it is important to investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, the relationship between soil skeleton deformations and the SWCC for different soils. There is limited information in the literature that examines, both experimentally and theoretically, the complex coupling between the soil skeleton deformation and SWCC behavior, and generally, this behavior is not well understood. This paper presents laboratory test results of SWCCs determined under different confining stresses on similarly prepared samples of a silty soil; drying, wetting, second drying, and scanning curves were obtained. The influence of soil skeleton deformations on SWCCs is inferred from the curves measured in an oedometer under different stress conditions. An elastoplastic phenomenological constitutive model based on the bounding surface plasticity theory was utilized to simulate the coupled mechanical-hydraulic behavior of measured results. This research demonstrates that the model is capable of predicting hysteresis in SWCCs and soil skeleton deformation and the coupling between the hydraulic and mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils.

AB Coupled flows through and over permeable layers occur in a variety of natural phenomena including turbulent flows over submerged vegetation. In this work, we employ a two-domain approach to model flow through and over submerged canopies. The model, amenable of a closed-form solution, couples the log-law and the Darcy-Brinkman equation, and is characterized by a novel representation of the drag force which does not rely on a parametrization through an unknown drag coefficient. This approach limits to one, i.e., the obstruction permeability, the number of free parameters. Analytical expressions for the average velocity profile through and above the canopies, volumetric flow rate, penetration length, and canopy shear layer parameter are obtained in terms of the canopy layer effective permeability. The model suggests that appropriately rescaled velocities in the canopy and surface layers follow two different scaling laws. The analytical predictions match with the experimental data collected by Ghisalberti and Nepf (2004) and Nepf et al. (2007).
   Key Points
   Analytical model characterized by one fitting parameter Velocities in the canopy and surface layers follow two different scaling laws Good agreement between model predictions and experimental data

AB Solute transport in a three-dimensional, heterogeneous hillslope is analyzed through a series of detailed, three-dimensional numerical simulations. The investigation focuses on the transport of a pulse of a passive solute, taking into account realistic features of the relevant flow domain (i.e., the spatial heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic properties and records of the time-dependent meteorological data and evapotranspiration). The scope of the present work is to analyze a few issues regarding the travel time probability density function (pdf) f(tau) of solute, with particular reference to the following: (1) the suitability of the time invariance assumption and the circumstance under which it may represent a valid approximation, (2) the shape of the resulting travel time pdf f(tau), and (3) the difference between f( tau) and the instantaneous unit hydrograph. It is found that in many cases of practical interest the transport of contaminants in catchments can be analyzed by assuming the time-invariant approximation for f(tau), provided that the calendar time is replaced by a flow-corrected time. Here f(tau) is calculated through the analysis of the breakthrough curve represented in terms of flux-averaged concentration versus cumulate discharge. The rescaling of time with respect to the cumulated outflow takes care in an approximate way of the transient processes occurring in the porous medium. The derived f(tau) is weakly dependent on various attributes, like the level of heterogeneity, presence of evaporation or transpiration, and injection period. The main exception regards the cases in which plant transpiration is intense in the vicinity of the channel after relatively long periods of low rain. The impact of the parameters' heterogeneity on f(tau) is generally quite limited, the dispersion being ruled by the distribution of length paths within the hillslope. The derived f(tau) seems compatible with the Gamma distribution, being characterized by both fast and slow responses, with a pronounced power law early peak and an exponential-like tail. Comparison of f(tau) with the often employed Gamma instantaneous unit hydrograph emphasizes the differences between water and solute dynamics after rainfall events.

AB Fluidlike and integral sliding behaviors can be partly attributed to the dilatancy/contraction behavior of granular materials. A three-dimensional two-phase model and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method are applied to study the fluidization behavior by simulating the collapse of an initially fully saturated granular column. The dimensionless numbers (the initial aspect ratio, initial solid volume fraction, and Stokes number associated with the grain size) are varied to examine the collapse process and deposition characteristics. The profiles and front location during collapse highlight that the mechanism changes with the Stokes number and initial solid volume. The granular migration and pore pressure evolution characteristics are presented to clarify the differences in the collapse procedures and mechanisms pertaining to the simulation cases. The dimensionless final runout length and deposition height present monotonically increase and decrease following power laws with increasing initial aspect ratio, respectively; the dimensionless final runout length and deposition height also have monotonically decreasing and increasing relationships with increasing initial solid volume fraction and strongly increasing and decreasing characteristics during the transfer from the viscous flow regime to the inertial flow regime with increasing Stokes number, respectively. The simulation results indicate that the dynamic mechanism of the fluidization transformation is controlled by the Stokes number and initial solid volume fraction. Moreover, the coupling effect of the Stokes number, initial solid volume fraction and initial aspect ratio controls the collapse process of the initially saturated granular column.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this paper is to numerically evaluate the spatially filtered flow theory of Beckie et al. [this issue]. We perform two suites of tests to evaluate the theory. In the first suite of tests we examine the accuracy of the spatially filtered Darcy's law approximations. To do this, we use exact filtered conductivities and head gradients in the spatially filtered Darcy's laws to calculate the approximate filtered flux and then compare the approximate flux field to the exact flux field. We determine the exact fields by numerically filtering the primitive fields. In the second suite of tests we solve the model equations to determine the approximate flux solution. We present a simple numerical-perturbation strategy to solve the model equations. The first suite of tests shows that over a range of filter widths the error in the resolved-scale flux computed from the second-order approximate spatially filtered Darcy's law is up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the zeroth-order approximation. The second suite of tests, which more closely correspond to the way the theory would be applied in practice, show that the model accuracy and convergence properties are degraded by error from the numerical-perturbation strategy.

AB A unified Eulerian-Lagrangian theory is presented for the transport of a conservative solute in a random velocity field that satisfies locally del . v(x, t) = f(x, t), where f(x, t) is a random function including sources and/or the time derivative of head. Solute concentration satisfies locally the Eulerian equation partial derivative c(x, t)/partial derivative t + del . J(x, t) = g(x, t), where J(x, t) is advective solute flux and g(x, t) is a random source independent of f(x, t). We consider the prediction of c(x, t) and J(x, t) by means of their unbiased ensemble moments [c(x, t)]nu, and [J(x, t)]nu conditioned (as implied by the subscript) on local hydraulic measurements through the use of the latter in obtaining a relatively smooth unbiased estimate nu(x, t) of v(x, t). These predictors satisfy partial derivative [c(x, t)]nu/partial derivative t + del.[J(x, t)]nu = [g(x, t)]nu, where [J(x, t)]nu = nu(x, t)[c(x, t)]nu + Q(nu)(x, t) and Q(nu)(x, t) is a dispersive flux. We show that Q, is given exactly by three space-time convolution integrals of conditional Lagrangian kernels alpha(nu) with del.Q(nu) beta, with del[c]nu and gamma(nu) with [c]nu for a broad class of v(x, t) fields, including fractals. This implies that Q(nu)(x, t) is generally nonlocal and non-Fickian, rendering [c(x, t)]nu non-Gaussian. The direct contribution of random variations in f to Q(nu) depends on [c]nu rather than on del[c]nu. We elucidate the nature of the above kernels; discuss conditions under which the convolution of beta(nu) and del[c] becomes pseudo-Fickian, with a Lagrangian dispersion tensor similar to that derived in 1921 by Taylor; recall a 1952 result by Batchelor which yields an exact expression for (c), at early time; use the latter to conclude that linearizations which predict that (c), bifurcates at early time when the probability density function of v is unimodal cannot be correct; propose instead a weak approximation which leads to a nonlinear integro-differential equation for (c), due to an instantaneous point source and which improves with the quantity and quality of hydraulic data; demonstrate that the weak approximation is analogous to the ''direct interaction'' closure of turbulence theory; offer non-Fickian and pseudo-Fickian weak approximations for the second conditional moment of the concentration prediction error; demonstrate that it yields the so-called ''two-particle covariance'' as a special case; conclude that the (conditional) variance of c does not become infinite merely as a consequence of disregarding local dispersion; and discuss how to estimate explicitly the cumulative release of a contaminant across a ''compliance surface'' together with the associated estimation error.

AB Flood is one of the natural hazards which occur all over the world and it is critical to be controlled through proper management. Severe flood events in Kelantan, Malaysia cause damage to both life and property every year, and therefore the development of flood model to recognize the susceptible areas in watersheds is important for decision makers. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques could be useful in hydrological studies while they are able to fulfill all the requirements for comprehensive, rapid and accurate analysis. The aim of the current research is to compare the prediction performances of two different approaches such as rule-based decision tree (DT) and combination of frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR) statistical methods for flood susceptibility mapping at Kelantan, Malaysia. DT is based on the rules which are created precisely and strongly by considering all the characteristics of the variables which can enhance the performance of the flood susceptibility mapping. On the other hand, LR as multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) has some weak points. For that reason, FR was used to analyze the impact of classes of each variable on flood occurrence and overcome the weakness of LR. At first, flood inventory map with a total of 155 flood locations was extracted from various sources over the part of the Kelantan. Then the flood inventory data was randomly divided into a testing dataset 70% (115 flood locations) for training the models and the remaining 30% (40 flood locations) was used for validation purpose. The spatial database includes digital elevation model (DEM), curvature, geology, river, stream power index (SPI), rainfall, land use/cover (LULC), soil type, topographic wetness index (TWI) and slope. For validation both success and prediction rate curves were performed. The validation results showed that, area under the curve for the results of DT and integrated method of FR and LR was 87% and 90% for success rate and 82% and 83% for prediction rate respectively.

AB To estimate the potential consequences of projected global warming on streamflow, a deterministic model for a monthly timescale has been developed. The model structure is based on the water budget theory and contains deterministic relationships to estimate four components of streamflow: direct runoff, interflow, base flow, and snowmelt. The model inputs are six climate variables for each time step and 10 watershed parameters. The model has four calibration parameters which are related to direct runoff and snowmelt runoff. The model has been applied to the Little Washita River watershed in Oklahoma and the Baptism River watershed in Minnesota. The former is an agricultural watershed with a warm and seasonally dry climate, and the latter is a forested watershed with a cool and humid climate. The model simulates mean monthly streamflow in the Baptism River with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) of 0.99 and a correlation coefficient of 0.83. For the Little Washita River the same simulation measures are 0.94 and 0.89, respectively.

AB The honey-bees mating programming (HBMP) algorithm is introduced as a novel tool for predicting suspended sediment concentration for the Mad River catchment near Arcata, USA. The paper also applies gene expression programming (GEP) as a comparison and shows that these two approaches can the produce transparent, nonlinear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Some modifications have been made to the HBMP algorithm to improve its capability and efficiency. The results achieved from this method and GEP are compared with two different sediment rating curves based on regression techniques. The findings show that the results from both the HBMP and GEP methods are promising and outperform the results obtained from the sediment rating curves.

AB The relative permeability versus saturation relation is fundamental for modeling unsaturated flow processes in aperture-based fractures. On the basis of the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution within single fractures, an analytical relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is established. When the van Genuchten function on the description of the capillary pressure-saturation relationship is applied, an explicit mathematical expression between the relative permeability and saturation is gained similar to the form of the van Genuchten-Mualem (VG-M) model of porous media. Through the comparisons between the several series of laboratory-measured data available in the literature and theoretical results, good agreements are both presented and they suggest that the proposed VG-M model can be successfully used for aperture-based fractures as well as porous media. To understand aperture variation dependence of the relative permeability properties, a computational method combining fractal theory and the invasion percolation model to determine the empirical parameters associated with the spatial correlation of aperture distribution is developed. Simulated fractures with spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture distributions corresponding respectively to small and large fractal dimensions are both studied. According to the simulated results, the residual saturation generally increases with fractal dimension increments. However, the value of m exhibits a weak dependence on fractal dimension. The proposed model can be applied to various engineering such as seepage control for rock slopes, petroleum reservoirs, nuclear waste disposal and geologic storage of carbon dioxide.

AB Rainfall intensity (depth)-duration-frequency (IDF/DDF) relationships provide information essential for urban stormwater drainage system design and other hydrosystem infrastructures. For catchments where drainage areas are small, rainfall DDF relationships with short duration can be established based on rainfall records from automatic raingauges. Due to the progression of technology development, wide spread installation of automatic raingauges does not happen until 2-3 decades ago. Therefore, record lengths at majority of automatic raingauges are relatively short and the derived rainfall DDF relationships on the basis of at-site frequency analysis are potentially subject to significant sampling error. On the other hand, many conventional raingauges exist long before automatic raingauges were deployed. However, daily rainfall data with long records at conventional raingauges are of limited use to establish rainfall DDF relationships in areas with small catchment size like Hong Kong where design storm duration significantly shorter than 24-h are needed. This study presents a practical methodological framework to derive rainfall DDF relationships with short duration at conventional raingauge locations. The core components of the framework include the scaling model of rainfalls of different durations, the establishment of relationship between annual maximum daily rainfall and rolling-time 1440 min rainfall, the quantification of statistical features of estimated annual maximum 1440 min rainfalls, and the assessment of uncertainty of derived rainfall DDF relationships at conventional raingauges.

AB Coupled groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) models are capable of simulating complex hydrological systems when used at fine resolutions. However, properly characterizing bulk GW-SW fluxes for either coarsely resolved integrated models or basin-discretized surface water models remains a challenge. Loss of subgrid detail, while beneficially decreasing computational cost, leads to a decrease in model accuracy as scale effects become important. Ideally, coarse low-resolution models should be informed by expected subgrid behaviour, reducing the impact of scale effects. Determining how to best represent these fine-scale details in lower-resolution models is important for improving the accuracy and appropriateness of these models. To investigate some of these scale effects, we here explore the relationships between area-averaged hydraulic head and bulk GW-SW exchange fluxes (e.g. evapotranspiration and discharge), all of which are presumed to be controlled predominantly by subgrid topographic effects. These relationships may be useful for simply upscaling models without the complete loss of crucial fine-resolution subgrid details. Using finely resolved simulation output from Modflow for a fine-resolution simulation and post-processed results generated to represent coarser resolutions, upscaled flux relationships (UFRs) are generated for multiple terrains; these UFRs define the relationships that exist between average hydraulic head and average fluxes in unconfined aquifer systems. It is found that, for steady-flow regimes, similar one-to-one power law relationships consistently exist between area-averaged hydraulic heads, exchange fluxes and saturated area for a variety of terrains. Additionally, when the averaged values are properly normalized, the generated steady-state UFRs for a single terrain are independent of hydraulic conductivity and potential evapotranspiration rates and apparently insensitive to the presence of mild heterogeneity. While some hysteresis is apparent in the relationships under transient conditions, transient artefacts are shown to be minor under some circumstances, indicating that UFRs may be applied to both steady-state and transient scenarios. Simpler tests performed under saturated and variably saturated conditions in a cross-sectional model show similar trends, suggesting that the UFR representation is extendable to systems where the vadose zone plays a significant role. It is suggested that relatively simple UFRs such as these may find use as an alternative to direct point upscaling or multi-resolution models for estimating GW-SW exchange fluxes in coarse-scale models. They also appear to justify the functional form of some classical models of baseflow and evapotranspiration used in conceptual surface water models. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In Part 1 of this two-part series, Hale and McDonnell (2016) showed that bedrock permeability controlled base flow mean transit times (MTTs) and MTT scaling relations across two different catchment geologies in western Oregon. This paper presents a process-based investigation of storage and release in the more permeable catchments to explain the longer MTTs and (catchment) area-dependent scaling. Our field-based study includes hydrometric, MTT, and groundwater dating to better understand the role of subsurface catchment storage in setting base flow MTTs. We show that base flow MTTs were controlled by a mixture of water from discrete storage zones: (1) soil, (2) shallow hillslope bedrock, (3) deep hillslope bedrock, (4) surficial alluvial plain, and (5) suballuvial bedrock. We hypothesize that the relative contributions from each component change with catchment area. Our results indicate that the positive MTT-area scaling relationship observed in Part 1 is a result of older, longer flow path water from the suballuvial zone becoming a larger proportion of streamflow in a downstream direction (i.e., with increasing catchment area). Our work suggests that the subsurface permeability structure represents the most basic control on how subsurface water is stored and therefore is perhaps the best direct predictor of base flow MTT (i.e., better than previously derived morphometric-based predictors). Our discrete storage zone concept is a process explanation for the observed scaling behavior of Hale and McDonnell (2016), thereby linking patterns and processes at scales from 0.1 to 100 km(2).

AB Understanding the controls on the infiltration of precipitation into soil is an important problem in hydrology and its representation in heterogeneous media is still challenging. Here we investigate the reduction of gravity-driven infiltration by the development of a saturated region due to the downward decrease in porosity and/or hydraulic conductivity. The formation of a saturated region chokes the flow and leads to a rising perched water table that causes ponding even when rainfall intensity is lower than the surface infiltration capacity. Mathematically this problem is interesting, because its governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. To analyze this coupled unsaturated-saturated flow we develop an extended kinematic wave analysis in the limit of no capillary forces. This theory provides a general framework to solve gravity-dominated infiltration problems for arbitrary downward decrease in porosity and/or conductivity. We apply the framework to three soil profiles (two-layer, exponential and power-law decay with depth) and develop (semi-) analytic solutions for evolution of the water saturation. For the case of a two-layer soil the saturated flux, and therefore the front speeds, are constant which allows explicit analytic solutions that agree well with Hydrus-1D. All solutions show excellent agreement with our numerical solutions of the governing equations in the limit of no capillary forces. Similarly, our solutions compare well with experimental data for infiltration into a multi-layer soil with declining hydraulic conductivity.

AB Water discharge and suspended and dissolved sediment data from three rivers (Napo, Pastaza and Santiago) in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin and a river in the Pacific basin (Esmeraldas) over a 9-year period, are presented. This data set allows us to present: (a) the chemical weathering rates; (b) the erosion rates, calculated from the suspended sediment from the Andean basin; (c) the spatio-temporal variability of the two regions; and (d) the relationship between this variability and the precipitation, topography, lithology and seismic activity of the area. The dissolved solids load from the Esmeraldas basin was 2 x 10(6) t year(-1), whereas for the Napo, Pastaza and Santiago basins, it was 4, 2 and 3 x 10(6) t year(-1), respectively. For stations in the Andean piedmont of Ecuador, the relationship between surface sediment and the total sediment concentration was found to be close to one. This is due to minimal stratification of the suspended sediment in the vertical profile, which is attributed to turbulence and high vertical water speeds. However, during the dry season, when the water speed decreases, sediment stratification appears, but this effect can be neglected in the sediment flux calculations due to low concentration rates. The suspended sediment load in the Pacific basin was 6 x 10(6) t year(-1), and the total for the three Amazon basins was 47 x 10(6) t year(-1). The difference between these contributions of the suspended sediment load is likely due to the tectonic uplift and the seismic and volcanic dynamics that occur on the Amazon side.

This new similarity parameter, named the catchment-Peclet (caPe) number, provides a theoretical framework to compare the relative hydrologic response derived from shallow subsurface flow of small catchments on the basis of geomorphic properties. Using 400,000 synthetically derived catchments to model catchment-scale characteristic response functions (CRFs), we see good agreement between the synthetic and theoretical relationships relating the caPe number to the first two dimensionless moments of the CRF of small catchments. Working with real-world data, however, requires the estimation of hydrologic parameters and delineation of hillslopes to apply the caPe number. Allowing for uncertainty in the estimation of hydrologic parameters and in the definition of the extent of the channel network, the caPe number is able to recreate the observed moments of an approximate catchment-scale CRF for four small catchments ranging in size from 0.025 to 880 ha in two distinct climatic and geologic settings. By using physics to underpin the link between landscape and hydrological response, the caPe number creates a functional relationship between hydraulic theory and a catchment's pedogeomorphological structure. While this study is limited to small headwater catchments, it lays the groundwork for a catchment-scale similarity parameter that could be expanded to larger scales where channel network structure and storage become more important.

AB Pumping events are often conducted in the alluvial fan due to its considerable amount of water; If pumping events occur in the nearby vicinity of the streams, it will inevitably influence the complex microbial ecosystems in both the river and the aquifer, induce the issue of water rights permits, and affect the development of the water resource management. Therefore, it becomes necessary to accurately predict groundwater flow as a result of pumping in the wedge-shaped aquifer. In this paper, we propose an analytical solution to describe the drawdown distribution and the stream depletion rate (SDR) due to pumping in a wedge-shaped aquifer, which represents the shape of the alluvial fan bounded by two streams. Moreover, we adopt the lagging theory into the model by introducing two lagging parameters in Darcy's law to allow the water flow and the hydraulic gradient to occur at different times. This measure facilitates the reflection of the inertial force because of a higher pumping rate and the microstructural interaction resulting from the water transfer between the primary pores and secondary pores (e.g., dead-end pores and very-small pores). It leads to the predicted result being closer to reality when these effects are profound. We found that the drawdown and SDR curves will behave like waves when the flux lagging dominates. The SDR value can be over unit due to the additional recharge driven by inertial force; the drawdown and SDR acts more like an unconfined or dual-porosity flow if storage lagging governs the system. Moreover, lagging parameters have the largest effect on drawdown and SDR when the times are close to the corresponding values of lagging parameters. The case of wedge-shaped domain bounded by two impervious barriers is considered to further explore the boundary effects on aquifer response to pumping.

AB Past studies on concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships have focused on short-term or low-temporal resolution data. While advancing understanding of catchment processes, these studies provided limited insight on catchment response over time or to climate change. Using 15 solutes from 1992 to 2015 at Sleepers River Research Watershed, Vermont, we compared C-Q relationships over decades, years, and seasons to elucidate controls on stream chemical variation. We applied end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) to identify solute sources and flow path routing. EMMA identified three end-members: near-surface runoff (NSR), riparian groundwater, and hillslope hollow groundwater. Shifting mixing proportions of these end-members accounted for the temporal variability of conservative (no chemical reaction en route from source to stream) solutes in streamflow. For example, an increase in NSR fraction, typical of high flow, caused flushing (increased concentrations) of NO3-, DOC, Al, and Fe, which were greatest in NSR, dilution of specific conductance and base cation, SO42-, Si, Sr, Ba, and Mn concentrations, which were greatest in the two groundwater end-members. This behaviour is reflected in the b-coefficient of the C-Q relation (C = aQ(b)), which indicates the strength of dilution (b < -0.1) and flushing (b > 0.1) effects. For conservative solutes, the b-coefficient decreased significantly (p < 0.01) with an increase in the groundwater to NSR concentration ratio. Solutes that are conservative and have relatively constant concentrations in end-members over time showed consistent annual C-Q patterns over years and decades. Furthermore, the strength of dilution or flushing was stronger during the snowmelt period, when the NSR fraction peaked, than during the dormant and growing seasons. With shorter snowmelt periods and snow to rain shifts, the flushing or dilution power of snowmelt runoff will weaken and alter catchment response to climate change. These insights provide more tools for the interpretation of catchment processes and responses to climate change.

AB We compare predictions of the saturation dependence of air permeability from percolation theory with experimental results taken from the last 60 years. We selected experiments with sufficient density of data points to verify a functional dependence. The typical number of such data points was about 10, but actual values ranged from 4 to 31. The predicted saturation dependence is a universal power law in the air-filled porosity (less a threshold value) with an exponent of 2.00. Our investigation showed that the experimental power was 2.028 +/- 0.028 with an R-2 value, averaged across all the experiments, of greater than 0.96 for database 1 (including 16 samples from the literature) and 1.814 +/- 0.386 with an R-2 value of larger than 0.90 for database 2 (including 23 samples from Tang et al. (2011)). The threshold value of the air-filled porosity could be predicted reasonably from the wet end of the soil water retention curves. The threshold varied systematically with soil texture. We also compare the proposed model with three other methods, e.g., Millington and Quirk, Burdine-Brooks-Corey, and Kawamoto et al., in estimation of air permeability. The results indicate that the universal scaling approach estimates air permeability more accurately than other methods. Thus, we believe that we have confirmed the universal scaling predicted as well as demonstrated its usefulness in predicting the air permeability.

AB [1] Batch equilibrium solubility studies were conducted to examine the solubilization behavior of a chlorinated solvent, trichloroethene (TCE), from a fuel-based nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) mixture. An alkane (n-decane) was used as a model compound because it is often a primary compound in jet fuel. The NAPL phase mole fractions of the chlorinated solvent in the mixture (X-TCE(N)) that were investigated are typical of in situ values found at industrial and military waste sites (0.0001 greater than or equal toX(TCE)(N)less than or equal to0.1). The measured aqueous concentrations of TCE were essentially equal to the concentrations predicted with ideal dissolution theory (Raoult's law) at X-TCE(N) values near 0.1. However, the ratio of the measured concentration to the ideal concentration, or the NAPL phase activity coefficient (gamma(TCE)(N)), increased nonlinearly as the X-TCE(N) decreased. The gamma(TCE)(N) approached 6 at X-TCE(N) = 0.0001. The UNIFAC method greatly underpredicts the gamma(TCE)(N) in this surrogate fuel. A NAPL-mixture equilibrium-dissolution model was developed that incorporates the observed nonideal dissolution. This model indicates that nonideal NAPL dissolution is 4 times faster than ideal dissolution for a hypothetical NAPL mixture with an initial X-TCE(N) = 0.001. The magnitude of this effect becomes more important as the initial value of the X-TCE(N) is decreased.

AB In this contribution, a three-dimensional sediment scour model based on the two-phase flow Eulerian-Eulerian solver, sedFoam, is developed within the framework of the open source platform OpenFOAM. The adoption of the Eulerian approach for both fluid and sediment makes the model suitable for simulating scour process around structures with arbitrary geometry. The model is first validated with unidirectional sediment transport configurations without structures, to ensure that it can capture both flow and sediment transport processes. The validation cases show that the model can accurately simulate the sediment transport rate and bedload layer thickness as a function of the Shields number over a wide range of flow condition and sediment properties. Then, the model is applied to simulate the live-bed scour process around a vertical pile due to unidirectional current. It is a first attempt to use a two-phase model for simulating such case and its success serves as a proof-of-concept for future development. Simulated results of flow, sediment transport, and scour processes are compared with experiments and good agreement is observed. A new methodology to determine the bed shear stress in complex flow configurations is proposed. The mixture shear stress computed at the elevation of the iso-concentration phi(0) = 0.08 (corresponding to top of the bedload layer) is used to define the local Shields number.
   Within the scour hole, a competition between fluid bed shear stress driven and gravity driven sediment transport occurs at bed angles up to beta approximate to 23 degrees. This is lower than the repose angle (beta(r) approximate to 32 degrees). The relationship between the sediment flux and the bed slope is linear below beta approximate to 23 degrees. Above this angle the sediment flux increases nonlinearly with the bed slope while the Shields number tends to 0. This shows that, in the part of the scour hole close to the vertical cylinder, the sediment flux only result from the action of gravity: avalanching is the dominant transport mechanism and conventional power law become ineffective even with slope correction. In the lee-side of the cylinder suspended load dominant and the power law, assuming a local equilibrium between bottom shear stress and transport flux, is no longer valid. Further discussion is made on the computational cost of the proposed model and future research directions.

AB Extrapolation of measurements of water use by individual trees to that for a stand of trees is a critical step in linking plant physiology and hydrology. Limitations in sampling resources and variation in tree sizes within a stand necessitate the use of some scaling relationship. Further, to scale tree water use in space as well as time, the relationship must reflect the changing availabilities of energy and water supply. It is argued here that tree leaf area is the most appropriate covariate of water use to achieve this aim. However, empirical results show that the relationship is not always linear. A theory is developed, based on the concepts of hydrological equilibrium (sensu Nemani and Running, 1989) and ecological field theory (Walker et al., 1989) which accounts for (occasional) non-linear behaviour of the flux/leaf area relationship in evergreen trees. A key feature of this theory is the notion of a non-linear, quasi-equilibrium reflecting plant water stress. An equation is derived from these concepts and a standard, explicit treatment of tree water use (Landsberg and McMurtrie, 1984), which is used to characterise this relationship. This equation has the form Q = aIA + b psi(s)A(f). The theory is tested against field data and published reports on Eucalyptus tree water use.

AB Estimates of potential evapotranspiration ( PET) and reference evapotranspiration (RET) were compared over the Mekong and Yellow river basins, representing humid and semi-arid Asian monsoon regions. Multiple regression relationships between monthly RET, PET, LAI ( leaf area index) and climatic variables were explored for different vegetation types. Over the Mekong River basin, the spatial average of RET is only 1.7% lower than PET; however, RET is 140% higher than PET over parts of the Tibetan Plateau, due to the short and sparse grassland, and 30% lower than PET in parts of the lower basin due to the tall and well-developed forests. Over the Yellow River basin, RET is estimated to be higher than PET, on average about 50% higher across the whole basin, due to the generally sparse vegetation. A close linear relationship between annual RET and PET allows the establishment of a regional regression to predict monthly PET from monthly RET, climatic variables and/or vegetation LAI. However, the large prediction errors indicate that the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model, although it is more complex, should be recommended due to its more robust physical basis and because it successfully accounts for the effect of changing land surface conditions on PET. The limited available field data suggest that the S-W estimate may be more realistic. It was also found that vegetation conditions in summer are primarily controlled by the regional antecedent precipitation in the cold and dry seasons over the Loess Plateau in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.

AB This study focuses on two main rivers of Bohemia (Czech Republic): the Vltava and the Elbe. Flows are determined for the Elbe at Decin (discharges) and Litomerice (water stages), and for the Vltava at Prague (discharges). Extreme flows have an important socio-economic impact; hence modelling their occurrence accurately is crucial. We identify the meteorological causes for floods: (a) the winter type due to snowmelt, ice damming, and usually rain, and (b) the summer type due to continuous heavy rains. The amplitude and frequency of floods are analysed using extreme value theory, in a non-stationary context. This allows the determination of the trends of flood features during the instrumental period and their dependence on atmospheric circulation patterns.

AB Climatic trends and anthropogenic changes in land cover and land use are impacting the hydrology and water quality of streams at the field, watershed, and regional scales in complex ways. In poorly drained agricultural landscapes, subsurface drainage systems have been successful in increasing crop productivity by removing excess soil moisture. However, their hydroecological consequences are still debated in view of the observed increased concentrations of nitrate, phosphorus, and pesticides in many streams, as well as altered runoff volumes and timing. In this study, we employ the recently developed theory of time-variant travel time distributions within the StorAge Selection function framework to quantify changes in water cycle dynamics resulting from the combined climate and land use changes. Our results from analysis of a subbasin in the Minnesota River Basin indicate a significant decrease in the mean travel time of water in the shallow subsurface layer during the growing season under current conditions compared to the pre-1970s conditions. We also find highly damped year-to-year fluctuations in the mean travel time, which we attribute to the homogenization of the hydrologic response due to artificial drainage. The dependence of the mean travel time on the spatial heterogeneity of some soil characteristics as well as on the basin scale is further explored via numerical experiments. Simulations indicate that the mean travel time is independent of scale for spatial scales larger than approximately 200 km(2), suggesting that hydrologic data from larger basins may be used to infer the average of smaller-scale-driven changes in water cycle dynamics.

AB Drainage characteristics of porous media are shaped by an interplay between gravitational, capillary and viscous forces that result in complex phase invasion patterns and dynamics. We propose a mechanistic model for viscous separation of temporary phase detention behind rapidly moving drainage fronts. The viscous-limited region forming behind the front tip (tip of furthest penetrated air finger) drains at a slower rate with a characteristic time scale tau dictated by hydraulic decoupling expressed by the hydraulic properties of the medium. The region where saturation becomes viscously detained (temporarily entrapped) is determined by a critical water content theta(crit) that defines a viscous length LV behind the front tip. Theory developed to predict the critical water content theta(crit) and the characteristic secondary timescale tau was in good agreement with measured drainage characteristics using neutron radiography and direct imaging. The observed critical water content theta(crit) increased with higher drainage rates as predicted by theory with consideration of a percolation threshold. The observed slow drainage timescale tau as a function of mean drainage rate depended on the critical water content theta(crit) and the resulting counteracting effects of increased detained liquid volume and increased conductivity of the viscous limited region. The concept of drainage zonation illustrates how increasing flow rates enhances the extent of viscous limitations behind the main drainage front. The new insights could be useful for management of immiscible fluid displacement, quantification of averaging effects in experimental measurements (dynamic effects on p(c)-S relationship), and explain some of the underpinnings of the field capacity phenomenon.

AB We present a new set of analytical solutions for analysing pumping tests in a well near a vertical fault zone, dyke or vein. We consider a fault zone with finite width, storativity and hydraulic conductivity, which can be anisotropic, and without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three aquifer domains (pumped aquifer, fault zone and opposite-side aquifer). This configuration, not described before, also considers flow transience within the fault zone. Drawdown solutions were developed for the three-aquifer domains based on an unconventional application of the well-image theory. Their comparison with numerical modelling results was very satisfactory. Drawdown behaviour at the pumping well is discussed for contrasted properties between the three-aquifer domains. Original analytical solutions for transient flow along both sides of the fault zone, and net transient flow from the fault itself, are proposed and discussed, with particular attention to flow reversal, from the pumped compartment to the fault zone, which occurs where the fault zone is the most transmissive. Finally, we extend the solutions to the case of a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near the same vertical geological discontinuity.

AB Irrigation practice has increased considerably recently and will continue to increase to feed a growing population and provide better life standards worldwide. Numerous studies deal with the hydrological impacts of irrigation, but little is known about the temporal evolution of the affected variables. This work assesses the effects on a gully after irrigation was implemented in its hydrological basin (7.38 km(2)). Flow, electrical conductivity, nitrate concentration and exported loads of salts and nitrates were recorded in Lerma gully (Zaragoza, Spain) for eight hydrological years (2004-2011), covering the periods before, during and after implementation of irrigation. Non-parametric statistical analysis was applied to understand relationships and trends. The results showed the correlation of irrigation with flow and the load of salts and nitrates exported, although no significant relationship with precipitation was detected. The implementation of irrigation introduced annual trends in flow (3.2L s(-1), +23%), salinity (-0.38 mS cm(-1), -9%), and nitrate concentration (5.4mg L-1, +8%) in the gully. In addition, the annual loads of contaminants exported increased (salts and nitrates, 27.3Mg km(-2) year(-1), +19%, and 263kg NO3--N km(-2) year(-1), +27%, respectively). The trends presented a strong seasonal pattern, with higher and more significant trends for the irrigation season. The changes observed were different from those of larger irrigation districts or regional basins, due to the differences in land use and irrigation management. It is important to understand these changes in order to achieve an adequate management of the environment and water resources.

ID ANNUAL FLOW SERIES; STREAMFLOW DROUGHT
AB Two important parameters of hydrological droughts are the longest duration and the greatest severity (in standardized form) over a desired return period (say T years), referred to as critical drought. The long-term mean of the annual flow sequences has been used as the truncation level for defining hydrological drought. Two well-known approaches-time series simulation and a probability theory-based approach-were used to estimate drought parameters. The drought episodes are treated as runs of deficits, and so the theory of runs forms a major tool for analysis. The sample estimates of the mean, coefficient of variation (or standard deviation), skewness, lag-1 serial correlation, and/or information on the probability distribution of flow sequences, are the basic input parameters in both approaches. The applicability of both approaches was tested for deducing drought parameters across Canada, with emphasis on northwest Ontario, a region bordering Lake Superior. Natural annual flow sequences in this region can be treated as normal independent sequences in the stochastic sense. The results of the probabilistic approach yielded marginally better results than the simulation approach. A main advantage of the probabilistic approach turned out to be parsimony with only two parameters, viz. drought probability at the truncation level and return period for normal independent annual flow sequences. Furthermore, estimates of the greatest standardized severity can be taken as equal to the longest duration, thus eliminating the need for severity analysis. The regional variation of droughts in northwest Ontario was portrayed through a map plotting the values of drought potential index (DPI). In northwest Ontario, a 100-year drought may persist continuously for 6 years and a 25-year drought for 4 years. The DPI map indicated proneness to drought along the Ontario-Manitoba border in the northwest Ontario region.

AB An analytical solution is developed for three-dimensional flow towards a partially penetrating large-diameter well in an unconfined aquifer bounded below by a leaky aquitard of finite or semi-infinite extent. The analytical solution is derived using Laplace and Hankel transforms, then inverted numerically. Existing solutions for flow in leaky unconfined aquifers neglect the unsaturated zone following an assumption of instantaneous drainage due to Neuman. We extend the theory of leakage in unconfined aquifers by (1) including water flow and storage in the unsaturated zone above the water table, and (2) allowing the finite-diameter pumping well to partially penetrate the aquifer. The investigation of model-predicted results shows that aquitard leakage leads to significant departure from the unconfined solution without leakage. The investigation of dimensionless time-drawdown relationships shows that the aquitard drawdown also depends on unsaturated zone properties and the pumping-well wellbore storage effects.

TI CORRELATION OF TURBIDITY WITH INDIAN REMOTE-SENSING SATELLITE-1A DATA
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-IA Linear Imaging Self Scanning System (IRS-1A-LISS-I) multispectral digital data acquired over the Tawa reservoir region have been analysed to evaluate the turbidity in the surface water. Tawa reservoir water samples were collected on 20 October 1988 concurrent with an IRS-1A overpass. The turbidity was measured at each sampling point in the field with a nephelometer. Reservoir water samples were analysed for total suspended matter, grain size and mineralogy. IRS-1A-LISS-I computer-compatible tapes were obtained from the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), India. The relationship between the LISS-I digital data of 20 October 1988 and the measured values of turbidity was established. The results indicate that, in the turbidity range between 15-45 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units), a positive relationship exists between the turbidity and the visible wavelength band 1, 2 and 3 (0.45 to 0.68-mu-m) mean pixel values. Shorter wavelengths, especially in band 3 (0.62-0.68-mu-m), are more useful than longer wavelengths (near infrared) in quantifying turbidity. The concentration, mineralogy and grain size of the suspended matters are the main factors which influence the reflected radiance at low concentration levels (15-45 NTU) of turbidity. There is a positive correlation between reflectance, turbidity and suspended sediment concentration. It can be concluded that, as turbidity increases in the 15-45 NTU range, the spectral response increases. It appears that IRS-1A-LISS-I data could he developed as a practical tool in water quality monitoring.

AB Identification of the location and strength of a contaminant source in an aquifer is a challenging but crucial task. Efficient surrogate models can be constructed to replace traditional time-consuming simulators while solving this inverse problem. In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithms, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been proven to be an efficient way for surrogate modeling. However, it may be difficult for ANN-based algorithms to learn the convection-dispersion equation and predict the contaminant concentration field due to their point-to-point learning scheme. Because of their strong localized features, the concentration fields can be seen as images. In contrast, the convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract spatial information better due to its convolutional structure. Herein, a theory-guided full convolutional neural network (TgFCNN) model is proposed to solve inverse problems in subsurface contaminant transport. TgFCNN can construct robust and reliable surrogate models with limited training realizations, and be further utilized for inverse modeling tasks. The loss function of TgFCNN comprises the residual of governing equations of contaminant transport, as well as data mismatch. Moreover, the iterative ensemble smoother (IES) method is employed to update the parameters while solving the inverse problems. The proposed TgFCNN model is evaluated in four scenarios. The results demonstrate that the TgFCNN model possesses strong generalization and extrapolation abilities, and satisfactory accuracy when estimating unknown contaminant source parameters, as well as the permeability field. The time consumption of the TgFCNN surrogate model for inverse tasks is also greatly reduced compared to using traditional simulators directly.

AB A statistical framework based on nonlinear dynamics theory and recurrence quantification analysis of dynamical systems is proposed to quantitatively identify the temporal characteristics of extreme (maximum) daily precipitation series. The methodology focuses on both observed and general circulation model (GCM) generated climates for present (1961-2000) and future (2061-2100) periods which correspond to 1xCO(2) and 2xCO(2) simulations. The daily precipitation has been modelled as a stochastic process coupled with atmospheric circulation. An automated and objective classification of daily circulation patterns (CPs) based on optimized fuzzy rules was used to classify both observed CPs and ECHAM4 GCM-generated CPs for 1xCO(2) and 2xCO(2) climate simulations (scenarios). The coupled model CP-precipitation' was suitable for precipitation downscaling. The overall methodology was applied to the medium-sized mountainous Mesochora catchment in Central-Western Greece. Results reveal substantial differences between the observed maximum daily precipitation statistical patterns and those produced by the two climate scenarios. A variable nonlinear deterministic behaviour characterizes all climate scenarios examined. Transitions' patterns differ in terms of duration and intensity. The 2xCO(2) scenario contains the strongest transitions highlighting an unusual shift between floods and droughts. The implications of the results to the predictability of the phenomenon are also discussed. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper reports the results of afield investigation aimed to establish morphological similarity between rills and ephemeral gullies. Rill measurements were made on 14 plots having a surface area of 22-352 m(2) located on a 149% slope and on a plot 6.0 in wide and 22.0 in long having a uniform 22.0% slope. The plots are located on the experimental station for soil erosion measurements. 'Sparacia', of the Agricultural Faculty of Palermo University, in Sicily, Italy. All plots are subjected to natural rainfall. The measurements were made immediately following five events between November 2004 and December 2005. The ephemeral gully measurements were made on a cultivated area of about 120 ha, located in Central Sicily, which is representative of many soil-crop conditions in the Mediterranean basin. The morphological similarity between rill and ephemeral gully was first tested. Then a power relationship between rill or gully volume and length, theoretically deduced by dimensional analysis and self-similarity theory, was applied. This power relationship needs a different scale factor for rill and gully measurements. Finally, using two dimensionless groups representative of the channel morphology variables, the analysis showed that a single relationship can be applied to rill and gully measurements.

AB The spatial heterogeneity in the soil hydraulic properties was considered here as the main cause of the spatial variability in soil water content, theta. The aim of the study was (i) to identify the critical mean soil water content, Theta(cr), below which the standard deviation of the soil water content, sigma(theta), can only diminish, and (ii) to provide a mathematical tool capable of linking Theta(cr) to inherent soil hydraulic properties. The relationships between sigma(theta) and the mean value of theta, Theta, were analyzed by a first-order analysis, based on a stochastic continuum presentation of steady-state flow in 3-D, spatially hetrogeneous, unsaturated soils, using the Gardner-Russo model to describe the constitutive relations locally. Novel results of the study suggested that the mean pressure head, H, associated with Theta(cr), H-cr = H (Theta(cr)), is an inflection point of the mean soil water capacity function, C(H) = d Theta/dH. Results of numerical simulations of flow in 3-D, spatially heterogeneous, unsaturated soils, using the van Genuchten (1980, ) model to describe the constitutive relations locally, suggested that the results of the first-order analysis might be applicable to more realistic situations, involving transient, nonmonotonous flows and more complicated descriptions of the local constitutive relations.

AB In networks where individual fracture lengths follow a fractal distribution, ensemble transport of conservative solute particles at the leading plume edge exhibit characteristics of operator-stable densities. These densities have, as their governing equations of transport, either fractional-order or integer-order advection-dispersion equations. Model selection depends on the identification of either multi-Gaussian or operator-stable transport regimes, which in turn depends on the power law exponent of the fracture length distribution. Low to moderately fractured networks with power law fracture length exponents less than or equal to 1.9 produce solute plumes that exhibit power law leading-edge concentration profiles and super-Fickian plume growth rates. For these network types, a multiscaling fractional advection-dispersion equation (MFADE) provides a model of multidimensional solute transport where different rates of power law particle motion are defined along multiple directions. The MFADE model is parameterized by a scaling matrix to describe the super-Fickian growth process, in which the eigenvectors correspond to primary fracture group orientations and the eigenvalues code fracture length and transmissivity. The approximation of particle clouds by a multi-Gaussian (a subset of the operator stable) for densely fractured networks with finite variance fracture length distributions can be ascribed to the classical ADE where Fickian scaling rates pertain along orthogonal plume growth directions. Fracture networks show long-term particle retention in low-velocity fractures so that coupling of the equations of motion with retention models such as continuous time random walk or multirate mobile/immobile will increase accuracy near the source. Particle arrival times at exit boundaries for multi-Gaussian plumes vary with spatial density. Generally, arrival times are faster in sparsely fractured domains where transport is governed by a few very long fractures.

AB Despite decades of research on the ecological consequences of stream network expansion, contraction and fragmentation, surprisingly little is known about the hydrological mechanisms that shape these processes. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four California headwater streams (4-27km(2)) spanning diverse topographic, geologic and climatic settings. We show that these stream networks dynamically expand, contract, disconnect and reconnect across all the sites we studied. Stream networks at all four sites contract and disconnect during seasonal flow recessions, with their total active network length, and thus their active drainage densities, decreasing by factors of two to three across the range of flows captured in our field surveys. The total flowing lengths of the active stream networks are approximate power-law functions of unit discharge, with scaling exponents averaging 0.27 +/- 0.04 (range: 0.18-0.40). The number of points where surface flow originates obey similar power-law relationships, as do the lengths and origination points of flowing networks that are continuously connected to the outlet, with scaling exponents averaging 0.36-0.48. Even stream order shifts seasonally by up to two Strahler orders in our study catchments. Broadly, similar stream length scaling has been observed in catchments spanning widely varying geologic, topographic and climatic settings and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in size, suggesting that network extension/contraction is a general phenomenon that may have a general explanation. Points of emergence or disappearance of surface flow represent the balance between subsurface transmissivity in the hyporheic zone and the delivery of water from upstream. Thus the dynamics of stream network expansion and contraction, and connection and disconnection, may offer important clues to the spatial structure of the hyporheic zone, and to patterns and processes of runoff generation.

AB It is difficult to measure river discharge accurately in an estuary, and particularly, in the region where the tidal flow dominates over the river discharge. River discharge is important for the morphology and hydrodynamics of estuaries as it influences the salt intrusion process, tidal dynamics, freshwater supply (water resources management), and the occurrence of floods. Here we try to derive river regime characteristics from the seaward end: the estuary. It is found that there are empirical relationships that link the geometry of an estuary to its river regime, which can be used to estimate river discharge characteristics with the least of data available. The aims of this study are: (1) to derive empirical relations between geometrical characteristics of estuaries and the bankfull discharge; (2) to explore a physical explanation for this relation; and (3) to estimate the bankfull discharge in estuaries. The physical connection between an estuary and its river regime is found by combining estuary shape analysis, tidal dynamic analysis, and Lacey's hydraulic geometry theory. The relationships found between the estuary depth, width, and bankfull river discharge have been tested in 23 estuaries around the world (including seven recently surveyed estuaries). From the analysis, it shows that the depth of an estuary is a function of the bankfull flood discharge to the power of 1/3, which is in agreement with Lacey's formula. This finding not only provides a method to estimate estuary depth, it also allows estimating flood discharge characteristics from readily available estuary shape indicators.

AB A study was carried out in the northwestern part of the Medjerda basin for the sake of improving the knowledge about its water quality as well as the relationships that may exist between the physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters. Added to that, it is meant to figure out the water quality indices of the meiofauna's diversity/density. The analysis of the 20 abiotic parameters reveals a degradation of the water quality in the Medjerda main stream and three of its northern tributaries (increased salinity, nitrate load, organic mattera, coliforms, etc.). The meiofauna data follows the regressive evolution of physico-chemical parameters and provides further knowledge about the type and quality of the sediment.

AB A study of the trends and variability of hydrological variables was conducted for natural streamflow gauging stations within the Liard River basin in northern Canada. Trends were investigated using the Mann-Kendall test, with an approach that corrects for serial correlation. The field significance of the results was evaluated using a bootstrap resampling approach. The relationships between trends in hydrological variables and both meteorological variables and a large-scale oceanic and atmospheric process were investigated using correlation analysis. The results reveal more trends in some hydrological variables than are expected to occur by chance. The observed trends are related to both trends in meteorological variables and a large-scale oceanic and atmospheric process.

AB The hillslope-storage Boussinesq (hsB) equation is a modification of the one-dimensional Boussinesq representation of saturated subsurface flow that accommodates the impact of converging and diverging flows resulting from a hillslope with nonconstant width. Here, a surrogate model, the hsB Proxy, is developed which closely emulates the results of high-quality numerical solutions of the hsB to reproduce the drainage response of a wide range of wedge-shaped hillslopes in response to a recharge time series at a fraction of the computational cost of a numerical solution and with minimal loss of fidelity. The efficacy of the Proxy in emulating the hsB response of a single hillslope and the aggregate response of a network of hillslopes is demonstrated. The Proxy applies to wedge-shaped hillslopes with homogenous hydraulic conductivity under uniform recharge, with the expectation that these hillslopes may inform future investigations into the upscaling behavior that results in the known power-law relationship between subsurface storage and outflow in a basin. The utility of the hsB as a tool for evaluating upscaling problems is demonstrated in two applications. First, the Proxy response is compared to the known basin-scale recession behavior in the Panola Mountain Research Watershed, under both transient and steady-state conditions. Second, the Proxy is applied to derive the single best effective hillslope in a basin. The Proxy is expected to be a useful tool for rapid simulation of subsurface flow from hillslopes for use in hydrological models and land surface schemes.

AB We rest on an Information Theory perspective and assess (i) the average information content and (i) the information shared between Darcy flux fields associated with fields of hydraulic conductivity (K) characterized by differing support (or measurement) scale. We treat hydraulic conductivity as a spatial random field, characterized by a given distribution and correlation structure. The latter is modeled through a truncated power law variogram (TPV), which explicitly takes into account a characteristic length scale of the support volume of K through a lower cutoff scale. We then frame our study in a numerical Monte Carlo context where groundwater flow is evaluated across a collection of realizations of hydraulic conductivity characterized by different values of the TPV parameters and subject to uniform in the mean flow. We quantify information through the Shannon entropy of the probability mass functions of the Darcy flux components as well as the mutual information and the multivariate mutual information respectively shared by pairs and triplets of Darcy flux components related to hydraulic conductivity fields evaluated at diverse scales and associated with various levels of heterogeneity. Partitioning of multivariate mutual information according to unique, redundant and synergetic contributions is also quantified. We found consistent trends (i) in the variation of the average information content with respect to the size of lower cutoff scale and (ii) in the way information is shared between pairs and triplets of Darcy flux components associated with diverse support scales of the underlying conductivities.

AB This is the first of a two-part paper exploring the coevolution of bedrock weathering and lateral flow in hillslopes using a simple low-dimensional model based on hydraulic groundwater theory (also known as Dupuit or Boussinesq theory). Here, we examine the effect of lateral flow on the downward fluxes of water and solutes through perched groundwater at steady state. We derive analytical expressions describing the decline in the downward flux rate with depth. Using these, we obtain analytical expressions for water age in a number of cases. The results show that when the permeability field is homogeneous, the spatial structure of water age depends qualitatively on a single dimensionless number, Hi. This number captures the relative contributions to the lateral hydraulic potential gradient of the relief of the lower-most impermeable boundary (which may be below the weathering front within permeable or incipiently weathered bedrock) and the water table. A scaled lateral symmetry exists when Hi is low: age varies primarily in the vertical dimension, and variations in the horizontal dimension x almost disappear when the vertical dimension z is expressed as a fraction z/H(x) of the laterally flowing system thickness H(x). Taking advantage of this symmetry, we show how the lateral dimension of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation can be collapsed, yielding a 1-D vertical equation in which the advective flux downward declines with depth. The equation holds even when the permeability field is not homogeneous, as long as the variations in permeability have the same scaled lateral symmetry structure. This new 1-D approximation is used in the accompanying paper to extend chemical weathering models derived for 1-D columns to hillslope domains.

ID NON-STATIONARITY; WATER-RESOURCES; AUSTRALIA; DROUGHT
AB This study demonstrates the benefits of using a simple statistical analysis to investigate the attributions of climate variables to the nonstationary rainfall-streamflow relationships. Rainfall and streamflow data from 65 catchments in southeast Australia are used to quantify the rainfall-streamflow relationship prior to, during, and after, the 1997-2009 Millennium Drought. The results showed that: (1) the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall, however the relationship is different in the different hydroclimate periods; (2) the number of rainfall days and the mean length of wet-spell (MeWS) are the two most "stable variables" that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods, followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90-day accumulated total rainfall (D90Max and D90P99); (3) the combination of MeWS with several other rainfall characteristics can explain the nonstationary rainfall-streamflow relationship through the different hydroclimate conditions in the eastern part of the study region; and (4) the relative differences in the key rainfall characteristics can help explain the nonstationary rainfall-streamflow relationship. The results here can help identify the key rainfall and climate characteristics to be considered in assessing the impacts of climate variability and change on streamflow, and potentially for developing hydrological models that can be better extrapolated to predict streamflow under a changing climate.

DE Reservoir operation; Implicit stochastic optimization;

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; RULES; MANAGEMENT; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS
AB This paper investigates the performance of seven stochastic models used to define optimal reservoir operating policies. The models are based on implicit (ISO) and explicit stochastic optimization (ESO) as well as on the parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO) approach. The ISO models include multiple regression, two-dimensional surface modeling and a neuro-fuzzy strategy. The ESO model is the well-known and widely used stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) technique. The PSO models comprise a variant of the standard operating policy (SOP), reservoir zoning, and a two-dimensional hedging rule. The models are applied to the operation of a single reservoir damming an intermittent river in northeastern Brazil. The standard operating policy is also included in the comparison and operational results provided by deterministic optimization based on perfect forecasts are used as a benchmark. In general, the ISO and PSO models performed better than SDP and the SOP. In addition, the proposed ISO-based surface modeling procedure and the PSO-based two-dimensional hedging rule showed superior overall performance as compared with the neuro-fuzzy approach.

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

   SALT TRANSPORT
AB The application of Fick's law to describe hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media is based on the assumption of a linear dependance of a solute dispersive mass flux on its concentration gradient. Both theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the Fickian description of dispersion is not valid when large concentration variations in the porous medium are encountered. However, an appropriate alternative is still lacking. In this work, based on a theoretical derivation of the Fickian dispersion equation, a non-linear theory of dispersion is suggested. In the non-linear theory, in addition to the longitudinal and transversal dispersivities, a new parameter is introduced. Miscible displacement experiments are carried out in order to investigate the effects of large variations in salt mass fraction and to assess the validity of the new theory. Low-concentration liquid is displaced upwards in a vertical column by a high-concentration liquid. Thus, only hydrodynamically stable flow regimes are considered.
   The experiments are simulated by means of both classical Fick's law and the new non-linear theory. It is found that low-concentration-gradient experiments can be simulated satisfactorily using the Fickian-type dispersion equation. However, calculated breakthrough curves for high-concentration-gradient experiments deviate substantially from the measured curves. It appears that a satisfactory fit to high-concentration-gradient data can be obtained only if the value of longitudinal dispersivity is reduced by a factor of three. Using the nonlinear theory, however, it is possible to simulate both low- and high-concentration-gradient experiments with a unique set of parameter values.

AB This work is the sixth in a series of papers on the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) approach for modeling flow and transport phenomena in multiscale porous medium systems. Building upon the general TCAT framework and the mathematical foundation presented in previous works, the limiting case of connected two-fluid-phase flow is considered. A constrained entropy inequality is developed based upon a set of primary restrictions. Formal approximations are introduced to deduce a general simplified entropy inequality (SEI). The SEI is used along with secondary restrictions and closure approximations consistent with the SEI to produce a general functional form of a two-phase-flow model. The general model is in turn simplified to yield a hierarchy of models by neglecting common curves and by neglecting both common curves and interfaces. The simplest case considered corresponds to a traditional two-phase-flow model. The more sophisticated models including interfaces and common curves are more physically realistic than traditional models. All models in the hierarchy are posed in terms of precisely defined variables that allow for a rigorous connection with the microscale. The explicit nature of the restrictions and approximations used in developing this hierarchy of models provides a clear means to both understand the limitations of traditional models and to build upon this work to produce more realistic models.

AB The relationship between soil erodibility, which is hard to measure, and modeled infiltration rate were rarely researched. Here, the soil erodibility factors (K and K-e in the USLE, K-i and K-1 in the WEPP) were calculated and the infiltration rates were modeled based on the designed laboratory simulation experiments and proposed infiltration model, in order to build their relationship. The impacts of compost amendment on the soil erosion characteristics and relationship were also studied. Two contrasting agricultural soils (bare and cultivated fluvo-aquic soils) were used, and different poultry compost contents (control, low and high) were applied to both soils. The results indicated that the runoff rate, sediment yield rate and soil erodibility of the bare soil treatments were generally higher than those of the corresponding cultivated soil treatments. The application of composts generally decreased sediment yield and soil erodibility but did not always decrease runoff. The comparison of measured and modeled infiltration rates indicated that the model represented the infiltration processes well with an N-S coefficient of 0.84 for overall treatments. Significant negative logarithmic correlations have been found between final infiltration rate (FIR) and the four soil erodibility factors, and the relationship between USLE-K and FIR demonstrated the best correlation. The application of poultry composts would not influence the logarithmic relationship between FIR and soil erodibility. Our study provided a useful tool to estimate soil erodibility.

AB In numerical modeling of subsurface flow and transport problems, formation properties may not be deterministically characterized, which leads to uncertainty in simulation results. In this study, we propose a sparse grid collocation method, which adopts nested quadrature rules with delay and transformation to quantify the uncertainty of model solutions. We show that the nested Kronrod-Patterson-Hermite quadrature is more efficient than the unnested Gauss-Hermite quadrature. We compare the convergence rates of various quadrature rules including the domain truncation and domain mapping approaches. To further improve accuracy and efficiency, we present a delayed process in selecting quadrature nodes and a transformed process for approximating unsmooth or discontinuous solutions. The proposed method is tested by an analytical function and in one-dimensional single-phase and two-phase flow problems with different spatial variances and correlation lengths. An additional example is given to demonstrate its applicability to three-dimensional black-oil models. It is found from these examples that the proposed method provides a promising approach for obtaining satisfactory estimation of the solution statistics and is much more efficient than the Monte-Carlo simulations.

TI Modeling water demand when households have multiple sources of water
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS; CONSUMPTION; CHOICE; PRICE
AB A significant portion of the world's population lives in areas where public water delivery systems are unreliable and/or deliver poor quality water. In response, people have developed important alternatives to publicly supplied water. To date, most water demand research has been based on single-equation models for a single source of water, with very few studies that have examined water demand from two sources of water (where all nonpublic system water sources have been aggregated into a single demand). This modeling approach leads to two outcomes. First, the demand models do not capture the full range of alternatives, so the true economic relationship among the alternatives is obscured. Second, and more seriously, economic theory predicts that demand for a good becomes more price-elastic as the number of close substitutes increases. If researchers artificially limit the number of alternatives studied to something less than the true number, the price elasticity estimate may be biased downward. This paper examines water demand in a region with near universal access to piped water, but where system reliability and quality is such that many alternative sources of water exist. In extending the demand analysis to four sources of water, we are able to (i) demonstrate why households choose the water sources they do, (ii) provide a richer description of the demand relationships among sources, and (iii) calculate own-price elasticity estimates that are more elastic than those generally found in the literature.

AB [1] We use the extended Darcy's law, which also accounts for the Brinkman correction, to study macrodispersion in a two-dimensional (2-D) porous medium. The former is necessary when permeability changes fast at a relatively small scale, and in general, it is a more complete description of flow in a heterogeneous medium. Lattice-gas methods are ideally suited to simulate such flows. Simulations using a lattice BGK method and a small-fluctuation approach are described for an isotropic, exponentially decaying correlation function of the permeability field. The analytical results contain the additional parameter K-l/lambda(2) (where K-l and lambda are the typical permeability and velocity variation length, respectively), the sensitivity to which was studied. As expected, the contribution of the Brinkman effect is insignificant for typical field values of this parameter, in which case, the classical results are recovered. At larger values, for example, for heterogeneous media of a small correlation length, and possibly in laboratory applications, the Brinkman correction leads to a decrease in macrodispersivity, reflecting the smoothing effect of the Brinkman correction on the velocity field. Nonetheless, for practical values of the parameters, this reduction is no larger than 50% of the classical expression. The small fluctuation theory was found to be in good agreement with the simulations, provided that it was consistently applied (namely, by not mixing first-order with second-order expansions). The results also show that lattice-gas simulations can be usefully employed to study macrodispersion in heterogeneous porous media.

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; WIND
AB Triple collocation has found widespread application in the hydrological sciences because it provides information about the errors in our measurements without requiring that we have any direct access to the true value of the variable being measured. Triple collocation derives variance-covariance relationships between three or more independent measurement sources and an indirectly observed truth variable in the case where the measurement operators are additive. We generalize that theory to arbitrary observation operators by deriving nonparametric analogues to the total error and total correlation statistics as integrations of divergences from conditional to marginal probability ratios. The nonparametric solution to the full measurement problem is underdetermined, and we therefore retrieve conservative bounds on the theoretical total nonparametric error and correlation statistics. We examine the application of both linear and non-linear triple collocation to synthetic examples and to a real-data test case related to evaluating space-borne soil moisture retrievals using sparse monitoring networks and dynamical process models.

AB We study the synergistic effects of the Peclet number and the length scale of medium heterogeneity on the evolution of bimolecular reactive transport between mobile and immobile species. We performed a suite of numerical simulations at the Darcy scale that quantify the instantaneous, irreversible bimolecular reaction A(aq)+B-s -> C-aq, under various transport conditions (Peclet numbers) and porous media configurations (correlation lengths). We find that the global reaction rate is sensitive to both the Peclet number and the correlation length. The total amount of product decreases with increasing Peclet number, while it increases with increasing correlation length. In addition, for all of these scenarios, the global reaction rate is shown to be time dependent and is an outcome of the anomalous transport behavior of the chemical species. The time-dependent behavior of the reaction rate is amplified with increasing Peclet number and decreasing correlation length and can be well approximated by a power law relationship. We find, too, that the transport behavior of the reaction products (C) often deviates from that of the inflowing reactant species (A), because reactions occur preferentially within the flow domain. Finally, and due to the influence of the Peclet number on reactive transport, we show that temporal variations in the magnitude of the flow field (i.e, changing the Peclet number over time) shift the reaction and transport behavior into a state measurably different than that for steady flow conditions.

AB Reducing soil erosion and sediment delivery into rivers is a major aim for land management in New Zealand. Therefore, it is important to identify areas of sediment generation and their relationship to in-stream suspended sediment concentrations and water quality attributes. It is possible to infer and assess sediment sources and dynamics using storm event suspended sediment concentration-discharge hysteresis shape and loop direction. Research in small catchments has achieved some success; however, research in larger (>10(3) km(2)) catchments has shown the inherent difficulty of interpreting hysteresis patterns at larger scales. In this paper, we use a nested, long-term suspended sediment monitoring program across a large catchment (3,903 km(2): Manawatu in New Zealand) to address these challenges. We evaluate the hysteresis patterns of five major tributaries (subcatchment areas 329-1,298 km(2)) of the Manawatu River together with the hysteresis patterns at the gauged catchment outlet. Hysteresis patterns of the Manawatu subcatchments can be characterized as predominantly clockwise, that is, high hysteresis index (HI) value. Larger storms (discharge >2 x 10(7) m(3)) increase the likelihood of clockwise hysteresis directions, whereas smaller storms (discharge <2 x 10(7) m(3)) are more likely to be anticlockwise. The link between suspended sediment concentration-discharge hysteresis and subcatchment sediment sources becomes increasingly attenuated within the larger subcatchments. High antecedent discharge negatively correlates to HI values, suggesting conditions immediately before the storm have an influence on whether the catchment is "primed" or "exhausted" with available sediment. The different storm categories indicate that within this catchment, whereas hysteresis patterns vary due to the spatial origin of discharge and sediment to some extent, storm magnitude has a stronger impact on hysteresis dynamics than spatial origin.

AB This paper documents the spatiotemporal evolution of wet-day and dry-day frequency (WDF and DDF) in the western Amazon, its relationships with oceanic and atmospheric variability and possible impact on vegetation. WDF and DDF changed significantly during the 1980-2009 period (p<0.05). An increase in WDF is observed after 1995 over the northern part of the western Amazon (Maraon basin). The average annual value of WDF changed from 22 days/yr before 1995 to 34 days after that date (+ 55% after 1995). In contrast, DDF increased significantly over the central and southern part of this region (Ucayali basin) after 1986. Average annual DDF was 16.2 days before 1986 and 23.8 days afterward (+ 47% after 1986). Interannual variability in WDF appears to be modulated by changes in Pacific SST and the Walker cell during the November-March season. This mechanism enhances convective activity over the northern part of the western Amazon. The increase in DDF is related to warming of the North Tropical Atlantic SST, which produces changes in the Hadley cell and subsidence over the central and the southern western Amazon. More intense seasonal hydrological extremes in the western Amazon therefore appear to be related to changes in WDF and DDF that occurred in 1995 and 1986, respectively. During the 2001-2009 period, an index of vegetation condition (NDVI) appears negatively correlated with DDF (r = -0.95; p < 0.0001). This suggests that vegetation in the western Amazon is mainly water limited, rather than light limited and indicates that the vegetation is highly sensitive to concentration of rainfall.

AB Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional finite element model of a flood in the southern paa of Sicily were used to explore the parameter space of distributed bed-roughness coefficients. For many real-world events specific data are extremely limited so that there is not only fuzziness in the information available to calibrate the model, but fuzziness in the degree of acceptability of model predictions based upon the different parameter values, owing to model structural errors. Here the GLUE procedure is used to compare model predictions and observations for a certain event, coupled with both a fuzzy-rule-based calibration, and a calibration technique based upon normal and heteroscedastic distributions of the predicted residuals. The fuzzy-rule-based calibration is suited to an event of this kind, where the information about the flood is highly uncertain and arises from several different types of observation. The likelihood (relative possibility) distributions predicted by the two calibration techniques are similar, although the fuzzy approach enabled us to constrain the parameter distributions more usefully, to lie within a range which was consistent with the modellers' a priori knowledge of the system.

AB Precipitation quantile estimates are used in engineering, agriculture, and a variety of other disciplines. Index flood regional frequency methods pool normalized gauge data in the case of homogeneity among the constituent gauges of the region. Unitless regional quantile estimates are outputted and rescaled at each gauge. Because violation of the homogeneity hypothesis is a major component of quantile estimation error in regional frequency analysis, heterogeneity estimators should be reasonable proxies of the error of quantile estimation. In this study, three Monte Carlo heterogeneity statistics tested in Hosking and Wallis (1997) are plotted against Monte Carlo estimates of quantile error for all five-or-more-gauge regionalizations in a 12 gauge network in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota. Upper-tail quantiles with nonexceedance probabilities of 0.75 and above are examined at time steps ranging from daily to monthly. A linear relationship between heterogeneity and error estimates is found and quantified using Pearson's r score. Two of Hosking and Wallis's (1997) heterogeneity measures, incorporating the coefficient of variation in one case and additionally the skewness in the other, are found to be reasonable proxies for quantile error at the L-moment ratio values characterizing these data. This result, in addition to confirming the utility of a commonly used coefficient of variation-based heterogeneity statistic, provides evidence for the utility of a heterogeneity measure that incorporates skewness information.

AB Arid and semi-arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. During droughts, the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff (r-r) relationships. Uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r-r non-stationarity, especially at seasonal scales. This study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r-r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi-arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. The results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms (i.e. groundwater table, baseflow and vegetation) have stronger influences on non-stationarity in r-r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapo-transpiration. These findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r-r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions. While this study is focussed on SEA the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts.

AB The importance of stagnation points for characterizing groundwater flow patterns has long been recognized. However, the possible streamline configurations near stagnation points under the constraints of Darcy's law have not been thoroughly investigated. We fill this gap by conducting a systematic analysis of groundwater flow patterns near stagnation points in two and three dimensions. The approach borrows ideas from dynamical systems theory, as often done in fluid mechanics. The most general form of Darcy's law, which applies to variable-density, compressible fluids flowing through heterogeneous, anisotropic, compressible porous media, is first considered. Under these conditions, there are no major restrictions on the possible flow patterns near stagnation points. The common types of stagnation points are thus minimums (spiral or nonspiral), maximums (spiral or nonspiral), and saddles (in three dimensions, these can be converging or diverging and spiral or nonspiral). The implications of dealing with more restrictive fluid and porous medium properties are then systematically investigated. In particular, important restrictions on the possible types of stagnation points exist when the flow is constant density or divergence free. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a series of examples of groundwater flow fields in which different types of stagnation point arise. The findings highlight key differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows and provide new insights on the patterns of variable-density groundwater flow. The fundamental knowledge on groundwater flow patterns gained from this study will benefit both theoretical and applied studies of groundwater flow and solute transport.
   Plain Language Summary Groundwater flow patterns reveal how water flows and solutes are transported in the subsurface. Therefore, characterizing them allows for understanding the origin and fate of water and solutes in the subsurface. Such information is absolutely essential for developing appropriate water resources management strategies. This paper investigates stagnation points in groundwater flow fields, where the flux is zero. Although the flux at these points is zero, these points are extremely important to identify and analyze in order to characterize the flow patterns. The reason is that at stagnation points, groundwater flow can converge, diverge, or abruptly change its course. This is in contrast with other (nonzero flux) points, at which groundwater locally flows uniformly. This article provides for the first time a thorough investigation of the possible flow patterns near stagnation points in porous media in two and three dimensions. It thus advances fundamental knowledge on groundwater flow patterns that will benefit both theoretical and applied studies of groundwater flow and solute transport.

AB An integrated model, combining a surface energy balance system, an LAI-based interception model and a distributed monthly water balance model, was developed to predict hydrological impacts of land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) in the East River basin, China, with the aid of GIS/RS. The integrated model is a distributed model that not only accounts for spatial variations in basin terrain, rainfall and soil moisture, but also considers spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover and evapotranspiration (ET), in particular, thus providing a powerful tool for investigating the hydrological impact of LUCC. The model was constructed using spatial data on topography, soil types and vegetation characteristics together with time series of precipitation from 170 stations in the basin. The model was calibrated and validated based on river discharge data from three stations in the basin for 21 years. The calibration and validation results suggested that the model is suitable for application in the basin. The results show that ET has a positive relationship with LAI (leaf area index), while runoff has a negative relationship with LAI in the same climatic zone that can be described by the surface energy balance and water balance equation. It was found that deforestation would cause an increase in annual runoff and a decrease in annual ET in southern China. Monthly runoff for different land-cover types was found to be inversely related to ET. Also, for most of the scenarios, and particularly for grassland and cropland, the most significant changes occurred in the rainy season, indicating that deforestation would cause a significant increase in monthly runoff in that season in the East River basin. These results are important for water resources management and environmental change monitoring.

AB This work presents a new graphical system to represent hydrological dynamical models and their interactions. We propose an extended version of the Petri Nets mathematical modeling language, the Extended Petri Nets (EPN), which allows for an immediate translation from the graphics of the model to its mathematical representation in a clear way. We introduce the principal objects of the EPN representation (i.e., places, transitions, arcs, controllers, and splitters) and their use in hydrological systems. We show how to cast hydrological models in EPN and how to complete their mathematical description using a dictionary for the symbols and an expression table for the flux equations. Thanks to the compositional property of EPN, we show how it is possible to represent either a single hydrological response unit or a complex catchment where multiple systems of equations are solved simultaneously. Finally, EPN can be used to describe complex Earth system models that include feedback between the water, energy, and carbon budgets. The representation of hydrological dynamical systems with EPN provides a clear visualization of the relations and feedback between subsystems, which can be studied with techniques introduced in nonlinear systems theory and control theory.
   Key Points
   We present a graphical system to represent hydrological dynamical systems called Extended Petri Nets (EPN), with a one-to-one correspondence with the driving equations EPN topology and connections clarify the causal relationship between compartments and the feedback between them; two different types of feedback are presented EPN can be used to formalize perceptual models from field work into equations

AB The term "environmental flows" is now widely used to reflect the hydrological regime required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, and the human livelihoods and well-being that depend on them. The definition suggests a central role for ecohydrological science to help determine a required flow regime for a target ecosystem condition. Indeed, many countries have established laws and policies to implement environmental flows with the expectation that science can deliver the answers. This article provides an overview of recent developments and applications of environmental flows on six continents to explore the changing role of ecohydrological sciences, recognizing its limitations and the emerging needs of society, water resource managers and policy makers. Science has responded with new methods to link hydrology to ecosystem status, but these have also raised fundamental questions that go beyond ecohydrology, such as who decides on the target condition of the ecosystem? Some environmental flow methods are based on the natural flow paradigm, which assumes the desired regime is the natural "unmodified" condition. However, this may be unrealistic where flow regimes have been altered for many centuries and are likely to change with future climate change. Ecosystems are dynamic, so the adoption of environmental flows needs to have a similar dynamic basis. Furthermore, methodological developments have been made in two directions: first, broad-scale hydrological analysis of flow regimes (assuming ecological relevance of hydrograph components) and, second, analysis of ecological impacts of more than one stressor (e.g. flow, morphology, water quality). All methods retain a degree of uncertainty, which translates into risks, and raises questions regarding trust between scientists and the public. Communication between scientists, social scientists, practitioners, policy makers and the public is thus becoming as important as the quality of the science.

AB Groundwater discharge to streams is spatially variable. We often estimate this flux based on an averaged measurement of hydraulic gradient and local estimate of hydraulic conductivity. It is important to understand how this estimated flux value relates to the flux into the stream. In this study we introduce the concept of representative stream length. The estimated flux value best represents the groundwater discharge over the representative stream length. We simulated groundwater discharge to a stream using synthetic stochastic hydraulic conductivity fields to investigate the impact of heterogeneity (variance and correlation length) on the estimated groundwater discharge and the representative stream length of this discharge. To obtain estimates of hydraulic conductivity between the stream and piezometer, the groundwater head response to a known change in stream stage was simulated and analyzed using a well-known analytical solution. The results of the theoretical investigation showed that the representative stream length of the groundwater discharge estimate was approximately equal to the distance of the piezometer from the stream, that is, groundwater discharge estimated using Darcy's law from a piezometer 50 m from a stream will approximately represent the discharge occurring over a 50 m length of the stream. Furthermore, the results suggest that the variability in the estimated groundwater discharge significantly reduced when the distance of the piezometer from the stream increased. A field experiment was conducted using two controlled stream-stage change tests and found that results were consistent with the theoretical experiment. That is, as the distance of the piezometer from the stream increased, the variability in discharge estimates reduced. The implication of this finding is that future studies estimating groundwater discharge to streams applying Darcy's law need to consider the representative stream length, as this will impact the spatial scale over which the discharge estimate can be applied.

AB This paper is of methodological nature, and deals with the foundations of Risk Assessment. Several international guidelines have recently recommended to select appropriate/relevant Hazard Scenarios in order to tame the consequences of (extreme) natural phenomena. In particular, the scenarios should be multivariate, i.e., they should take into account the fact that several variables, generally not independent, may be of interest. In this work, it is shown how a Hazard Scenario can be identified in terms of (i) a specific geometry and (ii) a suitable probability level. Several scenarios, as well as a Structural approach, are presented, and due comparisons are carried out. In addition, it is shown how the Hazard Scenario approach illustrated here is well suited to cope with the notion of Failure Probability, a tool traditionally used for design and risk assessment in engineering practice. All the results outlined throughout the work are based on the Copula Theory, which turns out to be a fundamental theoretical apparatus for doing multivariate risk assessment: formulas for the calculation of the probability of Hazard Scenarios in the general multidimensional case ( d2) are derived, and worthy analytical relationships among the probabilities of occurrence of Hazard Scenarios are presented. In addition, the Extreme Value and Archimedean special cases are dealt with, relationships between dependence ordering and scenario levels are studied, and a counter-example concerning Tail Dependence is shown. Suitable indications for the practical application of the techniques outlined in the work are given, and two case studies illustrate the procedures discussed in the paper.

AB The objectives of this study were to discover the relationship between variables in a water reservoir and the hydrochemical variations related to acid mine drainage (AMD), and to describe the horizontal stratification related to vertical salinity and variations in metals present in the region. The information obtained may be used for establishing risk evaluation criteria and to design future remediation strategies, which could be useful for new dams. The hydrochemical characterization was based on a sampling campaign performed in October 2011. A total of 28 samples, at 1-m-deep intervals, were obtained. The hydrogeochemical study of the polluted reservoir shows that the dilution effect is not sufficient to neutralize AMD contributions from mining activity. Sampling carried out from the surface water to the deepest points reveals stratification of the reservoir that allows it to be included in the group of monomictic and holomitic lakes.

AB The objective of this study is to analyse three rainfall-runoff hydrological models applied in two small catchments in the Amazon region to simulate flow duration curves (FDCs). The simple linear model (SLM) considers the rainfall-runoff process as an input-output time-invariant system. However, the rainfall-runoff process is nonlinear; thus, a modification is applied to the SLM based on the residual relationship between the simulated and observed discharges, generating the modified linear model (MLM). In the third model (SVM), the nonlinearity due to infiltration and evapotranspiration is incorporated into the system through the sigmoid variable gain factor. The performance criteria adopted were a distance metric (delta) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (R-2) determined between simulated and observed flows. The good results of the models, mainly the MLM and SVM, showed that they could be applied to simulate FDCs in small catchments in the Amazon region.

AB Among the processes most affected by global warming are the hydrological cycle and water resources. Regions where the majority of runoff consists of snowmelt are very sensitive to climate change. It is significant to express the relationship between climate change and snow hydrology and it is imperative to perform climate change impact studies on snow hydrology at global and regional scales. Climate change impacts on the mountainous Upper Euphrates Basin were investigated in this paper. First, historical data trend analysis of significant hydro-meteorological data is presented. Available future climate data are then explained, and, finally, future climate data are used in hydrological models, which are calibrated and validated using historical hydro-meteorological data, and future streamflow is projected for the period 2070-2100. The hydrological model outcomes indicate substantial runoff decreases in summer and spring season runoff, which will have significant consequences on water sectors in the Euphrates Basin.

AB Knowledge of sub-core permeability is necessary for accurate numerical modeling of coreflooding experiments and for investigation of sub-core flow phenomenon. A new method for estimating sub-core permeability geometric mean (k(G)) and log-permeability variance (sigma(2)(y)) is presented. The method is based on matching coreflooding experiment measurements of wetting phase relative permeability with semi-analytical calculations of effective relative permeability. The semi-analytical solution is formulated assuming log-normal permeability (k), steady state and capillary-limit conditions. It is based on the geometric mean and log-phase-permeability variance for isotropic k and power law averaging for anisotropic correlations. The solution is validated on synthetic k realizations by comparison with numerical calculations. Then, the estimation method is tested on synthetic data assuming various types of core capillary pressure relationships, relative permeability functions and k anisotropies. Results demonstrate high accuracy in almost all of the cases except for small anisotropy ratios l(h)/l(v) between horizontal (l(h)) and vertical (l(v)) dimensionless correlation lengths, where flow is in the horizontal direction, and when sigma(2)(y) is large. The method is also validated using data from CO2-brine coreflooding experiments conducted on two different cores. It is found that the estimation method remains accurate in these realistic settings, however, accuracy of kG is reduced when the core permeability departs from a log-normal distribution.

AB The application of artificial neural network (ANN) methodology for modelling daily flows during monsoon flood events for a large size catchment of the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh (India) is presented. The spatial variation of rainfall is accounted for by subdividing the catchment and treating the average rainfall of each subcatchment as a parallel and separate lumped input to the model. A linear multiple-input single-output (MISO) model coupled with the ANN is shown to provide a better representation of the rainfall-runoff relationship in such large size catchments compared with linear and nonlinear MISO models. The present model provides a systematic approach for runoff estimation and represents improvement in prediction accuracy over the other models studied herein.

AB Changes in climate and land cover are among the principal variables affecting watershed hydrology. This paper uses a cell-based model to examine the hydrologic impacts of climate and land-cover changes in the semi-arid Lower Virgin River (LVR) watershed located upstream of Lake Mead, Nevada, USA. The cell-based model is developed by considering direct runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) method and surplus runoff based on the Thornthwaite water balance theory. After calibration and validation, the model is used to predict LVR discharge under future climate and land-cover changes. The hydrologic simulation results reveal climate change as the dominant factor and land-cover change as a secondary factor in regulating future river discharge. The combined effects of climate and land-cover changes will slightly increase river discharge in summer but substantially decrease discharge in winter. This impact on water resources deserves attention in climate change adaptation planning.

ID LAKE VICTORIA; ADRIATIC SEA; TRENDS
AB The effects induced on the climate by human activity have become a major issue for the new millennium. In order to arrive at sustainable conclusions it is necessary, first of all, to assess and quantify natural climatic changes. In general this is done by analysing available time series. In the case of historical hydrometeorological data sets, a comparative analysis with solar cycles is not usually conducted. This work, however, demonstrates that the effect of solar cycles observed at the Equator is also visible at middle and high latitudes with multiple periodicity of the basic solar frequency (roughly 11 years). This could well be due to the interaction between solar forcing and circulation mechanisms within the atmosphere, i.e. water-air-soil interactions coupled with anthropogenic forcing. This theory has been tested by comparing different types of historical data series with the River Po discharges and cyclic appearance of slime bloom in the Adriatic Sea.

AB The theory of optimal channel networks (OCNs) explains the existence of self-similarities in river networks by multiple optimality principles, namely, (i) the minimum energy expenditure in any link, (ii) the equal energy expenditure per unit area of channel anywhere, and (iii) the minimum total energy expenditure (TEE). These principles have been used to generate OCNs from 2-D networks. The existing notion of OCN considers the concavity of river longitudinal profiles as a priori condition. Attempts to generate OCNs starting from a random 3-D digital elevation model (DEM) and minimizing solely TEE have failed to reproduce concave profiles. Yet alternative approaches can be devised from the three optimality principles, for instance, focusing on the local energy expenditure (LEE). In this paper, we propose a Multiobjective modeling framework for Riverscape Exploration (MoRE) via simultaneous optimization of multiple OCN criteria. MoRE adopts a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and radial basis functions to efficiently guide DEM elevation variations required to shape 3-D OCNs. By minimizing both TEE and the variance in LEE, MoRE successfully reproduces realistic on-DEM, OCN-based riverscapes, for the first time. Simulated networks possess scaling laws of upstream area and length and river longitudinal profile resembling those of real river networks. The profile concavity of generated on-DEM OCNs emerges as a consequence of the minimization of TEE constrained to the equalization of LEE. Minimizing TEE under this condition generates networks that possess specific patterns of LEE, where the scaling of slope with basin area resembles the patterns observed in real river networks.
   Plain Language Summary In nature, river networks self-organize their branches so that the energy spent by the water flow to reach the outlet is kept to a minimum. This physical process can be expressed mathematically with diverse formulations, which inspired a theory called Optimal Channel Network. Several studies applied Optimal Channel Network theory to reproduce two-dimensional features of channel networks, that is, how river branches develop and organize within the network. Yet these studies were not able to reproduce realistic river networks in three dimensions, for instance, starting from a random digital elevation model. In this paper, we propose the first modeling framework able to generate artificial river networks from random digital elevation model that resemble those observed in nature for their 3-D characteristics, in terms of 2-D organization of the river network branches, as well as longitudinal profile of the river elevations. This work contributes to enrich our understanding about the mechanisms guiding the development and evolution of river networks in nature and provides a software tool that can be used for future research on real-world 3-D river landscapes.

Transport is computed for a set of representative elementary volumes and results from advection and diffusion in the resolved macroporosity (mobile domain) and diffusion in the microporous phase (immobile domain) where the effective diffusion coefficient is calculated from the measured local porosity using a phenomenological model that includes a porosity threshold (phi(theta)) below which diffusion is null and the exponent n that characterizes tortuosity-porosity power-law relationship. We show that both flow field heterogeneity and microporosity trigger anomalous transport. Breakthrough curve (BTC) tailing is positively correlated to microporosity volume and mobile-immobile interface area. The sensitivity analysis showed that the BTC tailing increases with the value of phi(theta), due to the increase of the diffusion path tortuosity until the volume of the microporosity becomes negligible. Furthermore, increasing the value of n leads to an increase in the standard deviation of the distribution of effective diffusion coefficients, which in turn results in an increase of the BTC tailing. Finally, we propose a continuous time random walk upscaled model where the transition time is the sum of independently distributed random variables characterized by specific distributions. It allows modeling a 1-D equivalent macroscopic transport honoring both the control of the flow field heterogeneity and the multirate mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains.

AB The permeability architecture of the critical zone exerts a major influence on the hydrogeochemistry of the critical zone. Water flow path dynamics drive the spatiotemporal pattern of geochemical evolution and resulting streamflow concentration-discharge (C-Q) relation, but these flow paths are complex and difficult to map quantitatively. Here we couple a new integrated flow and particle tracking transport model with a general reversible Transition State Theory style dissolution rate law to explore theoretically how C-Q relations and concentration in the critical zone respond to decline in saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) with soil depth. We do this for a range of flow rates and mineral reaction kinetics. Our results show that for minerals with a high ratio of equilibrium concentration (C-eq) to intrinsic weathering rate (R-max), vertical heterogeneity in K-s enhances the gradient of weathering-derived solute concentration in the critical zone and strengthens the inverse stream C-Q relation. As C-eq/R-max decreases, the spatial distribution of concentration in the critical zone becomes more uniform for a wide range of flow rates, and stream C-Q relation approaches chemostatic behavior, regardless of the degree of vertical heterogeneity in K-s. These findings suggest that the transport-controlled mechanisms in the hillslope can lead to chemostatic C-Q relations in the stream while the hillslope surface reaction-controlled mechanisms are associated with an inverse stream C-Q relation. In addition, as C-eq/R-max decreases, the concentration in the critical zone and stream become less dependent on groundwater age (or transit time).

AB The study area consists of the spring zones of the Krcic, Krka and Cetina river catchments located in the Dinaric karst, Croatia. Classical hydrological approaches and some newer time and frequency domain methods are used in order to validate the existing hypotheses both qualitatively and quantitatively, and these contribute to factual information about the hydrological behaviour of the catchments. The groundwater recharge rates are calculated by a mathematical model based on Palmer's soil-moisture balance method. The values of parameters of the groundwater recharge model are estimated by the spectral method. The calculated monthly and annual groundwater recharge rates form the basis for estimating the hydrological catchment areas of the spring zones and also for the determination of quantitative relationships between the catchments.

AB Under the assumption that the only information available on a drainage basin is its mean elevation, the connection between entropy and potential energy is explored to analyze drainage basins morphological characteristics. The mean basin elevation is found to be linearly related to the entropy of the drainage basin. This relation leads to a linear relation between the mean elevation of a subnetwork and the logarithm of its topological diameter. Furthermore, the relation between the fall in elevation from the source to the outlet of the main channel and the entropy of its drainage basin is found to be linear and so is also the case between the elevation of a node and the logarithm of its distance from the source. When a drainage basin is ordered according to the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme, a linear relation is found between the drainage basin entropy and the basin order. This relation can be characterized as a measure of the basin network complexity. The basin entropy is found to be linearly related to the logarithm of the magnitude of the basin network. This relation leads to a nonlinear relation between the network diameter and magnitude, where the exponent is found to be related to the fractal dimension of the drainage network. Also, the exponent of the power law relating the channel slope to the network magnitude is found to be related to the fractal dimension of the network. These relationships are verified on three drainage basins in southern Italy, and the results are found to be promising.

AB To understand the influence of shear behavior on the transporting properties of fluid through a single fracture, splitting fractures were made in the laboratory and shear flow tests were carried out under constant normal load conditions. The applied normal stress is in the range of 0.5-3.0 MPa. Before the physical test, the fracture's morphology is measured for identification of the roughness. At each shear step, we performed 5-8 high precise hydraulic tests with different hydraulic gradient. The relationship between pressure gradient and volume flow rate demonstrates to be nonlinear and fits very well with Forchheimer's and Izbash's laws. The linear and nonlinear coefficients in Forchheimer's law are quite sensitive to shear deformation (closure or dilation), experienced 1-2 and 1-3 orders of magnitude reduction during shear, respectively. An empirical equation is proposed to quantify the relationship between linear coefficient and nonlinear coefficient based on the experimental observations. The two coefficients in Izbash's law are quantified. Them value is in the range between 1.06 and 1.41 and the lambda value experiences a reduction of 1-2 orders of magnitude during shear. In addition, the studied critical Reynolds number exhibits a decreasing and increasing variation corresponding to shear contraction and shear dilation of rock fracture. For all the cases in this study, the critical Reynolds number ranges between 1.5 and 13.0. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research recognized that the slope of 18% can be used to distinguish between the 'gentle slope' case and that of 'steep slope' for the detected differences in hydraulic variables (flow depth, velocity, Reynolds number, Froude number) and those representatives of sediment transport (flow transport capacity, actual sediment load). In this paper, using previous measurements carried out in mobile bed rills and flume experiments characterized by steep slopes (i.e., slope greater than or equal to 18%), a theoretical rill flow resistance equation to estimate the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is tested. The main aim is to deduce a relationship between the velocity profile parameter Gamma, the channel slope, the Reynolds number, the Froude number and the textural classes using a data base characterized by a wide range of hydraulic conditions, plot or flume slope (18%-84%) and textural classes (clay ranging from 3% to 71%). The obtained relationship is also tested using 47 experimental runs carried out in the present investigation with mobile bed rills incised in a 18%-sloping plot with a clay loam soil and literature data. The analysis demonstrated that: (1) the soil texture affects the estimate of the Gamma parameter and the theoretical flow resistance law (Equation 25), (2) the proposed Equation (25) fits well the independent measurements of the testing data base, (3) the estimate of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is affected by the soil particle detachability and transportability and (4) the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is linearly related to the rill slope.

AB The abilities of neuro-fuzzy (NF) and neural network (NN) approaches to model the streamflow-suspended sediment relationship are investigated. The NF and NN models are established for estimating current suspended sediment values using the streamflow and antecedent sediment data. The sediment rating curve and multi-linear regression are also applied to the same data. Statistic measures were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The daily streamflow and suspended sediment data for two stations-Quebrada Blanca station and Rio Valenciano station-operated by the US Geological Survey were used as case studies. Based on comparison of the results, it is found that the NF model gives better estimates than the other techniques.

AB We conducted laboratory experiments to measure the sound produced during water-by-gas and kerosene-by-water displacements in samples of Indiana limestone and sandstones with different permeabilities. In water-by-gas displacement experiments, intensive sound was detected during the injection of hundreds of pore volumes and even when mobile water saturation was small (similar to 1%). The sound was produced in a wide frequency range starting with frequencies less than 1 kHz; the upper frequencies varied from approximately 15 kHz for high-permeability sandstone to almost 50 kHz for low-permeability sandstone. In contrast to the experiments with gas flow through the dry rock samples, where sound appears only at high gas rates corresponding to the Forchheimer flow regime, the displacement produces sound at lower rates, corresponding to Darcy regime. Both the drop rate of sound emission and the sound intensity at the same mobile water saturation were determined to inversely depend on the rock permeability. We found that sound produced by sandstones shows a power law relationship between the number of events and their amplitudes, where the absolute value of the exponent also inversely depends on the rock permeability. In kerosene-by-water displacement experiments, the signal was observed at lower frequencies (up to 5 kHz) and only during injection of the first several pore volumes. A model describing the sound generation was suggested; the model considers acoustic events as a train of random pressure pulses corresponding to a Poisson point process. Simulation results demonstrated that the model reasonably reproduces the general trend of sound spectra produced by sandstones.

AB Utilizing the rainfall intensity, and slope data, a fuzzy logic algorithm was developed to estimate sediment loads from bare soil surfaces. Considering slope and rainfall as input variables, the variables were fuzzified into fuzzy subsets. The fuzzy subsets of the variables were considered to have triangular membership functions. The relations among rainfall intensity, slope, and sediment transport were represented by a set of fuzzy rules. The fuzzy rules relating input variables to the output variable of sediment discharge were laid out in the IF-THEN format. The commonly used weighted average method was employed for the defuzzification procedure.
   The sediment load predicted by the fuzzy model was in satisfactory agreement with the measured sediment load data. Predicting the mean sediment loads from experimental runs, the performance of the fuzzy model was compared with that of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the physics-based models. The results of showed revealed that the fuzzy model performed better under very high rainfall intensities over different slopes and over very steep slopes under different rainfall intensities. This is closely related to the selection of the shape and frequency of the fuzzy membership functions in the fuzzy model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate streamflow prediction information is of great importance for water resource planning and management. The goal of this research is to develop a hybrid model for forecasting short-term runoff time series, where the variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original nonlinear natural streamflow into numerous subcomponents with different frequencies and resolutions. Second, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to excavate the complicated input-output relationship hidden in each subcomponent, and the emerging sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is used to determine the suitable network parameter for each ELM model. Finally, the forecasting results of all the modelled subcomponents are summarized to form the forecasting result for original streamflow. Based on several statistical evaluation measures, the feasibility of the hybrid method is investigated in runoff forecasting for Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. The results indicate that the hybrid method can produce superior forecasting results compared to several control methods, providing accurate streamflow prediction information for operators.

AB In the first part of this study, a flood wave transformation analysis for the largest historical floods in the Danube River reach Kienstock-Bratislava was carried out. For the simulation of the historical (1899 and 1954) flood propagation, the nonlinear river model NLN-Danube (calibrated on the recent river reach conditions) was used. It was shown that the simulated peak discharges were not changed significantly when compared to their historical counterparts. However, the simulated hydrographs exhibit a significant acceleration of the flood wave movement at discharges of between 5000 and 9000 m(3) s(-1). In the second part, the travel time-water level relationships between Kienstock and Bratislava were analysed on a dataset of the flood peak water levels for the period 1991-2002. An empirical regression routing scheme for the Danube short-term water level forecast at Bratislava station was derived. This is based on the measured water level at Kienstock gauging station.

AB Meteorological and soil drought is disastrous to natural and social systems. It is expected that the occurrence of meteorological and soil drought compound events will become more frequent and extreme in the future. The propagation process of meteorological drought to soil drought plays an essential role in the occurrence of drought. However, the drought propagation process is not clear, especially the quantification of drought characteristic propagation process is rarely realized. This study constructs drought intensity propagation index (DIP) and drought duration propagation index (DDP), and then puts forward drought propagation partition in China. Furthermore, this study preliminarily discussed the driving factors of drought propagation and the relationship between land-atmosphere interaction and main drought propagation partition (arid type drought propagation area, peer-to-peer type drought propagation area, and humid type drought propagation area). The results show that DDP and DIP are significantly negatively correlated in China from 1981 to 2020. From southeast to northwest, the propagation of drought intensity from meteorological drought to soil drought gradually increased and the propagation of drought duration gradually decreased. We further concluded that 68% of regions with similar intensity and duration of meteorological drought and soil drought (peer-to-peer type drought propagation area) are concentrated in semiarid and dry subhumid, which is exactly the area with strong land-atmosphere interaction. In all land use types, grasslands are most prone to peer-to-peer propagation of drought. This study further reveals the law and mechanism of drought propagation and provides a new idea and attempt to clarify the drought propagation process.

AB Soil pore water salinity plays an important role in the distribution of vegetation and biogeochemical processes in coastal floodplain ecosystems. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to simulate the pore water salinity of a tidal floodplain in Florida. We present an approach based on embedding theory with mutual information to reconstruct ANN model input time series from one system state variable. Mutual information between system output and input was computed and the local minimum mutual information points were used to determine a time lag vector for time series embedding and reconstruction, with which the mutual information weighted average method was developed to compute the components of reconstructed time series. The optimal embedding dimension was obtained by optimizing model performance. The method was applied to simulate soil pore water salinity dynamics at 12 probe locations in the tidal floodplain influenced by saltwater intrusion using 4 years (2005-2008) data, in which adjacent river water salinity was used to reconstruct model input. The simulated electrical conductivity of the pore water showed close agreement with field observations (RMSE <= 0.031 S/m and R-2 >= 0.897), suggesting the reconstructed input by the proposed approach provided adequate input information for ANN modeling. Multiple linear regression model, partial mutual information algorithm for input variable selection, k-NN algorithm, and simple time delay embedding were also used to further verify the merit of the proposed approach.

AB Continuing worldwide growth in results from paired-catchment vegetation-change experiments raises the possibility of improving empirical predictions of change in annual water yield. However, the results are variable, and a large amount of variation in change in annual yield is not explained by relationships derived from the results. We investigated causes of this unexplained variation (scatter), for relationships between change in annual yield and precipitation, and proposed procedures for improving the strength and accuracy of the relationships. Results from 35 New Zealand experiments were used to investigate three possible causes of the scatter: inter-annual variability of precipitation, heterogeneity arising from combining increases and decreases in annual yield, and heterogeneity from mixing different forms of reported change in annual yield. We also investigated the significance of data gaps (uneven distribution of results across the full range of precipitation values). Inter-annual variability of precipitation was the most important of the causes of scatter investigated. Scatter was reduced (44% increase in R-2) by relating maximum change in annual yield to the annual precipitation for the year of the maximum, rather than to mean annual precipitation. Small sample size was found to be a more serious problem in the development of predictive relationships than heterogeneity of change in annual yield data; however, the accuracy of prediction can be increased by homogenisation of the change in annual yield data using transformation equations. We also found that data gaps can decrease the accuracy of the predictive relationships, but, in general, have no effect on the amount of variation explained. Our main conclusion was that annual precipitation in the year of maximum change in annual yield should be included as an explanatory variable in empirical predictive relationships. We also recommend that, before developing relationships, basic data from all experiments be re-analysed using a consistent methodology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we propose upscaling method for nonlinear Forchheimer flow in heterogeneous porous media. The generalized Forchheimer law is considered for incompressible and slightly-compressible single-phase flows. We use recently developed analytical results (Aulisa et al., 2009) [I] and formulate the resulting system in terms of a degenerate nonlinear flow equation for the pressure with the nonlinearity depending on the pressure gradient. The coarse scale parameters for the steady state problem are determined so that the volumetric average of velocity of the flow in the domain on fine scale and on coarse scale are close. A flow-based coarsening approach is used, where the equivalent permeability tensor is first evaluated following streamline methods for linear cases, and modified in order to take into account the nonlinear effects. Compared to previous works (Garibotti and Peszynska, 2009) [2], (Durlofsky and Karimi-Fard) [3], this approach can be combined with rigorous mathematical upscaling theory for monotone operators, (Efendiev et al., 2004) [4], using our recent theoretical results (Aulisa et al., 2009) [1]. The developed upscaling algorithm for nonlinear steady state problems is effectively used for variety of heterogeneities in the domain of computation. Direct numerical computations for average velocity and productivity index justify the usage of the coarse scale parameters obtained for the special steady state case in the fully transient problem. For nonlinear case analytical upscaling formulas in stratified domain are obtained. Numerical results were compared to these analytical formulas and proved to be highly accurate.

AB Rainfall and flood data are relatively sparse in semi-arid areas; hence there have been relatively few investigations into the relationships between rainfall inputs and flood generation in these environments. Previous work has shown that flood properties are influenced by a combination of precipitation characteristics including amount, intensity, duration and spatial distribution. Therefore floods may be produced by high intensity, short duration storms, or longer duration, low intensity rainfall. Most of this research has been undertaken in small catchments in either hyper-arid or relatively high rainfall Mediterranean climates. This paper presents results from a 6 year data record in south-east Spain from research conducted in two basins, the Rambla Nogalte (171 km(2)) and the Rambla de Torrealvilla (200 km(2)). Data cover an area of approximately 500 km(2) and an annual average rainfall of 300 mm. At coarse temporal resolutions gauges spread over large areas record similar patterns of rainfall, although spells of rain show much more complexity; pulses of rain within storms can vary considerably in total rainfall, intensity and duration over the same area. The analysis for south-east Spain shows that most storms occur over a period of less than 24 h, but that the number of rainfall events declines as the duration exceeds 8 h. This is at odds with data on floods for the study area suggesting that they are produced by storms lasting longer than 18 h. However, one flood event was produced by a very short (15 min) storm with high intensity rainfall. Most floods tended to occur in May/June or September, which coincides with wetter months of the year (September, October, December and May). Floods are also more highly related to the total rainfall occurring in a spell of rain, than to intensity. The complexity of storm rainfall increases with the storm total, which makes it difficult to generalize on the importance of rainfall intensity for flood generation.

TI Asymptotic analysis of nonlinear equilibrium solute transport in porous

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB We discuss the asymptotic behavior of a solute plume undergoing reversible sorption governed by a Freundlich isotherm after single-pulse injection. Our analysis predicts that the concentration at a fixed position decays asymptotically like a power law with an exponent alpha = 1/(1 - n) where n is the Freundlich exponent. Correspondingly, the shape of tail is time invariant. The results are checked by comparison with numerical solutions for one-dimensional transport in a homogeneous medium. Some further asymptotic results for this case are derived. The power law behavior provides an alternative way to derive the Freundlich n parameter from breakthrough curves in comparison to the use of inverse estimation methods. This is especially the case when evaluating breakthrough curves obtained in mio;or three-dimensional flow domains, for which indirect estimation of parameters becomes very difficult.

AB Over an eight-year period (1984-1991), seven experimental lysimeters filled with different soil materials from the State of Bavaria (quartz and tertiary sands, quartz and fluvioglacial gravels) were used to study water flow and tracer transport through the unsaturated zone under natural atmospheric conditions. The experiments were performed in the input-output mode using weekly water flow and tracer contents (environmental deuterium) in the precipitation and in the outflow in order to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic and transport parameters of the soils with limited measured data. This paper (Part 1) presents the evaluation of soil hydraulic parameters for tested soils, while the second paper (Part 2) is concerned with the estimation of transport parameters (dispersion, water content and possible zones with stagnant water). The estimation of the soil physical characteristics, i.e. the relationship between water pressure head and water content, performed by applying the van Genuchten model, showed a satisfactory accuracy against the measured data. Determination of the hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content using the van Genuchten-Mualem conductivity model did not yield good results, due to the fact that the theoretical water flow model based on such soil parameters was not able to fit the measured values of water content at the upper 20 cm and the cumulative water outflow simultaneously. To estimate the conductivity-water content characteristics, the inverse modelling technique was used for each lysimeter. The cumulative outflow curves were fitted to the observed outflow data by a trial-and-error procedure using the conductivity-water content relationship as the fitting function. It was shown that this method of estimating the soil characteristics yields parameters which are closer to the true values compared to those found in small-scale column experiments. The soil characteristics obtained in this part of the study were further used for modelling environmental deuterium transport through the soils (Part 2).

AB A reactive transport model was developed to simulate reaction of carbonates within a pore network for the high-pressure CO2-acidified conditions relevant to geological carbon sequestration. The pore network was based on a synthetic oolithic dolostone. Simulation results produced insights that can inform continuum-scale models regarding reaction-induced changes in permeability and porosity. As expected, permeability increased extensively with dissolution caused by high concentrations of carbonic acid, but neither pH nor calcite saturation state alone was a good predictor of the effects, as may sometimes be the case. Complex temporal evolutions of interstitial brine chemistry and network structure led to the counterintuitive finding that a far-from-equilibrium solution produced less permeability change than a nearer-to-equilibrium solution at the same pH. This was explained by the pH buffering that increased carbonate ion concentration and inhibited further reaction. Simulations of different flow conditions produced a nonunique set of permeability-porosity relationships. Diffusive-dominated systems caused dissolution to be localized near the inlet, leading to substantial porosity change but relatively small permeability change. For the same extent of porosity change caused from advective transport, the domain changed uniformly, leading to a large permeability change. Regarding precipitation, permeability changes happen much slower compared to dissolution-induced changes and small amounts of precipitation, even if located only near the inlet, can lead to large changes in permeability. Exponent values for a power law that relates changes in permeability and porosity ranged from 2 to 10, but a value of 6 held constant when conditions led to uniform changes throughout the domain.

AB Understanding non-Darcian flow of shear-thinning fluids through rough-walled rock fractures is of vital importance in a number of industrial applications such as hydrogeology or petroleum engineering. Different laws are available to express the deviations from linear Darcy law due to inertial pressure losses. In particular, Darcy's law is often extended through addition of quadratic and cubic terms weighted by two inertial coefficients depending on the strength of the inertia regime. The relations between the effective shear viscosity of the fluid and the apparent viscosity in porous media when inertial deviations are negligible were extensively studied in the past. However, only recent numerical works have investigated the superposition of both inertial and shear-thinning effects, finding that the same inertial coefficients obtained for non-Darcian Newtonian flow applied in the case of shear-thinning fluids. The objective of this work is to experimentally validate these results, extending their applicability to the case of rough-walled rock fractures. To do so, flow experiments with aqueous polymer solutions have been conducted using replicas of natural fractures, and the effects of polymer concentration, which determine the shear rheology of the injected fluid, have been evaluated. Our findings show that the experimental pressure loss-flow rate data for inertial flow of shear-thinning fluids can be successfully predicted from the empirical parameters obtained during non-Darcian Newtonian flow and Darcian shear-thinning flow in a given porous medium.

AB We studied the relationships between streamwater chemistry and the topography of subcatchments in the Dorokawa watershed in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, to examine the use of topography as a predictor of streamwater chemistry in a watershed with relatively moderate terrain compared with other regions of Japan. Topographic characteristics of the Dorokawa watershed and its subcatchments were expressed as topographic index (TI) values, which ranged from 4.5 to 20.4 for individual grid cells (50 x 50 m(2)), but averaged from 6.4 to 7.4 for the 20 subcatchments. Streamwater samples for chemical analyses were collected four times between June and October 2002 from 20 locations in the watershed. The pH of water that passed through the watershed increased from similar to 5.0 to 7.0, with major increases in Na+ and Ca2+ and marked decreases in NO3- and SO42-. Distinctive spatial patterns were observed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and NO3 concentrations of streamwater across the watershed. Statistical analyses indicated significant linear relationships between the average TI values of subcatchments and DOC, DON, and NO3- concentrations. Furthermore, the proportion of DOC in streamwaters in the wet season increased with TI values relative to other nitrogen species, whereas NO3- concentrations decreased with TI. The gradients of soil wetness and the presence of wetlands explained many of the observed spatial and temporal patterns of DOC, DON, and NO3- concentrations in the surface waters of the Dorokawa watershed. Our results suggest that the TI is especially useful for predicting the spatial distribution of DOC, DON and NO3- in the surface waters of Hokkaido, where topographical relief is moderate and wetlands more common than in other regions of Japan.

AB Water infiltrating during intense rainfall on steep slopes gradually weakens the wet soil mass, inducing localized failures that may initiate a cascade of load redistributions and successive failures propagating across a hillslope. The challenge of linking the progressive nature of local events culminating in an abrupt landslide is addressed by a new hydromechanical triggering model that links key hydrologic processes with threshold-based mechanical interactions. A hillslope is represented as assembly of soil columns interconnected by frictional and tensile mechanical bonds represented as virtual bundles of fibers. Increasing water load exerted on mechanical bonds causes gradual failure of fibers until restraining forces are exceeded. Following failure at the soil-bedrock interface, the load on a column is redistributed to its neighbors via intact mechanical (primarily tensile) bonds which, in turn, may also fail and transmit the load downslope as compressive stresses. When soil internal compressive strength is exceeded, a load-bearing column may liquefy and initiate a landslide release that could propagate downslope or retrogressively upslope. The model reproduces observed power law frequency magnitude relationships of landslides with exponents ranging between -1.0 and -2.2 in agreement with landslide inventory data. We applied a criticality measure defined by Ramos (2011) to evaluate the specific influences of slope angle, soil texture, and root reinforcement on attainment of hillslope criticality in which a small local failure may trigger release of a large soil mass. The model provides new insights on the conditions giving rise to an abrupt transition from a seemingly stable hillslope to a catastrophic landslide.

AB Understanding the relationships between extreme daily and sub-daily rainfall events and their governing factors is important in order to analyse the properties of extreme rainfall events in a changing climate. Atmospheric temperature is one of the dominant climate variables which has a strong relationship with extreme rainfall events. In this study, a temperature-rainfall binning technique is used to evaluate the dependency of extreme rainfall on daily maximum temperature. The Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation was found to describe the relationship between daily maximum temperature and a range of rainfall durations from 6 min up to 24 h for seven Australian weather stations, the stations being located in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The analysis shows that the rainfall-temperature scaling varies with location, temperature and rainfall duration. The Darwin Airport station shows a negative scaling relationship, while the other six stations show a positive relationship. To identify the trend in scaling relationship over time the same analysis is conducted using data covering 10 year periods. Results indicate that the dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature also varies with the analysis period. Further, this dependency shows an increasing trend for more extreme short duration rainfall and a decreasing trend for average long duration rainfall events at most stations. Seasonal variations of the scale changing trends were analysed by categorizing the summer and autumn seasons in one group and the winter and spring seasons in another group. Most of 99th percentile of 6 min, 1 h and 24 h rain durations at Perth, Melbourne and Sydney stations show increasing trend for both groups while Adelaide and Darwin show decreasing trend. Furthermore, majority of scaling trend of 50th percentile are decreasing for both groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solute transport in rivers has been traditionally represented using one-dimensional models assuming advection and Fickian dispersion along the main flow direction and transient storage in surface and subsurface dead zones. Experimental evidence from several stream tracer studies has shown that the longitudinal scaling of the moments of the breakthrough curves (BTCs) is inconsistent with classic 1-D solute transport models. In this work, simulations of advection and diffusion in a 2-D and 3-D channel flow over a porous bed are presented assuming an exponentially attenuated profile of the transverse mixing coefficient in the porous medium, as suggested by recent experimental and numerical studies. It is shown that the longitudinal transport in the channel is superdiffusive, and the skewness of the concentration distributions can be almost constant over a broad temporal range, with no sign of approaching zero at large times. A sensitivity analysis shows that, at large times, longitudinal dispersion is controlled by the cross-sectional profile of the in-bed transverse mixing coefficient, and by the difference between the average velocity in the channel and in the porous bed. The normalized concentration distributions can be approximated by beta-distributions with time-dependent parameters, and relationships are derived between the scaling of the parameters under power-law approximation and the scaling of the spatial and temporal moments. The results provide new insights into the physical mechanisms that control the anomalous scaling of the moments observed in field tracer studies and opens new possibilities for predictive and inverse modeling of transport processes in rivers and their catchments.

AB We investigated controls on concentration-discharge relationships of a catchment underlain by argillite by monitoring both groundwater along a hillslope transect and stream chemistry. Samples were collected at 1-3 day intervals over 4 years (2009-2013) in Elder Creek in the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in California. Runoff at our study hillslope is driven by vadose zone flux through deeply weathered argillite (5-25 m thick) to a perched, seasonally dynamic groundwater that then drains to Elder Creek. Low flow derives from the slowly draining deepest perched groundwater that reaches equilibrium between primary and secondary minerals and saturation with calcite under high subsurface pCO(2). Arriving winter rains pass through the thick vadose zone, where they rapidly acquire solutes via cation exchange reactions (driven by high pCO(2)), and then recharge the groundwater that delivers runoff to the stream. These new waters displayed lower solute concentrations than the deep groundwater by less than a factor of 5 (except for Ca). Up to 74% of the total annual solute flux is derived from the vadose zone. The deep groundwater's Ca concentration decreased as it exfiltrates to the stream due to CO2 degassing and this Ca loss is equivalent of 30% of the total chemical weathering flux of Elder Creek. The thick vadose zone in weathered bedrock and the perched groundwater on underlying fresh bedrock result in two distinct processes that lead to the relatively invariant (chemostatic) concentration-discharge behavior. The processes controlling solute chemistry are not evident from stream chemistry and runoff analysis alone.

AB Knowledge of porosity and saturation-dependent thermal conductivities is necessary to investigate heat and water transfer in natural porous media such as rocks and soils. Thermal conductivity in a porous medium is affected by the complicated relationship between the topology and geometry of the pore space and the solid matrix. However, as water content increases from completely dry to fully saturated, the effect of the liquid phase on thermal conductivity may increase substantially. Although various methods have been proposed to model the porosity and saturation dependence of thermal conductivity, most are empirical or quasiphysical. In this study, we present a theoretical upscaling framework from percolation theory and the effective-medium approximation, which is called percolation-based effective-medium approximation (P-EMA). The proposed model predicts the thermal conductivity in porous media from endmember properties (e.g., air, solid matrix, and saturating fluid thermal conductivities), a scaling exponent, and a percolation threshold. In order to evaluate our porosity and saturation-dependent models, we compare our theory with 193 porosity-dependent thermal conductivity measurements and 25 saturation-dependent thermal conductivity data sets and find excellent match. We also find values for the scaling exponent different than the universal value of 2, in insulator-conductor systems, and also different from 0.76, the exponent in conductor-superconductor mixtures, in three dimensions. These results indicate that the thermal conductivity under fully and partially saturated conditions conforms to nonuniversal behavior. This means the value of the scaling exponent changes from medium to medium and depends not only on structural and geometrical properties of the medium but also characteristics (e.g., wetting or nonwetting) of the saturating fluid.

AB In this study, the patterns of past and future drought occurrences in the Seoul region were analysed using observed historical data from the Seoul weather station located in the Korean Peninsula and four different types of general circulation models (GCMs), namely, GFDL:CM2_1, CONS:ECHO-G, MRI:CGCM2_3_2 and UKMO:HADGEM1. To analyse statistical properties such as drought frequency duration and return period, the Standardized Precipitation Index was used to derive the severity-duration-frequency (SDF) curve from the drought frequency analysis. In addition, a drought spell analysis was conducted to estimate the frequency and change of drought duration for each drought classification. The results of the analysis suggested a decrease in the frequency of mild droughts and an increase in the frequency of severe and extreme droughts in the future. Furthermore, the average duration of droughts is expected to increase. A comparison of the SDF relationship derived from the observed data with that derived via the GCMs indicated that the drought severity for each return period was reduced as drought duration increased and that the drought severity derived from the GCMs was severer than the severity obtained using the observed data for the same duration and return period. Furthermore, among the four types of GCMs used in this study, the MRI model predicted the most severe future drought for the Seoul region, and the SDF curve derived using the MRI model also resulted in the highest degree of drought severity compared with the other GCMs. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Aquifer drainage was numerically simulated by a coupled, unsaturated-saturated flow equation. The effect of the vadose zone on aquifer parameter predictions of classical hydraulic theory was investigated. Saturated-zone hydraulic theory was shown to be fairly robust in estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity but less so in estimating drainable porosity, mainly because of the much tighter possible range for the latter. Application of the coupled flow equation may explain discrepancies between predictions of classical saturated-zone theory and observations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work is to explore the use of flow dimensions as a toot for characterizing hydraulic conditions in faulted media. Transient flow is numerically simulated in synthetic vertically-faulted reservoirs. Analysis of the obtained time series following the Generalized Radial Flow (GRF) model displays combined radial and fractional signals with a flow dimension n = 1.5. Investigating the transient geometry of the frontal equipotential surface shows that fractional flow occurrence is due to abnormal fault diffusion as a consequence of water supply from the matrix under specific conditions. An original hydrodynamical explanation for fractional flow in vertically faulted media is suggested, along with a reinterpretation of the bilinear regime. It is shown that the GRF theory remains valid in such discontinuum as the fundamental relationship between n and the cross-flow area is satisfied. These results provide insights in the use of the flow dimension as a hydraulic diagnostic tool in faulted media. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological system analyses are challenged by complexities of irregular nonlinearities, data uncertainties, and multivariate dependencies. Among them, the irregular nonlinearities mainly represent inexistence of regular functions for robustly simulating highly complicated relationships between variables. Few existing studies can enable reliable simulation of hydrological processes under these complexities. This may lead to decreased robustness of the constructed models, unfeasibility of suggestions for human activities, and damages to socio-economy and eco-environment. In the first of two companion papers, a discrete principal-monotonicity inference (DPMI) method is proposed for hydrological systems analysis under these complexities. Normalization of non-normally distributed samples and invertible restoration of modelling results are enabled through a discrete distribution transformation approach. To mitigate data uncertainties, statistical inference is employed to assess the significance of differences among samples. The irregular nonlinearity between the influencing factors (i.e. predictors) and the hydrological variable of interest (i.e. the predictand) is interpreted as piecewise monotonicity. Monotonicity is further represented as principal monotonicity under multivariate dependencies. Based on stepwise classification and cluster analyses, all paired samples representing the responsive relationship between the predictors and the predictand are discretized as a series of end nodes. A prediction approach is advanced for estimating the predictand value given any combination of predictors. The DPMI method can reveal evolvement rules of hydrological systems under these complexities. Reliance of existing hydro-system analysis methods on predefined functional forms is removed, avoiding artificial disturbances, e.g. empiricism in selecting model functions under irregular nonlinearities, on the modelling process. Both local and global significances of predictors in driving the evolution of hydrological variables are identified. An analysis of interactions among these complexities is also achieved. The understanding obtained from the DPMI process and associated results can facilitate hydrological prediction, guide water resources management, improve hydro-system analysis methods, or support hydrological systems analysis in other cases. The effectiveness and advantages of DPMI will be demonstrated through a case study of streamflow simulation in Xingshan Watershed, China, in another paper. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB It is well known that relative permeabilities can depend on the flow configuration and they are commonly lower during counter-current flow as compared to co-current flow. Conventional models must deal with this by manually changing the relative permeability curves depending on the observed flow regime. In this paper we use a novel two-phase momentum-equation-approach based on general mixture theory to generate effective relative permeabilities where this dependence (and others) is automatically captured. In particular, this formulation includes two viscous coupling effects: (i) Viscous drag between the flowing phases and the stagnant porous rock; (ii) viscous drag caused by momentum transfer between the flowing phases. The resulting generalized model will predict that during co-current flow the faster moving fluid accelerates the slow fluid, but is itself decelerated, while for counter-current flow they are both decelerated. The implications of these mechanisms are demonstrated by investigating recovery of oil from a matrix block surrounded by water due to a combination of gravity drainage and spontaneous imbibition, a situation highly relevant for naturally fractured reservoirs. We implement relative permeability data obtained experimentally through co-current flooding experiments and then explore the model behavior for different flow cases ranging from counter-current dominated to co-current dominated. In particular, it is demonstrated how the proposed model seems to offer some possible interesting improvements over conventional modeling by providing generalized mobility functions that automatically are able to capture more correctly different flow regimes for one and the same parameter set.

AB The groundwater contamination risk in future climates was investigated at three locations in Sweden. Solute transport penetration depths were simulated using the HYDRUS-1D model using historical data and an ensemble of climate projections including two global climate models (GCMs), three emission scenarios and one regional climate model. Most projections indicated increasing precipitation and evapotranspiration until mid-century with a further increase at end-century. Results showed both increasing and decreasing groundwater contamination risks depending on emission scenario and GCM. Generally, the groundwater contamination risk is likely to be unchanged until mid-century, but higher at the end of the century. Soil and site specific relationships between Delta(P - PET) (i.e. change in the difference between precipitation, P, and potential evapotranspiration, PET) and changes in solute transport depths were determined. Using this, changes in solute transport depths for other climate projections can be assessed.

AB This study examined the effects of herbaceous plant roots on interrill erosion using two herbaceous species: clover (Trifolium repens) and oats (Avena sativa). We developed a simple rainfall simulator with relatively high normalized kinetic energy (KE; 23.2Jm(-2) mm(-1)). Under simulated rainfall, we measured eroded soil for 42 boxes with various amounts of aboveground and belowground biomass. Aboveground vegetation had a significant effect on the soil erosion rate (SER). We found a clear negative relationship between the percent vegetation cover (c) and the SER. In contrast, plant roots showed no effects on the SER. The SER was not significantly different between the boxes with and without plant roots under similar c conditions. Thus, plant roots could have less of an effect on the SER under higher KE conditions.

AB The logarithmic layer of double-averaged (in time and space) streamwise velocity profiles obtained from field measurements made in the Swiss rivers, Venoge and Chamberonne is parameterized and discussed. Velocity measurements were made using a 3D Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler. Both riverbeds are hydraulically rough, composed of coarse gravel, with relative submergences (h/D-50) of 5.25 and 5.96, respectively. From the observations, the flow may be divided into three different layers: a roughness layer near the bed, an equivalent logarithmic layer and a surface or outer layer. It was found that a logarithmic law can describe the double-averaged profiles in the layer 0.30 < z/h < 0.75. The parameterization of the logarithmic law is discussed. Special emphasis is given to the geometric parameters roughness and zero-displacement heights and to the equivalent von Karman constant. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A semi-distributed model with a parallel connection was applied to examine the effects of urbanization variables. Data were obtained from watershed divisions that were characterized by various degrees of urbanization. The mean rainfall was calculated using the kriging method. The model inputs were obtained by subtracting mean rainfall from Phi-index values, based on the spatially uniform loss assumption. Regression analysis was applied to determine the relationship between the parameters of 64 calibrations and urbanization variables among the divisions. The results showed that overland parameters produced more consistent change in response to imperviousness than to population. Conversely, the channel parameter was unaffected by changes in urbanization. The verification results of 46 cases showed that power linkage was a potential option for linking division parameters with the corresponding imperviousness based on four evaluation criteria. The changes in imperviousness on overland parameters show the hydrological effects of division urbanizations.

AB Structural hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of natural porous media. Yet it provokes one of the grand challenges for the modeling of fluid flow and transport since pore-scale structures and continuum-scale domains often coincide independent of the observation scale. Common approaches to represent structural hierarchy build, for example, on a multidomain continuum for transport or on the coupling of the Stokes equations with Darcy's law for fluid flow. These approaches, however, are computationally expensive or introduce empirical parameters that are difficult to derive with independent observations. We present an efficient model for fluid flow based on Darcy's law and the law of Hagen-Poiseuille that is parameterized based on the explicit pore space morphology obtained, for example, by X-ray -CT and inherently permits the coupling of pore-scale and continuum-scale domain. We used the resulting flow field to predict the transport of solutes via particle tracking across the different domains. Compared to experimental breakthrough data from laboratory-scale columns with hierarchically structured porosity built from solid glass beads and microporous glass pellets, an excellent agreement was achieved without any calibration. Furthermore, we present different test scenarios to compare the flow fields resulting from the Stokes-Brinkman equations and our approach to comprehensively illustrate its advantages and limitations. In this way, we could show a striking efficiency and accuracy of our approach that qualifies as general alternative for the modeling of fluid flow and transport in hierarchical porous media, for example, fractured rock or karstic aquifers.

   SHAPE; DISCHARGE; FLOW; NONLINEARITY; DERIVATION; NETWORKS
AB We investigate the role of cross-section geometry in flow routing by developing an analytical framework based on the instantaneous response function (IRF) and relationships of river basin geomorphology. The cross-section geometry is included explicitly within the framework by assuming a power law cross section that is, in turn, used to derive expressions for the at-a-site hydraulic geometry. The analysis performed using the Illinois River basin indicates that the cross-section geometry takes on different roles depending on whether flows are in the channel or floodplain. The cross-section geometry where width dominates over depth (width dominant), i.e., the at-a-site width-depth ratio increases with increasing depth, tends to produce a larger network celerity and dispersion for the channel, and the trend reverses for the high floodplain flows. We found that the cross-section geometry can influence the relative contribution of hydrodynamic and kinematic dispersion. For the channel, the depth-dominant cross section produces a lower hydrodynamic dispersion than the width-dominant cross section and vice versa for the floodplain. We found that the nonlinear dependence of the IRF on effective rainfall, expressed in the IRF time to peak and peak flow, may vary depending on the cross-section geometry, with the nonlinearity decreasing for the width-dominant cross sections. Additionally, the effect of cross-section geometry on the basin response can alter the relative contribution of the stream network and hillslopes to the basin dispersion. The derived framework has potential as an a priori tool for incorporating channel and floodplain geometry into distributed rainfall-runoff models.

AB Droughts are natural phenomena that severely affect socio economic and ecological systems. In Chile, population and economic activities are highly concentrated in its central region (i.e. between latitudes 29 degrees S and 40 degrees S), which periodically suffers from severe droughts affecting agriculture, hydropower, and mining. Understanding the dynamics of droughts and large-scale atmospheric processes that influence the occurrence of dry spells is essential for forecasting and efficient early detection of drought events. Central Chile's climate is marked by a significant El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence that might help to better characterize droughts as well as to identify the effects of ENSO on the spatial and temporal characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in the region. We analysed the behaviour of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) time series for 6-month accumulation periods over the austral winter and summer seasons. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) showed a significant ENSO influence on dry events for SPEI-6 and SSI-6 during winter and summer. We found that the magnitude of correlation between ENSO and SPEI-6 has changed over the last decades becoming weaker in winter periods and increasing in spring summer periods. Increasing trends in meteorological and hydrological drought events were also identified, along all latitudes, with significant trends during winter in the southern latitudes, and during summer in the semi-arid and Mediterranean zones. These results indicate that drought mitigation actions and policies are necessary to overcome their adverse effects. Given the monthly persistence of ENSO and its relationship to drought indices, there are opportunities for drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting that could become part of national drought management systems.

AB This work is concerned with the intricate interplay between node or pore pressures and connection or throat conductivities in flow or pore networks. A setting similar to pore networks is given by fracture networks. Recently, a non-local generalization of Darcy's law for flow and transport in porous media was presented in the context of unbounded or periodic pore networks. In this work, we first outline a robust method for the extraction of the hydraulic conductivity distribution, which is at the heart of the non-local Darcy formulation. Second, a theory for mean pressure and flow in bounded networks is outlined. Predictions of that theory are validated against numerical network results and it is demonstrated that the theory works well for networks with high connectivity involving pores with high coordination numbers. For other networks, improvements to the outlined theory are proposed and their accuracy is assessed.

DE Stochastic hydrogeology; Effective conductivity; Binary random media;

ID FLOW; PERMEABILITY; TRANSPORT
AB We develop a phenomenological model for the effective conductivity of porous media that consist of two distinct materials characterized by different values of hydraulic conductivity. Our focus is two-fold: first, to relate the terms and parameters of macroscale conductivity to the spatial variability of local flow and conductivity observed in computational experiments, and second to develop a reduced order model for effective conductivity based on those observations. Darcys law is assumed to hold at local (mesoscopic) and large (macroscopic) scales. At the mesoscale a composite medium is a configuration of irregular subdomains consisting of two different materials. The resulting heterogeneities force fluid to flow along irregular paths, and this produces spatial variability in the magnitude and the orientation of the Darcy flux. This variability, along with the macroscopic effective conductivity, depends on the proportion of the total volume allocated to each material, the ratio of the two conductivity values, and the spatial connectivity of material subvolumes. Computational experiments indicate that the effects of heterogeneity are most pronounced when the two conductivity values are very different, and when the volume fraction of the more conducive material is near a percolation threshold. The percolation threshold is the critical volume fraction of the more conducive material at which the medium is no longer traversed by connected paths through that material. The percolation threshold determines the existence of three regimes in effective conductivity, two where the effective conductivity obeys power laws and is dominated by one of the materials, and a third intermediate regime that interpolates between the power laws.

AB This paper presents hydrochemical data of an AMD stream, Poderosa Creek, in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, obtained between its source, in the Poderosa Mine portal, and its confluence with the Odiel River. The main objective is to establish potential interdependent relationships between sulphate and metal loads and the following physico-chemical variables: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), redox potential (EH) and dissolved oxygen (DO). All the parameters show an overall increasing tendency from the tunnel exit to the confluence at the Odiel River. The TDS and EC are two relevant exceptions. They behave similarly, showing a decreasing trend and a strong inflection that describes a minimum immediately after the discharging point. Spatial analysis combined with statistical tools reveal typical AMD processes and the respective physico-chemical implications. Inputs with distinctive hydrochemical signatures impose relevant modifications in the Poderosa Creek waters. This indicates low hydrochemical inertia and high vulnerability to external stimuli.

AB The Yellow River headwaters region (YRHR) contributes nearly 40% of total flow in the Yellow River basin, which is suffering from a serious water shortage problem. Investigation of the relationship between runoff and climate variables is important for understanding the variation trend of runoff in the YRHR under global climate change. Global and local climate variables, including the West Pacific subtropical high; northern hemisphere polar vortex (NH); Tibetan Plateau Index B (TPI-B); southern oscillation index; sea surface temperature; and precipitation, evaporation, and temperature, were fully considered to explore the relationship with runoff at Jimai, Maqu, and Tangnaihai stations from 1956 to 2014. The results reveal that runoff had a decreasing trend, which will likely be maintained in the future, and there was a significant change in runoff around 1995 at all stations. Correlation analysis indicated that runoff was dominated by precipitation, NH, temperature, and TPI-B, and a substantial correlation was observed with sea surface temperature and evaporation, but there was little correlation with West Pacific subtropical high and southern oscillation index. Furthermore, impacts of climate change on runoff variations were distinctly different at different temporal scales. Three dominant runoff periodicities were identified by a singular spectrum analysis-multitaper method and continuous wavelet transform, that is, 1.0-, 6.9-, and 24.8-year runoff periodicities. In addition, runoff was positively correlated with temperature at a 1-year periodicity, negatively correlated with TPI-B at a 6.9-year periodicity, and positively correlated with NH at a 24.8-year periodicity, that is, temperature, TPI-B, and NH-controlled runoff at annual, interannual, and interdecadal scales. Further, all analyses of the stations in the YRHR showed excellent consistency. The results will provide valuable information for water resource management in the YRHR.

AB We consider a one-dimensional, unconfined groundwater flow equation for the horizontal propagation of water. This equation was derived by using a particular form of the Forchheimer equation in place of Darcy's Law. Such equations can model turbulent flows in coarse and fractured porous media. For power-law head, exponential head, power-law flux and exponential flux boundary conditions at the inlet, the problems can be reduced, using similarity transformations, to boundary-value problems for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We construct quadratic and cubic approximate solutions of these problems. We also numerically compute solutions using a new modification of a method of Shampine, which exploits scaling properties of the governing equation. The polynomial approximate solutions replicate well the numerical solutions and they are easy to use. Last, we compare the predicted wetting front positions from our quadratic and cubic polynomials to predictions based on Adomian polynomials of the same degrees. The work demonstrates the value of polynomial approximate solutions for validating numerical solutions and for obtaining good approximations for water profiles and the extent of water propagation. This work also presents a new application of Shampine's method for this type of groundwater flow equation. We note that this paper introduces additional classes of approximate solutions for the Forchheimer equation. Up to this date, not many solutions are known, especially for the transient cases considered here.

TI delta O-18 as a tracer of the main regularities of water mass mixing and
   transformation in the Barents, Kara, and Laptev seas

ID ISOTOPES; BALANCE; SHELF
AB When researching the mixing of two or more water masses and their subsequent transformation, ideally, the most conservative parameters are used. Since the 1970s, the isotopic parameter delta O-18 has been used in various oceanological research works for example: Ostlund and Hut (1984) [J. Geophys. Res., 89, 6373-6381] and many others.
   The use of the salinity value and delta O-18 allowed the construction of a three-component system ("classic") of equations (TSC). Nevertheless, in the work: Dubinina et al. (2019) [Okeanologiya, No. 1, 57. 38-48] it was demonstrated that "the application of the three-component mixing to modified waters causes an overestimation of river water input". A model of `mixing-modification', which eliminated this drawback, was presented in the work and the difference of estimation with the three-component system may be up to 20%. In the present study are also shown that the classic three-component system is fully applicable only under the conditions of ice melting, and under the conditions of ice formation estimates based on the three-component system give overestimated results of basic waters content in the final water mass. However, the methodology of sea water component composition estimation in this work differs slightly from the methodology presented in the above publication. A modified three-component system (TSM) presented in this work allows elimination of such inaccuracies. The difference between average values for the available series of observations according to TSC and TSM increases in the following order: Kara Sea > Laptev Sea > Barents Sea and the maximum difference for Atlantic waters and river waters (30.5% and 25.2%, respectively) was observed for Laptev Sea; 17.6% and 9.5%, respectively, for the Barents Sea and 16.3% for both components of the Kara Sea.
   To reveal newly formed water masses, a method of cluster analysis was applied. The composition of basic waters in the final water masses of the seas in question was obtained, as well as the values of these waters modification during ice formation or ice melting. General regularities of water masses formations in the discussed seas are delineated. An illustration of the average values of these magnitudes in water masses (clusters) in the system of coordinates content of: Atlantic Waters - river water- ice water for each sea had similar character, but their magnitudes differed depending on the different magnitude of the river runoff and different extent of these waters' modification during ice formation and ice melting.
   It is noteworthy that the value of "ice water" has an important scientific and practical significance, because it is used to summarise singular cycle values, and possibly, several observation cycles of ice formation while also being unique, maintaining the "memory" of the ice formation process values, which occurred in these waters.

AB Recently, there has been a revival in the development of models simulating coupled heat and water transport in cold regions. These models represent significant advances in our ability to simulate the sensitivity of permafrost environments to future climate change. However, there are considerable differences in model formulations arising from the diverse backgrounds of researchers and practitioners in this field. The variability in existing model formulations warrants a review and synthesis of the underlying theory to demonstrate the implicit assumptions and limitations of a particular approach. This contribution examines various forms of the Clapeyron equation, the relationship between the soil moisture curve and soil freezing curve, and processes for developing soil freezing curves and hydraulic conductivity models for partially frozen soils. Where applicable, results from recent laboratory tests are presented to demonstrate the validity of existing theoretical formulations. Identified variations in model formulations form the basis for briefly comparing and contrasting existing models. Several unresolved questions are addressed to highlight the need for further research in this rapidly expanding field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fault zones affect the flow paths of fluids in groundwater aquifers and geological reservoirs. Fault-related fracture damage decreases to background levels with increasing distance from the fault core according to a power law. This study investigated mass transport in such a fault-related structure using nonlocal models. A column flow experiment is conducted to create a permeability distribution that varies with distance from a main conduit. The experimental tracer response curve is preasymptotic and implies subdiffusive transport, which is slower than the normal Fickian diffusion. If the surrounding area is a finite domain, an upper truncated behavior in tracer response (i.e., exponential decline at late times) is observed. The tempered anomalous diffusion (TAD) model captures the transition from subdiffusive to Fickian transport, which is characterized by a smooth transition from power-law to an exponential decline in the late-time breakthrough curves.

ID NATURAL-RESOURCE SCARCITY; LAW RELEVANT; ECOLOGY
AB Neoclassical economics has only recently considered the problem of sustainability-how to provide for the well-being of future generations given ecological constraints. In general, the neoclassical economist perceives physical and ecological constraints on economy-environment interactions as inconveniences that will inevitably be overcome by substitution-the discovery of new economic resources or technologies allowing the conversion of noneconomic materials to economic goods. Ecologists and ecological economists, however, argue that the constraints will bind. The debate centres on the relevance of entropy to the economics of resource use: irrelevant in the neoclassical view, relevant in the ecological. This paper places entropy, within the context of neoclassical economic thought, as a limit to economic growth. The paper rigorously argues the existence of limits to knowledge and consequently to technology and substitution, undermining a basic assumption of neoclassical economics and establishing the relevance of entropy to economic theories of resource use.

AB We present an analytical method for calculating two-phase effective relative permeability, keff rj, where j designates phase (here CO2 and water), under steady state and capillary-limit assumptions. These effective relative permeabilities may be applied in experimental settings and for upscaling in the context of numerical flow simulations, e. g., for CO2 storage. An exact solution for effective absolute permeability, keff, in two-dimensional log-normally distributed isotropic permeability (k) fields is the geometric mean. We show that this does not hold for keff rj since log normality is not maintained in the capillary-limit phase permeability field (Kj5k krj) when capillary pressure, and thus the saturation field, is varied. Nevertheless, the geometric mean is still shown to be suitable for approximating keff rj when the variance of ln k is low. For highvariance cases, we apply a correction to the geometric average gas effective relative permeability using a Winsorized mean, which neglects large and small Kj values symmetrically. The analytical method is extended to anisotropically correlated log-normal permeability fields using power law averaging. In these cases, the Winsorized mean treatment is applied to the gas curves for cases described by negative power law exponents (flow across incomplete layers). The accuracy of our analytical expressions for keff rj is demonstrated through extensive numerical tests, using low-variance and high-variance permeability realizations with a range of correlation structures. We also present integral expressions for geometric-mean and power law average keff rj for the systems considered, which enable derivation of closed-form series solutions for keff rj without generating permeability realizations.

AB In this study, the trends of water discharge and sediment load from three hydrometric stations over the past 25 years of development in the state of Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia, were analysed using the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests. Landscape metrics for establishing the relationship between land-use changes and trends of hydrological time series were calculated. The hydrological trends were also studied in terms of rainfall variations and manmade features. The results indicate upward trends in water discharge in the Hulu Langat sub-basin and in sediment load in the Semenyih sub-basin. These increasing trends were mainly caused by rapid changes in land use. Upward trends of hydrological series in the Hulu Langat sub-basin matched its rainfall pattern. In the Lui sub-basin, however, trends of hydrological series, and variations in rainfall and land use were not statistically significant.

AB Grassland restored by re-vegetated shrub is an important ecosystem in desert steppe of Northwest China. Yet little is understood about the underlying eco-hydrological mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the re vegetated ecosystem. Based on the conversion relationships among throughfall, interception loss, and stemflow, we developed a method to analyze the dynamic responses of rainfall partitioning by vegetation canopies to precipitation variation, and the driving mechanisms for stemflow of two morphological distinct shrubs (unhealthy and healthy C. intermedia) during the 21 rainfall events (0-15 mm) in the period from 2016 to 2017. We found that the stemflow increased in a low-value stepwise manner with the increasing rainfall depth and eventually became scattered. Therefore, the response of stemflow to gross precipitation was divided into three stages by rainfall depth: initiation (0-2 mm), transition (2-6 mm), and scattered (6-15 mm). A significantly negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss, while the relationships of interception loss- stemflow and throughfall- stemflow exhibited a more complex nonlinear way with relatively weaker correlations. Rainfall depth and canopy area were two main factors driving the partitioning relationships. Non-precipitation meteorological factors were dominant in the 0-2 mm rainfall events, while rainfall factors were determinant in the 6-15 mm events. Morphological factors exerted more influences on the partitioning relationships for healthy C. intermedia. Overall, the conversion between throughfall and interception loss was the majority of dynamic rainfall partitioning; therefore, low and unstable stemflow was usually inevitable. The results indicate that the precipitation threshold for stemflow generation should be a range value instead of a specific value, and the rebuilt analysis roadmaps are essential for investigating stemflow using the thorough conversion relationships and the 'stepped' approach.

   MOVEMENT; HEAT; WIND; GAS
AB Previous experiments have demonstrated "enhanced'' water vapor fluxes from partially saturated porous media relative to fluxes predicted based on Fick's law. This led to various mechanistic and phenomenological enhancement factors to reconcile discrepancies between experiments and predictions. In the present study, analyses of abrupt transitions from liquid- to diffusion-controlled mass transport during evaporation from porous media is used to offer new insights regarding key assumptions and adequacy of experimental setups used to develop vapor transport enhancement factors. We reevaluate these concepts considering the role of capillary-induced liquid flow through the unsaturated zone in supplying the total fluxes. The extent and existence of hydraulic connections through the unsaturated zone has been predicted theoretically and demonstrated experimentally using high-resolution X-ray tomography of sand columns during evaporation. Extending these results to the late stages of evaporation from porous media shows simultaneous capillary induced liquid flow and vapor diffusion supplying the total vapor fluxes as validated by laboratory evaporation experiments. Additionally, analysis of evaporation from porous media provides well defined conditions for testing vapor transport based solely on Fick's law. New insights regarding transport mechanisms controlling evaporation rates from porous media emphasize the extended role of capillary flows beyond previously assumed models and may reconcile observations with prediction without invoking unobservable local thermal gradients and similar enhancement factors. We illustrate that considering the coupling between capillary flow and vapor diffusion predicted by Fick's law of diffusion without any enhancement factors is the essential key to estimate the total vapor flux.

TI Watershed hydrograph model based on surface flow diffusion
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLASH-FLOOD; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; ENHANCE; GIS
AB Based on the diffusion equation and Darcy's law, Criss and Winston (2008b) developed the one-parameter analytical subsurface flow diffusion hydrograph model to represent the theory of rapid displacement of "old" aquifer water and shallow pore water following rainfall events. We developed a two-parameter analytical surface flow diffusion hydrograph model for urban or other basins that generate surface runoff similar to flash floods following a sharp pulse of rainfall at the watershed inlet. The model uses two time parameters that are based on watershed scale, flow diffusivity, and flow celerity to control the shape of the hydrograph and time to discharge peak. The two-parameter analytical surface flow diffusion model was mathematically and experimentally compared with the one-parameter analytical subsurface diffusion hydrograph model proposed by Criss and Winston (2008b). We demonstrated that the one-parameter model represented one extreme case of the two-parameter model when the advection of subsurface flow was zero and that the two-parameter model was applicable for both surface and subsurface flow hydrograph simulations. The two-parameter model was tested on several watersheds and was shown to have a high efficiency in simulating hydrograph timing and peak discharge as well as in matching rising and falling limb inflection points. Fitting the two-parameter surface flow diffusion hydrograph model to a watershed runoff event helps to quantify the role of advective and diffusive transport on discharge and how it changes with changing storm and land cover characteristics.

TI Rescuing degrading aquifers in the Central Coastal Plain of North
   Carolina (USA): Just process, effective groundwater management policy,
   and sustainable aquifers
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID STAKEHOLDER VALUES; SCIENCE
AB Strategic management of degrading coastal aquifers in eastern North Carolina (USA) became imperative after a severe imbalance occurred between withdrawal and recharge rates. To ameliorate this growing problem, an aggressive water policy was developed through public input by creating the Central Coastal Plain Capacity Use Area (CCPCUA) to maintain beneficial use of groundwater resources. Insights from social psychology, and socio-legal studies are used to evaluate how procedural justice and public participation played major roles to resolving groundwater resource management problems. A mixed methods approach uses archival data and interviews with various rule-making participants to assess the process of stakeholder involvement that led to creation of the policy. In addition, data analysis techniques are utilized to evaluate the effects of the policy on aquifer health (through water levels) over a similar to 10 year period. Results suggest that not only did a stakeholder group participate in a process that was deemed fair, understandable, and relatively easy to administer for users and regulators, but public participation resulted in an effective plan that ensures the long-term sustainable use of groundwater. Declining groundwater withdrawals and recovering water levels suggest that the rule is achieving its intended goal of protecting the aquifers from depletion and degradation. This paper touches on global themes that are essential to water demand and consumption, water management techniques, and water resources protection.

AB This paper presents an optimization model to simulate short-term pair-wise spot-market trading of surface water abstraction licenses (water rights). The approach uses a node-arc multicommodity formulation that tracks individual supplier-receiver transactions in a water resource network. This enables accounting for transaction costs between individual buyer-seller pairs and abstractor-specific rules and behaviors using constraints. Trades are driven by economic demand curves that represent each abstractor's time-varying water demand. The purpose of the proposed model is to assess potential hydrologic and economic outcomes of water markets and aid policy makers in designing water market regulations. The model is applied to the Great Ouse River basin in Eastern England. The model assesses the potential weekly water trades and abstractions that could occur in a normal and a dry year. Four sectors (public water supply, energy, agriculture, and industrial) are included in the 94 active licensed water diversions. Each license's unique environmental restrictions are represented and weekly economic water demand curves are estimated. Rules encoded as constraints represent current water management realities and plausible stakeholder-informed water market behaviors. Results show buyers favor sellers who can supply large volumes to minimize transactions. The energy plant cooling and agricultural licenses, often restricted from obtaining water at times when it generates benefits, benefit most from trades. Assumptions and model limitations are discussed.

AB This paper addresses how much flood water can be conserved for use after the flood season through the operation of reservoir by taking into account the residual flood control capacity (the difference between flood conveyance capacity and the expected inflow in a lead time). A two-stage model for dynamic control of the flood-limited water level (the maximum allowed water level during the flood season, DC-FLWL) is established considering forecast uncertainty and acceptable flood risk. It is found that DC-FLWL is applicable when the reservoir inflow ranges from small to medium levels of the historical records, while both forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk in the downstream affect the feasible space of DC-FLWL. As forecast uncertainty increases (under a given risk level) or as acceptable risk level decreases (under a given forecast uncertainty level), the minimum required safety margin for flood control increases, and the chance for DC-FLWL decreases. The derived hedging rules from the modeling framework illustrate either the dominant role of water conservation or flood control or the trade-off between the two objectives under different levels of forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk. These rules may provide useful guidelines for conserving water from flood, especially in the area with heavy water stress. The analysis is illustrated via a case study with a real-world reservoir in northeastern China.

AB We offer an explanation of the strongly tailed solute breakthrough curve typically observed when a tracer test is conducted in fractured bedrock. In this example, we limit the model to a single planar fracture of varying aperture. Flow heterogeneity derives from variable fracture aperture, which implies variable transmissivity (T). The analysis employs a physically based model well-suited to strong heterogeneity and relies only upon advective transport. The purely advective model is able to explain a power-law trend of magnitude 2 to 3 in the breakthrough curve tail; a range that has been found in field tracer experiments. The principle cause of this trend is the comparatively slow, transport in zones of small transmissivity (tight aperture). Slow advection occurs when either heterogeneity (variance of In T) is strong or when the assumed heterogeneity distribution is non-Gaussian. Thus, we link breakthrough tailing to the statistical parameters for the transmissivity field. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study quantified the nitrogen inflow and outflow for the largest distributary basin of the Mississippi River, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin. The goal of the study was to seek answers to three critical questions: (a) Does the Atchafalaya River Swamp remove a significant amount of nitrogen from the overflowing water, or is it releasing more nitrogen into the Gulp (b) How do the nitrogen removal or release rates fluctuate seasonally and annually? (c) What are the relationships between the nitrogen removal capacity and the hydrological conditions in the basin such as river stage and discharge? By utilizing the long-term (1978-2002) river discharge and water quality data, monthly and annual nitrogen fluxes were quantified, and their relationships with the basin hydrological conditions investigated. A total nitrogen-sum of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO3+NO2)-mass input-output balance between the upstream (Simmesport) and downstream (Morgan City and Wax Lake Outlet) locations was established to examine the nitrogen removal potential for this, the largest freshwater swamp basin in North America. The results from this study showed that, over the past 25 years, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin acted as a source for NO3+NO2 nitrogen, although the average annual output of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (174 584 Mg) was only slightly higher (2.3%) than the average annual input of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (170 721 Mg). The higher NO3+NO2 mass outflow occurred throughout summer and autumn, indicating an active role of biological processes on nitrogen in the overflowing waters of the Atchafalaya. However, this swamp basin has served as a major sink for organic nitrogen: the annual averages of TKN mass input and output were 200 323 and 145 917 Mg year(-1), respectively, presenting a 27.2% removal rate by the basin. This large TKN reduction appeared high during springs and low during late summers, corresponding with the fluctuation of the hydrological conditions of the river.

AB Understanding and monitoring extreme events is essential, particularly in river discharges from the La Plata Basin, where a large percentage of the economic resources and population of the region are concentrated. In this article, we seek to quantify the relationship between extreme events in discharge and the seasonal climatic index NINO 3.4. We start by estimating the phase shift between the index and mean seasonal (trimester) discharge values. Based on this result, we align the series and use the copula method to fit a joint distribution. We end up with a model that is particularly useful for quantifying the probability of occurrence of extreme events and monitoring their return periods. As a final step, we generate predictions and validate the model by splitting the series into training and test datasets. We develop a simple effective model for monitoring discharges using the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.

AB A statistical study was made of the temporal trend in extreme rainfall in the region of Extremadura (Spain) during the period 1961-2009. A hierarchical spatio-temporal Bayesian model with a GEV parameterization of the extreme data was employed. The Bayesian model was implemented in a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that allows the posterior distribution of the parameters that intervene in the model to be estimated. The results show a decrease of extreme rainfall in winter and spring and a slight increase in autumn. The uncertainty in the trend parameters obtained with the hierarchical approach is much smaller than the uncertainties obtained from the GEV model applied locally. Also found was a negative relationship between the NAO index and the extreme rainfall in Extremadura during winter. An increase was observed in the intensity of the NAO index in winter and spring, and a slight decrease in autumn.

AB To explore and address complex water-related issues, true collaborative, interdisciplinary research at the interface of hydrology and social science is necessary. Accordingly, hydrologists are increasingly working with social sciences and becoming involved in fieldwork with participants. With the overarching aim of facilitating collaboration and interdisciplinary water research, here we discuss important considerations and guiding principles for hydrologists, both those new to and those already familiar with interdisciplinary research, who are: (i) involved in fieldwork with participants; and (ii) working more collaboratively with social scientists. Drawing on first-hand experiences, this paper combines theory and experience from hydrologists and social scientists from their various interdisciplinary research projects to better understand key ethical, theoretical and practical considerations when working with participants. Complementary to this, we discuss the barriers and opportunities in collaborative interdisciplinary research. Facilitating these practices and understandings for hydrologists is essential to strengthen collaboration and to develop more holistic, successful research.

AB The cause-effect relationship and rates of change of suspended sediment dynamics at catchment scales in the tropics remain poorly understood. This study used a chrono-sequence of remotely sensed land use and historical hydrometric data from 1985 to 2001 in three tropical streams of Mexico to analyse the temporal dynamics of land-use change and measured suspended sediment behaviour. The variations in measured suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were related to land cover change using trend and hysteresis analysis. No statistically significant trends (p > 0.1) at a monthly scale were associated with the historical trajectories of stream sediment fluxes. However, intra-annual hysteresis allowed us to identify the climatic seasonality as a main driver for the discharge-sediment loops and to infer sediment source variations, related to land cover changes over time. The land cover change analysis, combined with statistical tests and hysteresis, was useful to identify temporal and spatial variations in sediment source dynamics.

AB Water resource management involves public investments with long-ranging impacts that traditional prediction approaches cannot address. These are increasingly being critiqued because (1) there is an absence of feedbacks between water and society; (2) the models are created by domain experts who hand them to decision makers to implement; and (3) they fail to account for global forces on local water resources. Socio-hydrological models that explicitly account for feedbacks between water and society at multiple scales and facilitate stakeholder participation can address these concerns. However, they require a fundamental change in how we think about prediction. We suggest that, in the context of long-range predictions, the goal is not scenarios that present a snapshot of the world at some future date, but rather projection of alternative, plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system. This will both yield insights into cause-effect relationships and help stakeholders identify safe or desirable operating space.

AB We use data on the freezing level height (FLH) and summer runoff in the Hotan River, China, from 1960 to 2013, to analyse the nonlinear relationships of atmospheric and hydrological factors at different time scales, by employing three nonlinear decomposition methods. Six hybrid prediction models are established by combining linear regression and back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) models. The decomposition results by three nonlinear methods are compared, indicating that the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) method ensures the best prediction capacity. The runoff and FLH have periods of 3 and 6 years, respectively, at the inter-annual scale, which pass the significance test of 0.05 (P < 0.05) by using the Monte Carlo method, although there were slight differences in the periods at the inter-decadal scale. Among the six models, ESMD-BPANN exhibits the highest accuracy, with good reliability and resolution, according to several performance indicators. The ESMD-BPANN model is thus selected for the simulation and prediction of runoff.

AB Sensitivity analysis is important in understanding the relationship between sunshine duration (SD) and reference evapotranspiration (ETref). This study was developed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin using a non-dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient (S-N) relating ETref to SD. The S-N for January and July for each station were calculated. The results indicate that (a) the SD and S-N change in similar ways, where January and July are selected as two representative time slices; (b) the spatial distributions of the long-term averaged S-N for January and July are the reverse of each other; (c) the most abrupt changes in climate occur in the 1980s and the middle region is sensitive to climate change; and (d) periodicities of 2-4 and 14-16years are detected in the basin generally. The significant increase of inter-decadal filter variance indicates changes in the long-term memory of the local climate system

AB The major driver of water-level changes in many heavily stressed aquifers is irrigation pumping, which is primarily a function of meteorological conditions (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration). Correlations among climatic indices, water-level changes, and pumping can thus often be used to assess the impact of climatic and anthropogenic stresses. The power of this simple, first-order approach, which captures the primary excitation-response relationships driving aquifer behavior, is demonstrated for the High Plains aquifer in the central United States (Kansas). Regional correlations between water-level changes and climatic indices indicate that a repeat of the most severe drought on record would more than double water-level decline rates. More importantly, correlations between water-level changes and reported pumping reveal that practically feasible pumping reductions should stabilize water levels, at least temporarily, over much of the aquifer in Kansas. This example illustrates that when uncertainty obscures process-based modeling projections, simple approaches such as described here can often provide insights of great practical value.

AB The Rational Formula (RF) is probably the most frequently applied equation in practical hydrology to compute the peak discharge, due to its simplicity and effective compromise between theory and data availability. Thus, after more than a century, the estimation of peak discharge through the RF is still an important and challenging issue in hydrology. The RF assumes response linearity and sometimes assumes that the return period does not depend on the runoff coefficient and neglects the time to ponding and the antecedent moisture condition. Moreover, the RF requires the critical duration of rainfall and the runoff coefficient to be estimated, both of which are highly controversial. This paper proposes an advanced RF that makes it possible to derive the peak discharge at the hillslope scale, where the above RF assumptions are mostly relaxed. Physically based runoff coefficient tables, which are not affected by subjectivity, are presented and application of the derived procedure is performed.

ID RICHARDS EQUATION; WATER-MOVEMENT; CLAY SOIL; INFILTRATION; FLOW; MODEL
AB A general procedure for modeling one-dimensional unsteady water flow through unsaturated swelling soil has been developed. The generalized equation is based on Richards' [1931] equation for unsaturated flow. The developed equation and its numerical solution used in the procedure can be applied to the study of soil drainage and redistribution where the flux of water is downward toward the water table. In this case the water content at each point in the profile decreases with time. The derivation of the relationship between volume changes and corresponding water losses reflects the effect of different shrinkage phases for a clayey soil. The model partitions the soil into two domains: macropores and micropores. To verify the model, results are compared with two other models. The model is then applied, using Regina clay as a media, to demonstrate the effect of volume change on moisture profiles during drainage. The results demonstrate that errors will occur if the classical theory of water movement in a nonswelling soil is employed to describe water flow in an unsaturated soil that exhibits volume change during wetting and drying.

ID FLOOD ESTIMATION; GUIDELINES; DISCHARGE
AB Knowledge of peak discharge is essential for safe and economical planning and design of hydraulic structures. In India, as in most developing countries, the majority of river basins are either sparsely gauged or not gauged at all. The gauged records are also of short length (generally 15-30 years), therefore development of robust models is necessary for estimation of streamflows. Various Studies reveal that flood estimation through channel geometry is an alternative method for ungauged catchments. It is appropriate for use where flow characteristics are poorly related to catchment area and other catchment characteristics. In the present study, stream geometry parameters for 42 river sites in central-south India were used; calibration equations were developed with data for 35 stations and tested on data for the remaining seven stations. The relationships developed between mean discharge and channel geometry parameters provide an alternative technique for estimation of mean annual channel discharge.

AB This study aims to develop a comprehensive approach including an analysis of the relationships between flood susceptibility and land-use change, based on the relevance vector machine (RVM) and coyote optimization algorithm (COA) models, applied to Gianh River watershed, Quang Binh province, Central Vietnam. Standard statistical indices, e.g. area under the curve (AUC), were used to assess the model performance. Comparative analyses emphasize that the COA successfully improves the performance of the RVM model (AUC = 0.99) and is also better than the reference models such as support vector machine (AUC = 0.98), gradient boosting machine (AUC = 0.97), random forest (AUC = 0.99), extra trees regressor (AUC = 0.98), and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.96). The improved model, when used in conjunction with land use maps, is able to show that urbanization has increased in flood-susceptible areas. The results highlight that urbanization has increased in the low and very low flood susceptibility areas by 110% between 2005 and 2020, while in the high and very high areas it has increased by 30 to 40%, despite urban and demographic growth.

AB One decade after the first publications on multi-objective calibration of hydrological models, we summarize the experience gained so far by underlining the key perspectives offered by such approaches to improve parameter identification. After reviewing the fundamentals of vector optimization theory and the algorithmic issues, we link the multi-criteria calibration approach with the concepts of uncertainty and equifinality. Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multi-objective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics ("soft" data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations.

AB Relationships between surface waters and groundwaters at basin scale are rarely investigated but have important implications for water resource development and management. Here, we integrate evidence from geochemical tracers and piezometry to advance the understanding of regional-scale, groundwater-surface water interactions in the River Awash Basin of Ethiopia. Hydrological characteristics are consistent with those observed in other semi-arid and arid basins where rivers are predominantly losing and act as a source of recharge rather than as a sink for groundwater discharge. Further, regional groundwater flow originating from the highlands exits the catchment rather than discharging to the riverine drainage. Consequently, groundwater abstraction from several regional-scale aquifers in the lowlands is not expected to impact river flow. However, salinity presents a major threat to irrigation and water supply. We identify critical areas for managing inflows, water use, wetlands and water quality that have significant implications for water security across the basin.

AB The identification of homogeneous precipitation regions has value in many water resources engineering applications (infrastructure planning, design, operations; climate forecasting, modelling). The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of precipitation regions to the temporal resolution (monthly, seasonal, annual and the annual maximum series) of the data. The presented method uses the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to partition climate sites into statistically homogeneous precipitation regions. The regions are validated using an approach based on L-moment statistics. The method is conducted in two climatically different study areas in western and eastern Canada. There does not appear to be a relationship between the spatial distributions of the regions formed using different temporal resolutions of the precipitation data. It is recommended to delineate precipitation regions that are specific to the task at hand, and to select a temporal resolution that is consistent with the final application of the regional precipitation dataset.

AB The magnitude, occurrence rate and occurrence timing of floods in the Poyang Lake basin were analysed. The flood series were acquired by annual and seasonal maximum flow (AMF) sampling and peaks-over-threshold (POT) sampling. Nonstationarity and uncertainty were analysed using kernel density estimation and the bootstrap resampling methods. Using the relationships between flood indices and climate indices, i.e. El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the potential causes of flooding were investigated. The results indicate that (1) the magnitudes of annual and seasonal AMF- and POT-based sampled floods generally exhibit an increasing tendency; (2) the highest occurrence rates of floods identified were during the 1990s, when the flood-affected crop area, flood-damaged crop area and crop failure area reached the highest levels; and (3) ENSO and IOD are the major climate indices that significantly correlate with the magnitude and frequency of floods of the following year.

AB In the absence of well-documented pumping tests, we investigate whether a reliable estimate of transmissivity T can be obtained using historical records of specific capacity data in granular and fractured-rock aquifers. Transmissivity values are calculated from the specific capacity data Q/s in several hundred wells located in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region (Canada), with an iterative method applied to the Cooper-Jacob equation. The results are compared with short- and long-duration pumping tests performed throughout the region. We demonstrate that values of transmissivity compare well between the different types of tests for each lithology, when the scale of the test is similar. Therefore, using historical information easily increases the number of transmissivity values that can be estimated over a region. These values can be integrated in regional numerical models. Moreover, this study shows that T=4.48(Q/s)(1.15) with R-2=0.66 for granular aquifers. This new empirical relationship can be used in similar environments.

AB Geochemical reaction rate laws are often measured using crushed minerals in well-mixed laboratory systems that are designed to eliminate mass transport limitations. Such rate laws are often used directly in reactive transport models to predict the reaction and transport of chemical species in consolidated porous media found in subsurface environments. Due to the inherent heterogeneities of porous media, such use of lab-measured rate laws may introduce errors, leading to a need to develop methods for upscaling reaction rates. In this work, we present a methodology for using pore-scale network modeling to investigate scaling effects in geochemical reaction rates. The reactive transport processes are simulated at the pore scale, accounting for heterogeneities of both physical and mineral properties. Mass balance principles are then used to calculate reaction rates at the continuum scale. To examine the scaling behavior of reaction kinetics, these continuum-scale rates from the network model are compared to the rates calculated by directly using laboratory-measured reaction rate laws and ignoring pore-scale heterogeneities. In this work, this methodology is demonstrated by upscaling anorthite and kaolinite reaction rates under simulation conditions relevant to geological CO2 sequestration. Simulation results show that under conditions with CO2 present at high concentrations, pore-scale concentrations of reactive species and reaction rates vary spatially by orders of magnitude, and the scaling effect is significant. With a much smaller CO2 concentration, the scaling effect is relatively small. These results indicate that the increased acidity associated with geological sequestration can generate conditions for which proper scaling tools are yet to be developed. This work demonstrates the use of pore-scale network modeling as a valuable research tool for examining upscaling of geochemical kinetics. The pore-scale model allows the effects of pore-scale heterogeneities to be integrated into system behavior at multiple scales, thereby identifying important factors that contribute to the scaling effect.

AB The classical Richards equation of water infiltration in unsaturated soil is a partial differential equation, which is non-linear and difficult to solve analytically. Taking time as the variable with the least action, the infiltration path as a function of time is established based on the Richards equation. The vertical infiltration problem of unsaturated soil under gravity is transformed into the functional extremum problem, and solved with the Euler-Lagrange equation. The results show that the diffusion coefficient D(theta) has a functional relationship with the depth of the wetting front. When the type of diffusion coefficient is known, the moisture content of the wetting front at a specified depth, the moisture content of the farthest wetting front and the maximum entropy distribution of soil moisture content can be obtained at the optimal path. Taking the optimal path as the standard, the accuracy of solving the Richards equation by Boltzmann transformation and linear transformation is tested.

AB The high cost of monitoring suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in rivers calls for the development of indirect estimation methods, based on relationships with other variables, which are easier and cheaper to measure. We present an original approach to investigate the capacity of regional models to extrapolate SSC to ungauged basins, in a heterogeneous region with scarce in situ data and complex hydrography. The estimates were based on qualitative variables (drainage area, soil type, land use, land cover and mean catchment slope) to represent spatial variability, and quantitative variables (turbidity, flow, precipitation and exponentially weighted moving average of past rainfall) to represent temporal variability. We used artificial neural network (ANN)-based models, applied to the Brazilian part of the Upper Paraguay River Basin, covering an area of 362 380 km(2). This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology allows the regional extrapolation of SSC to ungauged basins with very good performance, even in heterogeneous regions.

AB A soil moisture retrieval method is proposed, in the absence of ground-based auxiliary measurements, by deriving the soil moisture content relationship from the satellite vegetation index-based evapotranspiration fraction and soil moisture physical properties of a soil type. A temperature-vegetation dryness index threshold value is also proposed to identify water bodies and underlying saturated areas. Verification of the retrieved growing season soil moisture was performed by comparative analysis of soil moisture obtained by observed conventional in situ point measurements at the 239-km(2) Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA (2006-2009), and at the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) soil moisture measurement sites in Sundance, Wyoming (2012-2015), and Lewistown, Montana (2014-2015). The proposed method best represented the effective root zone soil moisture condition, at a depth between 50 and 100cm, with an overall average R-2 value of 0.72 and average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.042.

AB Identifying physical catchment processes from streamflow data, such as quick- and slow-flow paths, remains challenging. This study is designed to explore whether a flexible nonparametric regression model (generalized additive model, GAM) can be used to infer different flow paths. This assumes that the data relationship in data-driven models is also a reflection of catchment physical processes. The GAM, using time-lagged flow covariates, was fitted to synthetic rainfall-runoff data simulated using simple linear reservoirs. Partial plots of the time-lagged covariates show that the model could differentiate simple and more complex flow paths in simulated synthetic data with short and long memory systems and varying between dry and wet climates. Further analysis of data from real catchments showed that the model could differentiate catchments dominated by slow flow and by quick flow. Therefore, this study indicates that GAM can be used to identify catchment storages and delay processes from streamflow data.

AB The effects of land use on river water chemistry in a typical karst watershed (Wujiang River) of southwest China have been evaluated. Dissolved major ions and Sr isotopic compositions were determined in 11 independent sub-watersheds of the Wujiang River to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in river water chemistry and their relationship to land use. The results show significant spatial variability in pH, major ions, total dissolved solids (TDS), and Sr isotopic compositions throughout the basin. Correlation analysis indicates that nitrogen content is significantly related to forest coverage. Nitrogen and potassium generally have higher values in the rainy season, and the percentage of agricultural land controlled NO3- levels, which originate from anthropogenic sources. Forest cover, which varies between 35% and 71%, has no statistically significant impact on river solute concentrations, but the TDS flux is low in sub-watersheds with greater forest cover. Geological sources have a significant influence on pH and Sr isotopic compositions in river water throughout the basin.

AB Water resource management involves public investments with long-ranging impacts that traditional prediction approaches cannot address. These are increasingly being critiqued because (1) there is an absence of feedbacks between water and society; (2) the models are created by domain experts who hand them to decision makers to implement; and (3) they fail to account for global forces on local water resources. Socio-hydrological models that explicitly account for feedbacks between water and society at multiple scales and facilitate stakeholder participation can address these concerns. However, they require a fundamental change in how we think about prediction. We suggest that, in the context of long-range predictions, the goal is not scenarios that present a snapshot of the world at some future date, but rather projection of alternative, plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system. This will both yield insights into cause-effect relationships and help stakeholders identify safe or desirable operating space.

AB In situ megascale hydraulic diffusivities (D) of a confined loess aquifer were estimated at various scales (10 <= L <= 1500 m) by a finite difference model, and laboratory microscale diffusivities of a loess sample by empirical formulas. A scatter plot reveals that D fits to a single power function of L, providing that microscale diffusivities are assigned to L = 1 m and that differences in diffusivity observed between micro- and megascales are assigned to medium heterogeneity appraised by variations in the curvature and slope of natural hydraulic head waves propagating through the aquifer. Subsequently, a general power relationship between D and L is defined where the base and exponent terms stand for the aquifer storage capability under a confined regime of flow, for the microscale hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of loess, and for the changes in curvature and slope of hydraulic head waves relative to values defined at unit scale.

AB Models that can integrate aspects of society such as institutions, perceptions and behaviours with aspects of the natural system such as rainfall, runoff and water quality may help us understand and manage complex human-water systems. In this paper, a socio-hydrological model is developed for the Black Volta (Mouhoun) watershed in Burkina Faso. The model captures the relationships between the awareness of water quality issues and capacity of local organizations, land use in the riparian zone, agricultural practices and suspended sediment concentration as an indicator of water quality. Scenarios are generated for the current situation and for plausible pathways to achieve improved water quality through different riparian land management strategies. Scenario comparison show how water quality improvements are generated if institutional support, resources and capacity of local level organizations are substantially increased compared to current levels.

AB Pararametric studies were carried out to analyse the effect on sea water intrusion of freshwater recharge through a finite width strip parallel to the coast. A vertically integrated one-dimensional finite element model was used for this purpose. The studies included the analysis of the effect of location, width, intensity and the period of recharge on sea water-freshwater interface motion. Relationships were established between the interface motion and the recharge parameters applicable to wide ranging practical cases. From the studies, the ideal location for recharge was identified to achieve the maximum repulsion of intrusion. The width of recharge also affects the interface motion and the widths greater than 2% of the initial intrusion length were effective in controlling the intrusion. The results indicated that the reduction of intrusion up to 30% could be achieved through strip recharge.

AB We propose a spatially and temporally adaptive solution to Richards' equation based upon a local discontinuous Galerkin approximation in space and a high-order, backward difference method in time. We cast our approach in terms of a general, decoupled adaption algorithm based upon operators. We define non-unique instances of all operators to result in an adaption method from within the general class of methods that is defined. We formally decouple the spatial adaption from the temporal adaption using a method of lines approach and limit the temporal truncation error so that the total error is dominated by the spatial component. We use a multiple grid approach to guide adaption and support the data structures. Spatial adaption decisions are based upon error and regularity indicators, which are economical to compute. The resultant methods are compared for two test problems. The results show that the proposed adaption methods are superior to methods that adapt only in time and that in cases in which the problem has sufficient smoothness, adapting the order of the elements in addition to the grid spacing can further improve the efficiency of this robust solution approach.

AB Atmospheric stability conditions over the water surface can affect the evaporative and convective heat fluxes from the water surface. Atmospheric instability occurred 72.5% of the time and resulted in 44.7 and 89.2% increases in the average and maximum estimated evaporation, respectively, when compared to the neutral condition for a small shallow lake (Binaba) in Ghana. The proposed approach is based on the bulk-aerodynamic transfer method and the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) using standard meteorological parameters measured over the surrounding land. For water surface temperature, a crucial parameter in heat flux estimation from water surfaces, an applicable method is proposed. This method was used to compute heat fluxes and compare them with observed heat fluxes. The heat flux model was validated using sensible heat fluxes measured with a 3-D sonic anemometer. The results show that an unstable atmospheric condition has a significant effect in enhancing evaporation alongside the sensible heat flux from water surfaces.

AB The optimization and extension of existing gauging networks are a challenging task, which can be done under consideration of many different aspects. One possibility is to maximize the obtained information on regional hydrological characteristics by new gauges compared to existing ones. For this, information theory approaches are most suitable. Here, the principle of maximum entropy is applied to calculate the probability of non-similarity of catchments to determine locations of new gauges according to the catchment characteristics that are most relevant for the hydrological conditions. The realization in an interactive application, provided online, makes use easy for practitioners and scientists. Goodness-of-fit measures are applied to investigate the explanatory power of the model and the contribution of each characteristic to the model, which gives information on the most influential properties of the catchment. The relevance of the proposed approach is proven by comparing hydrological signatures between similar and non-similar catchment.

AB In reservoir flood control operation, candidate reservoir operation alternatives are evaluated, ranked and selected by a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. However, deterministic methods cannot handle MCDM problems where uncertainties exist in both criteria performance values (PVs) and criteria weights (CWs). To solve the issue, a novel SMAA-VIKOR model integrating stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) theory with the Viekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is proposed. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the model's decision making results, including risk assessment and sensitivity analysis. The case study applied to a flood control system in Dadu River in China indicates that the SMAA-VIKOR model can quickly identify the optimal alternative that meets the subjective preferences of decision makers, and has remarkable advantages compared to the traditional SMAA-2 model and the deterministic VIKOR method, which can provide theoretical support for making a robust reservoir release decision.

AB This study provides the first estimates of the frequency distribution of observational and future maximum daily precipitation considering nonstationarity for the entire Brazilian territory. We assess observational data from 1980 to 2015 and projected data from 2020 to 2099 for two climate change scenarios and four downscaled climate models. We modelled extreme precipitation according to the extreme values theory and calculated the precipitation intensity associated with the return periods of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years in nonstationary conditions. The results indicate that nonstationarity is identified in 17.5% of the study area during 1980-2015. The analysis of future climate projections indicated an increase in the return levels of extreme precipitation compared to the historical period in at least 90% of the national territory. It shows that engineering design must urgently consider the nonstationarity of extreme precipitation under the risk of increasingly unsafe infrastructure.

AB It is of great importance to construct an integrated drought indicator, which is of great importance to drought risk assessment and decision-making. Given the fuzzy nature of drought, the variable fuzzy set theory was applied to develop an Integrated Drought Index (IDI) combining meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural factors across the Yellow River basin in North China. The runoff and soil moisture were derived by driving the calibrated Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with observed atmospheric forcing. Furthermore, the law of mutual change of quality and quantity was adopted to identify qualitative change points of annual IDI series in the Yellow River basin. The results indicate that: (1) the Integrated Drought Index (IDI) has a better performance compared with Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized streamflow Index (SSFI), and it is more sensitive and effective to capture drought onset and persistence, largely owing to its combination with the information of different drought-related variables; (2) spatially, the middle reaches has a higher drought risk than the rest portions of the Yellow River basin; seasonally, drought risk in spring and winter is larger than other seasons; overall, the IDI of the basin is dominated by an insignificantly downward trend; (3) some qualitative change points of drought were identified in the Yellow River basin, and those are primarily induced by ENSO events and the construction of dams and reservoirs. This study proposed an alternative drought indicator coupled with multivariate drought-related variables by objectively determining their weights based on the entropy weight method, which has a great value in characterizing drought.

AB The main objective of this study has been to test the theories describing the pathways and the processes generating runoff from rainfall. A small forest catchment in south-eastern Norway has been used as a research area. The results of this study agree with previous work (Myrabo, 1986), suggesting that the response area concept gives a good description of the behaviour of the processes in small catchments in moraine terrain in Norway. Maps of the areal distribution of groundwater levels at different stream discharges are used, derived from measurements at more than 100 observational sites.
   The saturated area and response area in the catchment are controlled by the position of the groundwater level. The variations of the measured groundwater level, obtained automatically each hour, and at various stream discharges, are therefore thoroughly investigated. Correlation analysis and comparisons of discharge-groundwater level relationships, show distinct hysteresis effects. Threshold groundwater levels that indicate the limit for quick runoff from particular parts of the catchment have been identified. The behaviour of the discharge-groundwater relationship is dependent on location, antecedent conditions and size of response area before each precipitation event. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Moments of rainfall spatial variability, which quantify how flood response time scales are affected when spatially variable rainfall is considered, compared to when rainfall is spatially uniform, have been suggested as a useful tool for forecasters to guide their choice between lumped or distributed rainfall information for runoff modelling. However, the approaches used to evaluate the validity of moments suffer from limitations. Hence, we adopt a novel approach for their evaluation by comparing moments to the relationship between observed hydrograph characteristics generated by spatially variable and by uniform rainfall events in the same catchment. We further investigate the usefulness of moments by testing whether the performance of a lumped hydrological model for events classified by moments as spatially variable is lower than for uniform events. Results confirmed that moments can identify spatially variable events and characterize differences in hydrograph features compared to uniform events, providing a useful tool for forecasters.

AB Areas of Western and Central Europe were severely affected by devastating droughts in 2003 and 2015. A sharp decrease in annual atmospheric precipitation led to diminished spring discharges. Analysis of the fluctuations in discharge from three groups of springs in the south of Poland, namely in the Sudetes and Carpathian mountains, and in the German province of Bavaria revealed an average discharge reduction ranging from 52 to 4%. The study proved the existence of a relationship between diminished groundwater recharge from precipitation and the type of rock forming the reservoir as well as the parameters of the rock in the drained catchment. Spring discharge regime was compared for various periods to show that a decline in the regime correlates with a decline in river flow rate; considering the continually changing weather patterns, this correlation is arguably a key factor in sustainable water management.

AB Organic waste applications to soil (manure, various wastewaters, and biosolids) are among the most significant sources of bacterial contamination in surface and groundwater. Transport of bacteria through the vadose zone depends on flow path geometry and stability and is mitigated by interaction between soil, soil solution, air-water interfaces, and characteristics of microbial surfaces. After initial entry, the transport through soil depends on continued entrainment of bacteria and resuspension of those retained in the porous structure. We evaluated the retention of bacteria-sized artificial microspheres, varying in diameter and surface charge and applied in different suspending solutions, by a range of sieved soils contained in minicolumns, the transport of hydrophobic bacteria-sized microspheres through undisturbed soil columns as affected by waste type under simulated rainfall, and the field-scale transport of Enterococcus spp. to an unconfined sandy aquifer after the application of liquid manure. Microsphere retention reflected microsphere properties. The soil type and suspending solution affected retention of hydrophilic but not hydrophobic particles. Retention was not necessarily facilitated by manure-microsphere-soil interactions but by manure-soil interactions. Undisturbed column studies confirmed the governing role of waste type on vadose-zone microsphere transport. Filtration theory applied as an integrated analysis of transport across length scales showed that effective collision efficiency depended on the distance of travel. It followed a power law behavior with the power coefficient varying from similar to 0.4 over short distances to >0.9 over 1 m (i.e., very little filtration for a finite fraction of biocolloids), consistent with reduced influence of soil solution and biocolloid properties at longer travel distances.

AB Understanding of the effect of basin water resources utilization on lake nutrients is helpful to prevent lake eutrophication and facilitate sustainable water resources management. In this study, a lake basin dualistic water cycle system is established to identify the environmental effect of lake water. Four water utilization indicators were chosen to build a driving relationship with the lake nutrients. Three different trophic lakes in Yunnan Province, China - Dianchi, Erhai and Fuxian - were selected to demonstrate the changes in basin water utilization, runoff, nutrient loads and water-use indicators for the period 2000-2015. In addition, the driving forces of water-use indicators to nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were analysed by a general additive model. Finally, an optimized water utilization system for each lake basin is proposed. The research provides a practical tool for water resources and environmental management in lake basins.

AB This article analyses the nexus of technocracy-peacebuilding and its implications on water conflicts and hydropolitics. It is a conceptual exploration which advances an interdisciplinary approach by combining theories from two distinct research fields: peacebuilding and trans-boundary water management. It probes the argument that synergies between water management, development and peacebuilding frequently lead to technocratic and functional solutions. As empirical case illustration, the transboundary project, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance (RSDSWC) is analysed regarding its peacebuilding and peace promoting potential. Three concluding remarks are drawn from the conceptual and empirical analysis. First, strong emphasis on technocratic solutions is inclined to favour supply-oriented options rather than solutions based on ethics of sustainable development and rights-based distribution. Second, functional solutions to water conflicts downplay at times complex hydro-political and asymmetrical relations between adversaries. Third, wider trends of privatization in the water sector coincide with similar developments in the field of peacebuilding, where new transnational actors are gaining influence as "new peacemakers", which are likely to have long-term consequences on power relations and the resolution of water conflict.

AB The Ganjiang River is the largest tributary of Poyang Lake in China, and its hydrological regime variation greatly affects the utilization of regional water resources and the ecological environment of the lake. In this study, a novel trend analysis method, the Moving Average over Shifting Horizon (MASH), was applied to investigate the inter- and intra-annual trends of flow and water level from 1976 to 2016 at the Xiajiang and the Waizhou hydrological stations in the Ganjiang River. The Significant Change Rate Method (SCRM) was proposed to determine the MASH averaging parameters. The trend analysis results show a statistically significant decrease in water level series throughout the year and the relationship of flow and water level have changed greatly at the Waizhou station. The sediment load reduction, large-scale sand mining and water level decrease of Poyang Lake are identified as the main causes for the water level decrease.

AB A generalized flux law, which can specialize into power- and diffusive-type flux laws, is proposed. When coupled with the continuity equation, a generalized flow equation is the result. The generalized equation specializes into several cases, one of which is the kinematic wave equation. By applying the generalized flow equation and its variants to flow routing in two rivers, the usefulness of the generalized flux law is evaluated. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Extreme rainfall is the most common cause of flooding and likelihood of such events is found to increase in recent studies. Large scale natural variability, human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming are important drivers of extreme rainfall. Understanding the association of these drivers with extreme rainfall and finding out the most significant physical driver will provide a foundation for risk assessment. This study presents a methodology to investigate the association of extreme rainfall events with physical drivers and to model their dependence structure. The methodology is demonstrated with application to Mahanadi River basin, India. Non-stationary extreme value models with multivariate ENSO index, global average temperature anomalies and local mean temperature anomalies as covariates are fitted at non-stationary rainfall grids of the basin. Statistical modelling confirms localized temperature to be the main driver influencing rainfall extremes. Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes. Significant deviations from the expected CC scaling behaviour are observed. Daily rainfall extremes show peaks at low (25 degrees C) to medium (30 degrees C) range of temperature, but exhibit a decrease at high temperatures for most of the grids. No change in this pattern of relationship is observed when the extreme rainfall is lagged by 1-9 days with temperature. This time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere. The Copula theory is applied to capture the dependence of annual maximum daily rainfall and temperature extremes. Conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall are estimated by conditioning on local mean temperature values of strongest extreme rainfall events. Comparison of conditional probabilities suggests that stronger rainfall events are occurring at 30 degrees C. This study emphasizes the necessity of understanding the dependence structure of extreme rainfall and local mean temperature.

AB Multiphase flow and contaminant transport in porous media are strongly influenced by the presence of fluid-fluid interfaces. Recent theoretical work based on conservation laws and the second law of thermodynamics has demonstrated the need for quantitative interfacial area information to be incorporated into multiphase flow models. We have used synchrotron based X-ray microtomography to investigate unsaturated flow through a glass bead column. Fully three-dimensional images were collected at points on the primary drainage curve and on the secondary imbibition and drainage loops. Analysis of the high-resolution images (17 micron voxels) allows for computation of interfacial areas and saturation. Corresponding pressure measurements are made during the course of the experiments. Results show the fluid-fluid interfacial area increasing as saturation decreases, reaching a maximum at saturations ranging from 20 to 35% and then decreasing as the saturation continues to zero. The findings support results of numerical studies reported in the literature.

AB Understanding bedload transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for complementing the existing knowledge on sediment transport theory. In this contribution, we use a natural-scale laboratory flume to analyse bedload transport fluctuations in non-uniform sand under normal flow conditions. Based on the significance of downward seepage, we incorporate the seepage effect on bedload transport over a non-uniform sand bed channel. The weight of the dry material was measured, and the volumetric transport rate per unit width (bedload transport rate) was estimated. An important observation is that the bedload transport rate initially rapidly increases with time and reaches a maximum value. Based on experimental data, we propose an empirical expression to estimate temporal bedload transport. In addition, an empirical model for bedload transport is proposed by incorporating downward seepage among other variables. The performance of several existing bedload transport formulae was also taken into account by the experimental datasets.

AB A borehole is developed in a shallow multi-layered aquifer and used to derive the porosity, specific storage and hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard. Local values of hydrodynamical parameters are estimated from petrophysical analysis of core samples, and the empirical relationship between porosity and permeability. Vertical diffusivity is determined from the response of the aquitard to a loading cyclic signal using pressure records at different depths. Hydraulic conductivities deduced from the petrophysical analysis ranged from 10(8) to 10(10) m s(1) and are comparable with those of facies of marine/lacustrine clay observed in samples. The permeability values calculated based on diffusivity are within the range 10(9) to 10(11) m s(1) with a quasi-systematic bias of one order of magnitude. These values are average for a larger part of the aquitard and correspond to an integrated value. The methodology retained for the aquitard characterization is discussed with emphasis on the implications for the management of a complex aquifer system.

AB Various uncertainties are inherent in modelling any reservoir operation problem. Two of these are addressed in this study: uncertainty involved in the expression of reservoir penalty functions, and uncertainty in determining the target release value. Fuzzy set theory was used to model these uncertainties where the preferences of the decision maker for the fuzzified parameters are expressed as membership functions. Nonlinear penalty functions are used to determine the penalties due to deviations from targets. The optimization was performed using a genetic algorithm with the objectives to minimize the total penalty and to maximize the level of satisfaction of the decision maker with fuzzified input parameters. The proposed formulation was applied to the problem of finding the optimal release and storage values, taking Green reservoir in Kentucky, USA as a case study. The approach offers more flexibility to reservoir decision-making by demonstrating an efficient way to represent subjective uncertainties, and to deal with non-commensurate objectives under a fuzzy multi-objective environment.

ID PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PEATLANDS; BOG
AB The boreal region is a significant peat-forming area. With peat, there lie other natural resources, including mineral ores and fossil fuels needed by our economy. However, mining for mineral resources or any other activity that leads to large-scale groundwater extraction in the near vicinity or underneath the mires can alter the water levels in the overlaying ecosystems and thus have a damaging effect on them, raising concerns about the mires' preservation. Peat itself may isolate surface vegetation from drainage caused by nearby mining when its hydraulic conductivity is sufficiently low. More is known about the hydraulic properties of the uppermost layers of the peat column, but there is very little data about deeper, generally more decomposed peat layers that may potentially act as drainage barriers. Carrying out in situ hydraulic conductivity tests in less conductive peat can be laborious and time-consuming, and not always practical. This research aims to study and verify statistical relationships between easy-to-measure peat properties and hydraulic conductivity over the entire peat column, covering the knowledge deficit that is important in the context of indirect drainage effects related to mining or any other large-scale groundwater extraction. For that, we sampled peat and conducted in situ saturated hydraulic conductivity tests in several mires in northeast Estonia to gather information about the hydraulic properties of boreal peat. Collected data were fitted with linear mixed-effects models to link hydraulic conductivity with the degree of decomposition, dry bulk density, depth of measurement, and peatland growth phase. The results indicate that these parameters are strongly correlated with saturated hydraulic conductivity and can serve as predictors of this parameter. Constructed statistical models exhibit relatively high explanatory power and show potential usage for characterizing the hydraulic conductivity of peat. The findings of this study may be helpful in the efforts of mire conservation.

AB The aims of this study are to investigate the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation quantified by indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAOI), the Greenland-Balkan Oscillation index (GBOI) and blocking-type indices on the Lower Danube discharge. We separately analysed each season for the 1948-2000 period. In addition to the statistical linear procedure, we applied methods to quantify nonlinear connections between variables, as mutual information between predictors and predictand, using Shannon's information entropy theory. The nonlinear correlation information between climate indices and discharge is higher than that obtained from the linear measure, providing more insight into real connections. Also, the non-stationarity of the link between variables is highlighted by spectral coherence based on wavelet analysis. For the physical interpretation, we analyse composite maps over the Atlantic-European region. The most significant influence on the discharge of the Lower Danube Basin is given by the GBOI and blocking-type atmospheric circulation over Europe.

AB The focal point of this work is the estimation of the distribution of maxima without the use of classic extreme value theory and asymptotic properties, which may not be ideal for hydrological processes. The problem is revisited from the perspective of non-asymptotic conditions, and regards the so-called exact distribution of block-maxima of finite-sized k-length blocks. First, we review existing non-asymptotic approaches/models, and introduce an alternative and fast model. Next, through simulations and comparisons (using asymptotic and non-asymptotic models), involving intermittent processes (e.g. rainfall), we highlight the capability of non-asymptotic approaches to model the distribution of maxima with reduced uncertainty and variability. Finally, we discuss an alternative use of such models that concerns the theoretical estimation of the multi-scale probability of obtaining a zero value. This is a useful finding when the scope is the multi-scale modelling of intermittent hydrological processes (e.g. intensity-duration-frequency models). The work also provides step-by-step recipes and an R package.

AB The hydrological cycle in arid and semi-arid climates is highly controlled by evaporation. The correct quantification of this process is essential for improving the accuracy of water balance estimates, especially in closed basins. The objective of this paper is to characterize evaporation rates from shallow groundwater using the chamber approach in six closed basins in the Altiplano of northern Chile. Measurements were made at 49 locations with water-table depths ranging from 0.09 m to 3.3 m. Estimated daily evaporation rates appeared to be strongly related to groundwater depth and soil texture. In particular, the highest rates were recorded in areas with high groundwater tables and coarse-grained soils. Evaporation curves were derived by fitting exponential and power relationships as functions of the groundwater depths that we proposed to use in the study area. An application of these curves for the Salar de Pedernales basin produced an estimated evaporation flow of 530 L s(-1), using the average curve.

AB Rainfall and runoff play an important role in the process of soil erosion, which is usually expressed with the R factor. To calculate the R factor, long-term precipitation data are needed with high temporal resolution, typically available for only few locations. The aim of this study was to obtain an approximate relationship between the more commonly available daily precipitation data and the R factor. A set of equations is presented for calculating monthly and annual R factor values based on daily precipitation data for a sub-Mediterranean region in southwest Slovenia, and their applicability is discussed. The sum of squares of daily precipitation was found to be the best descriptor of the monthly R factor. The ratio between the R factor and the sum of squares of daily precipitation varies throughout the year and generally follows the mean monthly temperature, with the efficiency coefficient, e, of 0.869 between predicted and observed data on the annual basis.

TI Application of an extended Kalman filter approach to inversion of

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY; STATE ESTIMATION; MODEL; RECONSTRUCTION
AB We apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach to inversion of time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) field data. The EKF is a method of time series signal processing that incorporates both a state evolution model, describing changes in the physical system, and an observation model, incorporating the physics of the electrical resistivity measurement. We test the feasibility of using an EKF approach to inverting ERI data collected with 2-D surface array geometries. As a first test, we invert synthetic data generated using a simulated recharge event and water saturation distributions converted to electrical conductivity values using an Archie's law relationship. In the synthetic example we demonstrate the impact that the noise structure of the state evolution and the regularization weight have on EKF-estimated model parameters and errors. We then apply the method to inversion of field data collected to monitor changes in electrical conductivity beneath a recharge pond that is part of an aquifer storage and recovery project in northern California. Using lines of electrodes buried at a depth of 0.25 m when the base of the pond is dry, we monitor the wetting front associated with the diversion of stormflow runoff to the pond. Using field data, we demonstrate that by oversampling in time, we are able to apply the so-called random walk model for the state evolution and to build the model of observation noise directly from collected data. EKF-estimated values track changes in conductivity associated with both increasing water content in subsurface sediments and changes in the properties of the pore water, showing the method is a feasible approach for inversion of time-lapse ERI field data.

AB Several tools are available to simulate catchment streamflow with a higher level of accuracy. Validation of simulated streamflow of ungauged catchments is a challenge in hydrological science due to the non-availability of gauging data. Generally, complex linear and nonlinear mathematical approaches are used to generate regionalized streamflow for ungauged catchments with available observed hydrological data from a neighbouring catchment. Machine learning (ML) is broadly used to model complex nonlinear relationships between different variables. This study demonstrates how novel ML approaches such as support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) can be applied to generate regionalized streamflow to calibrate ungauged simulated flow from the existing hydrological model. This study was performed on two study areas and four catchments located in different climate zones. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used for ungauged flow simulation, and ML was used for regionalization.

AB Although storage-reliability-yield (SRY) relationships have been widely used in the design and planning of water supply reservoirs, their application in hydroelectricity is practically nil. Here, we revisit the SRY analysis and seek its generic configuration for hydroelectric reservoirs, following a stochastic simulation approach. After defining key concepts and tools of conventional SRY studies, we adapt them for hydropower systems, which are subject to several peculiarities. We illustrate that under some reasonable assumptions, the problem can be substantially simplified. Major innovations are the storage-head-energy conversion via the use of a sole parameter, representing the reservoir geometry, and the development of an empirical statistical metric expressing the reservoir performance on the basis of the simulated energy-probability curve. The proposed framework is applied to numerous hypothetical reservoirs at three river sites in Greece, using monthly synthetic inflow data, to provide empirical expressions of reliable energy as a function of reservoir storage and geometry.

AB Land-use changes have been significant these last decades in West Africa, particularly in the Sahel region; in this area, climatic and demographic factors have led to a rise in cropped areas in recent decades causing strong changes in the water cycle and in river regimes. This study compares the rainfall-runoff relationships for two periods (1991-1994 and 2004-2011) in two small and similar neighbouring Sahelian catchments (approx 0.1 km(2) each). This allows identification of the different hydrological consequences of land-use/land-cover change, particularly the fallow shortening and the consequent degradation of topsoil. The main land surface change is a 75% increase in crusted soil area. Runoff increased by more than 20% on average between the two periods while flood duration decreased by 50% on average. However, runoff values remained largely constant in the lower part of the northern basin due to a strong increase in in-channel infiltration.

AB Alluvial rivers commonly are subject to the integrated effects of hydrodynamic and eco-geomorphologic controls and there has been a lack of suitable methods to measure the effects. By taking the alluvial reach of the Yellow River over the Yinchuan Plain as a suitable example, this study evaluates the degree of hydrodynamic control in the channel-form adjustment of different channel patterns in light of the advances in equilibrium theory governing alluvial channel flow. In response to the significant variations in flow regime and channel forms, the non-dimensional number H that measures the equilibrium state of alluvial channel flow varies in the ranges of 0.23-0.65, 0.047-0.17 and 0.0012-0.0024 respectively in the anabranching, meandering and braided reaches during 1993-2015. The significant differences among the H-ranges are mainly because the individual anabranches have neither very narrow nor very deep cross-sections, while the single-thread channels in the meandering and braided reaches take moderately and significantly wider and shallower cross-sections, respectively. These results demonstrate that the H number is a good discriminator of river channel patterns, and the relatively small variability of H within each channel pattern implies that the channels in the study reach are resilient to significant change in flow regime but yet hydrodynamic control is only partial. While the H number is capable of embodying the outcome of the complex integrated effects of multiple localized eco-geomorphic controls with flow dynamics, more studies are required to define its specific varying ranges for different river channel patterns and differing eco-geomorphic controls.

AB Small reservoirs have traditionally been used worldwide to store surface water, but they are complex to manage. Accounting for a water resource scattered across thousands of water bodies remains challenging. Images acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are already used in different ways in hydrology, could provide additional support. We evaluated the use of UAVs as an alternative way to derive bathymetric data from the topography of a small reservoir. Digital elevation models (DEMs, 58) were produced from UAV imagery and in-situ differential global positioning system (DGPS) points using standard structure from motion (SfM) and interpolation methods. Image processing was able to produce DEMs with 10 times the vertical accuracy of DGPS-point interpolation methods for similar accuracy in determining the relationships between the water height, surface area, and reservoir volume. These results suggest that the SfM photogrammetry can be used to derive bathymetry data from UAV images.

AB The city of Sao Carlos, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, has a historical coexistence between society and floods. Unplanned urbanization in this area is a representative feature of how Brazilian cities have developed, undermining the impact of natural hazards. The Gregorio Creek catchment is an enigma of complex dynamics concerning the relationship between humans and water in Brazilian cities. Our hypothesis is that social memory of floods can improve future resilience. In this paper we analyse flood risk dynamics in a small urban catchment, identify the impacts of social memory on building resilience and propose measures to reduce the risk of floods. We applied a socio-hydrological model using data collected from newspapers from 1940 to 2018. The model was able to elucidate human-water processes in the catchment and the historical source data proved to be a useful tool to fill gaps in the data in small urban basins.
