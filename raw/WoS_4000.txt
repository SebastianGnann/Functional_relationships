AB A paired-catchment study began in 2000 to assess the hydrologic effects of high-elevation development on Mt. Mansfield, Vermont's highest summit (1340 m). West Branch Little River drains 12.08 km(2) and encompasses a large ski resort. Adjacent Ranch Brook drains 9.83 km(2) of minimally disturbed second-growth forest. The two catchments have similar elevation, aspect, surficial and bedrock geology, and vegetation. The resort was well established before this study, but it underwent a major expansion during the period 2004-2008. The expansion included new ski lifts and trails, a large hotel, roads and second home development, a 435 000-m(3) snowmaking storage pond and a nine-hole golf course, increasing the extent of cleared/open land from 17% to 24%. Runoff from the developed West Branch Little River catchment was 21% greater than Ranch Brook over the duration of the study, but varied widely each year from 10% to 42%. This high variability occurs both on the interannual and individual storm scales, and is consistent with expectations from future climate projections. Hydrologic variability is on the rise, as shown by an increase in stream flashiness in both catchments over the 20 years of our study. Resort expansion, which provided for stormwater management, had no discernible effect on the overall runoff difference nor the flow distribution at the scale of the catchments, but sedimentation, water quality impacts and localized erosion cannot be ruled out. Forest clearing, impervious and hardened surfaces, and skier-compacted and machine-made snow may all cause enhanced runoff. However, the greater runoff at West Branch, which occurs primarily during snowmelt and summer, may arise partly from greater precipitation capture in the complex mountain topography. Development pressure on the mountain landscape continues to mount, but managers may also need to consider the confounding effects of a changing climate.

AB Fractures are potential pathways for subsurface fluids. In the context of geologic CO2 sequestration, fractures could threaten the security of reservoirs since they are pathways for leakage. However, the constitutive equations describing the pressure-saturation and relative permeability-saturation, key inputs for flow modeling and prediction, are poorly understood for two-phase fracture flow at the field scale where each fracture might be an element of a complex fracture network or dual-porosity domain. This knowledge is required for the safe storage of CO2 under potentially fractured caprocks. To address this, we numerically simulated two-phase viscous flow through horizontal heterogeneous fractures across a broad range of roughness and aperture correlation length. The numerical experiments, which solved the modified local cubic law, showed a weak to strong phase interference during the drainage process; that is, supercritical CO2 displaces brine if the imposed pressure+local viscous force > local capillary force. The drainage process ended when no new brine cells can be further invaded by CO2. Afterward, we froze the saturation field for each individual phase and calculated the relative permeability by single-phase flow modeling. Thousands of simulated pressure-saturation and relative permeability curves enabled us to estimate and connect the parameters of the Van-Genuchten model and of the generalized nu-type model to fracture roughness and aperture correlation length. This empirical connection will be useful for assessing and predicting immiscible two-phase flow in horizontal rough fractures at the large scale.
   Plain Language Summary The analysis and modeling of two-phase flow require equations relating pressure and relative permeability with saturation. While these equations are somewhat mature for porous media flow applications, application of them in fractures or fractured media remains an open challenge. The key challenge is because of fracture heterogeneity represented by the roughness of the fracture surfaces and spatial structure of the aperture or spacing between fracture surfaces. We addressed this challenge by simulating two-phase flow of supercritical CO2 and brine through 7,700 heterogeneous fractures across a broad range of roughness and aperture correlation length. Using all these simulations, we systematically and successfully estimated the parameters in the Van-Genuchten model for pressure-saturation and the generalized nu-type model for relative permeability-saturation. The model parameters were then related to fracture roughness and aperture correlation length. This partly solves the challenge of predicting two-phase flow at the large scale.

ID FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; INFORMATION-THEORY; HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE
AB The estimation of flood frequency is vital for the flood control strategies and hydraulic structure design. Generating synthetic flood events according to statistical properties of observations is one of plausible methods to analyze the flood frequency. Due to the statistical dependence among the flood event variables (i.e. the flood peak, volume and duration), a multidimensional joint probability estimation is required. Recently, the copula method is widely used for multivariable dependent structure construction, however, the copula family should be chosen before application and the choice process is sometimes rather subjective. The entropy copula, a new copula family, employed in this research proposed a way to avoid the relatively subjective process by combining the theories of copula and entropy. The analysis shows the effectiveness of the entropy copula for probabilistic modelling the flood events of two hydrological gauges, and a comparison of accuracy with the popular copulas was made. The Gibbs sampling technique was applied for trivariate flood events simulation in order to mitigate the calculation difficulties of extending to three dimension directly. The simulation results indicate that the entropy copula is a simple and effective copula family for trivariate flood simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contemporary watershed management practices can reflect oversimplifications of relationships between anthropogenic pressures and resource degradation. Remediation and restoration efforts often focus on recent land use practices as the primary driver of hydrologic regime changes. We present a case study that serves as an example to the scientific and watershed management communities of the lasting influences of historic land use practices and natural physical processes on a stream in the central United States listed as impaired by the federal government. Abnormal spatiotemporal streamflow relationships, determined by means of an experimental watershed study, alerted the authors to possible sink/source behavior in the upper-watershed. Subsequent research uncovered archival evidence of coal mining, which may provide at least partial explanation. Additional investigation identified hydrologic processes associated with natural landscape evolution, noted by early-20th-century researchers, which are considered in the context of the current water quality and flow regime. Despite best-intended management practices, regulatory agencies, scientists, and local decision makers have not accounted for such practices and processes, instead relying on recent development as the proximate cause of designated impairment. We present argumentation that historic land use (coal mining) and landscape processes comprise cumulative yet unconsidered legacy effects that contribute systemically to the observed hydrologic regime of the watershed. Results hold important implications for contemporary watershed management, and support rethinking the case-by-case appropriateness of federal and state water impairment listings, and the achievability of restoration efforts in many developing watersheds.

AB This work developed regional Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) formulas for non-recording sites based on the scaling theory. Forty-six recording raingauges over northern Taiwan provide the data set for analysis. The temporal scaling properties of annual maximum rainfall series for various durations were first investigated. The hypothesis of piecewise simple scaling combined with Gumbel distribution was used to develop the IDF scaling formulas. Since most of parameters in IDF scaling formulas can be estimated from the annual 1-day maximum series, these parameters were regionalized based on the relationship between the scaling exponent and the average of annual 1-day maximum rainfall. Three scaling homogeneous regions were classified by different scaling regimes and regional IDF scaling formulas were developed in each region. The analyzed results reveal that the regional IDF scaling formulas proposed herein resulted in reasonable simulations and verifications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative model comparison methodology based on deviance information criterion, a Bayesian measure of the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit, is developed and demonstrated by comparing semiempirical transpiration models. This methodology accounts for parameter and prediction uncertainties associated with such models and facilitates objective selection of the simplest model, out of available alternatives, which does not significantly compromise the ability to accurately model observations. We use this methodology to compare various Jarvis canopy conductance model configurations, embedded within a larger transpiration model, against canopy transpiration measured by sap flux. The results indicate that descriptions of the dependence of stomatal conductance on vapor pressure deficit, photosynthetic radiation, and temperature, as well as the gradual variation in canopy conductance through the season are essential in the transpiration model. Use of soil moisture was moderately significant, but only when used with a hyperbolic vapor pressure deficit relationship. Subtle differences in model quality could be clearly associated with small structural changes through the use of this methodology. The results also indicate that increments in model complexity are not always accompanied by improvements in model quality and that such improvements are conditional on model structure. Possible application of this methodology to compare complex semiempirical models of natural systems in general is also discussed.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The topography of first-order catchments in a region of western Amazonia was found to exhibit distinctive, recurrent features: a steep, straight lower side slope, a flat or nearly flat terrace at an intermediate elevation between valley floor and interfluve, and an upper side slope connecting interfluve and intermediate terrace. A detailed survey of soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat))-depth relationships, involving 740 undisturbed soil cores, was conducted in a 0.75-ha first-order catchment. The sampling approach was stratified with respect to the above slope units. Exploratory data analysis suggested fourth-root transformation of batches from the 0-0.1 m depth interval, log transformation of batches from the subsequent 0.1 m depth increments, and the use of robust estimators of location and scale. The K(sat) of the steep lower side slope decreased from 46 to 0.1 mm/h over the overall sampling depth of 0.4 m. The corresponding decrease was from 462 to 0.1 mm/h on the intermediate terrace, from 335 to 0.01 mm/h on the upper side slope, and from 550 to 0.015 mm/h on the interfluve. A depthwise comparison of these slope units led to the formulation of several hypotheses concerning the link between K(sat) and topography.

AB Flood events are the most commonly occurring natural disaster, with over 5 million properties at risk in the UK alone. Changes in the global climate are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Flood hazard assessments, using climate projections as input, guide policy decisions and engineering projects to reduce the impact of large return period events. Probabilistic flood modeling is required to take into account uncertainties in climate model projections. However, the dichotomous relationship between probabilistic modeling, computational cost and model resolution limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper examines improvements to traditional Monte Carlo methods using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to quantify the uncertainty in flood extent resulting from input hydrograph uncertainty. The results demonstrate that MLMC is a more efficient modeling strategy than current methods (i.e., traditional Monte Carlo) with high resolution outputs produced in less time than previously possible. The novel application of MLMC technique to three Scottish case studies, demonstrating a variety of river characteristics, domain sizes and computational costs, using a high resolution 5 m grid resulted in a 99.2% reduction in computational cost compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods and up to 2.3 times speedup over Latin Hypercube Sampling.

AB A novel mathematical model was developed to describe the transport of nanoparticles in water saturated, homogeneous porous media with uniform flow. The model accounts for the simultaneous migration and aggregation of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are assumed to be found suspended in the aqueous phase or attached reversibly or irreversibly onto the solid matrix. The Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory was used to account for possible repulsive interactions between aggregates. Nanoparticle aggregation was represented by the Smoluchowski population balance equation (PBE). Both reaction-limited aggregation and diffusion-limited aggregation were considered. Particle-size dependent dispersivity was accounted for. In order to overcome the substantial difficulties introduced by the PBE, the governing coupled partial differential equations were solved by employing adaptive operator splitting methods, which decoupled the reactive transport and aggregation into distinct physical processes. The results from various model simulations showed that the transport of nanoparticles in porous media is substantially different than the transport of conventional biocolloids. In particular, aggregation was shown to either decrease or increase nanoparticle attachment onto the solid matrix, depending on particle size, and to yield early or late breakthrough, respectively. Finally, useful conclusions were drawn regarding possible erroneous results generated when aggregation, particle-size dependent dispersivity or nanoparticle surface charges are neglected.

AB This note presents a novel method for determining the changing composition of a multi-component NAPL body dissolving into moving groundwater, and the consequent changes in the aqueous phase solute concentrations in the surrounding pore water. A canonical system of coupled non-linear governing equations is derived which is suitable for representation of both pooled and residual configurations, and this is solved. Whereas previous authors have handled such problems numerically, it is shown that these governing equations succumb to analytical solution. By a suitable substitution, the equations become decoupled, and the problem collapses to a single first-order equation. The final result is expressed implicitly, with time as a function of the number of moles of the least soluble component, m(1). The number of moles of each other component is expressed explicitly in terms of m(1). It is shown that the time-nil relationship has a well behaved inverse. An example is given in which the analytic solution is verified against traditional finite difference analysis, and its computational efficiency is shown. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI In-stream geomorphic structures as drivers of hyporheic exchange

AB Common in-stream geomorphic structures such as debris dams and steps can drive hyporheic exchange in streams. Exchange is important for ecological stream function, and restoring function is a goal of many stream restoration projects, yet the connection between in-stream geomorphic form, hydrogeologic setting, and hyporheic exchange remains inadequately characterized. We used the models HEC-RAS, MODFLOW, and MODPATH to simulate coupled surface and subsurface hydraulics in a gaining stream containing a single in-stream geomorphic structure and to systematically evaluate the impact of fundamental characteristics of the structure and its hydrogeologic setting on induced exchange. We also conducted a field study to support model results. Model results indicated that structure size, background groundwater discharge rate, and sediment hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors determining the magnitude of induced hyporheic exchange, followed by geomorphic structure type, depth to bedrock, and channel slope. Model results indicated channel-spanning structures were more effective at driving hyporheic flow than were partially spanning structures, and weirs were more effective than were steps. Across most structure types, downwelling flux rate increased linearly with structure size, yet hyporheic residence time exhibited nonlinear behavior, increasing quickly with size at low structure sizes and declining thereafter. Important trends in model results were observed at the field site and also interpreted using simple hydraulic theory, thereby supporting the modeling approach and clarifying underlying processes.

AB Understanding the relationship between water and energy systems is important for effective management of both resources. Improved data availability has made more comprehensive modeling of hydropower and its water use possible, even as droughts and climate change have made questions about reservoir evaporation responsiveness more timely. This work makes three main contributions: first, it presents national and regional estimates of gross evaporation and evaporation net of evapotranspiration from local land cover ("net evaporation") for U.S. hydroelectricity, arguing that net evaporation is more consistent with other measures of energy-related water intensity; second, it introduces and validates a method for estimating system-wide evaporation based on primary purpose allocation that reduces data requirements by two orders of magnitude; and third, it makes available for public use a full Penman-Monteith model with multiple built-in sensitivity analyses. Based on this model, the U.S. hydropower system consumes an estimated average of 1.7 m(3) of net freshwater per GJ electricity produced (11 m(3)/GJ gross). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stochastic precipitation generators (SPGs) are often used to produce synthetic precipitation series for water resource management. Typically, an SPG assumes a stationary climate. We present an hourly precipitation generation algorithm for nonstationary conditions informed by the global climate model (GCM) forecasted average monthly temperature (AMT). The physical basis for precipitation formation is considered explicitly in the design of the algorithm using hourly pressure change events (PCE) to define the relationship between hourly precipitation and AMT. The algorithm consists of a multivariable Markov Chain and a moving window driven by time, temperature, and pressure change. We demonstrate the methodology by generating a 100-year, continuous, synthetic hourly precipitation time series using GCM AMT projections for the Northeast United States. When compared with historical observations, the synthetic results suggest that future precipitation in this region will be more variable, with more frequent mild events and fewer but intensified extremes, especially in warm seasons. The synthetic time series suggests that there will be less precipitation in the summers, while winters will be wetter, consistent with other research on climate change projections for the Northeast United States. This SPG provides physically plausible weather ensembles for water resource studies involving climate change.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Floods in mesoscale catchments (with a size of a few hundreds to a few thousand square kilometers) are often related to typical large scale weather phenomena which affect a large area in continental scale. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology for the identification of flood producing daily atmospheric circulation patterns (CPs) from large-scale pressure maps. The CPs are described by fuzzy rules which indicate the locations of the pressure centers-lows and highs. The flood producing circulation patterns are identified using the positive increments of the observed discharge series. The rules are assessed using a discrete optimization procedure based on simulated annealing. The goal of the optimization is to find Us corresponding to high discharge increments. The methodology is applied in two catchments: the Ardeche in France and the Llobregat in Spain. In both cases typical flood producing CPs could be identified. The occurrence of these Us does not necessarily lead to floods, but most important floods were related to them. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hedging the financial risk from water scarcity for Great Lakes shipping

   PRECIPITATION; TRANSPORT; DROUGHT
AB Low water levels in the Great Lakes have recently had significant financial impacts on the region's commercial shipping, which transports hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bulk goods each year. Cargo capacity is a function of a ship's draft, the distance between water level and the ship's bottom, and lower water levels force ships to reduce cargo loads to prevent running aground in shallow harbors and locks. Financial risk transfer instruments, such as index-based insurance contracts, may provide an adaptable method for managing these financial risks. In this work, a relationship between water levels and shipping revenues is developed and used in an actuarial analysis of the frequency and magnitude of revenue losses. This analysis is used to develop a standardized suite of binary financial contracts, which are indexed to water levels and priced according to predefined thresholds. These contracts are then combined to form hedging portfolios with different objectives for the shippers. Results suggest that binary contracts could substantially reduce the risk of financial losses during low lake level periods and at a relatively low cost of only one to three percent of total revenues, depending on coverage level.

AB This study shows how Mualem-van Genuchten (M-vG) parameters can be obtained from GPR data acquired during water infiltration from a single ring infiltrometer in the case of a sandy soil. Water content profiles were generated at various time steps using HYDRUS-1D, based on particular values of the M-vG parameters and were converted to dielectric permittivity profiles using the Complex Refractive Index Method. The GprMax suite of programs was used to generate radargrams and to follow the wetting front progression in depth using the arrival time of the electromagnetic waves recorded by a ground-penetrating radar (GPR). Theoretically, the 1-D time convolution between reflectivity and GPR signal at any infiltration time step is related to the peak of the reflected signal recorded in the corresponding trace in the radargram. We used this relationship to invert the M-vG parameters for constant and falling head infiltrations using the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm. The method is presented on synthetic examples and on experiments carried out for a sandy soil. The parameters inverted are compared with values obtained in laboratory on soil samples and with disk infiltrometer measurements.

AB Characterizing aquifer heterogeneity is paramount for accurate flow and transport modeling. In this work, we present a new approach for statistical analysis of hydraulic properties in continuous pumping tomography tests of a phreatic aquifer. The method entails determining equivalent hydraulic conductivity (K-eq), specific storage (S-s,S-eq), and specific yield (S-y,S-eq) at many locations in the field and then calculating statistical moments of the equivalent properties, assuming they are random space variables. Equivalent properties are defined as the ones pertinent to a homogeneous aquifer for which the head time dependent signal fits the one observed in the pumping test. Calculation is carried out in a novel approach, by matching measured head data to two separate semianalytical solutions considering two time periods, early and late. We apply this approach to the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site and find that the equivalent property spatial averages decrease with horizontal distance from the pumping well and appear to stabilize at sufficiently large distances, in line with existing theory for K-eq. The squared coefficient of variation shows similar behavior, with values indicating a weakly heterogeneous aquifer. Furthermore, estimated values for K-eq, S-s,S-eq, and S-y,S-eq are in agreement with literature values for the site.

AB Microtopography, consisting of small-scale excursions in the elevation of the land surface on millimeter to centimeter scales, is ubiquitous on hillslopes, but its effects are rarely incorporated into hydrological analyses of rainfall-runoff partitioning. To progress toward a hydrological theory that accounts for microtopography, two research questions are considered: (1) Does microtopography change the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration compared to a background case that lacks these small-scale excursions? and (2) how do soil, mean slope, storm properties, and microtopographic geometric attributes influence this partitioning? To address these questions, a simplified one-dimensional hillslope with uniform sinusoidal microtopography is considered, and several rainfall-runoff scenarios are examined with a numerical model. The results indicate that for a range of realistic conditions, microtopography increases the proportion of rainfall infiltrating by 20-200% relative to an equivalent "background state" in which microtopography is absent. Additional theoretical development addressing issues of connectivity and improved representations of flow hydraulics over microtopographic surfaces are needed to refine these estimates and extend them to less idealized conditions. If confirmed, the results suggest that microtopography may have a significant impact on streamflow generation, plant water availability and the co-evolution of geomorphic, hydrological and ecological systems, with important implications for land management, especially in arid ecosystems.

AB The coupled hydrology and mechanics of soft porous materials (such as clays, hydrogels, membranes, and biofilms) is an important research area in several fields, including water and energy technologies as well as biomedical engineering. Well-established models based on poromechanics theory exist for describing these coupled properties, but these models are not adapted to describe systems with more than one characteristic length scale, that is, systems that contain both macropores and micropores. In this paper, we expand upon the well-known Darcy-Brinkman formulation of fluid flow in two-scale porous media to develop a "Darcy-Brinkman-Biot" formulation: a general coupled system of equations that approximates the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid-filled macropores and resembles the equations for poroelasticity in microporous regions. We parameterized and validated our model for systems that contain either plastic (swelling clay) or elastic microporous regions. In particular, we used our model to predict the permeability of an idealized siliciclastic sedimentary rock as a function of pore water salinity and clay content. Predicted permeability values are well described by a single parametric relation between permeability and clay volume fraction that agrees with existing experimental data sets. Our novel formulation captures the coupled hydro-chemo-mechanical properties of sedimentary rocks and other deformable porous media in a manner that can be readily implemented within the framework of Digital Rock Physics.

AB Distinct water-content profiles, having saturated theta-bumps at and immediately behind wetting fronts, were observed in narrow columns (9 mm ID) of homogeneous air-dried glass beads under downward one-dimensional infiltration with applied water fluxes at lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity. The infiltrating water content profiles and the position of the wetting front as a function of time were also calculated based on Richards' equation using an independently measured hydraulic conductivity function K(theta), and water retention characteristic theta(h), of the drainage process, and by applying a pressure boundary condition, h(we), which is almost atmospheric pressure, at the moving wetting front. The good agreement between the calculated profiles and the observed confirms that the dynamic water entry pressure h(we) (where theta(h(we)) is the saturated water content), does exist for air-dried glass beads, although it is in contradiction to the modern theory of unsaturated water flow in porous media. This physical property of dry media creates an upward negative pressure profile behind the wetting front that would inevitably produce finger flow if the column diameter were larger. At the wetting front, the water content and pressure should be completely discontinuous at the level of pore size, and hence Darcy's equation cannot be applied across the interface between the air-dried and saturated media.

AB The Alps are often referred to as the water tower of Europe. In Switzerland, many branches of the economy, especially the hydropower industry, are closely linked to and dependent on the availability of water. Assessing the impact of climate change on streamflow runoff is, thus, of great interest. Major efforts have already been made in this respect, but the analyses often focus on individual catchments and are difficult to intercompare. In this article, we analysed nine high-alpine catchments spread over the Swiss Alps, selected for their relevance to a wide range of morphological characteristics. Runoff projections were carried out until the end of the current century by applying the Glacier Evolution Runoff Model (GERM) and climate scenarios generated in the framework of the ENSEMBLES project. We focused on assessing the uncertainty induced by the unknown climate evolution and provided general, statistically based statements, which should be useful as a rule of thumb for analyses addressing questions related to water management. Catchments with a high degree of glacierization will undergo the largest changes. General statements about absolute variations in discharge are unreliable, but an overall pattern, with an initial phase of increased annual discharge, followed by a phase with decreasing discharge, is recognizable for all catchments with a significant degree of glacierization. In these catchments, a transition from glacial and glacio-nival regime types to nival will occur. The timing of maximal annual runoff is projected to occur before 2050 in all basins. The time of year with maximal daily discharges is expected to occur earlier at a rate of 4.4 +/- 1.7 days per decade. Compared to its present level, the contribution of snow- and icemelt to annual discharge is projected to drop by 15 to 25% until the year 2100. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The evolution of the ecohydrological system driven by external climatic forcing and internal feedbacks between vegetation and hydrology, which is more remarkable in arid and semiarid regions, has attracted substantial research attention in recent years. To examine critically the state-of-the-art assumptions and dynamic equations used in the evolution study of an ecohydrological system, the rule of proceeding from simplicity to complexity should be followed. The riparian vegetation ecohydrological system in hyperarid regions (e.g. the lower Tarim River) can serve as a starting point given its simplicity, which has been seldom examined before in terms of system evolution. Further, the water transfer practice from 2000 to 2006 in the lower Tarim River serves as a valuable prototype experiment for model validation. This is because the remarkable changes in groundwater and vegetation in the area have taken place within a shorter period and thus can be easily observed. In the present study, the ecohydrological evolution model on riparian vegetation (ERV model) in hyperarid regions was proposed by coupling groundwater movement and vegetation dynamics. In the ERV model, the groundwater table serves as a critical feedback variable that determines the vegetation dynamics (colonization and mortality) and is determined by vegetation transpiration other than groundwater movement. The monitored groundwater table by wells and satellite-observed vegetation coverage from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer are used for model validation. The simulation results show the good performance of the ERV model with uncalibrated parameters. It was also calibrated manually using a multiobjective method, and the fine-tuned parameters are close to the uncalibrated ones, indicating the robustness of the model. The analysis shows further that the increased evapotranspiration is substantially due to the water transfer and thus the vegetation growth, which implies the importance of ecohydrological coupling for long-term hydrological modelling.

AB Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) often is applied to assess the sensitivity of model outputs to their inputs using ensemble simulations. However, increasing model complexity and the associated computational cost have limited the use of most GSA approaches for process-based watershed models. We propose to use mutual information (MI) as a computationally efficient GSA method for watershed modeling. Such MI computed from several hundred realizations usually can capture nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs of interest. We perform MI-based watershed sensitivity analyses in studies of the Portage River Watershed in Ohio and the American River Watershed in Washington. In these studies, MI is used to evaluate the sensitivity of river discharges simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to no less than 20 SWAT parameters for each watershed. Our MI-based sensitivity analyses achieved convergence with about 300-500 realizations, a small fraction of the ensemble size (i.e., several thousands) required by the Sobol method. Nevertheless, the two-dimensional MI yields similar sensitivity ranking compared to Sobol's total-order sensitivity indices, especially for sensitive parameters. Our study thus sheds new light on the use of MI as an affordable GSA method for computationally intensive models such as the hyperresolution, watershed hydrobiogeochemical models.

AB We propose a mathematical framework for the general definition and computation of travel time distributions defined by the closure of a catchment control volume, where the input flux is an arbitrary rainfall pattern and the output fluxes are green and blue water flows (namely, evapotranspiration and the hydrologic response embedding runoff production through soil water dynamics). The relevance of the problem is both practical, owing to implications in hydrologic watershed modeling, and conceptual for the linkages and the explanations the theory provides, chiefly concerning the role of geomorphology, climate, soils, and vegetation through soil water dynamics and the treatment of the so called old water paradox. The work focuses in particular on the origins of the conditional and time-variant nature of travel time distributions and on the differences between unit hydrographs and travel time distributions. Both carrier flow and solute matter transport in the control volume are accounted for coherently. The key effect of mixing processes occurring within runoff production is also investigated, in particular by a model that assumes that mobilization of soil water involves randomly sampled particles from the available storage. Travel time distributions are analytically expressed in terms of the major water fluxes driving soil moisture dynamics, irrespectively of the specific model used to compute them. Relevant numerical examples and a set of generalized applications are provided and discussed.

AB We propose two techniques for fracture aperture reconstruction. The first one is a correlation technique that estimates the normal aperture or the tangential shift across a discontinuity whose sides present geometrical similarities. The only required material is a pair of appropriately controlled images of each side. Here, the images are maps of the corresponding side topography, obtained from laser profilometry. Assuming a purely normal opening, it is possible, from two corresponding sides of a given discontinuity in a core log, to infer the precise geometry of the in situ aperture. The second technique allows to retrieve the three-dimensional geometry of a sealed discontinuity from non-independent topography measurements of both sides. Both techniques are applied to discontinuities extracted from a core drilled down to 20 m in a fractured marl formation at Draix (French Alps). The probability density functions of the aperture of the sealed and open discontinuities are shown to be Gaussian. At the sample scale, the sealed fracture aperture is self-affine, while the open one shows a cross-over from a self-affine regime at very small scales to an uncorrelated regime at largest scales. After extrapolating those scaling laws at the scale of the whole formation, we discuss when the aperture roughness affects the hydraulic properties of the Draix fractured bedrock. The overall estimated permeability is significant (10-9 - 10-8 m2), consistently with some previous indirect inferences. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Continental flow plays a significant role in the global ecosystem. With increased global warming and a booming economy exacerbating water scarcity, global analyses of continental discharge are of great relevance to water management. In this paper, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, with variations accounting for lag-1 autocorrelation, full autocorrelation, and long-term persistence, was used to detect the long-term flow trends in 916 of the world's largest ocean-reaching rivers over the period 1948-2004. Field significance was evaluated using Walker's test. Globally, the results revealed more decreases in streamflow than increases. With the traditional MK test, 503 rivers had decreased streamflow, with 120 showing significant decreases, whereas 408 rivers had increased streamflow, with 51 showing significant increases. Regionally, positive streamflow trends mainly occurred in high-latitude areas and negative streamflow trends mainly occurred in low-latitude areas, a pattern that can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming. When the full autocorrelation structure and long-term persistence behavior were taken into account in the trend analysis, there was a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow. Negligible departures from the traditional MK results were observed when only the lag-1 autocorrelation was taken into consideration. For the Americas and Europe, annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend; for other continents, there was a slight downward trend. For all oceans except the Arctic Ocean, integrated river flow had a downward trend. We investigated the causal relationships between streamflow and ocean signals using the Granger causality test. El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals were significantly causal for river flow in over 36% of global rivers tested. The influence of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was significant in more than a quarter of rivers studied. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was responsible for the variation in streamflow for over a quarter of rivers studied. Streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals as well as by anthropogenic activities.

   SYSTEMS; MODEL; LONG; AUSTRALIA; FRAMEWORK; OPTIMIZATION
AB Considerable research effort has recently been directed at improving and operationalising ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasts. Whilst this creates new opportunities for improving the performance of water resources systems, there may also be associated risks. Here, we explore these potential risks by examining the sensitivity of forecast value (improvement in system performance brought about by adopting forecasts) to changes in the forecast skill for a range of hypothetical reservoir designs with contrasting operating objectives. Forecast-informed operations are simulated using rolling horizon, adaptive control and then benchmarked against optimised control rules to assess performance improvements. Results show that there exists a strong relationship between forecast skill and value for systems operated to maintain a target water level. But this relationship breaks down when the reservoir is operated to satisfy a target demand for water; good forecast accuracy does not necessarily translate into performance improvement. We show that the primary cause of this behaviour is the buffering role played by storage in water supply reservoirs, which renders the forecast superfluous for long periods of the operation. System performance depends primarily on forecast accuracy when critical decisions are made - namely during severe drought. As it is not possible to know in advance if a forecast will perform well at such moments, we advocate measuring the consistency of forecast performance, through bootstrap resampling, to indicate potential usefulness in storage operations. Our results highlight the need for sensitivity assess-ment in value-of-forecast studies involving reservoirs with supply objectives.

TI Field estimates of groundwater circulation depths in two mountainous

   EVOLUTION; BASIN; CHEMISTRY; RECHARGE; AGE; PERMEABILITY
AB Estimates of groundwater circulation depths based on field data are lacking. These data are critical to inform and refine hydrogeologic models of mountainous watersheds, and to quantify depth and time dependencies of weathering processes in watersheds. Here we test two competing hypotheses on the role of geology and geologic setting in deep groundwater circulation and the role of deep groundwater in the geochemical evolution of streams and springs. We test these hypotheses in two mountainous watersheds that have distinctly different geologic settings (one crystalline, metamorphic bedrock and the other volcanic bedrock). Estimated circulation depths for springs in both watersheds range from 0.6 to 1.6 km and may be as great as 2.5 km. These estimated groundwater circulation depths are much deeper than commonly modeled depths suggesting that we may be forcing groundwater flow paths too shallow in models. In addition, the spatial relationships of groundwater circulation depths are different between the two watersheds. Groundwater circulation depths in the crystalline bedrock watershed increase with decreasing elevation indicative of topography-driven groundwater flow. This relationship is not present in the volcanic bedrock watershed suggesting that both the source of fracturing (tectonic versus volcanic) and increased primary porosity in the volcanic bedrock play a role in deep groundwater circulation. The results from the crystalline bedrock watershed also indicate that relatively deep groundwater circulation can occur at local scales in headwater drainages less than 9.0 km(2) and at larger fractions than commonly perceived. Deep groundwater is a primary control on streamflow processes and solute concentrations in both watersheds.
   Plain Language Summary Groundwater is an important source of water for perennial streams and springs (perennial means that the streams and springs flow year-round). However, it's still unclear what pathways groundwater takes in the bedrock aquifer to reach these streams and springs. Some pathways are shallow and some are deep, we call this groundwater circulation. Estimates of circulation depths based on field data are lacking, so we have little information to inform, critique, or validate our hydrogeologic models of groundwater flow in watersheds. This is especially important in steep mountainous watersheds like the ones found in the western United States. The depth of circulation is important because it defines how long it will take for groundwater to reach a stream or spring, how it will change geochemically along the flowpaths, and how long it will take for landscape-scale perturbations such as droughts (reduced recharge) to propagate through the mountain aquifer and impact the perennial streams and springs. Our data reveal circulation depths exceeding 1 to 1.5 km suggesting that groundwater circulation in mountainous watersheds can be deeper than currently represented in models. This has important implications for understanding aquifer responses and response times to pertubations, and weathering fluxes from the landscape.

AB We present a novel approach for modeling streamflow in ungauged catchments. Because of their widespread availability and global coverage, remotely sensed data provide an attractive alternative to supplement the absence of streamflow data in hydrological model calibration. One observable signal holds particular appeal; the satellite-derived calibration ratio-measurement (C/M ratio) has been widely studied as a direct measurement of streamflow because of its physical relationship to streamflow and demonstrated correlation with in situ streamflow. This study identifies the challenges in calibrating a hydrological model using a satellite-derived C/M ratio, presenting a rationale designed to account for the limitations that these data pose. A new Bayesian calibration approach is developed that uses the surrogate streamflow derived from the C/M ratio in place of direct streamflow observations. We assess and demonstrate our approach for three Australian Hydrologic Reference Stations, which can be considered free from anthropogenic effects, with distinct attributes. The results indicate the competency of the proposed approach, showing model performance with 0.54 similar to 0.78 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values, with the uncertainties in the model calibration quantified via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Overall, our study finds the new model calibration promising for predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), as the global data coverage of satellite data and the suitability of the approach suggest significant improvements over traditional approaches to PUB.

AB Several models for two-phase flow in porous media identify trapping and connectivity of fluids as an important contribution to macroscale hysteresis. This is especially true for hysteresis in relative permeabilities. The trapping models propose trajectories from the initial saturation to the end saturation in various ways and are often based on experiments or pore-network model results for the endpoints. However, experimental data or pore-scale model results are often not available for the trajectories, that is, the fate of the connectivity of the fluids while saturation changes. Here, using a quasi static pore-network model, supported by a set of pore-scale laboratory experiments, we study how the topology of the fluids changes during drainage and imbibition including first, main and scanning curves. We find a strong hysteretic behavior in the relationship between disconnected nonwetting fluid saturation and the wetting fluid saturation in a water-wet medium. The coalescence of the invading nonwetting phase with the existing disconnected nonwetting phase depends critically on the presence (or lack thereof) of connected nonwetting phase at the beginning of the drainage process as well as on the pore geometry. This dependence involves a mechanism we refer to as reversible corner filling. This mechanism can also be seen in laboratory experiments in volcanic tuff. The impact of these pore-network model results on existing macroscopic models is discussed.

TI Numerical homogenization of the Richards equation for unsaturated water

AB Homogenized equations and the corresponding effective constitutive relations are generally necessary for numerically modeling large-scale unsaturated flow processes in soils. Recently, based on the Kirchhoff transformation and the two-scale convergence theory, a homogenization method for the Richards equation with the Mualem-van Genuchten model has been proposed, with a constant model parameter a relating to the inverse of the air-entry pressure and the soil pore size distribution. The homogenized model is computationally efficient and convenient to use because of its explicit expression. In this study, we generalize this method, allowing a to be a spatially distributed random field and proposing a homogenized Richards equation in the mixed form (h/h) under the condition that the effective hydraulic conductivity tensor is diagonal. This generalization eliminates the limitation of a constant a in practical applications; the proposed homogenized model is meaningful in most situations because the flow problems are influenced mainly by the diagonal terms of conductivity and the off-diagonal terms are often neglected. Two-dimensional numerical tests are conducted in soil profiles with different degrees of spatial heterogeneity structure to illustrate that the homogenized model can capture the fine-scale flow behaviors on coarse grids effectively. Homogenization for the Richards equation with other two commonly used constitutive relations-the Brooks-Corey model and the Gardner-Russo model-is also illustrated in this study.

AB In cold agricultural regions, seasonal snowmelt over frozen soils provides the primary source of runoff and transports large nutrient loads downstream. The postglacial landscape of the Canadian Prairies and Northern Plains of the United States creates challenges for hydrological and water quality modeling. Here, the application of conventional hydrological models is problematic because of cold regions hydrological and chemical processes, the lack of fluvially eroded drainage systems, large noncontributing areas to streamflow and level topography. A new hydrodynamic model was developed to diagnose overland flow from snowmelt in this situation. The model was used to calculate the effect of variable contributing areas on (1) hydrological connectivity and the development of (2) tipping points in streamflow generation and (3) predominant chemical transport pathways. The agricultural Steppler Basin in Manitoba, Canada, was used to evaluate the model and diagnose snowmelt runoff. Relationships were established between contributing area and (1) snowmelt runoff intensity, (2) seasonal snowmelt volumes and duration, and (3) inundated, active and connected areas. Variations in the contributing area depended on terrain and snowmelt characteristics including wind redistribution of snow. Predictors of hydrological response and the size of the contributing area were developed which can be used in larger scale hydrological models of similar regions

AB Model development in hydrology and geochemistry has been advancing separately with limited integration. We developed a watershed hydrogeochemical code RT-Flux-PIHM to understand complex interactions between hydrological processes (PIHM), land-surface processes (FLUXNoah Land Surface Model), and multicomponent subsurface reactive transport (RT). The RT module simulates geochemical processes including aqueous complexation, surface complexation, mineral dissolution and precipitation, and cation exchange. The RT module is verified against the widely used reactive transport code CrunchFlow. The code uses semidiscrete finite volume method and irregular gridding and offers data harvesting capabilities from national databases. The application of RT-Flux-PIHM is demonstrated in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO). We aim to understand key processes that govern hydrogeochemical dynamics of the nonreactive chloride and reactive magnesium. Simulation results indicate that watershed characteristics, in particular topography, dictate the spatial distributions of water content and soil dissolution rates. Ion exchange provides buffering capacities and leads to a hysteresis loop of concentration and discharge relationship of magnesium, which differs from the open hysteresis of chloride. RT-Flux-PIHM offers physics-based modeling capabilities to integrate the vast amount of water and chemistry data that have now become available, to differentiate the relative importance of competing processes, and to test hypotheses at the interface of hydrology and geochemistry.

   RUNOFF; WATER; LINEARITY; DRAINAGE; AREA
AB This paper proposes a theoretical explanation of the variations of the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) versus catchment area relationships and the complex patterns in the behavior of sediment transfer processes at catchment scale. Taking into account the effects of erosion source types, deposition, and hydrological controls, we propose a simple conceptual model that consists of two linear stores arranged in series: a hillslope store that addresses transport to the nearest streams and a channel store that addresses sediment routing in the channel network. The model identifies four dimensionless scaling factors, which enable us to analyze a variety of effects on SDR estimation, including (1) interacting processes of erosion sources and deposition, (2) different temporal averaging windows, and (3) catchment runoff response. We show that the interactions between storm duration and hillslope/channel travel times are the major controls of peak-value-based sediment delivery and its spatial variations. The interplay between depositional timescales and the travel/residence times determines the spatial variations of total-volume-based SDR. In practical terms this parsimonious, minimal complexity model could provide a sound physical basis for diagnosing catchment to catchment variability of sediment transport if the proposed scaling factors can be quantified using climatic and catchment properties.

AB Electrically conducive particles, such as pyrites, and surface-charge-bearing nonconductive particles, such as clays, are commonly present in water-bearing subsurface formations. Under an external electric field generated by electromagnetic measurement tool, these particles give rise to interfacial polarization (IFP) effects, which causes frequency dispersion of effective conductivity and effective permittivity of the mixture containing such particles. The neglect of IFP effects can lead to inaccurate estimation of petrophysical properties of formations, especially in clay- and pyrite- rich formations. In this paper, we developed a mechanistic model that couples surface-conductance-assisted interfacial polarization (SCAIP) model with perfectly polarized interfacial polarization (PPIP) model to estimate effective conductivity and effective permittivity of homogeneous formations containing both nonconductive and conducive particles at various fluids saturations. The model is developed based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a dilute solution in a weak electrical field regime to calculate the dipolarizability of the representative volume comprising a single isolated spherical particle in an electrolyte host. Then the effective medium theory is used to determine effective complex conductivity of the whole mixture. The result shows that the conducive particles dominate the frequency dispersion of complex conductivity due to IFP effects compared to nonconductive particles.

AB New methods for obtaining and quantifying spatially distributed subsurface moisture are a high research priority in process hydrology. We use simple linear regression analyses to compare terrain electrical conductivity measurements (EC) derived from multiple electromagnetic induction (EMI) frequencies to a distributed grid of water-table depth and soil-moisture measurements in a highly instrumented 50 by 50 m hillslope in Putnam County, New York. Two null hypotheses were tested: H0((1)), there is no relationship between water table depth and EC; H0((2)), there is no relationship between soil moisture levels and EC. We reject both these hypotheses. Regression analysis indicates that EC measurements from the low frequency EM31 meter with a vertical dipole orientation could explain over 80% of the variation in water-table depth across the test hillslope. Despite zeroing and sensitivity problems encountered with the high frequency EM38, EC measurements could explain over 70% of the gravimetrically determined soil-moisture variance. The use of simple moisture retrieval algorithms, which combined EC measurements from the EM31 and EM38 meters in both their vertical and horizontal orientations, helped increase the r(2) coefficients slightly. This first hillslope hydrological analysis of EMI technology in this way suggests that it may be a promising method for the collection of a large number of distributed soilwater and groundwater depth measurements with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

AB The general role of river water input in shaping the basic morphometric parameters of floodplain lakes has been previously investigated. However, the process has not been quantitatively described in detail. This study is the first attempt in the literature to determine the allometric relation between fluvial impulse, expressed as Fluvial Connectivity Quotient, and morphometric parameters of six floodplain lakes of Bug River valley in the period 1952-2014. This relationship is given by Y=aX(b), from which the value of b exponent was analysed to determine the strength of the allometric relation. Extreme values of allometric compounds during the time period under study ranged from 5.99 to -4.91. Volume was the morphometric parameter showing the highest variability in all the lakes. General similarity in allometric relations was observed in the lakes under study. During analysis, no long-term trends were observed in the relationship between the Fluvial Connectivity Quotient and morphometric parameters. The results obtained show that fluvial impulse was the factor determining the variability of morphometric parameters of the lakes. Direct catchments topography of lake has periodically (during limnophase periods) played a significant role in shaping the morphometry of floodplain lakes. The most stable allometric relations occurred in a confluent lake, with a low limnological effective rise value and consequently, relatively long potamophase periods.Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Stream networks expand and contract through time, impacting chemical export, aquatic habitat, and water quality. Although recent advances improve prediction of the extent of the wetted channel network (L) based on discharge at the catchment outlet (Q), controls on the temporal variability of L remain poorly understood and unquantified. Here we develop a quantitative, conceptual framework to explore how flow regime and stream network hydraulic scaling factors co-determine the relative temporal variability in L (denoted here as the total wetted channel drainage density). Network hydraulic scaling determines how much L changes for a change in Q, while the flow regime describes how Q changes in time. We compiled datasets of co-located dynamic stream extent mapping and discharge to analyze all globally available empirical data using the presented framework. We found that although variability in L is universally damped relative to variability in Q (i.e., streamflow is relatively more variable in time than network extent), the relationship is elastic, meaning that for a given increase in the variability in Q, headwater catchments will experience greater-than-proportional increases in the variability of L. Thus, under anticipated climatic shifts towards more volatile precipitation, relative variability in headwater stream network extents can be expected to increase even more than the relative variability of discharge itself. Comparison between network extents inferred from the L-Q relationship and blue lines on USGS topographic maps shows widespread underestimation of the wetted channel network by the blue line network.

AB Field measurements were conducted to study the influence of aquatic vegetation on flow structures in floodplains under combined currents and wind-driven waves. Wave and turbulent velocities were decomposed from the time series of instantaneous velocity and analysed separately. In the present study, the wind waves were small, leading to the ratios of wave excursion (E-w) to stem spacing (S) for all cases tested here were less than 0.5. This caused the vertical distributions of time-averaged velocity (U-horiz) and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) impacted by vegetation similar with the vegetated flow structures under pure current conditions. For emergent vegetation, U-horiz and TKE distributed uniformly through the entire water column or increased slightly from bed to water surface. Similar distributions were present in the lower part of submerged vegetation. In the upper part of submerged vegetation, U-horiz and TKE increased rapidly toward water surface and TKE reached its maximum near the top of vegetation. The measured wave orbital velocity (U-w) fitted linear wave theory well through the entire water depth for both the emergent and submerged cases, so that with small E-w/S the wave velocity was not attenuated within vegetation and U-w within canopy can be predicted by the linear wave theory under combined currents and waves. However, wind-driven waves made the turbulence generated near the top of canopy penetrate a deeper depth into vegetation than predictions under pure current conditions.

DT Article
DE UNSATURATED FLOW; 2-PHASE FLOW; DARCY LAW; INTERFACIAL AREAS; CAPILLARY
   PRESSURE
AB The present work incorporates the effects of interface dynamics into the theoretical description of two-phase flow in a porous medium. This advance offers the potential for improved understanding and modeling of multiphase flow processes. To provide background for this work, the traditional approach to describing two-phase flow in porous media is reviewed. The universally employed empirical extension of Darcy's Law for single-phase flow to two-phase flow situations is rejected as arbitrary and subject to severe shortcomings. Burial of dynamic effects into relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis is shown to be an unsatisfactory theoretical construct for modeling the actual processes occurring in two-phase flow. Examination of the traditional theory at equilibrium shows that interfacial forces actually present in multiphase systems have been overlooked causing the theory to provide contradictory results. To overcome these problems, a general theory of two-phase flow is proposed that is based on the basic principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics. This theory accounts, in a systematic way, for interfacial forces that are known to have an important effect on the movement of fluid phases in a porous medium. A new equation of momentum balance accounting for the presence of interfaces and their energetics is developed. This equation reduces to Darcy's Law for the special case of single-phase flow. The extended theory has the potential to describe phenomena unaccounted for by the traditional theory and thus provides a basis for scientific understanding of the physics of two-phase flow. Application of the theory requires experimental study to ascertain the values and precise functional dependence of the constitutive coefficients that arise.

AB In recent years, Spatial Markov Models have gained popularity in simulating solute transport in heterogeneous formations. They describe the transition times of particles between equidistant observation planes by statistical distributions, assuming correlation of the transit times of individual particles between subsequent steps. By this, the approach naturally captures preasymptotic solute dispersion. In this study, we analyze Spatial Markov Models assuming bivariate log-normal distributions of the particle slowness (i.e., the inverse velocity) in subsequent transitions. The model is fully parameterized by the mean Eulerian velocity, the variance of the log-slowness, and the correlation coefficient of log-slowness in subsequent steps. We derive closed-form expressions for distance-dependent ensemble dispersion, which is defined in terms of the second-central moments of the solute breakthrough curves. We relate the coefficients to the properties of the underlying log-hydraulic conductivity field assuming second-order stationarity. The results are consistent with linear stochastic theory in the limit of small log-conductivity variances, while the approach naturally extends to high-variance cases. We demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison to three-dimensional particle-tracking simulations of advective transport in heterogeneous media with isotropic, exponential correlation structure for log-conductivity variances up to five. This study contributes to relating solute dispersion to metrics of the porous-medium structure in cases of strong heterogeneity.

AB Two-dimensional (2-D) discrete fracture networks (DFNs) are widely used to study the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses. There are few studies on the reliability of 2-D DFNs reflecting the hydraulic properties of three-dimensional (3-D) rock masses. This study provides a new perspective based on percolation theory to study the interconnectivity between 3-D and 2-D DFNs quantitatively. For isotropic fractured rock masses, the corresponding value of the number of fractures in per sampled volume (P-30) when 3-D DFNs achieve the percolation threshold is theoretically derived. Additionally, the corresponding value of P-30 of the original 3-D model when its 2-D DFNs on cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is also derived for comparison. These theoretical formulas show that: (a) The corresponding values of P30 at percolation threshold for both 3-D and 2-D DFNs are only related to the fracture diameter and inversely proportional to its third power; and (b) The corresponding value of P-30 when 2-D DFNs achieve the percolation threshold is 6.5 times of the corresponding value of P-30 when its original 3-D DFNs achieve the percolation threshold. Numerical codes and experiments based on Particle Flow Code and Matlab are developed to verify the derived theoretical equations, and the results show that the theoretical equations are validated.

AB We investigate numerically apparent multi-fractal behavior of samples from synthetically generated processes subordinated to truncated fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) on finite domains. We are motivated by the recognition that many earth and environmental (including hydrological) variables appear to be self-affine (monofractal) or multifractal with Gaussian or heavy-tailed distributions. The literature considers self-affine and multifractal types of scaling to be fundamentally different, the first arising from additive and the second from multiplicative random fields or processes. It has been demonstrated theoretically by one of us that square or absolute increments of samples from Gaussian/Levy processes subordinated to tfBm exhibit apparent/spurious multifractality at intermediate ranges of separation lags, with breakdown in power-law scaling at small and large lags as is commonly exhibited by real data. A preliminary numerical demonstration of apparent multifractality by the same author was limited to Gaussian fields having nearest neighbor autocorrelations and led to rather noisy results. Here, we adopt a new generation scheme that allows us to investigate apparent multifractal behaviors of samples taken from a broad range of processes including Gaussian with and without symmetric Levy and log-normal (as well as potentially other) subordinators. Our results shed new light on the nature of apparent multifractality, which has wide implications vis-a-vis the scaling of many hydrological as well as other earth and environmental variables.

AB In order to quantify total error affecting hydrological models and predictions, we must explicitly recognize errors in input data, model structure, model parameters and validation data. This paper tackles the last of these: errors in discharge measurements used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model, caused by stage-discharge rating-curve uncertainty. This uncertainty may be due to several combined sources, including errors in stage and velocity measurements during individual gaugings, assumptions regarding a particular form of stage-discharge relationship, extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship beyond the maximum gauging, and cross-section change due to vegetation growth and/or bed movement. A methodology is presented to systematically assess and quantify the uncertainty in discharge measurements due to all of these sources. For a given stage measurement, a complete PDF of true discharge is estimated. Consequently, new model calibration techniques can be introduced to explicitly account for the discharge error distribution. The method is demonstrated for a gravel-bed river in New Zealand, where all the above uncertainty sources can be identified, including significant uncertainty in cross-section form due to scour and re-deposition of sediment. Results show that rigorous consideration of uncertainty in flow data results in significant improvement of the model's ability to predict the observed flow. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Water distribution system vulnerability analysis using weighted and

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CONNECTIVITY; METHODOLOGY; RESILIENCE; DESIGN
AB The reliability and robustness against failures of networked water distribution systems are central tenets of water supply system design and operation. The ability of such networks to continue to supply water when components are damaged or fail is dependent on the connectivity of the network and the role and location of the individual components. This paper employs a set of advanced network analysis techniques to study the connectivity of water distribution systems, its relationship with system robustness, and susceptibility to damage. Water distribution systems are modeled as weighted and directed networks by using the physical and hydraulic attributes of system components. A selection of descriptive measurements is utilized to quantify the structural properties of benchmark systems at both local (component) and global (network) scales. Moreover, a novel measure of component criticality, the demand-adjusted entropic degree, is proposed to support identification of critical nodes and their ranking according to failure impacts. The application and value of this metric is demonstrated through two case study networks in the USA and UK. Discussion focuses on the potential for gradual evolution of abstract graph-based tools and techniques to more practical network analysis methods, where a theoretical framework for the analysis of robustness and vulnerability of water distribution networks to better support planning and management decisions is presented.

In this article, we present an improved algorithm for estimating these two relationships without assigning an a priori shape to them. The approach uses cubic Hermite interpolation and a global optimization strategy. A multilevel routine identifies the adequate number of degrees of freedom by balancing model performance, the statistical interaction of the estimated model parameters, and their number. A first-order uncertainty analysis provides a quantitative measure of how well the soil hydraulic properties can be identified in different ranges of pressure head. This offers great potential for designing optimal experimental procedures for identifying the hydraulic properties of porous media. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for the evaluation of multistep outflow experiments by investigating synthetic data sets and real measurements. The free-form approach yields optimal model parameters that show only moderate correlation, indicating well-posed inverse problems. Since parameterization errors are almost completely avoided, the algorithm is well suited to identifying other error sources in unsaturated flow problems, e. g., limitations in the applicability of the Richards equation or problems caused by spatial heterogeneity.

AB The influence of hydrological dynamics on vegetation distribution and the structuring of wetland environments is of growing interest as wetlands are modified by human action and the increasing threat from climate change. Hydrological properties have long been considered a driving force in structuring wetland communities. We link hydrological dynamics with vegetation distribution across Everglades National Park (ENP) using two publicly available datasets to study the probability structure of the frequency, duration, and depth of inundation events along with their relationship to vegetation distribution. This study is among the first to show hydrologic structuring of vegetation communities at wide spatial and temporal scales, as results indicate that the percentage of time a location is inundated and its mean depth are the principal structuring variables to which individual communities respond. For example, sawgrass, the most abundant vegetation type within the ENP, is found across a wide range of time inundated percentages and mean depths. Meanwhile, other communities like pine savanna or red mangrove scrub are more restricted in their distribution and found disproportionately at particular depths and inundations. These results, along with the probabilistic structure of hydropatterns, potentially allow for the evaluation of climate change impacts on wetland vegetation community structure and distribution.

AB A key parameter used in the assessment of bank filtration is the travel time of the infiltrated river water during the passage through groundwater. We analyze time series of electrical conductivity (EC) in the river and adjacent groundwater observation wells to investigate travel times of young hyporheic groundwater in adjoining channelized and restored sections of River Thur in North-East Switzerland. To quantify mixing ratios and mean residence times we perform cross-correlation analysis and non-parametric deconvolution of the EC time series. Measurements of radon-222 in the groundwater samples validate the calculated residence times. A simple relationship between travel time and distance to the river has not been observed. Therefore, we speculate that the lateral position and depth of the thalweg as well as the type of bank stabilization might control the infiltration processes in losing rivers. Diurnal oscillations of EC observed in the river and in nearby observation wells facilitate analyzing the temporal variation of infiltration. The diurnal oscillations are particularly pronounced in low flow situations, while the overall EC signal is dominated by individual high-flow events. Differences in travel times derived from diurnal and overall EC signals thus reflect different infiltration regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the effects of acoustic excitations on the water retention curve, i.e., the relationship between capillary pressure (PC) and water saturation (SW) in unsaturated porous media, during drainage. The water retention curves were measured under static and dynamic conditions, where water was withdrawn from a sandbox with three different pumping rates, 12.6, 19.7, and 25.2 mL/s. Excitations with frequencies of 75, 100, 125, and 150 Hz were applied. The acoustic excitations had no effect on the static water retention curve but altered the dynamic water retention curve. The acoustic excitations lowered the dynamic PC, especially under the dynamic condition where the pumping rate was 25.2 mL/s and when SW varied between 0.6 and 0.95. The differences between the capillary pressures measured under static and dynamic conditions decreased when acoustic excitations were applied. We link this finding to the change in contact angle induced by the acoustic excitation. The dynamic coefficients, , for the dynamic water retention curves that we fitted to the experimental data were smaller with than without acoustic excitations. We attribute the decrease of the dynamic coefficient to the combination of the increase in the permeability and the decline in the air-entry pressure caused by adding acoustic excitations.

AB [1] Hydrologic models use relatively simple mathematical equations to conceptualize and aggregate the complex, spatially distributed, and highly interrelated water, energy, and vegetation processes in a watershed. A consequence of process aggregation is that the model parameters often do not represent directly measurable entities and must therefore be estimated using measurements of the system inputs and outputs. During this process, known as model calibration, the parameters are adjusted so that the behavior of the model approximates, as closely and consistently as possible, the observed response of the hydrologic system over some historical period of time. In practice, however, because of errors in the model structure and the input ( forcing) and output data, this has proven to be difficult, leading to considerable uncertainty in the model predictions. This paper surveys the limitations of current model calibration methodologies, which treat the uncertainty in the input-output relationship as being primarily attributable to uncertainty in the parameters and presents a simultaneous optimization and data assimilation ( SODA) method, which improves the treatment of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling. The usefulness and applicability of SODA is demonstrated by means of a pilot study using data from the Leaf River watershed in Mississippi and a simple hydrologic model with typical conceptual components.

AB A new mathematical model is developed to describe the flow in response to a constant-head pumping (or constant-head test, CHT) in a leaky unconfined aquifer system of infinite lateral extent with considering unsaturated flow. The model consists of an unsaturated zone on the top, an unconfined aquifer in the middle, and a second aquifer (aquitard) at the bottom. The unsaturated flow is described by Richard's equation, and the flows in unconfined aquifer and second layer are governed by the groundwater flow equation. The well partially penetrates the unconfined aquifer with a constant head in the well due to CHT. The governing equations of the model are linearized by the perturbation method and Gardner's exponential model is adopted to describe the soil retention curves. The solution of the model for drawdown distribution is obtained by applying the methods of Laplace transform and Weber transform. Then the solution for the wellbore flowrate is derived from the drawdown solution with Darcy's law. The issue of the equivalence of normalized drawdown predicted by the present solution for constant-head pumping and Tartakovsky and Neuman's (2007) solution for constant-rate pumping is discussed. On the basis of the wellbore flowrate solution, the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the wellbore flowrate is very sensitive to the changes in the radial hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the saturated zone. Moreover, the results predicted from the present wellbore flowrate solution indicate that this new solution can reduce to Chang's et al. (2010a) solution for homogenous aquifers when the dimensionless unsaturated exponent approaches 100. The unsaturated zone can be considered as infinite extent in the vertical direction if the thickness ratio of the unsaturated zone to the unconfined aquifer is equal to or greater than one. As for the leakage effect, it can be ignored when the vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio (i.e., the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer over that of the unconfined aquifer) is smaller than 0.1. The present solution is compared with the numerical solution from FEMWATER for validation and the results indicate good match between these two solutions. Finally, the present solution is applied to a set of field drawdown data obtained from a CHT for the estimation of hydrogeologic parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE annual runoff; Budyko's curve; ungauged basins
ID SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; RAINFALL SEASONALITY
AB The solution of many practical water problems is strictly connected to the availability of reliable and widespread information about runoff. The estimation of mean annual runoff and its interannual variability for any basin over a wide region, even if ungauged, would be fundamental for both water resources assessment and planning and for water quality analysis. Starting from these premises, the main aim of this work is to show a new approach, based on the Budyko's framework, for mapping the mean annual surface runoff and deriving the probability distribution of the annual runoff in arid and semiarid watersheds. As a case study, the entire island of Sicily, Italy, is here proposed. First, time series data of annual rainfall, runoff, and reconstructed series of potential evapotranspiration have been combined within the Budyko's curve framework to obtain regional rules for rainfall partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff. Then this knowledge has been used to infer long-term annual runoff at the point scale by means of interpolated rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. The long-term annual runoff raster layer has been obtained at each pixel of the drainage network, averaging the upstream runoff using advanced spatial analysis techniques within a GIS environment. Furthermore, 2 alternative methods are here proposed to derive the distribution of annual runoff, under the assumption of negligible interannual variations of basin water storage. The first method uses Monte Carlo simulations, combining rainfall and potential evapotranspiration randomly extracted from independent distributions. The second method is based on a simplification of the Budyko's curve and analytically provides the annual runoff distribution as the derived distribution of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Results are very encouraging: long-term annual runoff and its distribution have been derived and compared with historical records at several gauged stations, obtaining satisfactory matching.

AB Based on known relationships of slope, discharge, valley confinement, sediment supply, and sediment caliber in controlling channel patterns, we developed multivariate models to predict natural channel patterns across the 674,500 km(2) Columbia River basin, USA. We used readily available geospatial data sets to calculate reach slopes, 2 year flood discharge, and valley confinement, as well as to develop hypothesized landscape-level surrogates for sediment load and caliber (relative slope, percent of drainage area in alpine terrain, and percent of drainage area in erosive fine-grained lithologies). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we found that the four channel patterns were best distinguished by a model including all variables except valley confinement (82% overall accuracy). We then used that model to predict channel pattern for the entire basin and found that the spatial distribution of straight, meandering, anabranching, and braided patterns were consistent with regional topography and geology. A simple slope-discharge model distinguished meandering channels from all other channel patterns, but did not clearly distinguish braided from straight channels (68% overall accuracy). Addition of one or more of the hypothesized sediment supply surrogates improved prediction accuracy by 4-14% over slope and discharge alone. Braided and straight channels were most clearly distinguished on an axis of relative slope, whereas braided and anabranching channels were most clearly distinguished by adding percent alpine area to the model.

AB Mass discharge across a control plane has great potential to serve as a metric for the assessment of the impact of partial source zone depletion and for the development of risk-based source plume remediation strategies. However, field-estimated mass discharge is always subject to uncertainty, arising from nonexclusive sampling. The accuracy of the estimated discharge and the magnitude of its quantifiable uncertainty depend upon the amount of information provided by the sample data. A multistage spatial sampling strategy is proposed to select optimal sampling locations and determine minimal sampling density for accurate quantification of mass discharge uncertainty. Two sampling criteria are incorporated to ensure coverage of the control plane and delineation of highly concentrated areas (hot spots). Multiple criteria decision making theory is adapted to objectively weight the two sampling criteria, on the basis of the information importance of each criterion, with additional observations located according to the weighted average of the two criteria. Application of this methodology to numerically simulated plume transects shows that in comparison to one stage sampling design (regular pattern), this sampling strategy yields a 50% reduction in required sampling density for accurate uncertainty modeling. The developed sampling algorithm can be used in real time to guide staged field sampling.

AB Bayesian theory provides a coherent framework in quantifying the data worth of measurements and estimating unknown parameters. Nevertheless, one common problem in Bayesian methods is the considerably high computational cost since a large number of model evaluations is required in the likelihood evaluation. To address this issue, a new surrogate modeling method, i.e., ANOVA (analysis of variance)-based transformed probabilistic collocation method (ATPCM), is developed in this work. To cope with the strong nonlinearity, the model responses are transformed to the arrival times, which are then approximated with a set of low-order ANOVA components. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated by synthetic numerical cases involving water and heat transport in the vadose zone. It is shown that, the ATPCM is more efficient than the existing surrogate modeling methods (e.g., PCM, ANOVA-based PCM and TPCM). At a very low computational cost, the ATPCM-based Bayesian data-worth analysis provides a quantitative metric in comparing different monitoring plans, and helps to improve the parameter estimation. Although the flow and heat transport in vadose zone is considered in this work, the proposed method can be equally applied in any other hydrologic problems.

AB The capillary pressure-saturation relation is one of the key constitutive equations used for modeling multiphase (or partially saturated) flow in porous materials. It is known that this empirical relation depends strongly on dynamic conditions, but the impact of a heterogeneity interface on this relationship has been studied less. The present study employed optical imaging to visualize two-phase drainage under different injection rates and two flow directions, in a heterogeneous micromodel. By analyzing the curvatures of the fluid-fluid interfaces, the averaged capillary pressures for the coarse and fine sections of the micromodel, and the entire micromodel were estimated. Results show that the capillary pressure-saturation relation in the vicinity of a heterogeneity interface does not follow the conventional models proposed in the literature. The averaged capillary pressure over the entire micromodel for the fine-to-coarse (FtC) direction shows decreasing capillary pressure with decreasing wetting phase saturation. However, in the coarse-to-fine direction, a non-monotonic trend was observed. These initial findings highlight the gaps in the knowledge of upscaling capillary pressure in heterogeneous porous materials. Moreover, discontinuity in saturation was clearly more pronounced for the FtC direction, as a result of lower entry capillary resistance against the flow in the coarse section.

AB In this study, presence of multi-scale behaviour in rainfall IDF relationship has been established using Linear Probability Weighted Moments (LPWMs) for some selected stations in India. Simple, non central moments (SMs) have seen widespread use in similar scaling studies but these latter statistical attributes are known to mask the 'true' scaling pattern and, consequently, leading to inappropriate inferences. There is a general agreement amongst researchers that conventional higher order moments do indeed amplify the extreme observations and drastically affect scaling exponents. Additional advantage of LPWMs over SMs is that they exist even when the standard moments do not exist. As an alternative, this study presents a comparison with results based on use of the robust LPWMs which have revealed, in sharp contrast with the conventional moments, a definitive multi-scaling behaviour in all four rainfall observation stations that were selected from different climatic zones. The multi-scale IDF curves derived using LPWMs show a good agreement with observations and it is accordingly concluded that LPWMs provide a more reliable tool for investigating scaling in sequences of observed rainfall corresponding to various durations.

AB Accurate quantification of evaporation from small water storages is essential for water management and planning, particularly in water-scarce regions. In order to ascertain suitable methods for direct measurement of evaporation from small water bodies, this study presents a comparison of eddy covariance and scintillometry measurements from a reservoir in southeast Queensland, Australia. The work presented expands on a short study presented by McJannet et al. (2011) to include comparisons of eddy covariance measurements and scintillometer-derived predictions of surface energy fluxes under a wide range of seasonal weather conditions. In this study, analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether important theoretical assumptions required for both techniques are valid in the complex environment of a small reservoir. Statistical comparison, energy balance closure, and the relationship between evaporation measurements and key environmental controls were used to compare the results of the two techniques. Reasonable agreement was shown between the sensible heat flux measurements from eddy covariance and scintillometry, while scintillometer-derived estimates of latent heat flux were approximately 21% greater than eddy covariance measurements. We suggest possible reasons for this difference and provide recommendations for further research for improving measurements of surface energy fluxes over small water bodies using eddy covariance and scintillometry.

AB This paper aims at examining the increase of phenol adsorption breakthrough curves spreading caused by the chemical heterogeneity of granular activated carbon fixed beds. The local and the thermodynamic equilibrium assumption, as well as the nonlinear adsorption obeying to Langmuir isotherm, are considered. This study particularly tempts to link the reduced variance of phenol breakthrough curves to a measurable quantifying parameter of the chemical heterogeneity. The investigated artificial heterogeneous media are prepared by alternating layers of two types of granular activated carbon, active and non-active ones, that have similar physical properties. On the one hand, the chemical heterogeneity is quantified by the active layer relative thickness of the column length,l(1)/L.On the other hand, it is quantified by the mean value of the probability distribution gamma. The latter also represents the mean active grains mass ratio of the total medium mass, hence the medium mean capacity. The obtained results show an increase in the reduced variance and thus the effective global dispersion with the heterogeneity; the increase is as important as the medium capacity decreases. However, the dispersion increase achieves a limit value, even when the heterogeneity increases. The results are statistically modelled using a regression equation function of the capacity variation in terms of gamma and the chemical heterogeneity in terms ofl(1)/L. The relationship combining the medium capacity and the chemical heterogeneity is obtained. The relationship implicitly takes into account the effect of the column length.

AB This study provides an evaluation of various modifications of the cubic law, expanding upon previous work as follows: (1) Experimentally measured flow rates and apertures are the basis for the evaluation; (2) a rock fracture is used rather than an analog or numerically simulated fracture; (3) the fracture is not disturbed at any point during the testing; and (4) detailed measurements of the apertures and the top and bottom fracture surface profiles (931,988 measurements in total) are obtained, enabling assessment of the impact of fracture surface undulation and model discretization on the simulated flow rates. The cubic law calculated with either the geometric mean aperture or incorporating surface roughness factors provided reasonable (+/-10%) estimates of the observed flow rates for Re < 1. The cubic law applied locally (LCL) over-predicted the observed flow rates by at least 1.9 times. Modifying the LCL to incorporate a solution for tapered plates and correcting for surface undulation reduced the over-prediction to at least 1.75 times the measured flow rates. The primary conclusions that we can draw from this work are as follows: (1) There appears to be merit to conducting further studies of the cubic law applied at the single-fracture scale to determine whether similar results are achievable in all fracture types; and (2) the current understanding of when the LCL will provide an adequate representation of the true flow behavior is not entirely correct; more investigation into the effect of fracture surface undulation and other causes of abrupt aperture change (e.g., rock debris trapped within the fracture plane) is required.

AB Urban development, topographic relief, and coastal boundaries can all exert influences on storm hydroclimatology, making rainfall and flood frequency analysis a major challenge. This study explores heterogeneity in extreme rainfall in the Baltimore Metropolitan region at small spatial scales using hydrometeorological analyses of major storm events in combination with hydroclimatological analyses based on storm catalogs developed using a 16-year record of high-resolution bias-corrected radar rainfall fields. Our analyses demonstrate the potential for rainfall frequency methods using storm catalogs combined with stochastic storm transposition (SST); procedures are implemented for Dead Run, a small (14.3km(2)) urban watershed located within the Baltimore Metropolitan area. The results point to the pronounced impact of complex terrain (including the Chesapeake Bay to the east, mountainous terrain to the west and urbanization in the region) on the regional rainfall climatology. Warm-season thunderstorm systems are shown to be the dominant mechanism for generating extreme, short-duration rainfall that leads to flash flooding. The SST approach is extended through the implementation of a multiplier field that accounts for spatial heterogeneities in extreme rainfall magnitude. SST-based analyses demonstrate the need to consider rainfall heterogeneity at multiple scales when estimating the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationships.

AB The objective of this study is to assess the validity of a theoretical expression for the outflow from an initially dry aquifer subject to recharge. This equation states that, for small values of time, this outflow is proportional to the square root of time. Here we report on experiments performed with two laboratory hillslopes in the Wageningen rainfall simulator. Three different aquifer slopes were investigated with four replicates for each slope. The relations between the measured outflows and the square root of time exhibited very high coefficients of determination (all but one >0.9). The aquifer saturated hydraulic conductivity (k) and drainable porosity were determined using a base flow recession analysis, with k being consistent with soil physical laboratory measurements. The recharge rates obtained using the coefficient of the short-time expression and the steady state discharge were consistent as well. Overall, these results confirm the theoretical relationship between the aquifer outflow for the hydrograph rising limb and the square root of time.
   Plain Language Summary A series of laboratory experiments have been performed to validate an expression for the outflow rate from an initially dry aquifer that is being replenished. It has been found that the expression is correct.

AB Headwater catchments are the fundamental units that connect the land to the ocean. Hydrological flow and biogeochemical processes are intricately coupled, yet their respective sciences have progressed without much integration. Reaction kinetic theories that prescribe rate dependence on environmental variables (e.g., temperature and water content) have advanced substantially, mostly in well-mixed reactors, columns, and warming experiments without considering the characteristics of hydrological flow at the catchment scale. These theories have shown significant divergence from observations in natural systems. On the other hand, hydrological theories, including transit time theory, have progressed substantially yet have not been incorporated into understanding reactions at the catchment scale. Here we advocate for the development of integrated hydro-biogeochemical theories across gradients of climate, vegetation, and geology conditions. The lack of such theories presents barriers for understanding mechanisms and forecasting the future of the Critical Zone under human- and climate-induced perturbations. Although integration has started and co-located measurements are well under way, tremendous challenges remain. In particular, even in this era of "big data," we are still limited by data and will need to (1) intensify measurements beyond river channels and characterize the vertical connectivity and broadly the shallow and deep subsurface; (2) expand to older water dating beyond the time scales reflected in stable water isotopes; (3) combine the use of reactive solutes, nonreactive tracers, and isotopes; and (4) augment measurements in environments that are undergoing rapid changes. To develop integrated theories, it is essential to (1) engage models at all stages to develop model-informed data collection strategies and to maximize data usage; (2) adopt a "simple but not simplistic," or fit-for-purpose approach to include essential processes in process-based models; (3) blend the use of process-based and data-driven models in the framework of "theory-guided data science." Within the framework of hypothesis testing, model-data fusion can advance integrated theories that mechanistically link catchments' internal structures and external drivers to their functioning. It can not only advance the field of hydro-biogeochemistry, but also enable hind- and fore-casting and serve the society at large. Broadly, future education will need to cultivate thinkers at the intersections of traditional disciplines with hollistic approaches for understanding interacting processes in complex earth systems.

TI Coping with model error in variational data assimilation using optimal
   mass transport
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID HYDROLOGIC DATA ASSIMILATION; INTERPOLATION
AB Classical variational data assimilation methods address the problem of optimally combining model predictions with observations in the presence of zero-mean Gaussian random errors. However, in many natural systems, uncertainty in model structure and/or model parameters often results in systematic errors or biases. Prior knowledge about such systematic model error for parametric removal is not always feasible in practice, limiting the efficient use of observations for improved prediction. The main contribution of this work is to advocate the relevance of transportation metrics for quantifying nonrandom model error in variational data assimilation for nonnegative natural states and fluxes. Transportation metrics (also known as Wasserstein metrics) originate in the theory of Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) and provide a nonparametric way to compare distributions which is natural in the sense that it penalizes mismatch in the values and relative position of "masses'' in the two distributions. We demonstrate the promise of the proposed methodology using 1-D and 2-D advection-diffusion dynamics with systematic error in the velocity and diffusivity parameters. Moreover, we combine this methodology with additional regularization functionals, such as the l(1)-norm of the state in a properly chosen domain, to incorporate both model error and potential prior information in the presence of sparsity or sharp fronts in the underlying state of interest.

AB We use a machine learning approach to seek an accurate, physically sound predictor, to estimate the mean velocity for open-channel flow when submerged arrays of rigid cylinders (model vegetation) are present. A genetic programming routine is used to find a robust relationship between relevant properties of the model vegetation and flow parameters. We use published data from laboratory experiments covering a broad range of conditions to obtain an equation that matches the performance of other predictors from recent literature in terms of accuracy, while showing a less complex structure. We also investigate how different criteria for data selection, as well as the size of the data set used to train the algorithm, influences the accuracy of the resulting predictors. Our results show that a proper use of Machine-Learning techniques does not only provide empirical correlations, but can yield physically sound models as representative of the physical processes involved. We provide a clear, thorough example of the application of GP, its advantages and shortcomings, to encourage the use of data-driven techniques as part of the data analysis process, and to address common misconceptions of machine learning as simple correlation techniques or physically senseless statistical analysis.

DE global rivers; hydraulic geometry
ID HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY; DISCHARGE; CHANNEL; DIMENSIONS
AB Hydraulic and hydrologic modeling has been moving to larger spatial scales with increased spatial resolution, and such models require a global database of river widths and depths to facilitate accurate river flow routing. Hydraulic geometry relationships have a long history in estimating river channel characteristics as a function of discharge. A simple near-global database of bankfull widths and depths (along with confidence intervals) was developed based on hydraulic geometry equations and the HydroSHEDS hydrography data set. The bankfull width estimates were evaluated with widths derived from Landsat imagery for reaches of nine major rivers, showing errors ranging from 8 to 62% (correlation of 0.88), although it was difficult to verify whether the satellite observations corresponded to bankfull conditions. Bankfull depth estimates were compared with in situ measurements at sites in the Ohio and Willamette rivers, producing a mean error of 24%. The uncertainties in the derivation approach and a number of caveats are identified, and ways to improve the database in the future are discussed. Despite these limitations, this is the first global database that can be used directly in hydraulic models or as a set of constraints in model calibration.

AB Total dissolved gas supersaturation (TDGS) produced by flood flows over a high dam has negative consequences on downstream fish. Reducing the total dissolved gas (TDG) levels and/or providing adequate low-TDGS fish shelter areas remains a challenge. The presence of a low-TDG-saturation (LTS) zone at river confluences can protect the fish from harmful high TDG levels, but the effects of confluence hydrodynamics on the TDGS distribution are not well understood. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations are performed to understand the influence of flow ratio and junction angle on the TDGS distribution downstream of river confluences. The simulation results show that the TDGS distribution is mainly affected by (a) inflow TDGS that determines the supply, (b) secondary flow that leads to rapid renewal of surface water for degassing, and (c) increased turbulence intensity that promotes dissipation of TDGS. Relationship between the LTS area, the flow ratio and the junction angle is constructed via regression analysis. The regression model is validated against a 3D numerical simulation that is compared to field observations at two river confluences along the Jinshajiang River (China). This study provides scientific basis for potential hydraulic modifications at confluences to enlarge an LTS zone and reduce fish fatality.

AB Earthquakes have been inferred to induce hydrological changes in aquifers on the basis of either changes to well water-levels or tidal behavior, but the relationship between these changes remains unclear. Here, changes in tidal behavior and water-levels are quantified using a hydrological network monitoring gravel aquifers in Canterbury, New Zealand, in response to nine earthquakes (of magnitudes M-w 5.4 to 7.8) that occurred between 2008 and 2015. Of the 161 wells analyzed, only 35 contain water-level fluctuations associated with Earth+Ocean (7) or Ocean (28) tides. Permeability reduction manifest as changes in tidal behavior and increased water-levels in the near field of the Canterbury earthquake sequence of 2010-2011 support the hypothesis of shear-induced consolidation. However, tidal behavior and water-level changes rarely occurred simultaneously (2%). Water-level changes that occurred with no change in tidal behavior reequilibrated at a new postseismic level more quickly (on timescales of 50min) than when a change in tidal behavior occurred (240min to 10days). Water-level changes were more than likely to occur above a peak dynamic stress of 50kPa and were more than likely to not occur below 10kPa. The minimum peak dynamic stress required for a tidal behavior change to occur was 0.2 to 100kPa.

AB This paper describes an economic model that links the demand for recreational stream fishing to fish biomass. Useful measures of fishing quality are often difficult to obtain. In the past, economists have linked the demand for fishing sites to species presence-absence indicators or average self-reported catch rates. The demand model presented here takes advantage of a unique data set of statewide biomass estimates for several popular game fish species in Michigan, including trout, bass and walleye. These data are combined with fishing trip information from a 2008-2010 survey of Michigan anglers in order to estimate a demand model. Fishing sites are defined by hydrologic unit boundaries and information on fish assemblages so that each site corresponds to the area of a small subwatershed, about 100-200 square miles in size. The random utility model choice set includes nearly all fishable streams in the state. The results indicate a significant relationship between the site choice behavior of anglers and the biomass of certain species. Anglers are more likely to visit streams in watersheds high in fish abundance, particularly for brook trout and walleye. The paper includes estimates of the economic value of several quality change and site loss scenarios.

AB The high-degree of spatial variability of dissolved As levels in shallow aquifers of the Bengal Basin has been well documented but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We compare here As concentrations measured in groundwater pumped from 4700 wells < 22 m (75 ft) deep across a 25 km(2) area of Bangladesh with variations in the nature of surface soils inferred from 18,500 measurements of frequency domain electromagnetic induction. A set of 14 hand auger cores recovered from the same area indicate that a combination of grain size and the conductivity of soil water dominate the electromagnetic signal. The relationship between pairs of individual EM conductivity and dissolved As measurements within a distance of 50 m is significant but highly scattered (r(2) = 0.12; n = 614). Concentrations of As tend to be lower in shallow aquifers underlying sandy soils and higher below finer-grained and high conductivity soils. Variations in EM conductivity account for nearly half the variance of the rate of increase of As concentration with depth, however, when the data are averaged over a distance of 50 m (r(2) = 0.50; n = 145). The association is interpreted as an indication that groundwater recharge through permeable sandy soils prevents As concentrations from rising in shallow reducing groundwater.

AB A hierarchical optimization framework is developed to analyze spatially complex watersheds and to support spatial decision making for land management practices. A watershed is subdivided into smaller spatial units according to its hierarchy, and a three-level optimization approach determines optimal land allocations at the subarea, catchment, and 30 m cell levels. A storm water runoff simulation model is used to generate peak discharge pseudo data, under different land use patterns. The results are inputs to regression analyses, and the functional relationships between peak discharges and land use variables are estimated as quadratic functions ( r(2) > 0.90). These functions are used in the optimization models to allocate future land uses to minimize peak discharges at the watershed and subarea outlets. The integrated hydrological land use optimization ( IHLUO) model is next used to allocate land uses at the cell level. The results are promising, with a 46% reduction of the peak discharge rate as compared to the rate generated by the current land use pattern. The results provide site-specific guidelines for land use management and practices at a high spatial resolution ( 30 m). The proposed methodology is applied to the Old Woman Creek watershed, located in the southwestern basin of Lake Erie ( Ohio).

AB Water drainage from porous media is a highly dynamic process often marked by rapid pistonlike air invasion events at the front and other rapid interfacial reconfigurations. Liquid phase entrapped behind the moving front drains at significantly slower rates often via gravity driven flow through corners and crevices. This distribution of slowly draining residual water phase determines the plant available water and biological functioning of soils. The study aims to determine the conditions for the flow regime transition from piston-like invasion at a drainage front to slower corner dominated flow at the pore and sample scale. This transition was observed experimentally for sand and glass beads with fast X-ray tomography, revealing water fragmentation into clusters of full pores interconnected by water corner films. The observed liquid morphology at the transition from piston to corner flow was reproduced by a quasi-static pore network model and predicted by percolation theory. The amount of capillary-retained water at flow transition controlling the subsequent drainage dynamics could be reproduced by an idealized star shaped pore whose geometry is deduced from macroscopic properties of the porous medium. Predictions of water content thresholds at flow transitions were in agreement with other critical saturation values associated with cessation of solute diffusion and of internal drainage (at field capacity) highlighting the criticality of water phase continuity disruption for formation of relatively stable unsaturated conditions controlled by slow corner flow that support life in soil.

AB [1] When the structure of an aquifer is complex and unknown, determining the complexity of model structure and identifying its spatially distributed parameters become very difficult. This two-paper series describes an approach for objective-oriented model construction that can identify a model with simplified structure and assure its reliability for predetermined model applications. The theoretical basis of the methodology includes the definition of structure error, the conditions of structure reducibility, the calculation of the worst-case parameter (WCP), and the solution of a generalized inverse problem. In the first paper of the series we extend the basic theory established in our previous works from zonation parameterization to any kind of parameterization. The extension makes the methodology more general and complete. We present an effective direct search algorithm that can form a nonnested structure series with an optimized pattern for solving the generalized inverse problem. We use numerical examples to show how the WCP depends on the structure complexity, prior information, boundary conditions, and the objectives of model application. Generally speaking, with more prior information, simpler boundary conditions, fewer objectives, and lower accuracy requirement, the WCP will have a simpler shape. As a result, a reliable model can be identified with less observation data. In part 2 of this series we will give the conditions of structure reducibility and the method for robust experimental design. A robust experimental design is independent of the true parameter and can provide sufficient information for identifying an objective-oriented model.

AB Stochastic analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for nonergodic transport of a nonreactive solute plume in three-dimensional heterogeneous and statistically anisotropic aquifers under uniform mean flow along the x axis. The hydraulic conductivity, K(x), is modeled as a random field which is assumed to be lognormally distributed with an anisotropic exponential covariance. The simulation model is validated with good comparison of the simulated and theoretical variogram model of the log K field, small mass balance errors, and a large number of Monte Carlo ( MC) runs. The ensemble averages of the second spatial moments of a solute plume about its center of mass, Z(ii), and the plume centroid variances, R-ii, (i = 1, 2, 3) of 1600 MC runs were simulated for three degrees of heterogeneity and a line source of three different lengths along the y or z axis. At least 800 MC runs are needed to stabilize the simulated moments even for the mildly heterogeneous aquifers of sigma(Y)(2) less than or equal to 0.5, and the ergodic condition is far from reaching for a line source with the initial dimension of several integral scales of log K field. The first-order theories predict well the longitudinal Z(11) and R-11 (thus the one-particle displacement variance, X-11= Z(11)+ R-11), significantly overestimate the horizontal transverse Z(22) and R-22 (thus X-22), and overestimate the vertical transverse Z(33) but underestimate R-33.

AB A new physically based hydrological and soil erosion model has been developed, which can be used for planning and conservation purposes: the LImburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM). The LISEM model is one of the first examples of a physically based model that is completely incorporated in a raster Geographical Information System. This incorporation facilitates easy application in larger catchments, improves the user friendliness by avoiding conversion routines and allows remotely sensed data to be used. Processes incorporated in the model are rainfall, interception, surface storage in micro-depressions, infiltration and vertical movement of water in the soil, overland flow, channel flow, detachment by rainfall and throughfall, detachment by overland flow and transport capacity of the flow. Special attention has been given to the influence of tractor wheelings, small roads and surface sealing. Vertical movement of water in the soil is simulated using the Richard's equation. Optionally, the user can choose the Holtan or the Green-Ampt infiltration model. For the distribution flow routing, a four-point finite-difference solution of the kinematic wave is used together with Manning's equation.

AB Scale-and location-dependent relationships between soil water content (SWC) and individual environmental factors have been widely explored. SWC is controlled by multiple factors concurrently; however, the multivariate relationship is rarely explored at different scales and locations. Multivariate controls of SWC at different scales and locations in two seasons within a hummocky landscape of North America were identified using bivariate wavelet coherency and multiple wavelet coherence. Results showed that depth to CaCO3 layer, which was correlated with elevation over all locations at scales of 36-144 m and cos(aspect), provided the best individual factor for explaining SWC variations in spring (May 2) and summer (August 23), respectively. Although spatial patterns of SWC were temporally stable, different topographic indices affected spatial distribution of SWC in different seasons (elevation in spring and aspect in summer) due to different dominating hydrological processes. These varying hydrological processes also resulted in the distinct role of soil organic carbon (SOC) content in different seasons: a positive correlation in spring and a negative correlation in summer. Multiple wavelet coherence identified a combination of depth to CaCO3 layer and SOC in spring and a combination of cos(aspect) and SOC in summer that controlled SWC at different scales and locations, respectively. This indicated a combined effect of soil and topographic properties on SWC distribution and a clear need for these two factors in developing scale-dependent prediction of SWC in the hummocky landscape of North America.

AB Soil moisture state and variability control many hydrological and ecological processes as well as exchanges of energy and water between the land surface and the atmosphere. However, its state and variability are poorly understood at spatial scales larger than the fields (i.e. 1 km(2)) as well as the ability to extrapolate field scale to larger spatial scales. This study investigates soil moisture profiles, their spatial organization, and physical drivers of variability within the Walnut Creek watershed, Iowa, during Soil Moisture Experiment 2005 and relates the watershed scale findings to previous field-scale results. For all depths, the watershed soil moisture variability was negatively correlated with the watershed mean soil moisture and followed an exponential relationship that was nearly identical to that for field scales. This relationship differed during drying and wetting. While the overall time stability characteristics were improved with observation depth, the relatively wet and dry locations were consistent for all depths. The most time stable locations, capturing the mean soil moisture of the watershed within +/- 0.9% volumetric soil moisture, were typically found on hill slopes regardless of vegetation type. These mild slope locations consistently preserve the time stability patterns from field to watershed scales. Soil properties also appear to impact stability but the findings are sensitive to local variations that may not be well defined by existing soil maps. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The ability to predict multiphase fluid transport in nanoporous rocks such as shales is critical for many geoscience applications, for example unconventional hydrocarbon production, geologic carbon sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal. When the pore sizes approach nanoscales, the impact of the molecular interaction forces between fluids and solids becomes increasingly important. These forces can alter macroscopic fluid phase behavior and control transport. Recent experimental studies have shown that capillary condensation and subsequent imbibition of liquid water can occur in hydrophilic nanoporous media even if the vapor phase is at a critical relative humidity (rh(crit)) well below vapor saturation. This study presents a theoretical investigation of the processes controlling adsorption, capillary condensation and imbibition in nanoporous media, using the square-gradient classical density functional theory. The proposed theoretical model explicitly includes the relevant interaction forces among fluids and solids in macroscopic porous media. Application of the model to a relative-humidity-controlled water adsorption experiment is presented to demonstrate the impact of water-pore wall attractive forces on multiphase water behavior in a hydrophilic silicon nanoporous medium. The model represents well the measured time-dependent evolution of the water imbibition front inside the nanoporous medium and also explains the diffusion-like water transport regimes observed at rh rh(crit). The study furthermore gives an insight on hysteresis phenomenon in adsorption and desorption isotherms.

AB With growing interest in understanding the magnitudes and sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling, the difficult problem of characterizing model structure adequacy is now attracting considerable attention. Here, we examine this problem via a model-structure-independent approach based in information theory. In particular, we (a) discuss how to assess and compute the information content in multivariate hydrological data, (b) present practical methods for quantifying the uncertainty and shared information in data while accounting for heteroscedasticity, (c) show how these tools can be used to estimate the best achievable predictive performance of a model (for a system given the available data), and (d) show how model adequacy can be characterized in terms of the magnitude and nature of its aleatory uncertainty that cannot be diminished (and is resolvable only up to specification of its density), and its epistemic uncertainty that can, in principle, be suitably resolved by improving the model. An illustrative modeling example is provided using catchment-scale data from three river basins, the Leaf and Chunky River basins in the United States and the Chuzhou basin in China. Our analysis shows that the aleatory uncertainty associated with making catchment simulations using this data set is significant (approximate to 50%). Further, estimated epistemic uncertainties of the HyMod, SAC-SMA, and Xinanjiang model hypotheses indicate that considerable room for model structural improvements remain.

AB Headwater streams expand, contract, and disconnect in response to seasonal moisture conditions or those related to individual precipitation events. The fluctuation of the surface flow extent, or active drainage network, reflects catchment storage characteristics and has important impacts on stream ecology; however, the hydrological mechanisms that drive this phenomenon are still uncertain. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four headwater streams in Central Idaho's Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness (7-21km(2)) spanning the spring and summer months of 2014. We report the total length of the active drainage networks, which varied as a power law function with stream discharge with an average exponent of 0.11 +/- 0.03 (range of 0.05-0.20). Generally, these active drainage networks were less responsive to changes in discharge than many streams in past studies. We observed that the locations where surface flow originates, or flowheads, were often stable, and an average of 64% of the change in active drainage network length was explained by downstream discontinuities. Analysis of geologic and geomorphic characteristics of individual watersheds and flowheads suggests that most flowheads below approximately 2200m are supported by stable flowpaths controlled by bedrock structure. At higher elevations, small accumulation areas and saturation of shallow and conductive soil and colluvium after snowmelt result in more mobile flowhead locations. The dynamics of active drainage networks can help illuminate the spatiotemporal structure of flowpaths supporting surface flow. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Excess reactive nitrogen in soils of intensively managed landscapes causes adverse environmental impact, and continues to remain a global concern. Many novel strategies have been developed to provide better management practices and, yet, the problem remains unresolved. The objective of this study is to develop a model to characterize the "age'' of inorganic soil-nitrogen (nitrate, and ammonia/ammonium). We use the general theory of age, which provides an assessment of the time elapsed since inorganic nitrogen has been introduced into the soil system. We analyze a corn-corn-soybean rotation, common in the Midwest United States, as an example application. We observe two counter-intuitive results: (1) the mean nitrogen age in the topsoil layer is relatively high; and (2) mean nitrogen age is lower under soybean cultivation compared to corn although no fertilizer is applied for soybean cultivation. The first result can be explained by cation-exchange of ammonium that retards the leaching of nitrogen, resulting in an increase in the mean nitrogen age near the soil surface. The second result arises because the soybean utilizes the nitrogen fertilizer left from the previous year, thereby removing the older nitrogen and reducing mean nitrogen age. Estimating the mean nitrogen age can thus serve as an important tool to disentangle complex nitrogen dynamics by providing a nuanced characterization of the time scales of soil-nitrogen transformation and transport processes.

AB [1] In this study we investigate an event-scale transit time distribution (TTD) for a catchment located in the Santa Catalina Mountains northeast of downtown Tucson, Arizona, USA, during a series of extreme rainfall events. Traditionally, TTD studies look at the long time response of a catchment to an input variation in tracer concentration. Few studies have determined the TTD at the scale of an event. Isotopic and hydrometric data collected during the event considered in this study provide the unique opportunity to characterize the response of the catchment under extreme conditions using both TTD modeling and hydrograph separation. This revealed similarity in the shapes of the event TTD and event water recession hydrograph. Also, the first moment of the event water recession hydrograph and the mean transit time of the TTD were similar. Because of the extreme nature of this event, it is likely that the catchment reaches and relaxes from the maximum possible storage, making its response a time-invariant characteristic of the catchment on the basis of hydraulic theory. The similarity between the event water recession and event TTD during this characteristic response of the catchment may, thus, allow for the derivation of a time-invariant event TTD. This result is especially valuable as it lays a basis for catchment similarity analysis linking a catchment's hydrological response and geomorphic properties.

AB The reliance of 10 Utah (USA) aspen forests on direct infiltration of growing season rain versus an additional subsurface water subsidy was determined from a trait- and process-based model of stomatal control. The model simulated the relationship between water supply to the root zone versus canopy transpiration and assimilation over a growing season. Canopy flux thresholds were identified that distinguished nonstressed, stressed, and dying stands. We found growing season rain and local soil moisture were insufficient for the survival of 5 of 10 stands. Six stands required a substantial subsidy (31-80% of potential seasonal transpiration) to avoid water stress and maximize photosynthetic potential. Subsidy dependence increased with stand hydraulic conductance. Four of the six "subsidized" stands were predicted to be stressed during the survey year owing to a subsidy shortfall. Since winter snowpack is closely related to groundwater recharge in the region, we compared winter precipitation with tree-ring chronologies. Consistent with model predictions, chronologies were more sensitive to snowpack in subsidized stands than in nonsubsidized ones. The results imply that aspen stand health in the region is more coupled to winter snowpack than to growing season water supply. Winters are predicted to have less precipitation as snow, indicating a stressful future for the region's aspen forests.

TI Evaporation suppression from water reservoirs: Efficiency considerations
   of partial covers
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID REDUCTION
AB Reservoirs enhance availability and temporal stability of water resources, however, water losses due to evaporation may significantly reduce their operational efficiency. Studies have evaluated the efficacy of various types of chemical or physical evaporation barriers often on a qualitative basis. Certain design and maintenance advantages are offered by self-assembling modular floating covers especially for large reservoir surfaces. Evidence suggests that evaporation suppression efficiency of these floating covers is not proportional to the covered surface fraction. Capitalizing on recent experimental results carried out on small vessels, we show that evaporation suppression efficiency of floating covers in much larger reservoirs (3 to 5 order of magnitude in volume) is proportional to the square root of open area. Thermal effects of evaporation from open and partially covered surfaces on surface water temperature are proportional to evaporation rate and thus provide a potential mean for real-time monitoring of cover performance. Floating covers seem to suppress evaporation more effectively than other suspended evaporation barriers. For a fixed covered surface fraction, larger "holes'' suppress evaporation more efficiently than many smaller and distributed openings. The concepts and relationships developed in this study provide quantitative means for engineering design and economical evaluation of evaporative barriers for water reservoirs in terms of cover geometry and water saving efficiency.

AB [1] We have investigated the potential of combining cross-hole georadar velocity and attenuation tomography as a method for characterizing heterogeneous alluvial aquifers. A multivariate statistical technique, known as k-means cluster analysis, is used to correlate and integrate information contained in velocity and attenuation tomograms. Cluster analysis allows us to identify objectively the major common trends in the tomographic data and thus to "reduce'' the information to a limited number of characteristic parameter combinations. The application of this procedure to two synthetic data sets indicates that it is a powerful tool for converting the complex relationships between the tomographically derived velocity and attenuation structures into a lithologically and hydrologically meaningful zonation of the probed region. In addition, these synthetic examples allow us to evaluate the reliability of further petrophysical parameter estimates. We find that although absolute values of the tomographically inferred petrophysical parameters often differ significantly from the actual parameters, the clustering approach enables us to reliably identify the major trends in the petrophysical properties. Finally, we have applied the approach to a cross-hole georadar data set collected in a well-studied alluvial aquifer. A comparison of the clustered tomographic section with well-log data demonstrates that our approach delineates the hydrostratigraphic zonation.

AB The right tail of streamflow distributions quantifies the occurrence probability of high flows, which play an important role in the dynamics of many eco-hydrological processes and eventually contribute to shape riverine environments. In this paper, the ability of a mechanistic analytical model for streamflow distributions to capture the statistical features of high flows has been investigated. The model couples a stochastic description of soil moisture dynamics with a simplified hydrologic response based on a catchment-scale storage-discharge relationship. Different types of relations between catchment water storage and discharge have been investigated, and alternative methods for parameter estimation have been compared using informal performance metrics and formal model selection criteria. The study highlights the pivotal role of non-linear storage-discharge relations in reproducing observed frequencies of high flows, and reveals the importance of analyzing the behavior of individual events for a reliable characterization of recession parameters. The emergence of heavy-tailed streamflow distributions is mechanistically linked to the degree of non-linearity of the catchment hydrologic response, with implications for the understanding of rivers' flooding potential and related ecologic and morphological processes.

AB In this work, we present a methodology for upscaling solute transport in heterogeneous reservoirs. The problem considers upscaling from the Darcy scale of a porous medium to the reservoir scale. We first define the mathematical problem that governs solute mass transport at the so-called Darcy scale, and then we apply the method of volume averaging. This method allows for upscaling the governing equations at the whole reservoir scale and, eventually, developing physical constraints, definitions of average variables and effective coefficients. One important characteristic of the volume averaging method is that the so-called closure problems for analytical or numerical computation of effective coefficients are identified. The closure problems consist of boundary-value problems, whose solution must be carried out in representative geometries (unit cells) of the reservoir. In this paper, we developed the theory for a two-facies reservoir, but the extension for more facies is straightforward. In this context, we present the two-equation model, and the numerical estimation of effective coefficients are presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies. In this manner, relevant coefficients are identified. The numerical solution of the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when the governing equations are solved at the Darcy scale.

AB Although recognized as important, measures of connectivity (i.e. the existence of high-conductivity paths that increase flow and allow for early solute arrival) have not yet been incorporated into methods for upscaling hydraulic conductivities of porous media. We present and evaluate a binary upscaling formula that utilizes connectivity information. The upscaled hydraulic conductivity (K) of binary media is determined as a function of the proportions and conductivities of the two materials, the geometry of the inclusions, and the mean distance between them. The use of a phase interchange theorem renders the formula equally applicable to two-dimensional media with inclusions of low K and high K as compared with the matrix. The new upscaling formula is tested on two-dimensional binary random fields spanning a broad range of spatial correlation structures and conductivity contrasts. The computed effective conductivities are compared to what is obtained using self-consistent effective medium theory, the coated ellipsoids approximation, and to a streamline approach. It is shown that, although simple, the proposed formula performs better than available methods for binary upscaling. The use of connectivity information leads to significantly improved behavior close to the percolation threshold. The proposed upscaling formula depends exclusively on parameters that are obtainable from field investigations. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ECONOMIC VALUATION; TERRESTRIAL; RUNOFF; DESIGN; CHOICE
AB Policymakers wanting to increase protection of the Great Barrier Reef from pollutants generated by agriculture need to identify when measures to improve water quality generate benefits to society that outweigh the costs involved. The research reported in this paper makes a contribution in several ways. First, it uses the improved science understanding about the links between management changes and reef health to bring together the analysis of costs and benefits of marginal changes, helping to demonstrate the appropriate way of addressing policy questions relating to reef protection. Second, it uses the scientific relationships to frame a choice experiment to value the benefits of improved reef health, with the results of mixed logit (random parameter) models linking improvements explicitly to changes in "water quality units." Third, the research demonstrates how protection values are consistent across a broader population, with some limited evidence of distance effects. Fourth, the information on marginal costs and benefits that are reported provide policymakers with information to help improve management decisions. The results indicate that while there is potential for water quality improvements to generate net benefits, high cost water quality improvements are generally uneconomic. A major policy implication is that cost thresholds for key pollutants should be set to avoid more expensive water quality proposals being selected.

AB We describe a novel framework for estimating subsurface properties, such as rock permeability and porosity, from time-lapse observed seismic data by coupling full-waveform inversion (FWI), subsurface flow processes, and rock physics models. For the inverse modeling, we handle the back propagation of gradients by an intrusive automatic differentiation strategy that offers three levels of user control: (1) At the wave physics level, we adopted the discrete adjoint method in order to use our existing high-performance FWI code; (2) at the rock physics level, we used built-in automatic differentiation operators from the TensorFlow backend; (3) at the flow physics level, we implemented customized partial differential equation (PDE) operators for the multiphase flow equations. The three-level coupled inversion strategy strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and programming efforts, and when the gradients are chained together, it constitutes a coupled inverse system. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the three-level coupled inverse problem is superior in terms of accuracy to a traditional decoupled inversion strategy. Additionally, our method is able to simultaneously invert for parameters in empirical relationships such as the rock physics models. Our proposed inverted model can be used for reservoir performance prediction and reservoir management/optimization purposes.

AB The complex interactions between rainfall-driven erosion processes and rainfall characteristics, slope gradient, soil treatment and soil surface processes are not very well understood. A combination of experiments under natural rainfall and a consistent physical theory for their interpretation is needed to shed more light on the underlying processes. The present study demonstrates such a methodology. An experimental device employed earlier in laboratory studies was used to measure downslope rain splash and 'splash-creep', lateral splash, upslope splash and rainfall-driven runoff transport (wash) from a highly aggregated clay-rich oxisol exposed to natural rainfall in West Java, Indonesia. Two series of measurements were made: the first with the soil surface at angles of 0degrees, 5degrees, 15degrees and 40% and the second all at an angle of 5degrees but with different tillage and mulching treatments. A number of rainfall erosivity indices were calculated from rainfall intensity measurements and compared with measured transport components. Overall storm kinetic energy correlated reasonably well with sediment transport, but much better agreement was obtained when a threshold rainfall intensity (20 turn h(-1)) was introduced. Rain splash transport measurements were interpreted using a recently developed theory relating detachment to sediment transport. Furthermore, a conceptually sound yet simple wash transport model is advanced that satisfactorily predicted observed washed sediment concentrations. The lack of replication precluded rigorous assessment of the effect of slope and soil treatment on erosion processes, but some general conclusions could still be drawn. The results stress the importance of experiments under conditions of natural rainfall. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The natural convection of miscible fluids in porous media has applications in several fields, such as geoscience and geoengineering, and can be employed for the geological storage of CO2. In this study, we used X-ray computer tomography to visualize 3D fingering structures associated with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability between miscible fluids in a porous medium. In the early stages of the onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, a fine crinkling pattern gradually appeared at the interface. As the wavelength and amplitude increased, descending fingers formed on the interface and extended vertically downward; in addition, ascending and highly symmetric fingers formed. The adjacent fingers were cylindrical in shape and coalesced to form large fingers. The fingers appearing on the interface tended to become finer with increasing Rayleigh number, which is consistent with linear perturbation theory. When the Peclet number exceeded 10, transverse dispersion increased the finger diameter and enhanced the finger coalescence, strongly impacting the decrease in finger number density. When mechanical dispersion was negligible, the finger-extension velocity and the dimensionless mass-transfer rate scaled with the characteristic velocity and the Rayleigh number with an appropriate length scale. Mechanical dispersion not only reduced the onset time but also enhanced the mass transport. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sorption of protons determines the surface charge of natural media and is therefore a first-order control on contaminant transport. Significant effort has been extended to develop chemical models that quantify the sorption of protons at the mineral surface. To compare these models' effect on predicted proton transport, we present analytic solutions for column experiments through silica sand. Reaction front morphology is controlled by the functional relationship between the total sorbed and total aqueous proton concentrations. An inflection point in this function near neutral pH leads to a reversal in the classic front formation mechanism under basic conditions, such that proton desorption leads to a self-sharpening front, while adsorption leads to a spreading front. A composite reaction front comprising both a spreading and self-sharpening segment can occur when the injected and initial concentrations straddle the inflection point. This behavior is unique in single component reactive transport and arises due to the auto-ionization of water rather than electrostatic interactions at the mineral surface. We derive a regime diagram illustrating conditions under which different fronts occur, highlighting areas where model predictions diverge. Chemical models are then compared and validated against a systematic set of column experiments. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Groundwater is often a critical source of water for municipal, industrial and agricultural uses, especially in and and semi-arid environments. Songnen Plain, located in the central part of northeast China, is such a region, it being an important productive base of commodity grain in this country. In the past two decades, groundwater quality in the region, especially salinization, has deteriorated under natural changes and human activities, and has become a crucial factor restricting sustainable eco-environmental and socio-economic development. In this paper, The Taoer River catchment, situated in the middle of the region, was selected as the study area for the groundwater quality evolution study using hydrochemistry and stable isotopes to obtain a better understanding of the system. Fifty-two groundwater samples were collected with systematic design during the low-water and high-water periods in 2003. A series of comprehensive quality data interpretations, e.g. statistics, ratios of ions and Piper diagrams, together with stable isotope data, have been used to gain an insight into the spatial and temporal variations and evolution laws of groundwater hydrochemistry. The following main hydrochemical processes were identified as controlling the water quality of the groundwater system: weathering-dissolution, evaporation-condensation, ion-exchange reactions and groundwater salinization. This latter process, salinization, is the most important process and is caused by the leaching of superficial or near-surface salts from the saline-alkaline soil into shallow groundwater.

AB A multi-scale study has been undertaken to explore the relationships between climate, water resources, land use and diffuse pollution in order to assess the significance of projected future changes in climate and the uncertainty inherent in these projections. Two climate simulations from the GCM-RCM Perturbed Physics Ensemble developed by the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, broadly representing the extremes of future climate simulations, were downscaled and applied to a grid-based dynamic national water balance and nitrate model for Scotland. Results from this model were cross-compared with multiple simulations using synthetic future climate data generated by the 2009 UK Climate Projections Weather Generator (WG) for two selected catchments. At a national scale the model predicted relatively small effects of climate change in terms of spatially and temporally averaged means, but with significant regional variability. Future changes in the seasonality of nitrate losses were also predicted, but with a high degree of uncertainty as to the scale of this change demonstrated by the different climate simulations. A land use scenario was developed in which food security is a very high priority for Scotland and this was linked with a classification of future land capability. Application of this scenario with the national scale model indicated greater changes in nitrate pollution caused by the land use change than those caused by the direct impacts of climate change on hydrological functioning. The multiple climate simulations applied at a catchment scale demonstrated that the two national scale simulations broadly represent likely bounds in future climate, although a probability figure cannot be assigned to them.

AB Lumped precipitation-runoff models represent the watershed as a single, homogeneous unit, thereby ignoring spatial variability in forcing inputs and physical properties. In spite of this, spatially distributed models, which account for the variability of such factors, generally do not provide better simulations of catchment outlet runoff. This is at least in part because lumped models are easier to calibrate. However, it is often unclear whether the optimal (calibrated) parameters of a lumped model take on values that are consistent with underlying physical properties. In this study we explore the hypothesis that optimized lumped parameters are "contaminated" by noise due to the lumped representation of the watershed. We conduct a series of virtual experiments in which a daily time-step conceptual precipitation-runoff model is applied, with both lumped and distributed spatial discretizations, to 49 Austrian mesoscale basins. The experiments examine the impacts of different degrees of spatial variability in the inputs and physical properties, as well as varying complexity of the model structure. The usage of lumped models results in optimal parameters that include a considerable degree of noise, because the parameters implicitly compensate for the deficiencies in the spatial discretization. Most of the noise is attributable to neglecting the spatial variability in the physical properties, while the spatial variability of the inputs is of less importance. Further, the noise increases with system complexity, where parameter interactions significantly magnify the noise. This noise in the lumped parameters diminishes the correlation with catchment properties, even when a theoretically strong relationship exists, thereby complicating parameter regionalization as used, for example, for prediction in ungauged basins.

AB The accurate characterization of flow from urban surfaces to sewer/stormwater systems is important for urban drainage design and flood modeling/risk identification. However, the geometrical complexity and large variety of drainage structures (linking elements) available makes model calibration and verification difficult. In this study an extensive comparison between experimentally measured and numerically modeled flow characteristics in the vicinity of ten different designs of manhole grate was performed under drainage flow in subcritical conditions. Using a 2-D surface PIV (sPIV) system the work presents the first detailed characterization of velocity fields around these linking elements. In addition, it provides the first detailed verification of the ability of a 2-D numerical model to describe both velocity fields and drainage flows. The overall comparison shows a close relationship between numerical and the experimental results with some higher inflows in the experimental results as a consequence of a localized transition from weir to orifice condition near the void areas of the grates. It was also noted that velocity differences decreased further from the manhole, due mainly to the more directional flow. Overall the work demonstrates the potential for further use of 2-D numerical models to describe flow conditions at linking elements, either directly within modeling simulations or indirectly via the characterization of energy loss coefficients.

AB Landscape-scale reconstruction and prescription of soil cover systems following oil sands mining is challenging due to the quality of available reclamation materials and the subhumid climate of the Boreal Plains of Canada. In an experimental reclaimed watershed (Sandhill Fen Watershed), basin-scale upland landforms (i.e., hummocks) were designed to provide groundwater to adjacent lowlands, necessitating adequate recharge following establishment of forest vegetation. Volumetric water contents, soil water pressure heads, and groundwater levels were monitored for four years throughout the watershed and used to calibrate and verify numerical models in IIYDRUS. Using a variably saturated two-dimensional domain, we identified a threshold-like relationship between recharge (or upflux) and upland hummock height, where upland hummocks not tall enough to limit root water uptake from the saturated zone decreased recharge or resulted in net upflux. Recharge varied with soil cover texture (higher in coarser-textured) and associated soil hydraulic parameters. Furthermore, scenario tests indicated the importance and relative influence that maximum rooting depths, forest floor placement thicknesses, and leaf area indices (all associated with forest development) had on recharge. Simulations utilizing a historical climate record indicated that interannual climatic variability was as influential as variation in soil cover texture in determining recharge. Reclamation practitioners should recognize that the water balances of reconstructed landscapes are largely influenced by the trade-off between optimizing forest productivity and sourcing water to downgradient landscape positions.

AB Determining the probability of a flood event in a catchment given that another flood has occurred in a nearby catchment is useful in the design of infrastructure such as road networks that have multiple river crossings. These conditional flood probabilities can be estimated by calculating conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall and then transforming rainfall to runoff through a hydrologic model. Each catchment's hydrological response times are unlikely to be the same, so in order to estimate these conditional probabilities one must consider the dependence of extreme rainfall both across space and across critical storm durations. To represent these types of dependence, this study proposes a new approach for combining extreme rainfall across different durations within a spatial extreme value model using max-stable process theory. This is achieved in a stepwise manner. The first step defines a set of common parameters for the marginal distributions across multiple durations. The parameters are then spatially interpolated to develop a spatial field. Storm-level dependence is represented through the max-stable process for rainfall extremes across different durations. The dependence model shows a reasonable fit between the observed pairwise extremal coefficients and the theoretical pairwise extremal coefficient function across all durations. The study demonstrates how the approach can be applied to develop conditional maps of the return period and return level across different durations.

AB The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely used in parameter estimation for hydrological models. The focus of most previous studies was to develop more efficient analysis (estimation) algorithms. On the other hand, it is intuitively understandable that a well-designed sampling (data-collection) strategy should provide more informative measurements and subsequently improve the parameter estimation. In this work, a Sequential Ensemble-based Optimal Design (SEOD) method, coupled with EnKF, information theory and sequential optimal design, is proposed to improve the performance of parameter estimation. Based on the first-order and second-order statistics, different information metrics including the Shannon entropy difference (SD), degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) and relative entropy (RE) are used to design the optimal sampling strategy, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by synthetic one-dimensional and two-dimensional unsaturated flow case studies. It is shown that the designed sampling strategies can provide more accurate parameter estimation and state prediction compared with conventional sampling strategies. Optimal sampling designs based on various information metrics perform similarly in our cases. The effect of ensemble size on the optimal design is also investigated. Overall, larger ensemble size improves the parameter estimation and convergence of optimal sampling strategy. Although the proposed method is applied to unsaturated flow problems in this study, it can be equally applied in any other hydrological problems.

AB Bresler [1978] proposed a procedure for drip irrigation design which is focused on the midpoint soil water pressure h(c). We present a practical field test of this approach in order to evaluate the validity of the underlying assumptions. The simulated h(c) values were obtained from Raats' [1971] steady state theory for 32 points in the field where the hydraulic conductivity parameters K-s and alpha were measured. The h(c) values were measured at the same locations during microirrigation of a maize crop. Measured h(c) appear to be lower than the simulated ones, especially late in the season. The measured spatial variability in h(c) appeared to be higher than the simulated ones. This could well have been caused by root uptake activity, which is not considered in the analysis, as well as by the large but typical drippers spacing of d = 1.00 m. Thus the tensiometers could have been beyond the practical limit of wetting. Consequences for design and management are important. For design, even if a high h(c), value is chosen, there is no real guarantee that the wetting would be effective at the midpoint. For irrigation management, tensiometer placement too far from the dripper would lead to overirrigation, so for a large dripper spacing d, the midpoint placement is not judicious.

AB In order to assess the reliability of the springs near Matalom, Leyte, Philippines as a sustainable source of drinking water, we measured precipitation and outflow of five small and two large springs for the region for a period of a year and analyzed the recession spring flow data. Although monthly spring flow follows a similar pattern to that of the rainfall, the regression relationship between both parameters is poor except for the smallest spring. To determine the dry season spring flow behavior, we analyzed the spring flow data with a mechanistic recession flow model originally developed for prediction of stream drought flow in the northeastern U.S. by Brutsaert and Nieber in 1977. The model describes the dry season spring flow well assuming that the aquifer behaves as a linear reservoir. The analysis shows that the flow "half-life" for the springs is about one month. By adding the individual spring flows to derive a watershed outflow we were able to evaluate how well the simple watershed geometry underlying the analysis of Brutsaert and Nieber [Regionalized drought flow hydrographs from a mature glaciated plateau. Water Resour Res 1977;13(3): 637-43] applies to the more complex watersheds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The uncertainty in spatially heterogeneous Manning's n fields is quantified using a novel formulation and numerical solution of stochastic inverse problems for physics-based models. The uncertainty is quantified in terms of a probability measure and the physics-based model considered here is the state-of-the-art ADCIRC model although the presented methodology applies to other hydrodynamic models. An accessible overview of the formulation and solution of the stochastic inverse problem in a mathematically rigorous framework based on measure theory is presented. Technical details that arise in practice by applying the framework to determine the Manning's n parameter field in a shallow water equation model used for coastal hydrodynamics are presented and an efficient computational algorithm and open source software package are developed. A new notion of "condition'' for the stochastic inverse problem is defined and analyzed as it relates to the computation of probabilities. This notion of condition is investigated to determine effective output quantities of interest of maximum water elevations to use for the inverse problem for the Manning's n parameter and the effect on model predictions is analyzed.

AB The first part of this investigation was aimed at testing the use of a three-dimensional (3D) digital terrain model and a quasi-tridimensional (2.5D) digital elevation model obtained by a large series of oblique images of eroded channels taken from consumer un-calibrated and non-metric cameras. For two closed earth channels having a different sinuosity, the ground measurement of some cross sections by a profilometer (P) was carried out and their real volume was also measured. The comparison among the three methods (3D, 2.5D, and P) pointed out that a limited underestimation of the total volume always occurs and that the 3D method is characterized by the minimum difference between measured and real volume. For this reason, 3D model can be used as benchmark. In the subsequent part of the investigation, the three ground measurement methods were applied for surveying of an ephemeral gully (EG) channel at the Sparacia area. The morphological and hydraulic variable values of the 24 surveyed cross sections determined by both 2.5D model and profilometer were compared. This comparison showed that the estimate error is generally less than +/- 10%. The EG measurements carried out by the three methods supported the applicability both of the empirical relationship between EG length and its eroded volume and the theoretical dimensionless relationship among the morphological variables describing the channelized erosion process. Finally, it was demonstrated that the effect of the distance interval on the EG volume measurement by 3D and 2.5D models is negligible for the investigated EG.

AB In cockpit karst landscapes, fluxes from upland areas contribute large volumes of water to low-lying depressions and stream flow. Hydrograph hysteresis and similarity between monitoring sites is important for understanding the space-time variability of hydrologic responses across the "hillslope-depression-stream" continuum. In this study, the hysteretic feature of hydrographs was assessed by characterizing the loop-like relationships between responses at upstream sites relative to subsurface discharge at the outlet of a small karst catchment. A classification of hydrograph responses based on the multi-scale smoothing Kernel -derived distance classifies the hydrograph responses on the basis of similarities between hillslope and depression sites, and those at the catchment outlet. Results demonstrate that the temporal and spatial variability of hydrograph hysteresis and similarity between hillslope flow and outlet stream flow can be explained by the local heterogeneity of depression aquifer. Large depression storage deficits emerging in the highly heterogeneous aquifer produce strong hysteresis and multiple relationships of upstream hydrographs relative to the outlet subsurface discharge. In contrast, when depression storage deficits are filled during consecutive rainfall events, depression hydrographs at the high permeability sites are almost synchronous or exhibit a monotonous function with the hydrographs at the outlet. This reduced hydrograph hysteresis enhances preferential flow paths in fractured rocks and conduits that can accelerate the hillslope flow to the outlet. Therefore, classification of hydrograph similarities between any upstream sites and the catchment outlet can help to identify the dominant hydrological functions in the heterogeneous karst catchment.

AB Spatial Markov random walk models (SMM) have been demonstrated to accurately predict conservative solute transport across a wide range of hydro-geological systems, with recent advances enabling the SMM to model systems with linear kinetic reactive processes. However, the proposed reactive SMM's applicability is limited to systems that can be partitioned into a series of identical periodic cells where travel times across cells are highly correlated to the solute's entrance position at the cell inlet. In real geologic settings, the spatial layout and size of grains varies through space, decorrelating the relationship between travel time and transverse position. Here, we generalize previous SMM implementations and implement a Bernoulli CTRW, where transport behavior can be captured in disordered and non-periodic porous media. We validate our upscaled model predictions with results from direct numerical simulation of transport in a 2D porous column that cannot be partitioned into identical periodic elements. We parameterize our model based on a subset of simulation statistics and explore how model accuracy changes due to our sampling method. This finding yields important insights for optimizing efficiency of the upscaled transport model parameterization and can guide field sampling of geological structures as well as multiscale investigation of laboratory observations.

AB Macrophyte community diversity and composition respond to ecosystem conservation and local environmental factors. In this study, we developed a multidimensional diversity framework for macrophyte communities, including the taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversity. We used the framework to explore the relationships among water level regimes and these diversity parameters in a case study of China's Baiyangdian Lake. Analysis of indicators of hydrologic alteration divided the water level from 1959 to 2019 into four regimes (dry, <6.42 m; low, 6.42-7.23 m; medium, 7.23-8.19 m; high, >8.19 m). Alpha and beta diversity were significantly higher in the medium regime than in the low and high regimes. Redundancy analysis indicated that the maximum water depth significantly affected taxonomic alpha diversity, and total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration significantly affected functional alpha diversity, respectively. Mantel tests showed that TN, Secchi depth (SD), and water depth in the high water level regime significantly increased the total beta diversity and turnover components. TN was the main factor that increased total taxonomic beta diversity. Water level regime mainly influenced interspecific relationships by changing the TN and COD concentration. The water level should be maintained between the medium and high water level regimes to promote restoration of the macrophyte community and improve ecosystem stability. The biodiversity evaluation framework would provide a deeper insight into the hydrological process management for restoration of aquatic macrophyte communities in shallow lakes.

AB Storage heterogeneity effects on runoff generation have been well documented at the hillslope or plot scale. However, diversity across catchments can increase the range of storage conditions. Upscaling the influence of small-scale storage on streamflow across the usually more heterogeneous environment of the catchment has been difficult. The objective of this study was to observe the distribution of storage in a heterogeneous catchment and evaluate its significance and potential influence on streamflow. The study was conducted in the subarctic Canadian Shield: a region with extensive bedrock outcrops, shallow predominantly organic soils, discontinuous permafrost and numerous water bodies. Even when summer runoff was generated from bedrock hillslopes with small storage capacities, intermediary locations with large storage capacities, particularly headwater lakes, prevented water from transmitting to higher order streams. The topographic bounds of the basin thus constituted the maximum potential contributing area to streamflow and rarely the actual area. Topographic basin storage had little relation to basin streamflow, but hydrologically connected storage exhibited a strong hysteretic relationship with streamflow. This relationship defines the form of catchment function such that the basin can be defined by a series of storing and contributing curves comparable with the wetting and drying curves used in relating tension and hydraulic conductivity to water content in unsaturated soils. These curves may prove useful for catchment classification and elucidating predominant hydrological processes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada.

AB Access to credible estimates of water use is critical for making optimal operational decisions and investment plans to ensure reliable and affordable provisioning of water. Furthermore, identifying the key predictors of water use is important for regulators to promote sustainable development policies to reduce water use. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework, grounded in statistical learning theory, to develop a rigorously evaluated predictive model of state-level, per capita water use in the United States as a function of various geographic, climatic, and socioeconomic variables. Specifically, we compare the accuracy of various statistical methods in predicting the state-level, per capita water use and find that the model based on the random forest algorithm outperforms all other models. We then leverage the random forest model to identify key factors associated with high water-usage intensity among different sectors in the United States. More specifically, irrigated farming, thermoelectric energy generation, and urbanization were identified as the most water-intensive anthropogenic activities, on a per capita basis. Among the climate factors, precipitation was found to be a key predictor of per capita water use, with drier conditions associated with higher water usage. Overall, our study highlights the utility of leveraging data-driven modeling to gain valuable insights related to the water use patterns across expansive geographical areas.

AB In this paper an attempt is made towards the generalization and summarisation of up-to-date research work in the field of simplified flood routing models derived from the linearized St. Venant equation.  The case of a uniform wide-open channel with an arbitrary cross section and friction law is considered.  The characteristic equation for deriving the cumulants of the IUH is used, which is applicable only when one boundary condition is active only.  Introduced in the paper is a method for evaluation of cumulants which allows the substitution rules for the second-order derivatives of the linearized St. Venant equation under the condition of cumulants equivalence to be formulated.  Depending on the number of equivalent cumulants, three kinds of models originating from the St. Venant equation are specified.  The families of simplified models belonging to each class are derived using the substitution rules.  Examples of applications are given.

AB The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) is a commonly used proxy for soil moisture. The predictive capability of TWI is influenced by the flow-routing algorithm and the resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) that TWI is derived from. Here, we examine the predictive capability of TWI using 11 flow-routing algorithms at DEM resolutions 1-30 m. We analyze the relationship between TWI and field-quantified soil moisture using statistical modeling methods and 5,200 study plots with over 46 000 soil moisture measurements. In addition, we test the sensitivity of the flow-routing algorithms against vertical height errors in DEM at different resolutions. The results reveal that the overall predictive capability of TWI was modest. The highest r(2) (23.7%) was reached using a multiple-flow-direction algorithm at 2 m resolution. In addition, the test of sensitivity against height errors revealed that the multiple-flow-direction algorithms were also more robust against DEM errors than single-flow-direction algorithms. The results provide field-evidence indicating that at its best TWI is a modest proxy for soil moisture and its predictive capability is influenced by the flow-routing algorithm and DEM resolution. Thus, we encourage careful evaluation of algorithms and resolutions when using TWI as a proxy for soil moisture.

AB Fluvial sediment transport studies have long underscored the difficulty in reliably estimating transport model parameters, collecting accurate observations, and making predictions because of measurement error, natural variability, and conceptual model uncertainty. Thus, there is a need to identify modeling frameworks that accommodate these realities while incorporating functional relationships, providing probability-based predictions, and accommodating for conceptual model discrimination. Bayesian statistical approaches have been widely used in a number of disciplines to accomplish just this, yet applications in sediment transport are few. In this paper we propose and demonstrate a Bayesian statistical approach to a simple sediment transport problem as a means to overcome some of these challenges. This approach provides a means to rigorously estimate model parameter distributions, such as critical shear, given observations of sediment transport; provides probabilistically based predictions that are robust and easily interpretable; facilitates conceptual model discrimination; and incorporates expert judgment into model inference and predictions. We demonstrate a simple unisize sediment transport model and test it against simulated observations for which the "true" model parameters are known. Experimental flume observations were also used to assess the proposed model's robustness. Results indicate that such a modeling approach is valid and presents an opportunity for more complex models to be built in the Bayesian framework.

AB The leak detection methods in the frequency domain have presently become widely established among transient-based techniques. This study quantifies the uncertainty of the frequency domain multiple leak detection subjected to uncertain Gaussian, independent, and identically distributed measurements. The lower limit of the variances and covariances of the estimated leak locations and sizes are derived via the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound theory, whose derivation consistency with the Taylor expansion is also revealed. A systematic methodology based on the Monte Carlo simulations and probing waves is carried out to examine and verify the proposed formulations and corresponding outcomes, leading to an in-depth analysis of interactions between probing waves and leaks. The results justify the formation of points of minimum error in the pipeline corresponding to each specific harmonic wave, which has direct application in detectability using signals of limited bandwidth in actual practice. The findings resolve the reason behind localization failure for some test cases and success for others despite the same noise levels, as illustrated via numerical and experimental test cases. A workflow for efficient leak detection and the approach to estimating the corresponding localization uncertainty is proposed. According to the findings of this study, one may recommend the predicted error-location results to accompany the wave-based leak detection outputs to render a measure of accuracy in the identification process.

AB This study presents an a priori model for predicting attachment efficiency of colloid deposition in porous media under unfavorable conditions. The model takes into account coupled effects of diffusion and hydrodynamic forces on colloid attachment efficiency that result from both primary and secondary minimum deposition. Effect of diffusion was quantified using the Maxwell approach, and influence of hydrodynamic drag was determined by comparing adhesive and hydrodynamic torques that act on the attached colloids. Main findings from this study include (1) the attachment efficiency does not change with increase of flow velocity until it reaches a critical value at which the attachment efficiency decreases as flow velocity further increases and (2) the attachment efficiency increases with increasing collector diameter when the condition that adhesive torque is greater than hydrodynamic torque is not guaranteed over the entire collector surface. Whereas the classic filtration theory only takes into account the effects of system hydrodynamics on single collector contact efficiency, we show additionally their effects on attachment efficiency. Furthermore, results of this study imply that in addition to the important role that collector size plays in the straining process, which has been the focus of many recent studies, it also influences the attachment process thus must be considered when describing colloid retention and transport in porous media under unfavorable attachment conditions.

AB Numerical simulation experiments of water erosion at the local scale (20 x 5 m) using a process-based model [ Plot Soil Erosion Model_2D (PSEM_2D)] were carried out to test the effects of various environmental factors (soil type, meteorological forcing and slope gradient) on the runoff and erosion response and to determine the dominant processes that control the sediment yield at various slope lengths. The selected environmental factors corresponded to conditions for which the model had been fully tested beforehand. The use of a Green and Ampt model for infiltration explained the dominant role played by rainfall intensity in the runoff response. Sediment yield at the outlet of the simulated area was correlated positively with rainfall intensity and slope gradient, but was less sensitive to soil type. The relationship between sediment yield (soil loss per unit area) and slope length was greatly influenced by all environmental factors, but there was a general tendency towards higher sediment yield when the slope was longer. Contribution of rainfall erosion to gross erosion was dominant for all surfaces with slope lengths ranging from 4 to 20 m. The highest sediment yields corresponded to cases where flow erosion was activated. An increase in slope gradient resulted in flow detachment starting upstream. Sediment exported at the outlet of the simulated area came predominantly from the zone located near the outlet. The microrelief helped in the development of a rill network that controlled both the ratio between rainfall and flow erosion and the relationship between sediment yield and slope length. Copyright.

TI Modeling jointly low, moderate, and heavy rainfall intensities without a
   threshold selection
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID PRECIPITATION; MOMENTS; LIKELIHOOD
AB In statistics, extreme events are often defined as excesses above a given large threshold. This definition allows hydrologists and flood planners to apply Extreme-Value Theory (EVT) to their time series of interest. Even in the stationary univariate context, this approach has at least two main drawbacks. First, working with excesses implies that a lot of observations (those below the chosen threshold) are completely disregarded. The range of precipitation is artificially shopped down into two pieces, namely large intensities and the rest, which necessarily imposes different statistical models for each piece. Second, this strategy raises a nontrivial and very practical difficultly: how to choose the optimal threshold which correctly discriminates between low and heavy rainfall intensities. To address these issues, we propose a statistical model in which EVT results apply not only to heavy, but also to low precipitation amounts (zeros excluded). Our model is in compliance with EVT on both ends of the spectrum and allows a smooth transition between the two tails, while keeping a low number of parameters. In terms of inference, we have implemented and tested two classical methods of estimation: likelihood maximization and probability weighed moments. Last but not least, there is no need to choose a threshold to define low and high excesses. The performance and flexibility of this approach are illustrated on simulated and hourly precipitation recorded in Lyon, France.

TI Disentangling the Impact of Catchment Heterogeneity on Nitrate Export
   Dynamics From Event to Long-Term Time Scales

   PHOSPHORUS; DISCHARGE; GERMANY; RESPONSES; SOLUTE; DENITRIFICATION
AB Defining effective measures to reduce nitrate pollution in heterogeneous mesoscale catchments remains challenging when based on concentration measurements at the outlet only. One reason for this is our limited understanding of the subcatchment contributions to nitrate export and their importance at different time scales. While upstream subcatchments often disproportionally contribute to runoff generation and in turn to nutrient export, agricultural areas (which are typically found in downstream lowlands) are known to be a major source of nitrate pollution. To examine the interplay of different subcatchments, we analyzed seasonal long-term trends and event dynamics of nitrate concentrations, loads, and the concentration-discharge relationship in three nested catchments within the Selke catchment (456 km(2)), Germany. The upstream subcatchments (40.4% of total catchment area, 34.5% of N input) had short transit times and dynamic concentration-discharge relationships with elevated nitrate concentrations during wet seasons and events. Consequently, the upstream subcatchments dominated nitrate export during high flow and disproportionally contributed to overall annual nitrate loads at the outlet (64.2%). The downstream subcatchment was characterized by higher N input, longer transit times, and relatively constant nitrate concentrations between seasons, dominating nitrate export during low-flow periods. Neglecting the disproportional role of upstream subcatchments for temporally elevated nitrate concentrations and net annual loads can lead to an overestimation of the role of agricultural lowlands. Nonetheless, constantly high concentrations from nitrate legacies pose a long-term threat to water quality in agricultural lowlands. This knowledge is crucial for an effective and site-specific water quality management.
   Plain Language Summary To efficiently remove nitrate pollution, we need to understand how it is transported, mobilized, and stored within large and heterogeneous catchments. Previous studies have shown that upstream catchments often have a disproportional impact on nutrient export, while agriculture (a major nitrate source) is often located in downstream lowlands. To understand which parts of a catchment contribute most to nitrate export and when, we analyzed long-term (1983-2016) and high-frequency (2010-2016) data in the Selke catchment (Germany) at three locations. The mountainous upstream part dominated nitrate transport during winter, spring, and rain events. It had a surprisingly high contribution to annual nitrate loads. The agricultural downstream part of the catchment dominated nitrate export during summer and autumn, with relatively constant concentrations between seasons. Here, nitrogen inputs needed more than a decade to travel through the subsurface of the catchment, which causes a time lag between measures to reduce nitrate pollution and their measurable effect. The resulting storage of nitrate in the groundwater threatens drinking water quality for decades to come. While the role of agricultural lowlands for nitrate export can be overestimated if neglecting the disproportional role of upstream subcatchments, their impact poses a long-term threat to water quality.

TI Exploring Drivers of Regional Water-Quality Change Using Differential

AB An understanding of riverine water-quality dynamics in regional mixed-land use watersheds is the foundation for advances in landscape biogeochemistry and informed land management. A differential implementation of the statistical/process-based model SPAtially Referenced Regressions on Watershed attributes (SPARROW; Smith et al., https://doi.org/10.1029/97wr02171) is proposed to empirically relate a regional pattern of changes in flow-normalized constituent flux, over a multiyear period, to contemporaneous changes in spatially referenced explanatory variables. In a pilot application, the differential model, called Spatiotemporal Watershed Accumulation of Net effects (SWAN), is used to explore factors influencing changes in flow-normalized flux of total nitrogen over the period 1990-2010 at 43 sites in the nontidal Chesapeake Bay watershed. A seven-parameter model explains 80% of the transformed variability in independently estimated flux changes, indicating that storage effects having characteristic time scales greater than 20 years had a small influence, relative to changes in inputs, on regional water-quality response. Results suggest that 1990-2010 changes in total-nitrogen flux are largely the outcome of increased nonpoint-source pollution associated with urban and suburban development, modulated to the point of negation by terrestrial losses stemming from widespread increases in air temperature and precipitation. The loss mechanism is qualitatively consistent with denitrification; however, increases in aboveground biomass, agricultural nitrogen exports, or hydrologic flushing are also plausible contributors. Although qualified by a small sample size and constraints on explanatory data availability, the pilot suggests that SWAN is a promising approach for broadening scientific understanding of factors driving regional water-quality change and for supporting evidence-based land-management decisions.
   Plain Language Summary Large watersheds are a mosaic of differing land types, climate, and human influences, which store and export pollutants over time scales ranging from days to centuries. Scientists' understanding of these watersheds' response to changing conditions has historically been based on complex models with many built-in assumptions. This work describes a simpler alternative, designed to link a regional pattern of observed changes in pollutant export to maps of changes in suspected causes, while keeping "rules" to a minimum. We modeled changes in the export of nitrogen, a nutrient whose excess is responsible for decline in Chesapeake Bay fisheries, from 43 bay tributaries between 1990 and 2010. Our model explained 80% of the observed changes, linking overall reductions to changes in inputs from point, agricultural, atmospheric, and urban sources, coupled with increases in temperature and precipitation. Delayed export of nitrogen input before 1990 had a smaller influence, indicating that the watershed's "memory" of degradation that occurred long ago, although evident, does not overshadow actions taken to improve regional water quality at the 20-year time scale. By providing hard evidence of the effects of past changes, this approach can better inform today's management choices and help set realistic expectations for their outcomes.

AB This paper investigates the specific contributions of river network geomorphology, hillslope flow dynamics and channel routing to the scaling behavior of the hydrologic response as function of drainage area. Scaling relationships emerged from the observations of geomorphological and hydrological data and were reproduced in previous works through mathematical models, for both idealized self-similar networks and natural basins. Recent literature highlighted that scale invariance of hydrological quantities depends not only on the metrics of the drainage catchment but also on effective flow routing. In this study we employ a geomorphological width function scheme to test the simple scaling hypothesis adopting more realistic dynamic conditions than in previous approaches, specifically taking into account the role of hillslopes. The analysis is based on the derivation of the characteristic distributions of path lengths and travel times, inferred from DEM processing and measurements of rainfall and runoff data. The study area is located in the Tiber River region (central Italy).
   Results indicate that, while scaling properties clearly emerge when the hydrologic response is defined on the basis of the sole geomorphology, scale invariance is broken when less idealized flow dynamics are taken into account. Lack of scaling appears in particular as a consequence of the catchment to catchment variability of hillslope velocities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the mid-20th century, harnessing of thermodynamics in describing water movement in soil, viz the concept of water potential, marks the emergence of modern soil physics, unsaturated soil mechanics, and vadose zone hydrology. Yet to date, a seamless linkage between thermodynamics and water potential is still missing, leading to several long-lasting dilemmas regarding soil properties, for example, abnormal soil water density, peculiar film water viscosity and relative permittivity, pore water pressure, and water freezing temperature depression. Here, a thermodynamic framework is established by synthesizing recent advancements in soil-water interaction. The classical thermodynamic concepts are revisited, highlighting the difference between macroscopic systems commonly treated in conventional theories and the intermolecular scale system subject to external fields. Soil water is conceived as an intermolecular scale open thermodynamic system subject to external fields of gravity, osmosis, and adsorption. The formulated thermodynamic framework is verified by reducing to the conventional definition of matric potential and a recently proposed unitary definition. The accuracy of the framework is further justified in terms of mechanical equilibrium criteria. The framework predicts the existence of spatially varied pore water pressure in soil pores and can serve as the theoretical basis for reconciling the physical origin of abnormal soil behavior such as water density, film water viscosity, relative permittivity, and negative or positive pore water pressure.

AB [ 1] This paper describes laboratory experimental evidence for lateral flow in the top layer of unsaturated sloping soil due to rainfall. Water was applied uniformly on horizontal and V-shaped surfaces of fine sand, at rates about 100 times smaller than the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Flow regimes near the surface and in the soil bulk were studied by using dyes. Streamlines and streak lines and wetting fronts were visually studied and photographed through a vertical glass wall. Near wetting fronts the flow direction was always perpendicular to the fronts owing to dominant matrix potential gradients. Thus, during early wetting of dry sloping sand, the flow direction is directed upslope. Far above a wetting front the flow was vertical due to the dominance of gravity. Downslope flow was observed during decreasing rainfall and dry periods. The lateral movement was largest near the soil surface and decayed with soil depth. Unstable downslope lateral flow close to the soil surface was attributed to non-Darcian flow due to variable temporal and spatial raindrop distributions. The experiments verify the theory that predicts unsaturated downslope lateral flow in sloping soil due to rainfall dynamics only, without apparent soil texture difference or anisotropy. This phenomenon could have significant implications for hillside hydrology, desert agriculture, irrigation management, etc., as well as for the basic mechanisms of surface runoff and erosion.

AB [ 1] The standard for conducting flood frequency analysis in the UK, as set out in the Flood Estimation Handbook, is based on the index flood method, using the median of the annual maximum flood as the index flood. For a given target site, a region-of-influence approach is used, involving the creation of a collection of hydrologically similar catchments ( pooling group). This paper examines the sampling uncertainty of quantile estimates on the basis of pooling groups and using the median as the index flood for both gauged and ungauged sites. Analytical approximations for the variance of the quantile estimates were derived, on the basis of asymptotic theory, and were used to calculate approximate confidence intervals for flood frequency curves obtained using both single-site and pooled analysis at gauged and ungauged sites. A series of bootstrap experiments were conducted to quantify the intersite dependence and to develop generalized expressions to be included in the analysis. It is shown that the pooled analysis yields narrower confidence intervals than the single-site analysis and that the presence of intersite correlations increases the sampling uncertainty. The method was extended to encompass estimation at ungauged sites in the UK on the basis of a regression model for the index flood, which significantly increases the prediction uncertainty compared with using an estimate of the index flood derived from observations at the target site.

AB Geologic heterogeneity is one of the important factors controlling migration and distribution of nonaqueous phase liquids in the subsurface. Heterogeneity, such as fractures, complicates the effectiveness of environmental remediation, and uncharacterized aquifer heterogeneity causes significant uncertainties in the removal of nonaqueous phase liquids. Foaming an injection gas is an effective method to alleviate the challenges in accessing heterogeneous media during remediation processes because foam is nonNewtonian and redirects gas and liquid flow. Foamed gas may also assist in increasing the storage of carbon dioxide in saline formations. This paper investigates foam flow behavior in microscale fractures and develops a mechanistic transient foam flow model using the population balance method. Microscale experiments in fractures with apertures of 25 and 88 mu m are used to validate the model for pressure drop, gas saturation, and bubble texture. Key differences related to modeling foam in fractures are the potential for continuously varying gas-liquid curvature in fractures and the relationship of this curvature to apparent foam viscosity. Incorporation of a local foam flow resistance factor is important to representing flow physics accurately. Hence, the results of this study provide foundational understanding for upscaling foam rheology in different sized fractures to ensure successful operations in soil/aquifer remediation and CO2 storage in saline formations.

AB The influence of the length of the calibration period and observation frequency on the predictive uncertainty in time series modeling of groundwater dynamics is investigated. Studied series are from deltaic regions with predominantly shallow groundwater tables in a temperate maritime climate where heads vary due to precipitation and evaporation. Response times vary over a wide range from approximate to 60 to approximate to 1200 days. A Transfer Function-Noise model is calibrated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to both synthetic series and measured series of heads. The model fit and uncertainty are evaluated for various calibration periods and observation frequencies. It is often assumed that the required length of the calibration period is related to the response time of the system. In this study, no strong relationship was observed. Results indicate, however, that the required length of the calibration period is related to the decay time of the noise. Furthermore, the length of the calibration period was much more important than the total number of observations. For the measured series, the credible intervals could commonly be reduced to approximate to 10% of the measured head range and the prediction intervals to approximate to 50% of the measured head range with calibration periods of 20 years with approximately two observations per month.

ID LANDSLIDE; RAINFALL; AREA
AB An infinite slope stability model is proposed which incorporates changes in root cohesion and vegetation surcharge through several timber management cycles along with the stochastic influence of rainfall on pore water pressure. Recovery of rooting strength and tree surcharge following timber harvest are simulated by a sigmoid relationship, while root deterioration of harvested vegetation is described by an exponential decay function. The effects of long-term timber management on probability of failure are simulated by overlaying the impacts of a prior vegetation removal on a more recent removal. For each year the critical pore water pressure (u(crit)) needed to trigger slope failure is computed. An empirical function relating piezometric level to antecedent rainfall, storm intensity, and total precipitation is presented to assess the probability of occurrence of u(crit), based on historical rainfall records for a site in coastal Alaska. Simulations of probability of failure indicate that alternate thinnings and clear-cuts and clear-cuts alone produce less stable conditions than shelterwood harvesting systems and partial cuts. Repeated harvestign cycles with progressively shorter rotations, reduced regeneration potential on new vegetation, and destruction of understory vegetation during logging or site preparation can all increase the probability of failure. These analyses can provide land managers with options for acceptable vegetation management strategies on potentially unstable hillslopes.

AB There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the application of Information Theory to problems of system identification in the Earth and Environmental Sciences. While the concept of entropy has found increased application, little attention has yet been given to the practical problems of estimating entropy when dealing with the unique characteristics of two commonly used kinds of hydrologic data: rainfall and runoff. In this paper, we discuss four important issues of practical relevance that can bias the computation of entropy if not properly handled. The first (zero effect) arises when precipitation and ephemeral streamflow data must be viewed as arising from a discrete-continuous hybrid distribution due to the occurrence of many zero values (e. g., days with no rain/no runoff). Second, in the widely used bin-counting method for estimation of PDF's, significant error can be introduced if the bin width is not carefully selected. The third (measurement effect) arises due to the fact that continuously varying hydrologic variables can typically only be observed discretely to some degree of precision. The Fourth (skewness effect) arises when the distribution of a variable is significantly skewed. Here we present an approach that can deal with all four of these issues, and test them with artificially generated and real hydrological data. The results indicate that the method is accurate and robust.

AB We provide a comprehensive experimental study of steady state, drainage relative permeability curves with CO2-brine and N-2-deionized water, on a single Bentheimer sandstone core with a simple two-layer heterogeneity. We demonstrate that, if measured in the viscous limit, relative permeability is invariant with changing reservoir conditions, and is consistent with the continuum-scale multiphase flow theory for water wet systems. Furthermore, we show that under capillary limited conditions, the CO2-brine system is very sensitive to heterogeneity in capillary pressure, and by performing core floods under capillary limited conditions, we produce effective relative permeability curves that are flow rate and fluid parameter dependent. We suggest that the major uncertainty in past observations of CO2-brine relative permeability curves is due to the interaction of CO2 flow with pore space heterogeneity under capillary limited conditions and is not due to the effects of changing reservoir conditions. We show that the appropriate conditions for measuring intrinsic or effective relative permeability curves can be selected simply by scaling the driving force for flow by a quantification of capillary heterogeneity. Measuring one or two effective curves on a core with capillary heterogeneity that is representative of the reservoir will be sufficient for reservoir simulation.

DT Article

ID CREATION; SYSTEMS
AB The search for suitable segmentations is a challenging and urgent issue for the analysis, planning and management of complex water distribution networks (WDNs). In fact, complex and large size hydraulic systems require the division into modules in order to simplify the analysis and the management tasks. In the complex network theory, modularity index has been proposed as a measure of the strength of the network division into modules and its maximization is used in order to identify community of nodes (i.e., modules) which are characterized by strong interconnections. Nevertheless, modularity index needs to be revised considering the specificity of the hydraulic systems as infrastructure systems. To this aim, the classic modularity index has been recently modified and tailored for WDNs. Nevertheless, the WDN-oriented modularity is affected by the resolution limit stemming from classic modularity index. Such a limit hampers the identification/design of small modules and this is a major drawback for technical tasks requiring a detailed resolution of the network segmentation. In order to get over this problem, we propose a novel infrastructure modularity index that is not affected by the resolution limit of the classic one. The rationale and good features of the proposed index are theoretically demonstrated and discussed using two real hydraulic networks.

AB Nonirrigated agriculture on the Iberian Peninsula is regularly affected by dry periods that can cause important losses. This paper focuses on the comparison of the classical Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) with a fragility index developed by the multivariate extreme value theory community, which is used to describe monthly precipitation deficits below 30.5 mm (about 1 mm/d) in the Spanish Duero basin. The multivariate extreme value model allows to capture relevant information concerning the dependence structure among extreme precipitation deficits. Maps of those extremal dependence summaries and of loadings of principal components of the SPI provide quantitative information for water management. In addition, jointly analyzing data from several stations improves the inference of uncertainty. Spatial patterns of extremal dependence emerged with respect to orographic features. Most severe dry spells occur in the southeast of the Duero basin. In central plain of the Duero basin, a predominantly agricultural area, a strong fragility index for severity of dry spells is particularly found in eastern regions. Results of the MEVT and SPI analysis point in the same direction. Beyond this, the MEVT assessment gives a quantitative measure of the dependence between stations and regions. Estimates of return periods for extreme dry spell severity are discussed. Deficits below 42.7 mm are also analyzed.

AB Machine learning techniques were applied to a large (n>10,000) compliance monitoring database to predict the occurrence of several redox-active constituents in groundwater across a large watershed. Specifically, random forest classification was used to determine the probabilities of detecting elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic in the Fox, Wolf, Peshtigo, and surrounding watersheds in northeastern Wisconsin. Random forest classification is well suited to describe the nonlinear relationships observed among several explanatory variables and the predicted probabilities of elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic. Maps of the probability of elevated nitrate, iron, and arsenic can be used to assess groundwater vulnerability and the vulnerability of streams to contaminants derived from groundwater. Processes responsible for elevated concentrations are elucidated using partial dependence plots. For example, an increase in the probability of elevated iron and arsenic occurred when well depths coincided with the glacial/bedrock interface, suggesting a bedrock source for these constituents. Furthermore, groundwater in contact with Ordovician bedrock has a higher likelihood of elevated iron concentrations, which supports the hypothesis that groundwater liberates iron from a sulfide-bearing secondary cement horizon of Ordovician age. Application of machine learning techniques to existing compliance monitoring data offers an opportunity to broadly assess aquifer and stream vulnerability at regional and national scales and to better understand geochemical processes responsible for observed conditions.

AB Soils in various places of the Panama Canal Watershed feature a low saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) at shallow depth, which promotes overland-flow generation and associated flashy catchment responses. In undisturbed forests of these areas, overland flow is concentrated in flow lines that extend the channel network and provide hydrological connectivity between hillslopes and streams. To understand the dynamics of overland-flow connectivity, as well as the impact of connectivity on catchment response, we studied an undisturbed headwater catchment by monitoring overland-flow occurrence in all flow lines and discharge, suspended sediment, and total phosphorus at the catchment outlet. We find that connectivity is strongly influenced by seasonal variation in antecedent wetness and can develop even under light rainfall conditions. Connectivity increased rapidly as rainfall frequency increased, eventually leading to full connectivity and surficial drainage of entire hillslopes. Connectivity was nonlinearly related to catchment response. However, additional information on factors such as overland-flow volume would be required to constrain relationships between connectivity, stormflow, and the export of suspended sediment and phosphorus. The effort to monitor those factors would be substantial, so we advocate applying the established links between rain event characteristics, drainage network expansion by flow lines, and catchment response for predictive modeling and catchment classification in forests of the Panama Canal Watershed and in similar regions elsewhere.

AB Appropriate regularizations of geophysical inverse problems and joint inversion of different data types improve geophysical models and increase their usefulness in hydrogeological studies. We have developed an efficient method to calculate stochastic regularization operators for given geostatistical models. The method, which combines circulant embedding and the diagonalization theorem of circulant matrices, is applicable for stationary geostatistical models when the grid discretization, in each spatial direction, is uniform in the volume of interest. We also used a structural approach to jointly invert cross-hole electrical resistance and ground-penetrating radar traveltime data in three dimensions. The two models are coupled by assuming, at all points, that the cross product of the gradients of the two models is zero. No petrophysical relationship between electrical conductivity and relative permittivity is assumed but is instead obtained as a by-product of the inversion. The approach has been applied to data collected in a U. K. sandstone aquifer in order to improve characterization of the vadose zone hydrostratigraphy. By analyzing scatterplots of electrical conductivity versus relative permittivity together with petrophysical models a zonation could be obtained with corresponding estimates of the electrical formation factor, the water content, and the effective grain radius of the sediments. The approach provides greater insight into the hydrogeological characteristics of the subsurface than by using conventional geophysical inversion methods.

AB Sorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) onto 17 lake/river sediments, one red soil, pure minerals, and humic acid was comparatively studied. The isotherms of 2,4-DCP onto soil/sediment samples and humic acid are notably nonlinear at low concentrations and can be described by a simple dual-mode model: q(e) = KpCe + Q(0)bC(e)/(1 + bC(e)). No significant sorption of 2,4-DCP on pure minerals ( montmorillonite and amorphous silicon oxide) was detected. Strong correlations of natural organic matter content to model parameters K-p, Q(0), and Q(0)b were observed, while no significant effects of soil/sediment specific surface area and total clay content on sorption were observed. It is hypothesized that most of the nonlinear sorption behavior can be attributed to the soil/sediment organic matter contents as opposed to mineral contents because of the predominance of strongly hydrated cations (e. g., Na+, Ca2+, Al3+, Mg2+) in natural waters. The treatment of K-oc* (K-oc* = K-p/f(oc)), Q(oc) (Q(oc) = Q(0)/f(oc)), and L-oc (L-oc = Q(0)b/f(oc)) as constants for a given solute represents an important step toward establishing a quantitative relationship between nonlinear sorption and solute molecular structure and offers a way to approximately calculate the nonlinear sorption from soil/sediment f(oc).

AB Solubility trapping is crucial for permanent CO 2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers. For the first time, a pore-scale numerical method is developed to investigate coupled scCO(2)-water two-phase flow, multicomponent (CO2(aq), H+, HCO3, CO32- and OH ) mass transport, heterogeneous interfacial dissolution reaction, and homogeneous dissociation reactions. Pore-scale details of evolutions of multiphase distributions and concentration fields are presented and discussed. Time evolutions of several variables including averaged CO2(aq) concentration, scCO(2) saturation, and pH value are analyzed. Specific interfacial length, an important variable which cannot be determined but is required by continuum models, is investigated in detail. Mass transport coefficient or efficient dissolution rate is also evaluated. The pore-scale results show strong non-equilibrium characteristics during solubility trapping due to non-uniform distributions of multiphase as well as slow mass transport process. Complicated coupling mechanisms between multiphase flow, mass transport and chemical reactions are also revealed. Finally, effects of wettability are also studied. The pore-scale studies provide deep understanding of non-linear non-equilibrium multiple physicochemical processes during CO2 solubility trapping processes, and also allow to quantitatively predict some important empirical relationships, such as saturation-interfacial surface area, for continuum models.

AB Large wood (LW) is used for river restoration, aquatic habitat conservation, and flood control; however, it can pose a threat to human life and the built environment. The formation of LW jams, river management strategies, and design of mitigation measures crucially all depend on how the large wood is transported along a river. This paper experimentally analyses at laboratory scale the motion of natural sticks in a long stretch of a straight channel (>16 m), when LW is released at different locations and with different flow conditions. Results show that instream large wood, following a transient motion shortly after being released at the water surface, tends to follow preferential patterns along the channel. Froude number and location of large wood input may provide an estimation of the LW location in downstream reaches. Several mechanisms of motion were observed, some of which were very common, including a frequent tendency to assume a tilted position with respect to the direction parallel to the flow. The experiments also suggest that theories on secondary cells responsible for channeling LW in preferential directions are incomplete. A new model, based on acceleration induced by hydrodynamic actions, has been established and proposed in this work, showing promising results and paving the way for the development of a comprehensive model for transport of large wood at the river surface in full-scale applications.

AB Velocity and forces on individual plants were measured within an emergent canopy with real plant morphology and used to develop predictions for the vertical profiles of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Two common plant species, Typha latifolia and Rotala indica, with distinctive morphology, were considered. Typha has leaves bundled at the base, and Rotala has leaves distributed over the length of the central stem. Compared to conditions with a bare bed and the same velocity, the TKE within both canopies was enhanced. For the Typha canopy, for which the frontal area increased with distance from the bed, the velocity, integral length-scale, and TKE all decreased with distance from the bed. For the Rotala, which had a vertically uniform distribution of biomass, the velocity, integral length-scale, and TKE were also vertically uniform. A turbulence model previously developed for random arrays of rigid cylinders was modified to predict both the vertical distribution and the channel-average of TKE by defining the relationship between the integral length-scale and plant morphology. The velocity profile can also be predicted from the plant morphology. Combining with the new turbulence model, the TKE profile was predicted from the channel-average velocity and plant frontal area.

TI Spatial characterization of the hydraulic conductivity using direct-push
   injection logging
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SLUG TESTS
AB Detailed information on the spatial structure of hydraulic conductivity (K) is important for understanding and predicting groundwater flow and transport. Direct-push injection logging (DPIL) is a promising technology for rapid measurement of K in unconsolidated formations. This technology was used to gain information on the highly heterogeneous aquifer at the Lauswiesen test site in Germany. Using a large body of DPIL and direct-push slug testing measurements, we characterize the structure of K on scales not previously possible. Two new applications of DPIL are put forward: (1) use of raw DPIL measurements of relative conductivity K-r to characterize the spatial distribution of K and (2) transformation of K-r measurements to K values based on their statistical moments. The DPIL results are compatible to those obtained using more conventional methodologies. The main achievement of the methodology is the possibility to delineate deterministic aquifer subunits as well as the identification of the statistical parameters of the log conductivity for each subunit. In particular, the horizontal integral scale I, a parameter affecting solute transport, is difficult and costly to identify using other approaches. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to clarify questions on low K-r measurements and the nature of the relationship between K-r and K.

AB Freezing point and unfrozen water content are key parameters in modeling the heat and mass transfer under the cyclic change of atmosphere temperature. It is theoretically revealed the relation between the measured pore pressure and true pore pressure with physicochemical interactions. A new generalized Clapeyron equation is derived, which addresses the relationship among the measured pore water, ice-liquid capillary pressure, and pore solution concentration for the frozen soil. The generalized Clapeyron equation is applied to derive the expressions for the freezing point and unfrozen water content in frozen soils at various thermodynamical conditions. The freezing point of soil is calculated and compared with the experimental results, showing that the freezing point depression becomes more pronounced as water content decreases and solution concentration increases. It is also shown that the NaCl solution with relatively high concentration in soil pore approximates the ideal dilute solution while Na2CO3 and some other solutions in soil are significantly different than the ideal dilute solution. Upon assuming the unfrozen water content is only determined by the capillary pressure, the Clapeyron equation links the soil water characteristic curve into the soil freezing characteristic curve. The unfrozen water content in the saline frozen soil and the frozen soil under overburden pressure is also calculated according to the expression derived from the generalized Clapeyron equation.

TI Hyphenated hydrology: Interdisciplinary evolution of water resource
   science
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; ETHNOHYDROLOGY; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE
AB Hydrology has advanced considerably as a scientific discipline since its recognized inception in the mid-twentieth century. Modern water resource related questions have forced adaptation from exclusively physical or engineering science viewpoints toward a deliberate interdisciplinary context. Over the past few decades, many of the eventual manifestations of this evolution were foreseen by prominent expert hydrologists. However, their narrative descriptions have lacked substantial quantification. This study addressed that gap by measuring the prevalence of and analyzing the relationships between the terms most frequently used by hydrologists to define and describe their research. We analyzed 16,591 journal article titles from 1965-2015 in Water Resources Research, through which the scientific dialogue and its time-sensitive progression emerged. Our word frequency and term cooccurrence network results revealed the dynamic timing of the lateral movement of hydrology across multiple disciplines as well as the deepening of scientific discourse with respect to traditional hydrologic questions. The conversation among water resource scientists surrounding the hydrologic subdisciplines of catchment-hydrology, hydro-meteorology, socio-hydrology, hydro-climatology, and eco-hydrology gained statistically significant momentum in the analyzed time period, while that of hydro-geology and contaminant-hydrology experienced periods of increase followed by significant decline. This study concludes that formerly exotic disciplines can potentially modify hydrology, prompting new insights and inspiring unconventional perspectives on old questions that may have otherwise become obsolete.

AB [ 1] Colloid transport was studied at the pore scale in order to gain insight into the microscale processes governing particle removal. Monodisperse suspensions of colloids and water-saturated micromodels were employed. Experiments were carried out for different particle sizes, grain surface roughness, solution ionic strength, and flow rates. Straining and attachment were observed and measured by tracking the trajectory and fate of individual colloids using optical microscopy. Classical filtration theory proved appropriate for throat to colloid ratios ( T/C) larger than 2.5 but did not take into account the possibility of straining that becomes an important capture mechanism for smaller T/C ratios. Spatially within the porous medium, straining occurred within the first 1-2 pore throats, while interception and attachment was seen from the inlet to the first 6-10 pore spaces, depending on particle size. Once a particle passed the initial region, the probability of attachment was very small. Colloid attachment increased with increasing solution ionic strength or decreasing flow rate, whereas straining was mainly independent of flow rate. Surface roughness of the grains also played a significant role in colloid capture, increasing collision efficiency by a factor of 2-3. The mechanisms of removal and the spatial distribution of colloid retention differed noticeably as a function of the T/C ratio. Micromodel visualizations clearly showed that physical straining and the effect of surface roughness should be taken into account when predicting the transport of colloids in saturated porous media.

ID MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; FIELDS
AB [1] The determination of a gradient, or directional derivative, of a spatial variable is a common problem in many Earth science applications. For hydraulic heads, for example, the gradient defines the direction of the groundwater flow and is used in solving groundwater flow and transport equations. Kriging provides a methodology for estimating gradients directly from experimental data without the need to estimate the variable at the nodes of a regular grid ( even when the data are widely and irregularly scattered) and without the need to use finite difference approximations. Kriging is more efficient than other methods of gradient estimation because it uses a probabilistic approach that gives an estimator that is unbiased and with minimum estimation variance. In addition, it provides a standard error of estimation, which is not available from deterministic methods. We extend the kriging formulation of gradient estimation to the universal kriging formulation to account for the frequently observed drift in spatial variables; this is almost always present at the regional scale, for example, for hydraulic head. We present an alternative approach to kriging the gradient that is simpler than previous formulations. This new formulation uses linear systems theory, which facilitates the inference of the required covariances as functions of the covariance of the primary variable whose gradient is to be estimated. An example of estimating the gradient of hydraulic head in an aquifer in southern Spain is presented to illustrate the methodology.

AB In this paper, we present a two-dimensional pore-scale numerical model to investigate the main mechanisms governing biofilm growth in porous media. The fluid flow and solute transport equations are coupled with a biofilm evolution model. Fluid flow is simulated with an immersed boundary-lattice Boltz-mann model while solute transport is described with a volume-of-fluid-type approach. A cellular automaton algorithm combined with immersed boundary methods was developed to describe the spreading and distribution of biomass. Bacterial attachment and detachment mechanisms are also taken into account. The capability of this model to describe correctly the couplings involved between fluid circulation, nutrient transport and bacterial growth is tested under different hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions (i) on a flat medium and (ii) for a complex porous medium. For the second case, different regimes of biofilm growth are identified and are found to be related to the dimensionless parameters of the model, Damkohler and eclet numbers and dimensionless shear stress. Finally, the impact of biofilm growth on the macroscopic properties of the porous medium is investigated and we discuss the unicity of the relationships between hydraulic conductivity and biofilm volume fraction.

AB There is broad consensus that urbanization results in dramatic changes in stream hydrology, such as higher peak flows and greater flashiness. However, this has not been definitively tested for aridlands, which are characterized by these very same hydrograph properties. We analyzed streamflow records from 19 watersheds of central Arizona, USA, to determine how hydrograph characteristics varied with urban development. Using linear mixed effects models, which factored in imperviousness along with other watershed characteristics, we evaluated influences on streamflow regime metrics calculated from daily and subdaily flow data. We found that flashiness, coefficient of variation, zero-flow days, and hydrograph rise and fall rates decreased with extent of imperviousness-the opposite pattern to that observed in previous studies primarily in humid regions. Engineered retention basins are one explanation for this observation though novel urban sources of dry weather flows are likely also playing a role. We also found strong relationships between these hydrologic metrics and mean area-weighted discharge, watershed area, and annual precipitation. Like in humid systems, we did observe more high flow events in the urban desert streams compared to nonurban desert streams. However, this was only at the lower flood threshold; there was no increase in larger floods with urban development. Overall, the urban stream syndrome manifests differently in this arid system: Urbanization increases water retention and leads to less variable flows in stream ecosystems.

AB A model is developed to quantify the wind sheltering of a lake by a tree canopy or a bluff. The experiment-based model predicts the wind-sheltering coefficient a priori, without calibration, and is useful for one-dimensional (1-D) lake hydrodynamic and water quality modeling. The model is derived from velocity measurements in a boundary layer wind tunnel, by investigating mean velocity profiles and surface shear stress development downwind of two canopies and a bluff. The wind tunnel experiments are validated with field measurements over an ice-covered lake. Both wind tunnel and field experiments show that reduced surface shear stress extends approximately 50 canopy heights downwind from the transition. The reduction in total shear force on the water surface is parameterized by a wind-sheltering coefficient that is related to the reduction of wind-affected lake area. While all measurements are made on solid surfaces, the wind-sheltering coefficient is shown to be applicable to the lake surface. Although several canopy characteristics, such as its height, aerodynamic roughness, and its porosity affect the transition of velocity profiles and surface shear stress onto a lake, a relationship based on canopy height alone provides a sufficiently realistic estimate of the wind-sheltering coefficient. The results compare well with wind-sheltering coefficients estimated by calibration of lake water temperature profile simulations for eight lakes.

AB A framework to estimate sediment loads based oil the statistical distribution of sediment concentrations and various functional forms relating distribution characteristics (e.g. mean and variance) to covariates is developed. The covariates are used as surrogates to represent the main processes involved in sediment generation and transport. Statistical models increasing comlpexity are built and compared to assess their relative performance using available sediment concentration and covariate data. Application to the Beaturivage River watershed (Quebec, Canada) is conducted using data for the 1989-2004 period. The covariates considered in this application are streamflow and calendar day. A comparison of different statistical models shows that. in this case. the log-normal distribution with a mean Value depending oil streamflow (power law with in additive term) and calendar day (sinusoidal). a constant coefficient of variation for streamflow dependence and a constant standard deviation for calendar day dependence provide the best result. Model parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation technique. The selected model is then used to estimate the distribution of annual sediment loads for the Beaurivage River watershed for a selected period. A bootstrap parametric method is implemented to account for uncertainties in parameter values and to build the distributions of annual loads. Comparison of model results with estimates obtained using the empirical ratio estimator shows that the latter were rarely within the 0.1-0.9 quantile interval of the distributions obtained with the proposed approach.

AB Electrokinetics (EK) has been used extensively to remove heavy metals from low permeability porous media. Electrokinetics (EK) or more specifically electrophoresis (EP) has also been proposed to enhance transport of nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) in fine grained porous media in the subsurface. However, increased dissolved oxygen and lower pH, due to electrolysis of water at the anode oxidizes NZVI particles and thus affects the remediation potential of EP with NZVI. This study focuses on minimization of NZVI oxidation and quantification of NZVI migration enhancement through the application of EP. Application of 50 and 100 mA currents under constant current conditions with an oxygen scavenger enhanced NZVI transport from the cathode to the anode. The enhancement in transport compared to diffusion was proportional to the applied current. Predictions of a numerical model, based on traditional colloidal filtration theory (CFT), were consistent with experimental results. In developing the model, the traditional CFT based mass balance equation was modified for the case of no advection. This study suggests that EP has the potential to deliver NZVI in low permeability porous media and that the numerical simulator can be used to predict NZVI mobility with EP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work concludes the investigations into the stability of haline flows in saturated porous media. In the first part [33] a stability criterion for density-driven flow in a saturated homogeneous medium was derived excluding dispersion. In the second part [34], the effects of dispersion were included. The latter criterion made reasonable predictions of the stability regimes (indicated by the number of fingers present) as a function of density and dispersivity variations. We found out that destabilising variables caused an increase in the number of fingers and vice versa. The investigation is extended here for the effects of the medium heterogeneity. The cell problem derived via homogenization theory [20] is solved and its solution used to evaluate the elements of the macrodispersion tensor as functions of time for flow aligned parallel to gravity. The longitudinal coefficient exhibits asymptotic behaviour for favourable and moderately unfavourable density contrasts while it grows indefinitely for higher density contrasts. The range of densities stabilised by medium heterogeneities can thus be estimated from the behaviour of the coefficient. The d(3)f software program is used for the numerical simulations. The code uses the cell-centred finite volume and the implicit Euler techniques for the spatial and temporal discretisations respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maintaining the health of aquatic systems is an essential component of sustainable catchment management, however, degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat continues to challenge scientists and policy-makers. To support management and restoration efforts aquatic system models are required that are able to capture the often complex trajectories that these systems display in response to multiple stressors. This paper explores the abilities and limitations of current model approaches in meeting this challenge, and outlines a strategy based on integration of flexible model libraries and data from observation networks, within a learning framework, as a means to improve the accuracy and scope of model predictions. The framework is comprised of a data assimilation component that utilizes diverse data streams from sensor networks, and a second component whereby model structural evolution can occur once the model is assessed against theoretically relevant metrics of system function. Given the scale and transdisciplinary nature of the prediction challenge, network science initiatives are identified as a means to develop and integrate diverse model libraries and workflows, and to obtain consensus on diagnostic approaches to model assessment that can guide model adaptation. We outline how such a framework can help us explore the theory of how aquatic systems respond to change by bridging bottom-up and top-down lines of enquiry, and, in doing so, also advance the role of prediction in aquatic ecosystem management.

AB Radiation heat transport through the internal void spaces of particle beds, fiber beds, packed beds, reactors and porous media with opaque, diffusely reflecting, gray body surfaces and large solid dimensions (pi d/lambda(th) > 100) is considered. A variational principle formulated for the effective radiation conductivity, based on the local particle surface radiosity, differential view factor and solid temperature, permits a rigorous solution of the dependent, long range multiple scattering problem. The conductivity results, applied to a bed of randomly overlapping spheres, agree exactly with pseudohomogeneous results in both the isotropic and anisotropic scattering limits and shed rigorous light on the anisotropic phase function expansion theory. Explicit calculations, performed for several other standard packings, e.g. fiber beds, exhibit a parallel upper and series lower bound over the various particle shapes and dispersion structures. Results show that an empirical equation first suggested by Vortmeyer (German Chem. Engng, 3, (1980) 124-137), but generalized herein from one P to four P-0, P-1, P-2, P-3 coefficients, which vary substantially with the various industrial packings, will provide a suitable generalization of the emissivity factor of k(rad) for engineering conductivity modeling of radiation heat transport.

AB O-18 is an ideal tracer for characterizing hydrological processes because it can be reliably measured in several watershed hydrological compartments. Here, we present multiyear isotopic data, i.e. O-18 variations (delta O-18), for precipitation inputs, surface water and groundwater in the Shingobee River Headwaters Area (SRHA), a well-instrumented research catchment in north-central Minnesota. SRHA surface waters exhibit delta O-18 seasonal variations similar to those of groundwaters, and seasonal O-18 variations plotted versus time fit seasonal sine functions. These seasonal delta O-18 variations were interpreted to estimate surface water and groundwater mean residence times (MRTs) at sampling locations near topographically closed-basin lakes. MRT variations of about 1 to 16 years have been estimated over an area covering about 9 km(2) from the basin boundary to the most downgradient well. Estimated MRT error ( +/- 0.3 to +/- 0.7 years) is small for short MRTs and is much larger ( +/- 10 years) for a well with an MRT (16 years) near the limit of the method. Groundwater transit time estimates based on Darcy's law, tritium content, and the seasonal delta O-18 amplitude approach appear to be consistent within the limits of each method. The results from this study suggest that use of the delta O-18 seasonal variation method to determine MRTs can help assess groundwater recharge areas in small headwaters catchments.

AB In this paper we seek to understand the nature of flood spatial dependence over the conterminous United States. We extend an existing conditional multivariate statistical model to enable its application to this large and heterogenous region and apply it to a 40-year data set of similar to 2,400 U.S. Geological Survey gauge series records to simulate 1,000years of U.S. flooding comprising more than 63,000 individual events with realistic spatial dependence. A continental-scale hydrodynamic model at 30m resolution is then used to calculate the economic loss arising from each of these events. From this we are able to compute the probability that different values of U.S. annual total economic loss due to flooding are exceeded (i.e., a loss-exceedance curve). Comparing these data to an observed flood loss-exceedance curve for the period 1988-2017 shows a reasonable match for annual losses with probability below 10% (e.g., >1 in 10-year return period). This analysis suggests that there is a 1% chance of U.S. annual fluvial flood losses exceeding $78Bn in any given year, and a 0.1% chance of them exceeding $136Bn. Analysis of the set of stochastic events and losses yields new insights into the nature of flooding and flood risk in the United States. In particular, we confirm the strong relationship between flood affected area and event peak magnitude, but show considerable variability in this relationship between adjacent U.S. regions. The analysis provides a significant advance over previous national flood risk analyses as it gives the full loss-exceedance curve instead of simply the average annual loss.
   Plain Language Summary Traditional flood risk analyses make the assumption that flow probability (the chance that a given river discharge is exceeded) does not vary within river catchments within an event. Real floods, however, do not look like this: In some places flooding is more severe than in others. Over a few tens of kilometers of river assuming the same event return period everywhere is perfectly fine, but over larger areas it breaks down. At national scales traditional risk analyses can only estimate the average annual loss. To estimate the total annual losses that might occur in more extreme flooding years the risk analysis needs to be based on more realistic spatial patterns of flooding. In this paper we use a sophisticated statistical model, based on U.S. Geological Survey river flow data, to simulate 1,000years of spatially realistic U.S. flooding comprising more than 63,000 individual events. By calculating the damage for each event as a dollar value, we are able to estimate the probability of the United States experiencing particular levels of annual flood losses. We show that there is a 1% chance of U.S. annual fluvial flood losses exceeding $78Bn in any given year, and a 0.1% chance of them exceeding $136Bn.

AB A discrete, structured metapopulation model is coupled with the strictly hierarchical competition-colonization trade-off model, in which competitively superior species have lower fecundity rates and thus lower colonizing ability, to study the resulting biodiversity patterns in river networks. These patterns are then compared with those resulting from the neutral dynamics, in which every species has the same fecundity rate and is competitively equivalent at a per capita level. Significant differences exist between riparian biodiversity patterns and those predicted by theories developed for two-dimensional landscapes. We find that dispersal directionality and network structure promote species that produce a large number of propagules at a species level; such species are considered competitively superior in the neutral model and inferior in the trade-off model. As a result, the two key characteristics of riparian systems, dispersal directionality and network structure, lead to lower and higher overall g diversity in the former and the latter models, respectively. The network structure, through the containment effect due to limited cross-basin dispersal, always leads to higher between-community, beta diversity. The spatial distribution of local, a diversity becomes heterogeneous and thus important under directional dispersal and network structure. A higher degree of dividedness results in higher g diversity for communities obeying both neutral and trade-off models, but the increase is more dramatic in the latter.

AB The mismatch between the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of water resources and recent regional socioeconomic development threatens social stability and sustainable development, particularly in river basins affected by water scarcity. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt a water resource regulation model to address these new challenges. Based on the theory of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the Gini coefficient, in this study, a water resource equilibrium regulation model is constructed from the demand side and applied to the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Different from fairness, equilibrium is a stable state under the influence of diversity of interests and other factors. The results show that the model realizes the spatial and temporal equilibrium regulation of water resources. The water supply assurance rates of ecological and agricultural water users increase significantly to 94.1% and 74.3%, respectively. In particular, in dry years, the rigid demands of water users can be well met, and irreversible losses can be avoided. Compared with Scheme 1987, the proportion of water supply for upstream provinces increases to 42.34%, which will contribute to the balanced development of the basin. This model has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, providing not only theoretical and technical support for the adjustment of Scheme 1987 in the YRB but also a reference for other governments and water resource management institutions around the world.

AB Dynamics of vegetated mixing layer displays analogy with canonical and shallow mixing layers. Universality of turbulence and minor influence of flexible aquatic plants on the individual turbulent eddies are anticipated as the prerequisites for the analogy. This paper explores theoretically and experimentally some aspects of analogy by examining spatial patterns of turbulence characteristics around a finite-size patch of submerged flexible vegetation the population density of which was varied between the experimental runs [Sukhodolova and Sukhodolov, 2012]. It introduces analysis of turbulent shear stress, kinetic energy, dissipation rate, and periodicity of organized motions inside the vegetated mixing layer. The theory is compared with the field experiments. The results of the study indicate that the flow structure around the patch with dense population agrees well with the proposed theoretical scaling relations and reveals many aspects of the analogy to hydrodynamic mixing layers. Around the patch with sparse vegetation the flow structure is best represented by a perturbed boundary layer model. These conclusions on the dynamics of the flow are supported by the analysis of scaled turbulence characteristics. The patterns of turbulence profiles are approximated by scaling functions fairly well while the values of scaling parameters differ from the values reported for canonical and shallow mixing layers. This is an important result which agrees with the previous reports of laboratory research with model vegetation and is explained by a combined effect of internal shear and friction at the top of the canopy.

AB The majority of annual sediment flux is transported during storm events in many watersheds across the world. Using X-ray diffraction, we analyzed the mineralogy of grab samples of suspended sediment during different stages of storm hydrographs in the Southern Piedmont. Mineralogy of suspended sediment changes drastically from quartz-dominated during the rising limb to clay dominated during the late falling limb/baseflow. Changes in mineralogy can shed insight into turbidity relationships, suspended sediment sources, energy versus supply-limited sediment transport, and other suspended sediment parameters such as anion exchange capacity and trace element chemistry. An unexpected key finding, confirmed by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, is that both kaolinite and quartz are primarily transported as discrete crystalline minerals of different size classes in our watersheds; this contrasts with existing scientific literature stating that in most fluvial systems suspended sediment is transported primarily as composite particles composed of a heterogeneous mix of all particle sizes. Our findings also support existing literature that turbidity can be a good proxy for elements such as P, which are preferentially adsorbed onto iron oxide coatings thus in situ turbidity probes have great potential to provide relatively inexpensive estimates of P flux when calibrated for specific watersheds.

AB [1] We conducted a detailed study of subsurface flow and water table response coupled with digital terrain analysis (DTA) of surface and subsurface features at the hillslope scale in Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), Georgia. Subsurface storm flow contributions of macropore and matrix flow in different sections along an artificial trench face were highly variable in terms of timing, peak flow, recession characteristics, and total flow volume. The trench flow characteristics showed linkages with the spatial tensiometer response defining water table development upslope. DTA of the ground surface did not capture the observed spatial patterns of trench flow or tensiometric response. However, bedrock surface topographic indices significantly improved the estimation of spatial variation of flow at the trench. Point-scale tensiometric data were also more highly correlated with the bedrock surface-based indices. These relationships were further assessed for temporal changes throughout a rainstorm. Linkages between the bedrock indices and the trench flow and spatial water table responses improved during the wetter periods of the rainstorm, when the hillslope became more hydrologically connected. Our results clearly demonstrate that in developing a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms of runoff generation, local bedrock topography may be highly significant at the hillslope scale in some catchments where the bedrock surface acts as a relatively impermeable boundary.

AB A two-level clustering approach is proposed for optimal design/expansion of a ground-based precipitation monitoring network (GPN). It harnesses the advantages of Infinite Bayesian fuzzy clustering in the first level to partition the study area into homogeneous precipitation zones by considering structural/statistical characteristics and temporal variability of the observed precipitation. In the second level, an ensemble of hierarchical and partitional clustering techniques is considered in the time domain to effectively partition each zone into groups by considering weighted inter-site dissimilarities of precipitation. The dissimilarities account for correlation, temporal dynamics, and fuzzy mutual information of precipitation at existing stations and possible new gauge locations. Key station's location in each group is identified by a proposed ranking procedure that accounts for population density, land-use/landcover, and fuzzy marginal entropy of precipitation. For use with the approach, information on precipitation was derived for fine resolution ungauged grids covering the study area using random forest-based regression relationships developed for gauged grids between merged multiple satellite-based precipitation products (CHIRPS, IMERG) and ground-based precipitation measurements. The potential of the proposed approach over other clustering-based procedures is illustrated through a case study on a GPN comprising 1,128 gauges in Karnataka state (191,791 km(2)) of India. Potential locations for installing new gauges and areas where there is scope for relocating existing stations are identified. The proposed methodology appears promising and could be extended to design networks monitoring various other hydrometeorological variables.

AB Fluid invasion, displacement of one fluid by another in porous media, is important in a large number of industrial and natural processes. Of special interest is the trapping of gas and oil clusters. We study the impact of wettability on fluid pattern formation and capillary trapping in three-dimensional glass beads packs (d(mean) = 1 mm) during fluid invasion at capillary numbers of 10(-7) using mu-CT. The invading fluid was water, and the defending fluid was air. The contact angle of the glass beads was altered between 5 degrees and 115 degrees using Piranha cleaning and silanization. We analyzed the front morphology of the invading fluid, the residual gas saturation, the fluid occupation frequency of pores, and the morphology and statistics of the trapped gas clusters. We found a sharp transition (crossover) at a critical contact angle theta(c) = 96 degrees. Below theta(c) the morphology of the displacement front was flat and compact caused by the strong smoothing effect of cooperative filling. Above theta(c) the morphology of the displacement front was fractal and ramified caused by single bursts (Haines jumps). Across this dynamical phase transition the trapping efficiency changes from no trapping to maximal trapping. For theta > theta(c) the experimental results show that invasion percolation governs the fluid displacement. Strong indicators are the universal scaling behavior of the size distribution of large clusters (relative data error epsilon(data) < 1%) and their linear surface-volume relationship (R-2 = 0.99).

AB The intertidal zone of beach aquifers hosts biogeochemical transformations of terrestrially derived nutrients that are mediated by reactive organic carbon from seawater infiltration. While dissolved organic carbon is often assumed the sole reactive organic carbon component, advected and entrapped particulate organic carbon (POC) is also capable of supporting chemical reactions. Retarded advection of POC relative to groundwater flow forms pools of reactive carbon within beach sediments that support biogeochemical reactions as dissolved solutes move across them due to transient groundwater flow. In this work, we simulate the contribution of POC to beach reactions and identify parameters that control its relative contribution using a groundwater flow model (SEAWAT) and reactive transport model (PHT3D). Results show transient contributions of POC to denitrification, as the spatial extent of the saline circulation cell varies over time due to changing hydrologic factors. A decrease in POC retardation and an increase in tidal amplitude during POC deposition resulted in POC expansion, which increased the relative contributions of POC to beach reactivity. Decreased hydraulic conductivity and increased tidal amplitude post-deposition decreased the utilization of POC for denitrification by allowing the oxic, saline water to completely encompass the pool of POC. Results highlight that POC is an intermittently utilized source of carbon that displays complex spatial relationships with groundwater flow conditions and overall beach biogeochemistry. This work demonstrates that POC may be a periodically important but overlooked contributor to biogeochemical reactions in carbon-poor beach aquifers.

AB This work advances a unified approach to process-based hydrologic modeling, which we term the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA). The modeling framework, introduced in the companion paper, uses a general set of conservation equations with flexibility in the choice of process parameterizations (closure relationships) and spatial architecture. This second paper specifies the model equations and their spatial approximations, describes the hydrologic and biophysical process parameterizations currently supported within the framework, and illustrates how the framework can be used in conjunction with multivariate observations to identify model improvements and future research and data needs. The case studies illustrate the use of SUMMA to select among competing modeling approaches based on both observed data and theoretical considerations. Specific examples of preferable modeling approaches include the use of physiological methods to estimate stomatal resistance, careful specification of the shape of the within-canopy and below-canopy wind profile, explicitly accounting for dust concentrations within the snowpack, and explicitly representing distributed lateral flow processes. Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation. This emphasizes that improvements in model fidelity require a sagacious choice of both process parameterizations and model parameters. In conclusion, we envisage that SUMMA can facilitate ongoing model development efforts, the diagnosis and correction of model structural errors, and improved characterization of model uncertainty.

AB A long-standing challenge for hydrologists has been a lack of observational data on global-scale basin hydrological behavior. With observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, hydrologists are now able to study terrestrial water storage for large river basins (>200,000 km(2)), with monthly time resolution. Here we provide results of a time series model of basin-averaged GRACE terrestrial water storage anomaly and Global Precipitation Climatology Project precipitation for the world's largest basins. We address the short (10 year) length of the GRACE record by adopting a parametric spectral method to calculate frequency-domain transfer functions of storage response to precipitation forcing and then generalize these transfer functions based on large-scale basin characteristics, such as percent forest cover and basin temperature. Among the parameters tested, results show that temperature, soil water-holding capacity, and percent forest cover are important controls on relative storage variability, while basin area and mean terrain slope are less important. The derived empirical relationships were accurate (0.54 <= E-f <= 0.84) in modeling global-scale water storage anomaly time series for the study basins using only precipitation, average basin temperature, and two land-surface variables, offering the potential for synthesis of basin storage time series beyond the GRACE observational period. Such an approach could be applied toward gap filling between current and future GRACE missions and for predicting basin storage given predictions of future precipitation.

AB The precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction have a variety of potential uses in flood forecasting and reservoir operation, but suffer from relatively poor performance due to the uncertainty of the hydrometeorological system. In this study, the control forecasts of four global weather centres were selected and assessed against the measured data using several verification metrics during the flood season (May-September) over the Shihe River catchment in the Huaihe River basin of China. The results show that the daily rainfall forecasts have low prediction ability and cannot meet the demand of reservoir regulation. To describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts for the safety of flood control, a new model was proposed using fuzzy probability and Bayesian theory on the basis of the generalized probability density function (GPDF). The performance of the new model is examined by using various probability measures and compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather centres. It is proved that the fuzzy Bayesian model can generate the conditional probability distribution of actual precipitation from a single predicted value based on the historical observation and forecast data, and has strong generalization ability. Compared with the ensemble forecasts, although the fuzzy Bayesian model shows a slightly improvement in accuracy, it has better performance in sharpness and reliability. Meanwhile, the new model is easy to update with new samples by modifying its likelihood function, which is favourable for real-time reservoir regulation. In addition, the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast was analysed with the model in different lead times. Generally, the uncertainty increases with the growth of lead time, and the probability distribution of the rainfall forecast within 3 days is an acceptable result for a risk and benefit analysis of the flood control system. To be more specific, a fuzzy Bayesian model based on the GPDF is an efficient way to generate the probability distribution of the precipitation with forecast data for the uncertainty analysis, and makes it possible to provide a reference for reservoir managers to plan regulation strategies with a lead time of at least 3 days.

AB Fractures have been recently identified in potential host rock for high level nuclear waste disposal, like indurated argilite formations. These fractures appear as potential rapid pathways for radionuclides transport and hydrodynamic properties of the transport inside these systems must thus be characterized. Miscible non-sorbing and sorbing tracers displacements were performed on a 2-D model derived from a real fracture geometry observed in the Tournemire argilite formation with a lattice-gas cellular automaton (LGA). LGA was shown to easily handle the complex geometry of such a fracture. The numerical breakthrough curves obtained were inverted with the 1-D CDE and MIM transport models. Two main conclusions were drawn: (i) at the length scale of the study, the non-sorbing tracer transport in our fracture geometry was more accurately interpreted in terms of the MIM model rather than in terms of the classical CDE model; (ii) in order to correctly model the sorbing tracers migration, the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient value was found to increase with the increase of the retardation factor. A semi-empirical relation based on the Taylor-Aris theory was then used to describe this dependency. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new method of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based tracer tests using RGB (red, green, blue) images was developed in order to acquire the spatio-temporal concentration distribution of tracer clouds in open channel flows. Tracer tests using Rhodamine WT were conducted to collect the RGB images using a commercial digital camera mounted on a UAV, and the concentration of Rhodamine WT using in-situ fluorometric probes. The correlation analysis showed that the in-situ measured concentrations of Rhodamine WT were strongly correlated with the digital number (DN) of the RGB images, even though the response of DN to the concentration was spatially heterogeneous. The empirical relationship between the DN values and the Rhodamine WT concentration data was estimated using artificial neural network (ANN) models. The trained ANN models, which consider the effect of water depth and river bed, accurately retrieved the detailed spatio-temporal concentration distributions of all study areas that had an R-2 higher than 0.9. The acquired spatio-temporal concentration distributions by the proposed method based on the UAV images gave general as well as detailed views of the tracer cloud moving dynamically in open channel flows that cannot be easily observed using conventional in-situ measurements.

AB Understanding hydrological processes occurring within a basin by looking at its outlet hydrograph can improve and foster comprehension of ungauged regions. In this context, we present an extensive examination of the roles that floodplains play on driving hydrograph shapes. Observations of many river hydrographs with large floodplain influence are carried out and indicate that a negative skewness of the hydrographs is present among many of them. Through a series of numerical experiments and analytical reasoning, we show how the relationship between flood wave celerity and discharge in such systems is responsible for determining the hydrograph shapes. The more water inundates the floodplains upstream of the observed point, the more negatively skewed is the observed hydrograph. A case study is performed in the Amazon River Basin, where major rivers with large floodplain attenuation (e.g., Purus, Madeira, and Jurua) are identified with higher negative skewness in the respective hydrographs. Finally, different wetland types could be distinguished by using this feature, e.g., wetlands maintained by endogenous processes, from wetlands governed by overbank flow (along river floodplains). A metric of hydrograph skewness was developed to quantify this effect, based on the time derivative of discharge. Together with the skewness concept, it may be used in other studies concerning the relevance of floodplain attenuation in large, ungauged rivers, where remote sensing data (e.g., satellite altimetry) can be very useful.

AB Water resources within large-scale fractured aquifers are typically evaluated using continuum models. While any arbitrary scale of continuum can be imposed to represent fracture architecture, using the representative elementary volume eliminates errors that result from estimating network connectivity. In traditional theory, representative elementary scales ( RES) are equal in magnitude and geometry throughout a domain and are normally determined using a structural indicator such as porosity or effective hydraulic conductivity. We present a fluid-based methodology, analyzing scale-dependent energy variation, to estimate RES using relatively low cost, readily available hydraulic head data. Hydraulic head predictions of RES (HYRES) reveal a spatial variation in elementary scale consistent with the flow field and fracture architecture. Porosity predictions of RES (PORRES) incorporate the structural effect of disconnected fracture regions but do not account for fluid behavior. RES estimated from hydraulic conductivity (KRES) are sensitive to fracture connectivity, which controls fluid movement, but are difficult to quantify because of scale and spatial variability. HYRES may be the superior approach for evaluating water resources because it is sensitive to fracture connectivity and avoids complications with scale and spatially dependent averaging. Our method is sensitive to fracture density, clustering, connectivity, and flow direction, but is insensitive to the magnitude of hydraulic gradient. HYRES is a novel approach to estimating spatially variable RES that improves water resource evaluation and flow characterization in fractured aquifers.

AB While the significance of leaf transpiration (f(e)) on carbon and water cycling is rarely disputed, conflicting evidence has been reported on how increasing mean wind speed (U) impacts f(e) from leaves. Here, conditions promoting enhancement or suppression of f(e) with increasing U for a wide range of environmental conditions are explored numerically using leaf-level gas exchange theories that combine a stomatal conductance model based on optimal water use strategies (maximizing the 'net' carbon gain at a given f(e)), energy balance considerations, and biochemical demand for CO2. The analysis showed monotonic increases in f(e) with increasing U at low light levels. However, a decline in modeled f(e) with increasing U were predicted at high light levels but only in certain instances. The dominant mechanism explaining this decline in modeled f(e) with increasing U is a shift from evaporative cooling to surface heating at high light levels. New and published sap flow measurements for potted Pachira macrocarpo and Messerschmidia argemea plants conducted in a wind tunnel across a wide range of U (2 - 8 m s(-1)) and two different soil moisture conditions were also employed to assess how f(e) varies with increasing U. The radiative forcing imposed in the wind tunnel was only restricted to the lower end of expected field conditions. At this low light regime, the findings from the wind tunnel experiments were consistent with the predicted trends. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Various types of porous media materials inherently contain pore structures of different scales, ranging from nanoscale to millimeter scale. Due to the limitations of the existing imaging technology, it is challenging and intractable for any single method to obtain and characterize the multiscale pore structure features of porous media accurately and comprehensively. To address the issue, according to the inherent logical correspondence and mutual conversion relationship between different-scale image pixels, we propose an improved universal fusion algorithm for constructing three-dimensional (3D) multiscale porous media. We successfully applied this algorithm to the construction of multiscale pore structure model of carbonate rock, sandstone and coal, and subsequently made quantitative extractions and characterizations of their pore structure characteristics. In addition, the finite element method (FEM) was used to calculate their absolute permeability. The results show that the improved fusion algorithm can effectively solve the problem of pore bias of the existing algorithm, which reduces the porosity of the multiscale model to a certain extent, while maintaining good pore interconnectivity. Besides, the multiscale model obtained by the improved fusion algorithm has a wider pore size distribution interval than that of the existing algorithm, and the absolute permeability of the former, computed using the FEM, is closer to the laboratory-measured value than that of the latter.

AB Realistic modeling of discontinuous overland flow on irregular topographic surfaces has been proven to be a challenge. This study is aimed to develop a new modeling framework to simulate the discontinuous puddle-to-puddle (P2P) overland flow dynamics for infiltrating surfaces with various microtopographic characteristics. In the P2P model, puddles were integrated in a well-delineated, cascaded drainage system to facilitate explicit simulation of their dynamic behaviors and interactions. Overland flow and infiltration were respectively simulated by using the diffusion wave model and a modified Green-Ampt model for the DEM-derived flow drainage network that consisted of a series of puddle-based units (PBUs). The P2P model was tested by using a series of data from laboratory overland flow experiments for various microtopography, soil, and rainfall conditions. The modeling results indicated that the hierarchical relationships and microtopographic properties of puddles significantly affected their connectivity, filling-spilling dynamics, and the associated threshold flow. Surface microtopography and rainfall characteristics also exhibited strong influences on the spatio-temporal distributions of infiltration rates, runoff fluxes, and unsaturated flow. The model tests demonstrated its applicability in simulating microtopography-dominated overland flow on infiltrating surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an optimal regulation programme, grey fuzzy stochastic dynamic programming (GFSDP), for reservoir operation. It is composed of a grey system, fuzzy theory and dynamic programming. The grey system represents data by covering the whole range without loss of generality, and the fuzzy arithmetic takes charge of the rules of reservoir operation. The GFSDP deals with the multipurpose decision-making problem by fuzzy optimization theorem. The practicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on the operation of the Shiman reservoir in Taiwan. The current M5 operating rule curves of this reservoir also are evaluated. The simulation results demonstrate that this new approach, in comparison with the M5 rule curves, has superior performance with regard to the total water deficit and number of monthly deficits.

AB To our knowledge, no one has examined the canopy conductance of a Cryptomeria japonica plantation, although such forests are very common in Japan. We plan to examine the canopy conductance of a Cryptomeria japonica plantation (canopy height 8 in) based on 1-year sap-flow data using the simplified Penman-Monteith equation. This study examines the effect of the aerodynamic control of transpiration before calculating canopy conductance using the simplified Penman-Monteith equation, because the equation assumes that the effect of aerodynamic control is negligible. To examine the effect of aerodynamic control, we examined the dependency of the relationship between the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and transpiration on wind speed, when solar radiation, air temperature, and soil water content do not limit transpiration greatly. The relationship between VPD and the heat pulse velocity measured 11 m above the ground was dependent on wind speed only when the wind speed was < 0.7 m s(-1). This suggests that the effect of aerodynamic control was negligible when the wind speed was >= 0.7 in s(-1), but that the effect was not negligible when the wind speed was < 0.7 m s(-1). Therefore, we should use data from when the wind speed was >= 0.7 in s(-1) for calculating canopy conductance G(c), based on the simplified Penman-Monteith equation. Although this criterion is site specific, the methods used to develop it are applicable to other sites. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper deals with the simulation of inundated areas for a region of 84,000 km(2) from estimated flood discharges at a resolution of 2 m. We develop a modeling framework that enables efficient parallel processing of the project region by splitting it into simulation tiles. For each simulation tile, the framework automatically calculates all input data and boundary conditions required for the hydraulic simulation on-the-fly. A novel method is proposed that ensures regionally consistent flood peak probabilities. Instead of simulating individual events, the framework simulates effective hydrographs consistent with the flood quantiles by adjusting streamflow at river nodes. The model accounts for local effects from buildings, culverts, levees, and retention basins. The two-dimensional full shallow water equations are solved by a second-order accurate scheme for all river reaches in Austria with catchment sizes over 10 km(2), totaling 33,380 km. Using graphics processing units (GPUs), a single NVIDIA Titan RTX simulates a period of 3 days for a tile with 50 million wet cells in less than 3 days. We find good agreement between simulated and measured stage-discharge relationships at gauges. The simulated flood hazard maps also compare well with local high-quality flood maps, achieving critical success index scores of 0.6-0.79.

AB Links between climate variability modes, rainfall, and streamflow are important for understanding the trajectories of change and dynamics in water availability. In this study, we examined the influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, Southern Annular Mode, and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation modes on interannual variations in rainfall and streamflow in four hydroclimate regions. We also explored the link between climate variability modes and extreme rainfall and streamflow years. Climate mode indices, rainfall, and streamflow data from 1975 to 2018 were analyzed for 92 predominately forested catchments located across temperate Australia. Climate modes had divergent influences on streamflow and rainfall between and within regions. Across temperate Australia, a higher proportion of interannual variation in rainfall was explained by climate modes than for streamflow, indicating factors other than atmosphere-ocean phenomena are important in determining interannual streamflow variability. Extremes in rainfall and streamflow across regions were related to the co-occurrence of climate modes, with a stronger relationship between teleconnections and low rainfall/streamflow years than high rainfall/streamflow years. The study provides new insights into the regional drivers of hydrological extremes and consolidates our understanding of the role of teleconnections on water availability in the temperate zone of Australia.

AB Monitoring the snow water equivalent (SWE) is critical to effective management of water resources in many parts of the world that depend on the mountain snowpack for water storage. There are currently no methods to remotely sense SWE with accuracy over large lateral distances in the steep and often forested terrain of mountain basins. Previous studies have shown that measurements of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) velocity can provide accurate estimates of SWE in dry snow. Introduction of liquid water into the snowpack results in a three-phase system that cannot be accurately characterized with GPR velocity alone. We show that measuring the frequency-dependent GPR signal attenuation and velocity provides a direct estimate of the complex dielectric permittivity. Because the imaginary component is a function only of liquid water content, we can utilize both the real and imaginary components of the permittivity to estimate liquid water content, snow density, and SWE using existing empirical relationships that are valid in the pendular regime. We tested this new method at two field sites and found that the estimates were accurate to within 12% of gravimetric methods in both a moist and a dry snowpack. GPR has the potential to provide SWE estimates across large lateral distances over a broad range of snow conditions.

   HILLSIDES
AB Analysis with a three-dimensional variably saturated groundwater flow model provides a basic understanding of the interplay between streams and perched groundwater. A simplified, layered model of heterogeneity was used to explore these relationships. Base flow contribution from perched groundwater was evaluated with regard to varying hydrogeologic conditions, including the size and location of the fine-sediment unit and the hydraulic conductivity of the fine-sediment unit and surrounding coarser sediment. Simulated base flow was sustained by perched groundwater with a maximum monthly discharge in excess of 15 L/s (0.6 feet(3)/s) over the length of the 2000-m stream reach. Generally, the rate of perched-groundwater discharge to the stream was proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of sediment surrounding the stream, whereas the duration of discharge was proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of the fine-sediment unit. Other aspects of the perched aquifer affected base flow, such as the depth of stream penetration and the size of the fine-sediment unit. Greater stream penetration decreased the maximum base flow contribution but increased the duration of contribution. Perched groundwater provided water for riparian vegetation at the demand rate but reduced the duration of perched-groundwater discharge nearly 75%.

AB A variety of formulae has been developed to predict bed load transport in gravel bed rivers, ranging from simple regressions to complex multiparameter formulations. The ability to test these formulae across numerous field sites has, until recently, been hampered by a paucity of bed load transport data for gravel bed rivers. We use 2104 bed load transport observations in 24 gravel bed rivers in Idaho to assess the performance of eight different formulations of four bed load transport equations. Results show substantial differences in performance but no consistent relationship between formula performance and degree of calibration or complexity. However, formulae containing a transport threshold typically exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, we find that the transport data are best described by a simple power function of discharge. From this we propose a new bed load transport equation and identify channel and watershed characteristics that control the exponent and coefficient of the proposed power function. We find that the exponent is principally a factor of supply-related channel armoring (transport capacity in excess of sediment supply), whereas the coefficient is related to drainage area (a surrogate for absolute sediment supply). We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed power function at 17 independent test sites.

AB Numerical simulations examine the migration, entrapment, and mass recovery behaviour of DNAPLs in aquifer systems with coupled textural and wettability variations. Permeability fields of varying degrees of heterogeneity (i.e., differing sigma(In(k))(2)) were generated with sequential Gaussian simulation, using geostatistical parameters derived from core grain size measurements in a sandy glacial outwash aquifer. Organic-wet mass fraction, a representative metric for wettability, was correlated to porous media permeability. A multiphase flow simulator incorporating wettability-dependent constitutive relationships for capillary behaviour is used to generate residual saturation distributions for tetrachloroethene (PCE) spill events in these synthetic aquifers. Simulated saturation distributions then serve as initial conditions for compositional simulations of PCE dissolution, to examine the effect of coupled wettability and permeability variations on DNAPL mass recovery. Simulations reveal considerable differences in predicted depth of organic liquid penetration, extent of vertical spreading, and magnitude of maximum entrapped saturation for the various modeled scenarios. These differences are directly linked to observable variations in effluent concentration and mass recovery predictions in the aqueous phase flushing simulations. Results suggest that mass recovery behaviour may be highly realization dependent and not closely correlated with geostatistical parameters. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The complementary principle, which was first proposed by Bouchet (1963), illustrates a complementary relationship among the actual evaporation, the potential evaporation, and the apparent potential evaporation. It has generated increasing attention for estimating evaporation by using only routinely observed meteorological variables (radiation, wind speed, air temperature, and humidity) without complex surface property parameters. However, this principle still poses great challenges because of the underlying uncertainties in estimating its critical parameter, namely, asymmetric parameterb. In this study, we adopted a sigmoid generalized complementary function and utilized the eddy covariance (EC) data from 217 sites around the world to determinebvalues in different ecosystems and their correlation with environmental factors. We foundbhas a mean value of 6.01 +/- 0.08. The asymmetric parameterbis small in dry regions (i.e., the desert ecosystem, 0.42 +/- 0.02) and increases as the land surface wetness improves. The ecosystem mean air temperature and vapor pressure deficit have negative correlations withb(Pearson correlation coefficients are -0.57 and -0.52, respectively), and the mean soil water content has a positive correlation withb(0.69). Besides, the sigmoid function has a favorable capability in estimating evaporation no matter based on the site-specificbvalues or the ecosystem meanbvalues. The ecosystem meanbvalues given in the current study also perform acceptably in the independent verifications, indicating these values can be applied extendedly for regional and global studies.

AB The accumulation of salts in soils adversely influences plant growth and biological activity resulting in loss of yields and soil ecosystem services. Water table depth plays an important role on solute distribution through the unsaturated zone. We focus on the relationship between saline water evaporation from soil surfaces and water table depths. When the water table was hydraulically connected to the surface, we found more evaporatively driven sodium chloride precipitation at the surface with deeper water tables relative to shallow ones. We attribute this result to lower surface water contents that reach solubility limit sooner and support an expanding salt crust. Thermal imaging confirmed that when surface is hydraulically connected to the water table, capillary flows through the porous precipitated salt maintain the evaporative flux. Macroscopic continuum-scale numerical simulations demonstrate higher solute concentration closer to the surface in the case of deeper water tables supporting the microscopic picture attributed to fewer evaporation and solute deposition sites at the surface with deeper water tables. Insights from the laboratory-scale experiments and numerical studies were used to describe soil salinity at much larger scales. We employed two global-scale databases for topsoil salinity, soil texture, and water table depths to link our laboratory-scale findings with long-term and field-scale observations. The results illustrate the importance of pore-scale physics and processes on constraining the field-scale responses.

AB We present a pore-scale study of two-phase relative permeability in homogenous-wet porous media, and porous media altered to a mixed-wet state. A Shan-Chen type multicomponent lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is employed to determine pore-scale fluid distributions and relative permeability. Mixed-wet states are created by altering the wettability of solid surfaces in contact with the nonwetting phase at the end of steady state simulation of initially homogenous-wet porous media. To ensure accurate representation of fluid-solid interfacial areas, we compare LB simulation results to experimental measurements of interfacial fluid-fluid and fluid-solid areas determined by X-ray computed microtomography imaging of water and oil distributions in bead packs. The LB simulations are found to match experimental trends observed for fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfacial area-saturation relationships. The relative permeability of both fluids in the homogenous-wet porous media was found to decrease with a decreasing contact angle. The relative permeability of both fluids in the altered, mixed-wet porous media was found to decrease for all mixed-wet states in comparison to the initial homogenous-wet states. The nonwetting phase relative permeability decreased significantly, while the wetting phase experienced only a minor decrease. The significance of the decrease was found to be dependent on the distribution of the unaltered solid surfaces, with less dependence on the severity of alteration.

AB [1] The spatial sources and delivery mechanisms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to streams are poorly understood. We examined the relationship between storm DOC dynamics, catchment landscape units, and catchment scale to elucidate controls on DOC export dynamics at the Maimai watersheds, a group of highly responsive, steep, wet catchments located on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Specifically, we address the controls on the characteristic hysteresis in DOC export dynamics (i.e., DOC concentrations higher on the rising than falling limb of the discharge hydrograph) previously ascribed to a flushing mechanism. We found that during the storm event, the proportion of riparian runoff was larger on the rising than falling limb of the hydrograph, while the proportion of hillslope runoff was smaller on the rising than falling limb of the hydrograph. The delayed response of hillslope runoff resulted in a disconnection between hillslope and riparian areas early in the event and higher DOC concentrations on the rising limb than the falling limb of the event hydrograph. Later in the event, hillslope and riparian areas became connected once the hillslope soil moisture deficits were satisfied. We suggest that the relative timing of riparian and hillslope source contributions and the connections and disconnections of dominant runoff contributing areas are the first-order catchment controls on stream DOC concentrations and mass export.

AB Natural ecosystems in the region of the lower Tarim River in northwestern China strongly deteriorated since the 1950s due to an expanding desertification. As a result, the downstream Tarim River reaches became permanently dry land. This historical evolution in land-use change is typically the result of the anthropogenic impact on natural ecosystems. On the basis of a spatially distributed hydrological catchment model bidirectionally linked with a fully hydrodynamic MIKE11 river model, land-use changes characterized by historical changes in leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation, as well as the evolution of irrigated surface areas, can be causally related to changes in water resources (groundwater storage and surface water resources). An increased surface area of irrigated (agricultural) land, together with a majority of inefficient irrigation methods, did lead to a strong increase of water resources consumption of the farmlands located in the upper Tarim River area. Evidently, this evolution influenced available water resources downstream in the Tarim basin. As a result, farmland has been gradually relocated to the upstream regions. This has led to reduced flows from the upper Tarim stream, which subsequently accelerated the dropping of the groundwater level downstream in the basin. This study moreover demonstrates that land surface biomass changes (cumulative LAI) along the lower Tarim River are strongly related to the changes in groundwater storage.

AB In this paper, a computational model for the simulation of coupled hydromechanical and electrokinetic flow in fractured porous media is introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling CO2 flow in a deformed, fractured geological formation and the associated electrokinetic flow. The governing field equations are derived based on the averaging theory and the double porosity model. They are solved numerically with a mixed discretization scheme, formulated on the basis of the standard Galerkin finite element method, the extended finite element method, the level-set method and the Petrov-Galerkin method. The standard Galerkin method is utilized to discretize the equilibrium and the diffusive dominant field equations, and the extended finite element method, together with the level-set method and the Petrov-Galerkin method, are utilized to discretize the advective dominant field equations. The level-set method is employed to trace the CO2 plume front, and the extended finite element method is employed to model the high gradient in the saturation field front. The proposed mixed discretization scheme leads to a convergent system, giving a stable and effectively mesh-independent model. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated by verification and numerical examples. Effects of the fracture spacing on the CO2 flow and the streaming potential are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experimental data obtained for particle transport in downward and upward flows in smooth and rough porous media are analyzed at various flow rates. The data analysis and interpretation are aided through an analytical model with linear kinetics that assumes two sites for particle deposition within a medium, namely, reversible and irreversible, together with a dual mode of irreversible deposition. The bimodal particle transport model is obtained using the Green's function method and is capable of fitting, with reasonable accuracy, the observed transport and deposition behavior of particles. Approximations for advection-dominated flows are also obtained that could represent a simplified modeling tool. Expressions of the temporal moments are developed and algebraic equations are derived that express the model parameters in terms of the moments of the measured particle concentration distributions. The transport models helped define the relationship of the modeled parameters to flow velocity and media roughness. The fitting results show that the parameters for rough and smooth media vary in a systematic way with the pore fluid velocity. The results also reveal that flow direction has a significant influence on the mode and magnitude of irreversible particle deposition for the conditions investigated. For the same seepage velocity, the rate of particle deposition is greater for upward flows than for downward flows. Moreover, roughness effects increase the irreversible particle deposition in downward flows but have little effect in upward flows.

AB The conceptual model of hyporheic exchange below river steps may oversimplify exchange flow paths if it depicts a uniform pattern of downstream-directed upwelling. This research used nonmobile, porous bed flume experiments and hydrodynamic simulation (CFD) to characterize hyporheic flow paths below a river step with a hydraulic jump. Bed slope was 1%, step height was 4 cm, downstream flow depth was 4 cm, substrate was 1 cm median diameter gravel, and hydraulic jump length was 25 cm in the flume and CFD experiments. With the hydraulic jump, flow paths changed to include downwelling beneath the water plunging into the pool and upstream-directed upwelling at the base of the step and beneath the length of jump. Failure to represent the influence of static and dynamic pressures associated with hydraulic jumps leads to erroneous prediction of subsurface flow paths in 75% of the streambed beneath the jump. A refined conceptual model for hyporheic flow paths below a step with a hydraulic jump includes reversed hyporheic circulation cells, in which downwelling water moves upstream and then upwells, and flow reversals, in which the larger flow net of downstream-directed upwelling encounters a nested flow path of upstream-directed upwelling. Heterogeneity in hyporheic flow paths at hydraulic jumps has the potential to explain field-observed mosaics in streambed redox patterns and expand structure-function relationships used in river management and restoration.

AB The difference between average pressures of two immiscible fluids is commonly assumed to be the same as macroscopic capillary pressure, which is considered to be a function of saturation only. However, under transient conditions, a dependence of this pressure difference on the time rate of saturation change has been observed by many researchers. This is commonly referred to as dynamic capillarity effect. As a first-order approximation, the dynamic term is assumed to be linearly dependent on the time rate of change of saturation, through a material coefficient denoted by . In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out to quantify the dynamic capillarity effect in an unsaturated sandy soil. Primary, main, and scanning drainage experiments, under both static and dynamic conditions, were performed on a sandy soil in a small cell. The value of the dynamic capillarity coefficient was calculated from the air-water pressure differences and average saturation values during static and dynamic drainage experiments. We found a dependence of on saturation, which showed a similar trend for all drainage conditions. However, at any given saturation, the value of for primary drainage was larger than the value for main drainage and that was in turn larger than the value for scanning drainage. Each data set was fit a simple log-linear equation, with different values of fitting parameters. This nonuniqueness of the relationship between and saturation and possible causes is discussed.

AB Under transient flow conditions, the groundwater age distribution (GAD) is affected by both the physical characteristics of the aquifer, such as the hydraulic conductivity field, and the past temporal flow variations. Therefore, measuring the concentration of single or multiple tracers in a water sample collected at one time does not provide sufficient information on the transient nature of groundwater flows. However, obtaining multiple tracers at different times may contain such information. To find the temporal relationship between the GADs at a certain location, and to gain understanding about the current characteristics of an aquifer using environmental tracers, it is useful to separate the effects of temporal flow variations from that of the aquifer structure. In this paper, a new approach is presented, aiming at establishing a link between a reference residence time distribution based on steady-state flow and the transient age distributions at different times. Such information allows us to look collectively at sets of tracers measured at different times, when inferring aquifer structure and temporal trends in flow. The potential of using multiple tracers collected at different times to infer the GAD and its temporal variations is shown through two demonstration cases where measurements of CFCs, SF6, and Kr-85 in hypothetical water samples are used to infer the overall temporal flow pattern in the aquifer. Bayesian inverse modeling via Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was used to estimate lumped-parameter groundwater ages and temporal flow patterns.

AB A geostatistical framework is proposed to downscale daily precipitation and temperature. The methodology is based on multiple-point geostatistics (MPS), where a multivariate training image is used to represent the spatial relationship between daily precipitation and daily temperature over several years. Here the training image consists of daily rainfall and temperature outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 50 and 10 km resolution for a 20 year period ranging from 1985 to 2004. The data are used to predict downscaled climate variables for the year 2005. The result, for each downscaled pixel, is daily time series of precipitation and temperature that are spatially dependent. Comparison of predicted precipitation and temperature against a reference data set indicates that both the seasonal average climate response together with the temporal variability are well reproduced. The explicit inclusion of time dependence is explored by considering the climate properties of the previous day as an additional variable. Comparison of simulations with and without inclusion of time dependence shows that the temporal dependence only slightly improves the daily prediction because the temporal variability is already well represented in the conditioning data. Overall, the study shows that the multiple-point geostatistics approach is an efficient tool to be used for statistical downscaling to obtain local-scale estimates of precipitation and temperature from General Circulation Models.

TI Identification of hydrologic indicators related to fish diversity and
   abundance: A data mining approach for fish community analysis
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RIVER; WATER; FLOW; MANAGEMENT
AB [1] This paper develops a new approach to identify hydrologic indicators related to fish community and generate a quantitative function between an ecological target index and the identified hydrologic indicators. The approach is based on genetic programming ( GP), a data mining method. Using the Shannon Index ( a fish community diversity index) or the number of individuals ( total abundance) of a fish community, as an ecological target, the GP identified the most ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators ( ERHIs) from 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration, for the case study site, the upper Illinois River. Robustness analysis showed that different GP runs found a similar set of ERHIs; each of the identified ERHI from different GP runs had a consistent relationship with the target index. By comparing the GP results with those from principal component analysis and autecology matrix, the three approaches identified a small number ( six) of common ERHIs. Particularly, the timing of low flow ( D-min) seems to be more relevant to the diversity of the fish community, while the magnitude of the low flow ( Q(b)) is more relevant to the total fish abundance; large rising rates result in a significant improvement of fish diversity, which is counterintuitive and against previous findings. The quantitative function developed by GP was further used to construct an indicator impact matrix ( IIM), which was demonstrated as a potentially useful tool for streamflow restoration design.

AB [1] Organic liquid saturation distributions resulting from a simulated tetrachloroethene (PCE) spill were generated with alternative models of spatially varying aquifer properties for a statistically homogeneous, nonuniform sand aquifer. The distributions were analyzed to quantify DNAPL source zone characteristics and then incorporated as initial conditions for simulated PCE recovery using surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation ( SEAR). The predicted evolution of the spatial distribution of DNAPL saturations or source zone "architectures'' and associated remediation efficiencies are strongly influenced by the spatial correlation of aquifer parameters and multiphase flow constitutive relationships. Model predictions suggest that removal of 60 to 99% of entrapped PCE can reduce dissolved contaminant concentration and mass flux under natural gradient conditions by approximately two orders of magnitude. Aqueous phase contaminant flux, however, does not vary consistently as a function of the percentage of DNAPL removed, and notable differences in flux evolution were observed for models incorporating correlated versus uncorrelated capillary entry pressure and permeability fields. Simulation results demonstrate that the application of alternative models of aquifer parameter spatial variability can influence predicted DNAPL infiltration, entrapment, and recovery, even for relatively homogeneous aquifers of the type investigated here. Results also demonstrate potential benefits, in the form of reduced mass flux, accruing from partial mass removal that may not be readily predicted from analyses relying on simplified conceptual models for DNAPL source zone architecture or aquifer flow fields.

AB We investigate the interaction of strongly non linear internal solitary waves (ISWs) with boundaries having different slopes by means of high-resolution 3D large Eddy Simulations (LES). Releasing a volume of fresh water into a stratified ambient fluid, three different breaking mechanisms are produced: plunging, collapsing and surging breakers. The different shoaling dynamics affect the ISW evolution over the sloping boundary, inducing different effects on the bottom. In order to investigate the effects of the ISW breaking on the inclined surface, we calculate the bed shear stress and estimate the local flux of sediments entrained from the bed. We analyze the relationship between the breaking criteria and the related effects on the sloping surface. Although plunging breakers are expected to induce significant effects within the fluid, causing larger amount of mixing and fluid entrainment, the effects on the bottom are totally opposite. The collapsing breaker mechanism, indeed, generates boundary layer separation, which in turn induces whirling instabilities. Results show that the ISW interaction with the inclined surface occurs in its close proximity for collapsing breaker mechanism, which explains why the largest bed shear stresses and sediment re-suspension are predicted in the simulation where a collapsing breaker mechanism is observed.

AB A period-of-record flow duration curve (FDC) represents the relationship between the magnitude and frequency of daily streamflows. Prediction of FDCs is of great importance for locations characterized by sparse or missing streamflow observations. We present a detailed comparison of two methods which are capable of predicting an FDC at ungauged basins: (1) an adaptation of the geostatistical method, Top-kriging, employing a linear weighted average of dimensionless empirical FDCs, standardised with a reference streamflow value; and (2) regional multiple linear regression of streamflow quantiles, perhaps the most common method for the prediction of FDCs at ungauged sites. In particular, Top-kriging relies on a metric for expressing the similarity between catchments computed as the negative deviation of the FDC from a reference streamflow value, which we termed total negative deviation (TND). Comparisons of these two methods are made in 182 largely unregulated river catchments in the southeastern U.S. using a three-fold cross-validation algorithm. Our results reveal that the two methods perform similarly throughout flow-regimes, with average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies 0.566 and 0.662, (0.883 and 0.829 on log-transformed quantiles) for the geostatistical and the linear regression models, respectively. The differences between the reproduction of FDC's occurred mostly for low flows with exceedance probability (i.e. duration) above 0.98. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flow through partially frozen pores in granular media containing ice or gas hydrate plays an essential role in diverse phenomena including methane migration and frost heave. As freezing progresses, the frozen phase grows in the pore space and constricts flow paths so that the permeability decreases. Previous works have measured the relationship between permeability and volumetric fraction of the frozen phase, and various correlations have been proposed to predict permeability change in hydrology and the oil industry. However, predictions from different formulae can differ by orders of magnitude, causing great uncertainty in modeling results. We present a floating random walk method to approximate the porous flow field and estimate the effective permeability in isotropic granular media with specified particle size distributions, without solving for the entire flow field in the pore space. In packed spherical particles, the method compares favorably with the Kozeny-Carman formula. We further extend this method with a probabilistic interpretation of the volumetric fraction of the frozen phase, simulate the effect of freezing in irregular pores, and predict the evolution of permeability. Employing no adjustable parameters, our results can provide insight into the coupling between phase transitions and permeability change, which plays important roles in hydrate formation and dissociation, as well as in the thawing and freezing of permafrost and ice-bed coupling beneath glaciers.

AB [1] Episodic concentration-discharge (c-Q) plots are a popular tool for interpreting the hydrochemical response of small, forested catchments. Application of the method involves assuming an underlying conceptual model of runoff processes and comparing observed c-Q looping patterns with those predicted by the model. We analyzed and interpreted c-Q plots of acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) for 133 storms collected over a 7-year period from three catchments in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. Because of their underlying lithologies the catchments represent a gradient in both hydrologic and geochemical behavior, ranging from a flashy, acidic, poorly buffered catchment to a moderate, neutral, well-buffered catchment. The relative frequency of observed anticlockwise c-Q loops in each catchment decreased along this gradient. Discriminant function analysis indicated that prestorm base flow ANC was an important predictor of loop rotation direction; however, the strength of the predictive relationship decreased along the same gradient. The trends were consistent with several equally plausible three-component mixing models. Uncertainty regarding end-member timing and relative volume and possible time variation in end-member concentrations were key factors precluding identification of a unique model. The inconclusive results obtained on this large data set suggest that identification of underlying runoff mechanisms on the basis of a small number of c-Q plots without additional supporting evidence is likely to be misleading.

AB A modified steady state head control method was used to obtain, on identical samples, direct measurements of soil moisture retention (volumetric water content theta versus matric potential psi) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) as a function of both theta and psi. The minimum psi values for the undisturbed coarse-textured samples were as low as -400 cm, whereas the theta values were as low as 0.04. Of the 79 samples, 41 contained a high gravel fraction (>2 mm size) that ranged from 20 to 71% by weight. The remaining samples were sandy with very little gravel fraction. We examined similarities and differences between the two soil types in their retention and K(theta) slopes for the intermediate moisture regime. The retention data for the gravelly soils fell within a narrower range than for the sandy type. The water capacity (dtheta/dpsi) estimates for the two soil types showed similar variability. Although both soils are coarse-textured, important differences were noted in two integral measures for psi(theta) and K(theta) measurements. The mean and variance for the Campbell pore-size distribution parameter (b) and K(theta) slope (beta) estimates for the gravelly type were larger than those for the sandy type. A unique relation was noted between b and beta; the relationship was similar for the two soil types with a very dissimilar particle-size distribution.

ID INTRASEASONAL EXTREME RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE FREQUENCIES; ENSO INFLUENCE;

AB Daily snow water equivalent records from the snowpack telemetry archive are used to assess spatiotemporal characteristics of large snowfall events over the montane western United States. The largest mean annual (leading) events are found in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada. The mean leading event lasting up to 72 hours typically accounts for 10-23% of the water equivalent of annual snowfall, with the largest contribution in the Arizona/New Mexico sector. For most of the West, snowfall events In the top quartile of station distributions are most common during midwinter, but those for the Rocky Mountain states and Utah are more common during late winter or spring. Colorado also shows a secondary peak in large events during November. Large midwinter snowfall events in the marine sectors, Idaho, and Arizona/New Mexico are spatially coherent in that when observed at one station, they tend to occur at surrounding stations. Large events are less spatially coherent for drier inland regions. When annual snowfall is anomalously positive, there tends to be an increase in the number of snow days as well as a shift in the distributions toward the larger event sizes. Opposite relationships are observed for negative annual snowfall anomalies. These findings are in accord with recent studies using lower elevation data, demonstrating that the probability of extreme precipitation events is altered during El Nine or La Nina conditions.

AB The purpose of this paper is to identify simple connections between observations of hydrological processes at the hillslope scale and observations of the response of watersheds following rainfall, with a view to building a parsimonious model of catchment processes. The focus is on the well-studied Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW), Georgia, USA. Recession analysis of discharoe Q shows that while the relationship between dQ/dt and Q is approximately consistent with a linear reservoir for the hillslope, there is a deviation from linearity that becomes progressively larger with increasing spatial scale. To account for these scale differences conceptual models of streamflow recession are defined at both the hillslope scale and the watershed scale, and an assessment made as to whether models at the hillslope scale can be aggregated to be consistent with models at the watershed scale.
   Results from this Study show that a model with parallel linear reservoirs provides the most plausible explanation (of those tested) for both the linear hillslope response to rainfall and non-linear recession behaviour observed at the watershed outlet. In this model each linear reservoir is associated with a landscape type. The parallel reservoir model is consistent with both geochemical analyses of hydrological flow paths and water balance estimates of bedrock recharge. Overall, this study demonstrates that standard approaches of using recession analysis to identify the functional form of storage-discharge relationships identify model structures that are inconsistent with field evidence, and that recession analysis at multiple spatial scales can provide useful insights into catchment behaviour.

AB We imaged the steady state flow of brine and decane in Bentheimer sandstone. We devised an experimental method based on differential imaging to examine how flow rate impacts impact the pore-scale distribution of fluids during coinjection. This allows us to elucidate flow regimes (connected, or breakup of the nonwetting phase pathways) for a range of fractional flows at two capillary numbers, Ca, namely 3.0 x 10(-7) and 7.5 x 10(-6). At the lower Ca, for a fixed fractional flow, the two phases appear to flow in connected unchanging subnetworks of the pore space, consistent with conventional theory. At the higher Ca, we observed that a significant fraction of the pore space contained sometimes oil and sometimes brine during the 1 h scan: this intermittent occupancy, which was interpreted as regions of the pore space that contained both fluid phases for some time, is necessary to explain the flow and dynamic connectivity of the oil phase; pathways of always oil-filled portions of the void space did not span the core. This phase was segmented from the differential image between the 30 wt % KI brine image and the scans taken at each fractional flow. Using the grey scale histogram distribution of the raw images, the oil proportion in the intermittent phase was calculated. The pressure drops at each fractional flow at low and high flow rates were measured by high-precision differential pressure sensors. The relative permeabilities and fractional flow obtained by our experiment at the mm-scale compare well with data from the literature on cm-scale samples.

AB Coupling global climate models, hydrologic models and extreme value analysis provides a method to forecast streamflow maxima, however the elusive variance structure of the results hinders confidence in application. Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied. The variance of maxima projections was dominated by climate model factors and extreme value analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the psychological-social drivers of water-use behavior in households is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of water-conservation strategies and subsequent environmental benefits. This study used the Behaviour Change Wheel framework to review associations between capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM) dimensions and household water-use behaviors. A meta-analysis of 88 correlation coefficients from a combined sample of 15,656 participants showed positive relationships between water-use behavior and COM dimensions. These three dimensions were statistically significant in predicting household water-use behavior, with opportunity being the most moderate predictor of water-conservation behavior (r = 0.25, p < 0.001), followed by motivation (r = 0.24, p < 0.001) and then capability (r = 0.18, p < 0.001). Collectively, these dimensions explained 37% of the variance in household water-conservation behavior. Correlation coefficients also diverged as a function of COM dimension subtypes (psychological, physical, social, reflective, and automatic) and study location, study design, and the gender of participants. Overall, the results are consistent with the Behaviour Change Wheel assertion that the integrative components of behavior are important sources of psychological-social drivers of water-use behavior. COM dimensions are useful for the identification of behaviors that influence water-use and how these may diverge depending on the water-use character of the region and environment.

AB Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are being increasingly identified as associated with some extreme floods. More generally, such floods may be associated with tropical moisture exports (TMEs) that exhibit relatively robust teleconnections between moisture source regions and flood regions. A large-scale flood event that persisted over Western Europe in January 1995 is studied here. During the last 10 days of the month, two rare flooding events, associated with heaviest rainfall in 150 years, occurred in two places, one over Brittany (West of France), and the second in the France-Germany border region and parts of neighboring countries. In this paper, we explore the month-long evolution of TMEs and their connection to the precipitation events that led to the Brittany event. The persistent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that led to the birth, death, and evolution of these TMEs as ARs with landfalls in Western Europe are identified, and the relationship of daily extreme precipitation to these patterns is examined. Singular value decomposition analysis and a generalized linear model are used to assess whether knowledge of the atmospheric circulation patterns from the prior record is useful for explaining the occurrence of their rare events. The analysis establishes the importance of both global and regional atmospheric circulation modes for the occurrence of such persistent events and the hydrologic importance of diagnosing global atmospheric moisture pathways.

AB One of the most challenging parameters in hillslope- and watershed-scale, distributed, hydrologic models is the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s). In this paper, we present a methodology to determine the hillslope- scale lateral K-s above a moderately deep sloping restrictive layer in an 18x35 m hillslope plot using perched water level measurements and drain tile outflow data. The hillslope- scale lateral K-s was compared to small-scale K-s measured with small soil cores and the Guelph permeameter. Our results show that small-scale K-s measurements underestimate the actual hillslope- scale K-s. The hillslope- scale K-s measurements were 13.7, 4.1, and 3.2 larger than small soil core measurements in the A, B, and E horizons, respectively. We argue that the gap between small-scale and hillslope- scale K-s within the same porous medium is foremost a measurement problem. Data analysis provided the K-s distribution with depth, showing a sharp decrease in K-s within the first 0.1 m of the soil and an exponential decline in K-s below 0.1 m. The distribution of K-s with depth was best described by a double-exponential relationship. Overall, results indicate the importance of macroporosity, perhaps of biological origin, in determining K-s at a hillslope scale.

AB In this study, we examine extremes of atmospheric water balance components through analyses of annual maxima of precipitable water and water vapor transport. Our analyses are grounded in Extreme Value Theory, using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution as a platform for assessing water balance extremes. Annual maxima of atmospheric water balance terms are computed from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) fields for the 40-year period extending from 1979 to 2018 on a grid of approximately 0.3-degree resolution. We assess nonstationarities in the annual maximum time series through tests for monotonic trends. Estimates of the location, scale, and shape parameters for the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution are used to examine the spatial variability of water balance extremes. We focus on estimates of the GEV shape parameter, which dictates the "thickness" of the upper tail of the distribution. Estimates of the GEV shape parameter for precipitable water generally point to bounded distributions, but clusters of unbounded, thick-tailed distributions are linked to exceptionally large record values of precipitable water associated with tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic. Larger regions of "thick-tailed" distributions are found for integrated water vapor transport (IVT). Non-stationary GEV models are used to examine the impacts of trends on extremes of the atmospheric water balance. Mixtures of rare events associated with tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones play a central role in analyses of water balance extremes.

AB Both theory and application of multispecies reactive transport for in situ groundwater bioremediation involving a vertical circulation well (VCW) are not fully understood despite its importance and common usage in aquifer remediation practices. This study proposes novel approaches including two methods for design and remediation prediction of a VCW system, which involves multispecies, multiphase, and microbially enhanced reactive transport process. One is particle-tracking method, which depicts the trajectories of particles released from an injection chamber; the other is node-dependent finite difference (NDFD) method, which describes the advection-dispersion process based on the inflow and outflow directions at each node. The numerical results demonstrate that the particle-tracking method works well by yielding a useful index, that is, the recovery ratio, which helps optimize the in situ preliminary remediation screening. When biochemical parameters, dispersivities, and in situ contaminated conditions are known after the preliminary screening, the NDFD method performs better than the conventional Laplace transform finite difference method in terms of describing multispecies reactive transport with multiple phases in a VCW system. The proposed particle-tracking method and NDFD methods are employed to elucidate different effects of factors such as injection mode, hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio, distance between injection and extraction screened intervals, and injection/extraction rate on recovery and removal ratios. Our findings suggest that both methods are effective tools for optimization and prediction of VCW remediation in an anisotropic aquifer.

AB An analytical solution is obtained for steady 2-D potential seepage flow from a nonclogged and nonlined soil channel into a highly permeable porous layer, with phreatic surfaces tapering toward a horizontal interface with a subjacent low-permeable formation. Along this boundary, a vertical component of the Darcian velocity vector equals the formation saturated hydraulic conductivity. The image of the physical flow domain in the hodograph plane is a circular polygon, a triangle or digon in a limiting case of a "phreatic jet'' impinging on the low-permeable substratum. The polygon is mapped onto an auxiliary half plane, where the complex physical coordinate and complex potential are reconstructed by the Polubarinova-Kochina method, i. e., by solution of a Riemann BVP. The seepage flow rate from the channel, free surfaces, and a saturated (water-logged) area are found for different thicknesses of the top layer, channel widths, and conductivity ratios of the two strata. In particular, the earlier results of Brock, Kirkham, and Youngs, which are based on a numerical solution, Dupuit-Forchheimer (DF) approximation, and approximate potential model, are confirmed in the full 2-D models. Sufficiently far from the channel, the phreatic surface and interface make a wedge. For a sufficiently deep substratum, three zones are analytically distinguished: an almost vertical 1-D descending flow, an almost wedge-configured 1-D flow, and an essentially 2-D zone in between, where neither a standard infiltration theory nor DF analysis are valid.

AB The situation of multiphase flow with varying salinity through rock formations with microporosity plays a key role in many applications. Experimental data for single-phase flow through rocks with microporosity show that chemical osmosis can lead to osmotic pressures in the range of several megapascal, but the effect of osmosis on multiphase flow so far has received little attention. Pore networks can be used to investigate these effects, but crucially depend on expressions for capillary entry pressures. Here we extend the classical theory for capillary entry pressures to the case where chemical potentials play a role. The inclusion of osmosis results into a capillary-osmotic pressure that also depends on salinity differences and temperature. Consequently, also the pore-scale events of piston-like displacement and snap-off depend on salinity contrasts and temperature and not only on pore geometry as has been assumed so far. Examples show that even small salinity differences can lead to significantly different entry pressures and changed pore invasion sequences compared to if osmosis is absent. We show that the ensemble behavior with osmosis often is identical to the case where the medium partly has become more water wet, which implies that osmosis might have a strong impact on laboratory-scale quantities, but also that their detection in experiments will be challenging. Hence, chemical gradients could be important drivers of multiphase flow in rocks with microporosity and should be included into flow models, which currently is not the case.

AB Describing and predicting gas and solute diffusivities and electrical and thermal conductivities under variably saturated fluid conditions are necessary for simulating gas, solute, and heat transport in soils. On the basis of comprehensive data for gas (D(p)) and solute (D(s)) diffusivities and electrical (EC) and thermal (TC) conductivities for differently textured and variably saturated soils, we investigated analogies and differences between the four parameters. At fluid (water or air) saturation, relative parameter values for D(p), D(s), and EC were all well described by an excluded- volume expansion of Archie's first law. The cementation exponent in Archie's first law was close to 1.5 for all parameters. At fluid- unsaturated conditions, relative values of D(p), D(s), and EC (normalized at fluid saturation) were well described by an excluded- volume expansion of Archie's second law. In the case of relative TC, the saturation exponent in Archie's second law was substituted by the inverse of it for the three other parameters since water bridge effects dramatically enhance the TC with increasing moisture contents in relatively dry porous media. If appropriate but different expressions for a percolation threshold in Archie's second law were applied for the four parameters, a saturation exponent value of around 2.0 generally gave accurate predictions of all four parameters for differently textured soils. Finally, the excludedvolume expansion of Archie's second law was modified to also represent porous media with bimodal pore size distribution and well- described data for D(p) and D(s) in aggregated soil.

AB The transfer and transport of a passive scalarTfrom an isolated array of circular cylinders of varying Reynolds number (Re=[100,333]) and solid fraction (0.0023 < phi < 0.3) in a uniform steady flow are investigated. This problem is an abstraction of the flow past emergent vegetation or marine aquaculture, in which passive contaminants are continuously generated. The upstream flow (T infinity=0) is uniform and incident on an array ofN(c)cylinders whose surfaces are set toTS=1. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the mean and fluctuating Nusselt number of the individual cylinders and the array as a whole. To help interpret the numerical results a mathematical model, partly based on empirical relationships, is developed to predict the transfer. The transfer of the scalar from the array was found to increase when the Reynolds number was increased. As the solid fraction is increased the transfer increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. This is due to the collective effect of all the cylinders resulting in (i) a modification of the incident flow and (ii) a reduction in the scalar gradient between the cylinder surface and the locally incident flow on individual cylinders. These effects are highly dependent on the solid fraction. Additional simulations were carried out to decompose the contribution of these two processes on the transfer of individual cylinders.

AB High-frequency in situ sensors have enabled researchers to measure solute concentrations at a time scale that captures the variability in stream discharge. We analyzed discrete samples and high-frequency time series of solutes to characterize how nitrate (NO3-) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM; a proxy for dissolved organic carbon) respond to changes in discharge at annual and intra-annual timescales across a stream network in New Hampshire, USA. NO3- and fDOM exhibited highly variable concentration-discharge (c-Q) behavior at intra-annual scales. Transport limitation, source limitation, and chemostatic behavior were observed to occur within and among years in all our study watersheds. Annual assessment of c-Q misclassified streams 31% of the time, as the annual time step missed seasonal and event-induced shifts in c-Q dynamics. In some instances, anomalous events lasting less than 5% of the year determine the annual c-Q behavior for a site. Catchment land use appeared to drive some of the variability among watersheds in c-Q relationships and their temporal variability. Forested streams had highly variable NO3- c-Q behavior and streams draining watersheds with more development had greater variability in fDOM c-Q behavior. Sample frequency impacts how hydrologic systems are characterized and extrapolating c-Q behavior from discrete samples alone can bias interpretations of c-Q dynamics and our understanding of solute transport.

AB Arctic coastal watersheds, though rarely monitored, are expected to have increased runoff, as climate models predict more precipitation in the Arctic. This study provides a synthesis of streamflow changes in watersheds of the Alaska Arctic Coastal Plain (AACP) based on available historic discharge data and water balance analysis. A comparison of annual runoff from the Putuligayuk River watershed (471 km(2)) from the period 1970-1986 (7824.1 mm/yr) to the period 1999-2015 (12249.6 mm/yr) shows increasing discharge and interannual variability. From this discontinuous record of 32 years, the three lowest runoff years occurred in 1979, 2007, and 2008, and the three highest runoff years occurred in 2003, 2014, and 2015. Other studied AACP watersheds with shorter discharge records demonstrate similar patterns of dry (2007-2008) and wet (2014-2015) years during common periods of observation. A combination of favorable antecedent surface storage conditions and above-average precipitation is required to generate large volumes of surface runoff. A strong relationship between climate, surface storage, and runoff inherent to AACP watersheds makes these systems highly responsive to sea ice retreat and hydrological intensification. Our new estimates of freshwater flux from the AACP to the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea account for an observed range of runoff variability and provide baseline data for modeling arctic hydrologic systems.

AB As changes in precipitation dynamics continue to alter the water availability in dryland ecosystems, understanding the feedbacks between the vegetation and the hydrologic cycle and their influence on the climate system is critically important. We designed a field campaign to examine the influence of two-layer soil moisture control on bare and canopy albedo dynamics in a semiarid shrubland ecosystem. We conducted this campaign during 2011 and 2012 within the tower footprint of the Santa Rita Creosote Ameriflux site. Albedo field measurements fell into one of four Cases within a two-layer soil moisture framework based on permutations of whether the shallow and deep soil layers were wet or dry. Using these Cases, we identified differences in how shallow and deep soil moisture influence canopy and bare albedo. Then, by varying the number of canopy and bare patches within a gridded framework, we explore the influence of vegetation and soil moisture on ecosystem albedo. Our results highlight the importance of deep soil moisture in land surface-atmosphere interactions through its influence on aboveground vegetation characteristics. For instance, we show how green-up of the vegetation is triggered by deep soil moisture, and link deep soil moisture to a decrease in canopy albedo. Understanding relationships between vegetation and deep soil moisture will provide important insights into feedbacks between the hydrologic cycle and the climate system.

AB The hydrological response of semiarid watersheds to short but intense rainfall events is complex due to feedbacks among water fluxes, vegetation patches, topography, and soil properties. This paper seeks to quantify the combined impact of soil-surface sealing, microtopography, and vegetation patches on surface hydrologic processes on a semiarid hillslope. A modeling approach using a two-layer conceptual infiltration model and two-dimensional surface runoff model was developed to study rainfall-runoff relationships. This combined model is applicable to heterogeneous areas with spatially varying soil properties, landscape, and land-cover characteristics. Data from a semiarid site in southern Israel was used to evaluate the model and analyze fundamental hydrologic mechanisms. Our results indicate that seal layer, microtopography, and vegetation play important roles in dry land runoff processes: seal layer controls runoff generation; vegetation patches affect overland flow by enhancing local infiltration rates; microtopography has a small impact on the total amount of runoff, but shapes the spatial pattern of overland flow. The presence of vegetation patches amplifies the effect of microtopography by increasing spatial variability of infiltration and runoff. Results also show that water resource allocation favors vegetation patches through surface runoff, with maximum local cumulative infiltration one order of magnitude higher than the amount of water available from rainfall. This suggests a sophisticated system of water resource distribution in semiarid ecosystems through complex interactions among environmental factors.

AB Numerous numerical modeling studies have been completed in support of an extensive recovery program for the endangered white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) on the Kootenai River near Bonner's Ferry, ID. A technical hurdle in the interpretation of these model results is the transfer of information from the specialist to nonspecialist such that practical decisions utilizing the numerical simulations can be made. To address this, we designed and trained a Bayesian network to provide probabilistic prediction of depth-averaged velocity. Prediction of this critical parameter governing suitable spawning habitat was obtained by exploiting the dynamic relationships between variables derived from model simulations with associated parameter uncertainties. Postdesign assessment indicates that the most influential environmental variables in order of importance are river discharge, depth, and width, and water surface slope. We demonstrate that the probabilistic network not only reproduces the training data with accuracy similar to the accuracy of a numerical model (root-mean-squared error of 0.10 m/s), but that it makes reliable predictions on the same river at times and locations other than where the network was trained (root mean squared error of 0.09 m/s). Additionally, the network showed similar skill (root mean square error of 0.04 m/s) when predicting velocity on the Apalachicola River, FL, a river of similar shape and size to the Kootenai River where a related sturgeon population is also threatened.

AB This paper introduces a thermo-hydro-mechanical computational model for freezing and thawing in porous media domains, with focus on freezing and thawing in soil. The model is formulated based on the averaging theory and discretized using a mixed discretization scheme, where the standard and extended finite element methods are simultaneously employed. It is capable of capturing the strong coupling between all important phenomena and processes occurring during relatively high freezing-thawing rates in porous media. Solid and fluid compressibility, buoyancy, phase change, thermomechanical behavior, water volume change, pores expansion, cryogenic suction, melting point depression and water migration to the freezing zone are all considered in the model. The cryogenic suction, in particular, is central to the occurrence of many of these phenomena and processes, and thus treated as a primary state variable, and discretized using the partition of unity method to make sure that it can be captured accurately. The paper presents detailed formulation of the governing equations and the numerical discretization. Verification and numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and computational capability of the model in describing the behavior of a soil mass subjected to boundary conditions resembling those occurring in the vicinity of an energy pile. The numerical examples show that the model is effectively mesh-independent and can simulate all important phenomena using relatively coarse meshes.

AB A human-made entrance to a side channel separated from the river by a longitudinal training dam can be considered a new, emergent type of river bifurcation. To understand the processes controlling the diversion of flow and sediment toward the side channel at such bifurcations, a comprehensive field monitoring program was performed in the Waal River, which is the main branch of the Rhine River in the Netherlands. Local processes govern the flow field in the bifurcation region. The angle between the main river flow and the flow into the side channel increases with decreasing lateral and longitudinal distance to the bifurcation point, which corresponds to the head of the training dam. The general flow pattern can be well reproduced with a uniform depth, potential flow model consisting of a superposition of main channel flow and lateral outflow. For submerged flow conditions over the sill, the side channel hydraulic conditions influence the exchange processes, yet free flow side weir theory describes the flow field at this bifurcation type qualitatively well. The vertical flow structure in the side channel, which governs the sediment exchange between the main channel and the side channel, is steered by the geometrical details of the sill. The presence of the sill structure is key to controlling the morphological stability of this type of bifurcation given its primary influence on bed load sediment import and exerts an indirect impact on suspended sediment exchange.

AB Floods are one of the most frequent and disruptive natural hazards that affect man. Annually, significant flood damage is documented worldwide. Flood mapping is a common preimpact flood hazard mitigation measure, for which advanced methods and tools (such as flood inundation models) are used to estimate potential flood extent maps that are used in spatial planning. However, these tools are affected, largely to an unknown degree, by both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Over the past few years, advances in uncertainty analysis with respect to flood inundation modeling show that it is appropriate to adopt Probabilistic Flood Maps (PFM) to account for uncertainty. However, the following question arises; how can probabilistic flood hazard information be incorporated into spatial planning? Thus, a consistent framework to incorporate PFMs into the decision-making is required. In this paper, a novel methodology based on Decision-Making under Uncertainty theories, in particular Value of Information (VOI) is proposed. Specifically, the methodology entails the use of a PFM to generate a VOI map, which highlights floodplain locations where additional information is valuable with respect to available floodplain management actions and their potential consequences. The methodology is illustrated with a simplified example and also applied to a real case study in the South of France, where a VOI map is analyzed on the basis of historical land use change decisions over a period of 26 years. Results show that uncertain flood hazard information encapsulated in PFMs can aid decision-making in floodplain planning.

AB In this article's companion paper, flexible approaches for conceptual hydrological modeling at the catchment scale were motivated, and the SUPERFLEX framework, based on generic model components, was introduced. In this article, the SUPERFLEX framework and the "fixed structure" GR4H model (an hourly version of the popular GR4J model) are applied to four hydrologically distinct experimental catchments in Europe and New Zealand. The estimated models are scrutinized using several diagnostic measures, ranging from statistical metrics, such as the statistical reliability and precision of the predictive distribution of streamflow, to more process-oriented diagnostics based on flow-duration curves and the correspondence between model states and groundwater piezometers. Model performance was clearly catchment specific, with a single fixed structure unable to accommodate intercatchment differences in hydrological behavior, including seasonality and thresholds. This highlights an important limitation of any "fixed" model structure. In the experimental catchments, the ability of competing model hypotheses to reproduce hydrological signatures of interest could be interpreted on the basis of independent fieldwork insights. The potential of flexible frameworks such as SUPERFLEX is then examined with respect to systematic and stringent hypothesis-testing in hydrological modeling, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward a more unified formulation of hydrological theory at the catchment scale. When interpreted in physical process-oriented terms, the flexible approach can also serve as a language for dialogue between modeler and experimentalist, facilitating the understanding, representation, and interpretation of catchment behavior.

ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; HYDROLOGIC-MODELS;
   AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; SENSITIVITY; UNCERTAINTY
AB [ 1] The performance of any model depends on how well its associated parameters are estimated. In the current application, a localized Bayesian recursive estimation ( LOBARE) approach is devised for parameter estimation. The LOBARE methodology is an extension of the Bayesian recursive estimation ( BARE) method. It is applied in this paper on two different types of models: an artificial intelligence ( AI) model in the form of a support vector machine ( SVM) application for forecasting soil moisture and a conceptual rainfall-runoff ( CRR) model represented by the Sacramento soil moisture accounting ( SAC-SMA) model. Support vector machines, based on statistical learning theory ( SLT), represent the modeling task as a quadratic optimization problem and have already been used in various applications in hydrology. They require estimation of three parameters. SAC-SMA is a very well known model that estimates runoff. It has a 13-dimensional parameter space. In the LOBARE approach presented here, Bayesian inference is used in an iterative fashion to estimate the parameter space that will most likely enclose a best parameter set. This is done by narrowing the sampling space through updating the "parent'' bounds based on their fitness. These bounds are actually the parameter sets that were selected by BARE runs on subspaces of the initial parameter space. The new approach results in faster convergence toward the optimal parameter set using minimum training/calibration data and fewer sets of parameter values. The efficacy of the localized methodology is also compared with the previously used BARE algorithm.

AB The statistics of extremes have played an important role in engineering practice for water resources design and management. How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper. Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere-ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamflow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere-ocean circulation (e.g., El Nino phenomenon).

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

DE scaling; nonlinearity; floods; unit hydrographs; geomorphology
ID REGIONAL FLOOD FREQUENCY
AB Two uses of the terms "linearity" and "nonlinearity" appear in recent literature. The first definition of nonlinearity is with respect to the dynamical property such as the rainfall-runoff response of a catchment, and nonlinearity in this sense refers to a nonlinear dependence of the storm response on the magnitude of the rainfall inputs [Minshall, 1960; Wang et al., 1981]. The second definition of nonlinearity [Huang and Willgoose, 1993; Goodrich et al., 1997] is with respect to the dependence of a catchment statistical property, such as the mean annual flood, on the area of the catchment. They are both linked to important and interconnected hydrologic concepts, and furthermore, the change of nonlinearity with area (scale) has been an important motivation for hydrologic research. While both definitions are correct mathematically, they refer to hydrologically different concepts. In this paper we show that nonlinearity in the dynamical sense and that in the statistical sense can exist independently of each other (i.e., can be unrelated). If not carefully distinguished, the existence of these two definitions can lead to a catchment's response being described as being both linear and nonlinear at the same time. We therefore recommend separating these definitions by reserving the term "nonlinearity" for the classical, dynamical definition with respect to rainfall inputs, while adopting the term "scaling relationship" for the dependence of a catchment hydrological property on catchment area.

AB An effective description of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is needed for wide-ranging applications in hydrology and climate-vegetation interactions. In this contribution, the theory of water movement within the SPAC is reviewed with emphasis on the eco-physiological and evolutionary constraints to water transport. The description of the SPAC can be framed at two widely separated time scales: (i) sub-hourly to growing season scales, relevant for hydro-climatic effects on ecosystem fluxes (given a set of plant hydraulic traits), and (ii) inter-annual to centennial scales during which either hydraulic traits may change, as individuals grow and acclimate, or species composition may change. At the shorter time scales, water transport can be described by water balance equations where fluxes depend on the hydraulic features of the different compartments, encoded in the form of conductances that nonlinearly depend on water availability. Over longer time scales, ontogeny, acclimation, and shifts in species composition in response to environmental changes can impose constraints on these equations in the form of tradeoffs and coordinated changes in the hydraulic (and biochemical) parameters. Quantification of this evolutionary coordination and the related tradeoffs offers novel theoretical tactics to constrain hydrologic and biogeochemical models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There have been a number of flume tests of flow round bends with idealized geometry and recently hydraulic simulations of such experiment. However, studies of hydraulic models in natural river bend are rather limited because of greater complexity of the flow characteristics and lack of detailed data. In this article, we study how 2D hydraulic model and raster-based hydraulic parameter calculations predict flow characteristics on the natural point bar environment. We will compare calculations of various hydraulic parameters (velocity, bed shear stress and stream power) by the 2D model and the associated sedimentology of the point bars. As a result of comparison, the usability of the 2D model for flow-form-product relationship predictions will be evaluated in natural river bend environment. The study shows that the 2D model can be generally utilized to predict the flood-generated flow-form-product relationship in coarse-grained and structurally complex point bar environments with sand-dominated bedload. For example, point bar sections submerged in water depths greater than 50 cm showed a relatively good match laterally between the model and sedimentological estimations. Furthermore, this approach allows us to estimate flood processes on a local scale in similar point bar environments with similar to 1:50 width-length ratio. The flow direction estimates of the 2D model coincided relatively well with the sedimentological estimations on the bar head. However, flow directions on the downstream section could not be modelled because the 2D model cannot handle the helicoidal flow of the river bend. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The NASA Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and ESA Sentinel-1, inter-alia, propose to monitor inland waters from satellites. The radar altimeter and the microwave radiometer can be used to monitor water surface level and assess the cross-sectional mean flow velocity, respectively. However, for most river sites bathymetric data are lacking, preventing the direct computation of discharge. In this context, a new methodology for simulating the bathymetry and estimating the discharge is proposed. The approach is based on entropy theory and can be applied using ground and satellite observations. Four parameters are needed and include channel roughness, water surface slope, channel bottom elevation, and an entropy parameter of flow depth. These parameters are estimated using a genetic algorithm by minimizing the error in the observed maximum surface velocity. Parameter uncertainty is considered through 1,000 random realizations based on different initial values. Eighteen streamflow measurements recorded from three different gauged river sites are used to benchmark the ground observations. The method included ENVISAT altimetry and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2002-2010) at one river site. Relative to ground measurements, the method provides good results with an error in channel area and discharge that, on average, does not exceed 10% on the 50th percentile. Relative to satellite measurements, channel area is well simulated with an error, on average, lower than 9%; discharge is less well simulated and represented by an error greater than 30% on the 50th percentile.

AB In this study, we use a linearization procedure and a finite difference method to solve non-Darcian flow to a well in an aquifer-aquitard system. The leakage effect is considered. Flow in the aquifer is assumed to be non-Darcian and horizontal, whereas flow in the aquitard is assumed to be Darcian and vertical. The Izbash equation [Izbash SV. O filtracii V Kropnozernstom Materiale. USSR: Leningrad; 1931 [in Russian]] is employed to describe the non-Darcian flow. The wellbore storage is also considered in this study. An approximate semi-analytical solution has been obtained by the linearization procedure, and a numerical solution has been obtained by using a finite difference method. The previous solutions for Darcian flow case and non-Darcian flow case without leakage can be described as special cases of the new solutions. The error caused by the linearization procedure has also been analyzed. The relative error caused by the linearization procedure is nearly 100% at early times, and decreases to zero at late times. We have also compared the results in this study with Wen et al. [Wen Z, Huang G. Zhan H. A numerical solution for non-Darcian flow to a well in a confined aquifer using the power law function. J Hydrol, 2008d [in revision]] in which the leakage effect is not considered, and Hantush and Jacob [Hantush MS, Jacob CE. Non-steady radial flow in an infinite leaky aquifer. Trans Am Geophys Union 1955;36(1):95-100] who investigated a similar problem in Darcian flow case. The comparison of this study and Wen et al. (2008d) indicates the dimensionless drawdown in the aquifer with leakage is less than that without leakage, and the leakage has little effect at early times. The comparison between the results of this study and that of Hantush and Jacob (1955) indicates that the dimensionless drawdown in the aquifer for non-Darcian flow is larger at early times and smaller at late times, than their counterparts for Darcian flow. A larger dimensionless non-Darcian conductivity k(D) results in a smaller dimensionless drawdown in the aquifer at late times, and leads to a larger dimensionless drawdown in the aquifer at early times. A smaller dimensionless leakage parameter BD results in a smaller drawdown at late times, and the leakage does not affect the early-time drawdown. The analysis of the dimensionless drawdown inside the well has also been included in this study when the wellbore storage is considered. C 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental decisions with substantial social and environmental implications are regularly informed by model predictions, incurring inevitable uncertainty. The selection of a set of model predictions to inform a decision is usually based on model performance, measured by goodness-of-fit metrics. Yet goodness-of-fit metrics have a questionable relationship to a model's value to end users, particularly when validation data are themselves uncertain. For example, decisions based on flow frequency models are not necessarily improved by adopting models with the best overall goodness of fit. We propose an alternative model evaluation approach based on the conditional value of sample information, first defined in 1961, which has found extensive use in sampling design optimization but which has not previously been used for model evaluation. The metric uses observations from a validation set to estimate the expected monetary costs associated with model prediction uncertainties. A model is only considered superior to alternatives if (i) its predictions reduce these costs and (ii) sufficient validation data are available to distinguish its performance from alternative models. By describing prediction uncertainties in monetary terms, the metric facilitates the communication of prediction uncertainty by end users, supporting the inclusion of uncertainty analysis in decision making.

AB Effects of substantial increase in area of pine plantations from 1960 to 2000 on runoff in a large catchment in southeastern Australia are quantified. Reliable land use maps were prepared for 1960-1979, 1980-1989, and 1990-2000 conditions from various data sources. Land use changes in the subcatchments have occurred at varying rates ( 16 to 28%) with pines replacing pasture and native woody vegetation. On the basis of long-term trends in rainfall-runoff relationships, flow duration curves, and history of land use changes, it is shown that there is strong evidence of reduction in runoff over a wide range. Modeling methodology using a lumped catchment-scale rainfall-runoff model (SMAR) and landscape-scale ecohydrological models (CLASS U3M-1D, CLASS PGM, and 3PG+) was implemented in a catchment framework to partition the effects of land use change and climate variability during 1960-2000. Runoff reductions from land use change in the range 22-52 mm/yr are estimated for different subcatchments. Annual yield impact per 10% of the catchment forested (AYI/10%) from catchment-scale modeling is estimated to vary between 14.3 to 19.2 mm/yr for the subcatchments. AYI/10% from landscape-scale modeling is estimated to vary between 12.8 to 21.3 mm/yr.

AB Baseflow in the Andes is commonly considered to be related with the release of water stored in paramos. Paramo is the predominant ecosystem above 3500m a.s.l. and is characterized by a rainy and cold climate with low evapotranspiration. However, this baseflow concept is based on hydrological process studies in small Andean catchments of a few square kilometre with a homogeneous land cover. Middle-sized Andean catchments, like the subcatchments of Tarqui and Yanuncay, Ecuador, are rarely homogeneous or uniformly covered by paramo. The objectives of this study are therefore to investigate baseflow characteristics in heterogeneous Andean catchments and to identify relationships between baseflow processes and physical characteristics such as storage and recharge. Hereby, the contribution to baseflow of paramo and other sources such as alluvial aquifers is quantified.
   This study uses nonlinear recession analysis, physically based filters and digital filters for comparison of baseflow of neighbouring but distinct subcatchments. The Yanuncay subcatchment shows a clearly different storage capacity and recession. The storage capacity of Yanuncay is 50% higher than for Tarqui because of its higher coverage of paramo. On the other hand, considerable storage capacity has also been found in the Tarqui subcatchment, which has a limited paramo area but a significant alluvial aquifer. It is shown that improved understanding of the specific baseflow characteristics such as storage and recharge and its relationships to the heterogeneity of the land cover in Andean catchments will lead to a better assessment of the water resources and give new insights for effective management actions.

AB This study focuses on the prediction of event-based runoff coefficients (an important descriptor of flood events) for nested catchments up to an area of 50?km(2) in the Eastern Ore Mountains. The four main objectives of the study are (i) the prediction of runoff coefficients with the statistical method of generalized linear models, (ii) the comparison of the results of the linear models with estimates of a distributed conceptual model, (iii) the comparison of the dynamics of observed soil moisture and simulated saturation deficit of the hydrological model and (iv) the analysis of the relationship between runoff coefficient and observed and simulated wetness. Different predictor variables were selected to describe the runoff coefficient and were differentiated into variables describing the catchment's antecedent wetness and meteorological forcing. The best statistical model was estimated in a stepwise approach on the basis of hierarchical partitioning, an exhaustive search algorithm and model validation with jackknifing. We then applied the rainfall runoff model WaSiM ETH to predict the runoff processes for the two larger catchments. Locally measured small-scale soil moisture (acquired at a scale of four to five magnitudes smaller than the catchment) was identified as one of the key predictor variables for the estimation of the runoff coefficient with the general linear model. It was found that the relationship betweenobserved and simulated (using WaSiM ETH) wetness is strongly hysteretic. The runoff coefficients derived from the rainfall runoff simulations systematically underestimate the observed values. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID SHAPE
AB Tailings dams differ from conventional water-retaining dams in design, materials retained behind the dam and used in construction of the dam, and the inclination of the upstream face of the dam. In this paper, we isolate the effect of upstream slope angle on behavior during overtopping breach. Six 1 m high homogeneous fine sand dams were constructed with upstream slope angles varying between 10.0 degrees and 30.0 degrees and brought to failure by V notch overtopping. Slope angle was observed to define the height of flow over the erosional breach crest hydraulic control structure that forms in the upstream face of the dam, with higher peak outflow corresponding to steeper upstream slope angles. A semiellipse was observed to be an excellent approximation of the geometry of the breach throughout the rising limb of the hydrograph to peak outflow. This observation permitted the use of the Ramanujan approximation for perimeter of an ellipse to define a mathematical relationship between breach width and arc length. A simplified method to predict the rising limb of the outflow hydrograph was then proposed based on the assumption of linear growth of breach width coupled with a semielliptical breach geometry. These findings show that hazard analysis for overtopping failure should consider the effect of upstream slope angle on peak outflow.

TI A physically based description of floodplain inundation dynamics in a
   global river routing model
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Current global river routing models do not represent floodplain inundation dynamics realistically because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by small-scale topography rather than the commonly used spatial resolution of global models. In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments.

AB Through its role in the energy and water balances at the land surface, soil moisture is a key state variable in surface hydrology and land-atmosphere interactions. Point observations of soil moisture are easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS. Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1 m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables was known with greater certainty.

ID VOLUME CHANGE
AB Extension of the work of Philip (1969a, 1972) has shown that the effect of overburden pressure on volume change of swelling soils produces equilibrium moisture profiles entirely different from those predicted without considering the overburden pressure effects. Volume change of swelling soils accompanied by moisture changes also affects the overburden pressure. The total volume change under an overburden pressure occurs in three different shrinkage phases from saturation to oven dry. These volume change characteristics are usually described on the shrinkage surface, a surface drawn as void ratio e (volume of voids/volume of solids) versus moisture ratio Theta (volume of water/volume of solids) for different overburden pressures. A relationship for the moisture gradient is developed by assuming that the overburden potential, a component of the total potential of soil water, is a function of moisture ratio only across a small soil element of a long swelling soil column which consists of large numbers of finite soil elements. The moisture gradient has complex behavior based on the properties of the three shrinkage phases on the shrinkage surface. Distribution of equilibrium moisture paths is then explained by evaluating the moisture gradients at points on an idealized shrinkage surface. It is shown that the soil at great depths could either be saturated or unsaturated at equilibrium. (These depths could be over 250 m for some sodium montmorillonite clays).

AB The vertical stratification of carbon dioxide (CO2) injected into a deep layered aquifer made up of high-permeability and low-permeability layers, such as Utsira aquifer at Sleipner site in Norway, is investigated with a Buckley-Leverett equation including gravity effects. In a first step, we study both by theory and simulation the application of this equation to the vertical migration of a light phase (CO2), in a denser phase (water), in 1D vertical columns filled with different types of porous media: homogeneous, piece-wise homogeneous, layered periodic and finally heterogeneous. For each case, we solve the associated Riemann problems and propose semi-analytical solutions describing the spatial and temporal evolution of the light phase saturation. These solutions agree well with simulation results. We show that the flux continuity condition at interfaces between high-permeability and low-permeability layers leads to CO2 saturation discontinuities at these interfaces and. in particular, to a saturation increase beneath low-permeability layers. In a second step, we analyze the vertical migration of a CO2 plume injected into a 2D layered aquifer. We show that the CO2 vertical stratification under each low-permeability layer is induced, as in 1D columns, by the flux continuity condition at interfaces. As the injection takes place at the bottom of the aquifer the velocity and the flux function decrease with elevation and this phenomenon is proposed to explain the stratification under each mudstone layer as observed at Sleipner site.

AB We studied 34 global reservoirs for which good quality surface elevation data could be obtained from a combination of five satellite altimeters for the period from 1992 to 2010. For each of these reservoirs, we used an unsupervised classification approach using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day 250 m vegetation product to estimate the surface water areas over the MODIS period of record (2000 to 2010). We then derived elevation-area relationships for each of the reservoirs by combining the MODIS-based estimates with satellite altimeter-based estimates of reservoir water elevations. Through a combination of direct observations of elevation and surface area along with documented reservoir configurations at capacity, we estimated storage time histories for each reservoir from 1992 to 2010. We evaluated these satellite-based data products in comparison with gauge observations for the five largest reservoirs in the United States (Lakes Mead, Powell, Sakakawea, Oahe, and Fort Peck Reservoir). The storage estimates were highly correlated with observations (R = 0.92 to 0.99), with values for the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 3% to 15%. The storage mean absolute error (expressed as a percentage of reservoir capacity) for the reservoirs in this study was 4%. The multidecadal reconstructed reservoir storage variations are in accordance with known droughts and high flow periods on each of the five continents represented in the data set.

   transport; variance reduction; variance estimation

AB In this study we introduce a new approach named importance sampling or quick simulations. The method has been extensively used in communication theory in estimating probability of rare events. The basic idea behind importance sampling techniques is that certain values of the input random variables (or vectors) have more important impact on the parameters being estimated than others, and if these "important" values are sampled more frequently than others, i.e., sampled from a biased density function, the variance of the estimator can be reduced. The outputs from simulations are then weighted to correct such biased sampling. Two illustrative examples are given to show the general procedure of the importance sampling approach as well as its applicability to subsurface flow and transport problems. In one example we estimated the mean and variance of hydraulic head for one-dimensional flow, and in the other we estimated the probability of a particle's travel time t less than a given critical value T. In both examples, we compared results from analytical solutions, the conventional Monte Carlo (CMC) simulations, and the importance sampling approach. It is shown that when an importance density function is chosen appropriately, importance sampling techniques may be many orders of magnitude more efficient than the CMC simulations and have a great potential in simulating subsurface flow and transport.

AB The Penman-Monteith equation is used widely to estimate evapotranspiration (E) and to understand its governing physics. I present an alternative to the Penman-Monteith equation that has both practical and theoretical advantages, at no appreciable cost. In particular, the new equation requires no additional assumptions, empiricism, or computational cost compared with the Penman-Monteith equation. Practically, the new equation is consistently more accurate over a wide range of conditions when compared with eddy covariance observations: The new equation has lower errors compared with Penman-Monteith estimates of ET at all of the 79 eddy covariance sites available for the analysis. Using the new equation reduces errors, on average, by 67%, from 8.55 to 2.81 [W m(-2)]. At night, the improvement is even greater (92% reduction in error; from 1.26 to 0.097 [W m(-2)]). This improvement is achieved without calibration. Theoretically, the new equation corrects a conceptual error in the Penman-Monteith equation, in which the Penman-Monteith equation incorrectly implies that E from a saturated surface into a saturated, turbulent atmosphere ("equilibrium" E) is exactly equivalent to E from an unsaturated surface into an unsaturated, laminar atmosphere. The conceptual error is traced back to the failure of the Penman-Monteith equation in important limiting cases; these errors are eliminated by the new equation. I use the new equation to revise an existing theory of land-atmosphere coupling affected by the conceptual error in the Penman-Monteith equation and to reassess several common but incorrect definitions of equilibrium E.

AB Regional frequency analysis (RFA) deals with the estimation of hydrological characteristics at sites where little or no data is available. Recently, machine learning applications to RFA have received considerable attention in terms of their flexibility in modeling as well as superior generalization ability compared to conventional approaches. The proper application of machine learning techniques, however, requires good understanding of the available information about system's dynamics, i.e. system variables. This paper presents two contributions to the literature. First, novel ensemble architecture, using a unique two-stage resampling approach, is proposed. The objective of the proposed ensemble model is to promote diversity within the individual learners and reduce over fitting. Second, the application of the proposed model is demonstrated in RFA case study to obtain improved regional flood quantile estimates at ungauged sites. A jackknife validation procedure is used for the evaluation of the model's performance. The method is applied to data from the province of Quebec, Canada. The model showed similar performance and generalization compared to major ensemble models in the literature, which were investigated in previous studies using the same data set. The proposed model confirmed the diversity requirement in ensemble modeling and, in the same time, validated the proposed model adherence to ensemble learning theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intensive agriculture in the Midwestern United States contributes to excess nitrogen in surface water and groundwater, negatively affecting human health and aquatic ecosystems. Complete denitrification removes reactive nitrogen from aquatic environments and releases inert dinitrogen gas. We examined denitrification rates and the abundances of denitrifying genes and total bacteria at three sites in an agricultural watershed and in an experimental stream in Minnesota. Sampling was conducted along transects with a gradient from always inundated (in-channel), to periodically inundated, to noninundated conditions to determine how denitrification rates and gene abundances varied from channels to riparian areas with different inundation histories. Results indicate a coupling between environmental parameters, gene abundances, and denitrification rates at the in-channel locations, and limited to no coupling at the periodically inundated and noninundated locations, respectively. Nutrient-amended potential denitrification rates for the in-channel locations were significantly correlated (alpha =0.05) with five of six measured denitrifying gene abundances, whereas the periodically inundated and noninundated locations were each only significantly correlated with the abundance of one denitrifying gene. These results suggest that DNA-based analysis of denitrifying gene abundances alone cannot predict functional responses (denitrification potential), especially in studies with varying hydrologic regimes. A scaling analysis was performed to develop a predictive functional relationship relating environmental parameters to denitrification rates for in-channel locations. This method could be applied to other geographic and climatic regions to predict the occurrence of denitrification hot spots.

TI The institutionalization of River Basin Management as politics of scale

   Water Resources Management (IWRM); Water governance
ID GOVERNANCE; ECOLOGY
AB River Basin Management (RBM) as an approach to sustainable water use has become the dominant model of water governance. Its introduction, however, entails a fundamental realignment and rescaling of water-sector institutions along hydrological boundaries. Creating such a new governance scale is inherently political, and is being described as politics of scale. This paper analyzes how the politics of scale play out in the institutionalization of RBM in Mongolia. It furthermore scrutinizes the role of the broader political decentralization process in the introduction of RBM, an issue that has so far received little attention. Finally, it assesses whether the river basin is an adequate water management scale in Mongolia.
   This article finds that institutionalizing RBM in Mongolia is indeed a highly political negotiation process that does not only concern the choice of the governance scale, but also its detailed institutional design. It furthermore reveals that Mongolia's incomplete political decentralization process has for a long time negatively impacted the decentralization of water-related tasks and the implementation of RBM. However, the 2011 Budget Law and the 2012 Water Law provide for a fiscal strengthening of local governments and clearer sharing of responsibilities among the various different institutions involved in water management. Nevertheless, only if the 2012 Water Law is complemented by adequate by-laws - and if the newly created river basin institutions are adequately equipped - can RBM be effectively put into practice.
   This article confirms the usefulness of a politics-of-scale approach to understand scalar practices and changes in water management. However, the article also argues for a broadening of the analytical perspective to take the interdependencies between changes in water governance and other political processes, such as decentralization, into account.

AB The Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity (STIC) electrical conductivity (EC) logger as presented by Chapin et al. (2014) serves as an inexpensive (similar to 50 USD) means to assess relative EC in freshwater environments. This communication demonstrates the calibration of the STIC logger for quantifying EC, and provides examples from a month long field deployment in the High Arctic. Calibration models followed multiple nonlinear regression and produced calibration curves with high coefficient of determination values (R-2=0.995-0.998; n=5). Percent error of mean predicted specific conductance at 25 degrees C (SpC) to known SpC ranged in magnitude from -0.6% to 13% (mean=-1.4%), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from 2.1% to 13% (mean=5.3%). Across all tested loggers we found good accuracy and precision, with both error metrics increasing with increasing SpC values. During 10, month-long field deployments, there were no logger failures and full data recovery was achieved. Point SpC measurements at the location of STIC loggers recorded via a more expensive commercial electrical conductivity logger followed similar trends to STIC SpC records, with 1:1.05 and 1:1.08 relationships between the STIC and commercial logger SpC values. These results demonstrate that STIC loggers calibrated to quantify EC are an economical means to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of water quality investigations.

AB [1] The nature and distribution of soil particles and pores plays a strong role in determining the soil hydraulic properties ( specifically the soil water retention curve and the relative hydraulic conductivity curve) that govern water movement. A new mathematical model for these hydraulic properties was developed by conceptualizing the soil as a random assemblage of soil particles represented by randomly sized overlapping spheres ( fully penetrable spheres). The spatial arrangement of the spheres was assumed to follow a homogeneous Poisson process. A stochastic analysis was utilized to obtain analytical expressions for soil water retention curves and relative conductivity at varying water contents. Unlike the existing models of soil hydraulic properties, this new model incorporates soil porosity in estimating model parameters. Furthermore, because of this conceptualization, we are able to determine the types of soils for which the model is appropriate. A quantitative evaluation of the new model was performed by examining data on hydraulic properties for several soils. In addition, quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made with currently used expressions ( such as the van Genuchten model, Brooks-Corey relationship, and Kosugi model) for the same data sets. Results show that the new model provides reasonable fits with the observed water retention curve and good predictions of the hydraulic conductivity, particularly for soils exhibiting a distinct air entry pressure.

TI A model for soil relative hydraulic conductivity based on the water

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A simple model is proposed which predicts the relative unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of nonswelling soils by using the first two moments of their water retention curve (WRC). The model is based on the statistical approach but uses less restrictive assumptions concerning the pore configuration than Mualem's [1976] model. The result is that the relative hydraulic conductivity (RHC) is a power function of the relative contribution of the pores filled with water. It is shown that the power value is related to the coefficient of variation characterizing the retention curve, expressed in terms of the WRC model of Assouline et al. [1998]. Therefore a relationship is established between the RHC and the soil structure and texture, as reflected by the measured WRC. The model is calibrated on data from eight soils and tested on data from five soils, representing a wide range of soil textures, from sand to silt. The performances of the model are compared to those resulting from the application of Mualem's [1976] model to the analytical expressions of Brooks and Corey [1964] and Assouline et al. [1998] for the WRC. In most of the cases the proposed model improves the fit of the predicted RHC to the measured data, although its performance in the case of loam soils seems to be weak.

   SURFACE
AB A combined Richards-Cowan model of transpiration and soil moisture flux is used to analyze the relationship between stage-one (atmosphere limited) and stage-two (stressed) transpiration during a series of simulated dry downs. The duration of stage-one transpiration is found to be controlled by the storage capacity of the root zone, the potential transpiration rate, and the soil desorptivity and drainage properties, which in turn influence the net of upward and downward moisture fluxes through the bottom of the root zone. During stage-two transpiration the root zone lower boundary behaves like a dry surface, and the transpiration rate is supply-limited by the upward flux to this boundary. These findings are combined with a similarity solution for the upward flux rate (including the influence of gravity) in order to derive an analytic approximation for the time to onset of stage-two transpiration. This estimated time to stress t(s), along with a rate scale defined by the time average flux in the root zone prior to stress, can be used to nondimensionalize the relation between stage-two transpiration and time in similar fashion to the bare soil evaporation analysis of Salvucci [1997]. The resulting expressions allow prediction, under simplified event-based initial and boundary conditions, of the second stage of transpiration from soil desorptivity and drainage properties.

AB Fracture networks in shales exhibit multiscale features. A rock system may contain a few main fractures and thousands of microcracks, whose length and aperture are orders of magnitude smaller than the former. It is computationally prohibitive to resolve all the fractures explicitly for such multiscale fracture networks. One traditional approach is to model the small-scale features (e.g., microcracks in shales) as an effective medium. Although this fracture-matrix conceptualization significantly reduces the problem complexity, there are classes of physical processes that cannot be accurately upscaled by effective medium approximations, for example, microcrack clogging during mineral reactions. In this work, we employ deep learning in place of effective medium theory to upscale physical processes in small-scale features. Specifically, we consider reactive transport in a fracture-microcrack network where microcracks can be clogged by precipitation. A deep learning multiscale algorithm is developed, in which the microcracks are upscaled as a wall boundary condition of the main fractures. The wall boundary condition is constructed by recurrent neural networks, which take concentration histories as input and predict the solute transport from main fractures to microcracks. The deep learning multiscale algorithm is first employed in specific scenarios, then a general model is developed which can work under various conditions. The new approach is validated against fully resolved simulations and an analytical solution, providing a reliable and efficient solution for problems that cannot be upscaled by effective medium models.

TI Dividing the waters: An empirical analysis of interstate compact
   allocation of transboundary rivers
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; MARKETS; INSTITUTIONS
AB Legal scholars and jurists have identified several criteria (e. g., hydrology, climate, population, and historical water use) to guide equitable allocation of transboundary rivers among riparian claimants. Are these criteria used in practice, such that a quantitative pattern emerges from actual water-sharing agreements regarding factors affecting allocations? To address this, we study interstate compacts, the principal mechanism for allocating the waters of transboundary rivers within the United States. We develop a georeferenced data set and construct variables representing conditions in state-based watersheds of 14 rivers at the times of compact ratification. A state's water allocation share of a compact serves as the dependent variable, and a set of explanatory variables is derived from legal and political theories. We estimate allocation shares using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and bootstrap regressions, and we apply two alternative specifications of the factors affecting compact allocations, one with and one without political variables. Estimated coefficients on variables for land area, population, prior water use, riparian position, and Congressional committee chair are statistically significant in the OLS regressions. The preferred OLS specification, which includes political variables, provides a good fit (R-2 = 0.84). We also find that OLS and bootstrap regressions have a similar ability to predict state allocation shares. We discuss how the results could be used as a reference point in negotiations over new compacts or international river treaties and as a basis to identify existing compacts with statistical outliers.

AB Climate change is inevitably altering the hydrological regime of water bodies. The interest in changing behaviour of intermittent rivers is increasing in many countries. This research was focused on intermittent rivers (rivers which naturally, periodically cease to flow) in Lithuania. The purpose of this research was to provide an overview of flow intermittency phenomena according to available data in a historical period and to evaluate the impact of catchment geographical features and climate variability on zero-flow events. The calculated indices of flow intermittency showed that the selected rivers had very different flow regimes. The threshold for the separation of typically intermittent rivers from only occasionally intermittent ones was suggested. Multiple linear regression analysis defined the crucial role of catchment size and watercourse slope on the river cessation process in Lithuania. The applied non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test revealed the significance of the relationship between precipitation (in June-September) and zero-flow duration. Flow intermittency phenomena in Lithuanian rivers were linked to a low-frequency teleconnection pattern (SCAND index). A methodology of estimating the relation between river intermittency and large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern (based on SCAND index) was created. The generated regression equations between flow intermittency indices and catchment characteristics might be useful for the estimation of zero-flows in ungauged river catchments. The main aspect of future investigations might be related to forecasting flow intermittency using modern hydrological models and climate scenarios as well as the defined relationships between zero-flow indices and physico-geographical features of river catchments.

AB This study examines the influence of constitutive models and their parameters on predictions of the spatial and temporal distribution of a finite release of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) into a two-dimensional, spatially correlated random permeability field. The base case simulation employed a comprehensive constitutive model that was validated against relevant one-dimensional laboratory experiments. The base case was perturbed in the course of nine individual simulations, where each simulation examined the consequences of simplifying a single model characteristic. None of the nine subsequent simulations was able to reproduce, within +/-10%, the spatial and temporal migration characteristics of the nonwetting fluid body at late time predicted by the base case. Capillary pressure-saturation relationships that do not incorporate specific displacement and terminal pressures are demonstrated to severely overpredict the spatial extent of nonwetting fluid advancement. This suggests that van Genuchten-based models may not be suitable for predicting DNAPL migration in saturated porous media. Not accounting for any one of hysteresis, nonwetting phase trapping, or the proper curvature or end-point values of the nonwetting phase imbibition relative permeability curve profoundly influenced the time predicted for all nonwetting fluid movement to cease. The practical implication of this study is that an appropriate, comprehensive constitutive model, characterized with suitable parameter values, is necessary to accurately simulate a complete DNAPL release below the water table in both space and time.

AB This paper introduces a new and computationally efficient model for the simulation of non-wetting phase leakage in a rigid heterogeneous layered medium domain constituting layers of different physical properties. Such a leakage exhibits a discontinuity in the saturation field at the interface between layers. The governing field equations are derived based on the averaging theory and solved numerically using a mixed finite element discretization scheme. This scheme entails solving different balance equations using different discretization techniques, which are tailored to accurately simulate the physical behavior of the primary state variables. A discontinuous non-wetting phase saturation-continuous water pressure formulation is adopted. The standard Galerkin finite element method is utilized to discretize the water phase pressure field, and the partition of unity finite element method is utilized to discretize the non-wetting phase saturation field. This mixed discretization scheme leads to a locally conservative system, giving accurate simulation of the saturation jump. The boundary between layers is embedded within the finite elements, alleviating the need to use the typical interface elements, and allowing for the use of structured, geometry-independent and relatively coarse meshes. The accuracy and capability of the proposed model are evaluated by verification and numerical examples covering water, DNAPL and CO2 leakage through layers of different hydraulic properties.

AB Sensitivity analysis is an important tool for development and improvement of mathematical models, especially for complex systems with a high dimension of spatially correlated parameters. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis has gained popularity because it can quantify the relative contribution of uncertainty from different sources. However, its computational cost increases dramatically with the complexity of the considered model and the dimension of model parameters. In this study, we developed a new sensitivity analysis method that integrates the concept of variance-based method with a hierarchical uncertainty quantification framework. Different uncertain inputs are grouped and organized into a multilayer framework based on their characteristics and dependency relationships to reduce the dimensionality of the sensitivity analysis. A set of new sensitivity indices are defined for the grouped inputs using the variance decomposition method. Using this methodology, we identified the most important uncertainty source for a dynamic groundwater flow and solute transport model at the Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford site. The results indicate that boundary conditions and permeability field contribute the most uncertainty to the simulated head field and tracer plume, respectively. The relative contribution from each source varied spatially and temporally. By using a geostatistical approach to reduce the number of realizations needed for the sensitivity analysis, the computational cost of implementing the developed method was reduced to a practically manageable level. The developed sensitivity analysis method is generally applicable to a wide range of hydrologic and environmental problems that deal with high-dimensional spatially distributed input variables.

AB [1] A method is presented to estimate flow parameters and geological structure in the vadose zone by combining time-lapse Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) traveltime tomography and inverse flow modeling. The traveltime tomography is used to determine the spatial electromagnetic velocity distribution in the vadose zone. These time-lapse velocity images are converted to time-lapse volumetric soil water content images using petrophysical relationships. Subsequently, the water content images are used as constraints in the flow inversion. The influence of the tomographic artifacts on the flow inversion is minimized by assigning weights that are proportional to the ray coverage. Our flow inversion algorithm estimates the flow parameters and calibrates the geological structure. The geological structure is defined using a set of control points, the positions of which can be modified during the inversion. After the inversion, the final geological and flow model are used to compute GPR traveltimes to check the consistency between these computed traveltimes and the observed traveltimes. The method is first tested on two synthetic models (a steady state and a transient flow models). Subsequently, the method is applied to characterize a real vadose zone at Oslo Airport Gardermoen, Norway, during the snowmelt in 2005. The flow inversion method is applied to locate and quantify the main geological layers at the site. In particular the inversion method identifies and estimates the location and properties of thin dipping layers with relatively low-permeability. The flow model is cross validated using an independent infiltration event.

AB [1] Transport of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in soils is becoming an increasingly serious threat to the environment. Detection and observation of these substances are thus an increasingly important issue. During recent years, studies have used the apparent dielectric constant (K-a) measured by time domain reflectometry (TDR) for determining the saturation of NAPLs (theta(NAPL)) in soils (m(3) m(-3)). K-a has been related to theta(NAPL) using dielectric mixing models. In this approach for the unsaturated zone, the water content theta(w) should be known beforehand (by assumptions or measured using other techniques). Here, unlike previous research, detailed laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between the TDR measured K-a and bulk electrical conductivity sigma(a) and theta(NAPL). Calibration was made in homogeneous sand using three different NAPLs. It was shown that the mixing model used previously led to errors up to 0.05 m(3) m(-3) in saturated sand. Moreover, in unsaturated sand, measurements of Ka only cannot be used for estimation of theta(NAPL) even if theta(w) is known. Instead, TDR's capability of determining both K-a and sigma(a) was utilized to estimate theta(w) and theta(NAPL). The approach presented in this study can be used for simultaneous observation of theta(w) and theta(NAPL) during NAPL transport experiments in both unsaturated and saturated sandy soils. Thus it is potentially helpful when developing new NAPL transport models.

AB The critical condition of incipient motion of cohesive sediments was investigated in a laboratory study. One-hundred experimental runs were performed with sediment samples by varying the yield stress to determine the relationship between the critical condition of incipient motion and the rheological properties of the cohesive sediments. The results indicate that yield stress is a factor that has a major influence on the incipient motion of cohesive sediments. In addition, the critical Shields parameter is found to be exponentially proportional to the yield stress and inversely proportional to the median grain size. The effect of yield stress on the critical Shields parameter is significant for the cohesive sediments and becomes progressively weaker with increasing median grain size. Furthermore, an empirical formula for calculating the critical Shields parameter of cohesive sediments that includes a rheological term and a gravity term is proposed by introducing the yield stress. According to this formula, a modified Shields diagram is obtained in which the values of the critical Shields parameter for cohesive sediments vary within a band that contains countless curves (instead of on a single line) to reflect the influence of the yield stress. This modification of the traditional Shields curve is effective for fine sediments, but the effects tend to vanish for coarse sediments as the behavior of sediments changes from cohesive to noncohesive. Finally, potential further investigations are discussed.

AB The quantity and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters influence ecosystem processes and anthropogenic use of freshwater. However, despite the importance of understanding spatial and temporal patterns in DOM, measures of DOM quality are not routinely included as part of large-scale ecosystem monitoring programs and variations in analytical procedures can introduce artifacts. In this study, we used consistent sampling and analytical methods to meet the objective of defining variability in DOM quantity and quality and other measures of water quality in streamflow issuing from small forested watersheds located within five Critical Zone Observatory sites representing contrasting environmental conditions. Results show distinct separations among sites as a function of water quality constituents. Relationships among rates of atmospheric deposition, water quality conditions, and stream DOM quantity and quality are consistent with the notion that areas with relatively high rates of atmospheric nitrogen and sulfur deposition and high concentrations of divalent cations result in selective transport of DOM derived from microbial sources, including in-stream microbial phototrophs. We suggest that the critical zone as a whole strongly influences the origin, composition, and fate of DOM in streams. This study highlights the value of consistent DOM characterization methods included as part of long-term monitoring programs for improving our understanding of interactions among ecosystem processes as controls on DOM biogeochemistry.

AB Projected decreases and changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation will have profound impacts on southeastern Australia, including its ability to generate renewable hydroelectricity. Recent decreases in precipitation over the region may be significant in the context of instrumental records, but the question of whether these decreases are within long-term natural variability remains. To help address this issue, we present December-January streamflow and dam inflow reconstructions for southeastern Australia. These reconstructions for the Tasmanian west coast are based solely on local tree ring chronologies and span up to 1600 years. Nonparametric estimates, however, indicate good model skill for the last 458 years (streamflow) and 478 years (dam inflow). The reconstructions indicate that twentieth century conditions were well within the range of historical variability, and were in fact relatively wet. The period from approximately 1600 to 1750 CE was one of the enhanced variability and a high proportion of low and high flow events occurred in the seventeenth century. There are significant relationships between streamflow and inflow reconstructions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere processes such as ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode. Critically, our two reconstructions rely heavily on new tree ring chronologies based on properties such as tracheid radial diameter, cell wall thickness, and density, underscoring the importance of these different types of chronologies in reconstructions.

TI Flash flood dynamics and composition in a semiarid mountain watershed

ID SANTA-CATALINA MOUNTAINS; RUNOFF GENERATION; VEGETATION
AB Flash flood hydrographs were examined using water stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen) and a plug-flow lumped catchment model to assess the origin and routing processes of flood water in a semiarid basin in southwestern United States. Precipitation and stream water were sampled during storm and flood conditions at high and low elevations. Isotope mixing relationships readily determined the predominance of three sources for the representative summer monsoon events: high elevation precipitation from two major subbasins and base flow. Each flood progressed through a series of source water contributions, as indicated by several segments of linear mixing between these end-members. We developed a plug-flow lumped catchment model to test possible governing processes for specific watershed and forcing conditions. Results suggest twomain findings: First, these flood events were generated primarily from event water runoff in high elevations that mixed at the flood bore with pre-event base flow resident in the stream. The power, speed, and turbulence of the flood bore cause it to mix with, ride atop and push the resident in-stream water in the front of the rising limb. Second, the timing and volume of flood waves from subbasins are identified by their combined isotopic signature at the basin outlet; this approach may provide an effective mesoscale constraint for rainfall-runoff models.

AB Hydrodynamic dispersion in flow through porous media is an essential phenomenon in many geosystems. While dispersion in flow of Newtonian fluids is relatively well-understood, many subsurface applications, such as groundwater remediation, use the flooding system with non-Newtonian fluids, such as polymer oxidants. Despite its significance, however, very limited studies have been carried out focusing on hydrodynamic dispersion in flow of non-Newtonian fluids. The present study addresses a fundamental question regarding how solute transport in flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media differs from the Newtonian limit. We report on the results of an extensive pore-scale study of the upscaling of advection-diffusion in flow of a non-Newtonian, shear thinning fluid through disordered and spatially-correlated porous media, using an advanced GPU-based pore-scale simulator in order to delineate the effects of the fluid's rheology, dynamics of fluid flow, and pore-scale spatial correlations on hydrodynamic dispersion. The simulations indicate a surprising non-monotonic relation between the injection rate (or injection velocity) and the dispersivity. While dispersivity in Newtonian fluid flow in porous media is constant in the flow regime that we study, we find, however, that the dispersivity in flow of non-Newtonian fluids is shear-dependent. This highlights the gap in the existing theories of transport through porous materials for non-Newtonian fluids, which can lead to erroneous estimates of dispersion coefficients in porous materials when the fluid's rheology cannot be represented by Newtonian mechanics.

AB This paper investigates age mixing processes arising in advection-dispersion models, where large-scale travel and residence time distributions can be explicitly calculated based on the underlying velocity field. In particular, we analyze spatially integrated age mixing dynamics by comparing the age distributions of the storage and of the outflow(s). The relevance of the work lies in the impact of age mixing dynamics on the shape of travel time distributions (TTDs), which ultimately control the long-term memory of catchment transport processes. We set up a theoretical framework that bridges previous Lagrangian and Eulerian water age theories in heterogeneous media. The framework allows for the analysis of the dynamical connection between water age distributions in large-scale volume and flux samples. Theoretical advances are then illustrated through the application to a finite one-dimensional domain with constant advection and dispersion coefficient. Therein, we analyze the type of mixing emerging for different Peclet numbers and diverse spatiotemporal patterns of solute input. We find that in spite of the enhanced nonstationarity of TTDs, the type of mixing is markedly invariant. Moreover, for relatively low Peclet numbers the different ages available in the control volume are systematically removed from the domain at a rate nearly proportional to their relative abundance (random sampling). Emerging large-scale patterns of age mixing yield theoretical and practical implications for watershed hydrology, where TTDs can be used to infer general patterns of catchment response across scales.

AB Potential evapotranspiration is a key input to hydrological models. Its estimation has often been via the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, most recently in the form of an estimate of reference evapotranspiration (RET) as recommended by FAO-56. In this article, the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model is implemented to estimate the potential evapotranspiration from soil moisture (PET) and the potential evaporation from interception (PET0) directly in a form that recognizes vegetation diversity and temporal development without reference to experimental measurements and without calibration. The threshold values of vegetation parameters are drawn from the literature based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover classification. The spatial and temporal variation of the leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation is derived from the composite National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using a method based on the SiB2 model, and the Climate Research Unit (CRU) database is used to provide the required meteorological data. All these data inputs are publicly and globally available. Consequently, the implementation of the S-W model developed in this study is applicable at the global scale, an essential requirement if it is to be applied in data-poor or ungauged large basins.
   A comparison is made between the FAO-56 method and the S-W model when applied to the Mekong River basin for the period 1981-2000. The resulting estimates of RET and PET and their association with vegetation types and LAI are examined over the whole basin both annual and monthly and at five specific points. The effect of NDVI on the PET estimate is further evaluated by replacing the monthly NDVI product with the 10-day product. Multiple regression relationships between monthly PET, RET, LAI, and climatic variables are explored for categories of vegetation types. The estimated RET is a good climatic index that adequately reflects the temporal change and spatial distribution of climate over the basin, but the PET estimated using the S-W model not only reflects the change in climate but also the vegetation distribution and the development of vegetation in response to climate. Although good statistical relationships can be established between PET, RET, and/or climatic variables, applying these relationships Will likely result in large errors because of the strong non-linearity and scatter between the PET and the LAI of the vegetation. It is concluded that use of the implementation of the S-W model described in this study results in a physically sound estimate of PET, which accounts for changing land surface conditions.

AB The persistence effect contribution of legacy nutrients is often cited as a reason for little or no improvement in water quality following extensive implementation of watershed nutrient mitigation actions, yet there is limited knowledge concerning factors influencing this response, often called the " persistence effect." Here, we adopted detrended fluctuation analysis and Spearman analysis methods to assess the influence of land use on the watershed phosphorus (P) persistence effect, using monthly water quality records during 2010-2016 in 13 catchments within a drinking water reservoir watershed in eastern China. Detrended fluctuation analysis was used to calculate the Hurst exponent a to assess watershed legacy P characteristics (alpha approximate to 0.5, alpha > 0.5, and alpha < 0.5 indicate white noise, persistence, and anti-persistence, respectively). Results showed weak to strong P persistence (0.60-0.81) in the time series of riverine P in the 13 catchments. The Hurst exponent a had negative relationships with agricultural land (R = -.47, p = .11) and developed land (R = -.67, p = .01) and a positive relationship with forest land cover (R = .48, p = .10). The persistence effect of riverine P was mainly determined by retention ability (biogeochemical legacy) and migration efficiency (hydrological legacy). A catchment with strong retention capacity (e.g., biomass uptake/storage and soil PO4 sorption) and low migration efficiency results in a stronger persistence effect for riverine P. In practice, source control is more effective in catchments with weak persistence, whereas sink control (e. ., riparian buffers and wetlands) is preferred in catchments with strong persistence effects.

AB The objective of this analysis is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a composite L2 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture product for determining drought conditions by taking advantage of its spatial and temporal resolutions. The work investigates the potential relationships between soil moisture anomalies and two drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, both calculated on a ten-day basis. As the two drought indices can be applied to different time scales for precipitation series, the influence of time scale on the drought definition is also studied. The anomalies were calculated both for the in situ soil moisture by REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network, Spain) and from the SMOS L2 soil moisture product. In general, in situ anomalies exhibit higher correlation coefficients for the drought indices than those of SMOS, except for the shortest time scale. As expected, the short-term remotely sensed anomalies have a high response to precipitation events. This effect may be due to the greater sensitivity of SMOS data to rainfall, as well as to the spatial averaged nature of its observations. The optimal time scale was 1 month for the SMOS values and ranged between 30 and 50 days for the in situ values. The use of evapotranspiration in the calculation of the indices did not improve the description of the anomalies. The relationship between indices and soil moisture conditions provides encouraging results. Indeed, this method generates preliminary but valuable insights for future satellite products.

   model; Teba catchment; water balance
AB A hydrological model (YWB, yearly water balance) has been developed to model the daily rainfall-runoff relationship of the 202 km(2) Teba river catchment, located in semi-arid south-eastern Spain. The period of available data (1976-1993) includes some very rainy years with intensive storms (responsible for flooding parts of the town of Malaga) and also some very dry years.
   The YWB model is in essence a simple tank model in which the catchment is subdivided into a limited number of meaningful hydrological units. Instead of generating per unit surface: runoff resulting from infiltration excess, runoff has been made the result of storage excess. Actual evapotranspiration is obtained by means of curves, included in the software, representing the relationship between the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture content for three soil texture classes.
   The total runoff generated is split between base flow and surface runoff according to a given baseflow index. The two components are routed separately and subsequently joined. A large number of sequential years can be processed, and the results of each year are summarized by a water balance table and a daily based rainfall runoff time series. An attempt has been made to restrict the amount of input data to the minimum.
   Interactive manual calibration is advocated in order to allow better incorporation of field evidence and the experience of the model user. Field observations allowed for an approximate calibration at the hydrological unit level. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents the assimilation of synthetic surface soil moisture retrievals and C-band backscatter signal in a 100-meter resolution version of the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) on footprint scale soil moisture with a time interval of three hours. The synthetic surface soil moisture map was generated by extrapolating a regression relationship between in situ measurements and open loop land surface model outputs based on the soil texture of a given pixel. The surface roughness was inverted from RADARSAT-2 imagery using a modified Integral Equation Model (IEM) model. Three hourly synthetic backscatter maps were created from this surface roughness and the synthetic soil moisture. The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with bias correction was applied to mitigate the impact of nonlinear errors introduced by multi-sourced perturbations. Both time series and spatial maps were examined in the evaluation of the assimilation experiments. Results show that the assimilation of backscatter is as effective as assimilating soil moisture retrievals although the later has slightly better temporal statistics. Compared to the open loop, both approaches improved the analysis of surface and root zone soil moisture with significantly lower bias. For the later, the open loop average bias was reduced from -1.25 vol/vol to 0.59 vol/vol by backscatter assimilation and to 0.41 vol/vol by soil moisture assimilation.

AB Water-related hazards such as floods, droughts, and disease cause damage to an economy through the destruction of physical capital including property and infrastructure, the loss of human capital, and the interruption of economic activities, like trade and education. The question for policy makers is whether the impacts of water-related risk accrue to manifest as a drag on economic growth at a scale suggesting policy intervention. In this study, the average drag on economic growth from water-related hazards faced by society at a global level is estimated. We use panel regressions with various specifications to investigate the relationship between economic growth and hydroclimatic variables at the country-river basin level. In doing so, we make use of surface water runoff variables never used before. The analysis of the climate variables shows that water availability and water hazards have significant effects on economic growth, providing further evidence beyond earlier studies finding that precipitation extremes were at least as important or likely more important than temperature effects. We then incorporate a broad set of variables representing the areas of infrastructure, institutions, and information to identify the characteristics of a region that determine its vulnerability to water-related risks. The results identify water scarcity, governance, and agricultural intensity as the most relevant measures affecting vulnerabilities to climate variability effects.

AB Cooperation in transboundary river basins can make water resources systems more efficient and benefit riparian stakeholders. However, in a basin with upstream and downstream stakeholders that have different interests, noncooperative outcomes have often been observed. These can be described by a one-shot prisoners' dilemma game where noncooperation (defection) is a dominant equilibrium strategy. However, cooperative outcomes have also been observed in several transboundary settings, such as the Lancang-Mekong River Basin in Asia. Such cooperation motivates our research effort to refine relevant game theoretic descriptions to account for the evolution of players' behaviors, from conflict to cooperation. In this study, a repeated game model is proposed to analyze evolutionary transboundary cooperation. A generalized evolutionary cooperation pattern with four stages is summarized, starting with noncooperation and ending with in-depth cooperation. The Lancang-Mekong River Basin and three other typical transboundary river management case studies are chosen to validate our theoretical findings. Upstream and downstream stakeholder behaviors are analyzed for these case studies, in accordance with a game payoff matrix that accounts for incentives to cooperate. The results indicate that patience and incremental benefits can lead stakeholders to adopt a cooperative equilibrium strategy if appropriate institutional mechanisms are in place. Such mechanisms can be developed through negotiations that recognize the wide range of stakeholder interests that may influence the decision to cooperate. Our analysis suggests that game theory can provide useful insights into the conditions and institutional mechanisms that foster cooperative strategies for managing transboundary water resources.

AB An imprecise probabilistic framework for design flood estimation is proposed on the basis of the Dempster-Shafer theory to handle different epistemic uncertainties from data, probability distribution functions, and probability distribution parameters. These uncertainties are incorporated in cost-benefit analysis to generate the lower and upper bounds of the total cost for flood control, thus presenting improved information for decision making on design floods. Within the total cost bounds, a new robustness criterion is proposed to select a design flood that can tolerate higher levels of uncertainty. A variance decomposition approach is used to quantify individual and interactive impacts of the uncertainty sources on total cost. Results from three case studies, with 127, 104, and 54 year flood data sets, respectively, show that the imprecise probabilistic approach effectively combines aleatory and epistemic uncertainties from the various sources and provides upper and lower bounds of the total cost. Between the total cost and the robustness of design floods, a clear trade-off which is beyond the information that can be provided by the conventional minimum cost criterion is identified. The interactions among data, distributions, and parameters have a much higher contribution than parameters to the estimate of the total cost. It is found that the contributions of the various uncertainty sources and their interactions vary with different flood magnitude, but remain roughly the same with different return periods. This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology can effectively incorporate epistemic uncertainties in cost-benefit analysis of design floods.

AB We present a pore-network model study of capillary trapping in water-wet porous media. The amount and distribution of trapped non-wetting phase is determined by the competition between two trapping mechanisms - snap-off and cooperative pore-body filling. We develop a new model to describe the pore-body filling mechanism in geologically realistic pore-networks. The model accounts for the geometrical characteristics of the pore, the spatial location of the connecting throats and the local fluid topology at the time of the displacement. We validate the model by comparing computed capillary trapping curves with published data for four different water-wet rocks. Computations are performed on pore-networks extracted from micro-CT images and process-based reconstructions of the actual rocks used in the experiments. Compared with commonly used stochastic models, the new model describes more accurately the experimental measurements, especially for well connected porous systems where trapping is controlled by subtleties of the pore structure. The new model successfully predicts relative permeabilities and residual saturation for Bentheimer sandstone using in-situ measured contact angles as input to the simulations. The simulated trapped cluster size distributions are compared with predictions from percolation theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flood forecasts are generally associated with errors, which can be attributed to uncertainties in the meteorological forecasts and the hydrologic simulations, and ensemble spreads are usually considered capable of representing them. To quantify these two components of the total forecast errors and to compare these to ensemble spreads, an extended data set is used. Four years of operational flood forecasts at hourly time step with lead times up to 48 h are evaluated for 43 catchments in Austria and Germany. Catchment sizes range from 70 to 25,600 km(2), elevations from 200 to 3800 m, and mean annual precipitation from 700 to 2000 mm. A combination of ECMWF and ALADIN ensemble forecasts are used as input in a semidistributed conceptual water balance model on an hourly time step. The results indicate that, for short lead times, the ratio of hydrological simulation error to precipitation forecast error is 1.2 to 2.7 with increasing catchment size from 100 to 10,000 km(2). For long lead times the ratio of hydrological simulation error to precipitation forecast error decreases from 1.1 to 0.9 with increasing catchment size. Clear scaling relationships of the forecast error components with catchment area are found. A similar scaling is also found for ensemble spreads, which are shown to represent quantitatively the total forecast error when forecasting floods.

AB In integral geometry, intrinsic volumes are a set of geometrical variables to characterize spatial structures, for example, distribution of fluids in two-fluid flow in porous media. McClure et al. (2018, ) utilized this principle and proposed a geometric state function based on the intrinsic volumes. In a similar approach, we find a geometrical description for free energy of a porous system with two fluids. This is also an extension of the work by Mecke (2000, ) for energy of a single fluid. Several geometrical sets of spatial objects were defined, including bulk of the two fluids, interfaces, and three-phase contact lines. We have simplified the description of free energy by showing how the intrinsic volumes of these sets are geometrically related. We obtain a description for energy as a function of seven microscopic geometrically independent variables. In addition, using a thermodynamic approach, we find an approximation for the free energy as a function of macroscopic parameters of saturation and pressure under quasi-static conditions. The combination of the two energy descriptions, by integral geometry and thermodynamics, completes the relation between the associated variables and enables us to find the unknown coefficients of the intrinsic volumes and to calculate the amount of dissipated energy in drainage and imbibition processes. We show that the theory is consistent with a set of experiments performed by Schluter et al. (2016a, , 2017a, ). However, in order to be more conclusive, it needs to be tested with larger data sets.

TI Delta channel networks: 2. Metrics of topologic and dynamic complexity
   for delta comparison, physical inference, and vulnerability assessment
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Deltas are landforms that deliver water, sediment and nutrient fluxes from upstream rivers to the deltaic surface and eventually to oceans or inland water bodies via multiple pathways. Despite their importance, quantitative frameworks for their analysis lack behind those available for tributary networks. In a companion paper, delta channel networks were conceptualized as directed graphs and spectral graph theory was used to design a quantitative framework for exploring delta connectivity and flux dynamics. Here we use this framework to introduce a suite of graph-theoretic and entropy-based metrics, to quantify two components of a delta's complexity: (1) Topologic, imposed by the network connectivity and (2) Dynamic, dictated by the flux partitioning and distribution. The metrics are aimed to facilitate comparing, contrasting, and establishing connections between deltaic structure, process, and form. We illustrate the proposed analysis using seven deltas in diverse morphodynamic environments and of various degrees of channel complexity. By projecting deltas into a topo-dynamic space whose coordinates are given by topologic and dynamic delta complexity metrics, we show that this space provides a basis for delta comparison and physical insight into their dynamic behavior. The examined metrics are demonstrated to relate to the intuitive notion of vulnerability, measured by the impact of upstream flux changes to the shoreline flux, and reveal that complexity and vulnerability are inversely related. Finally, a spatially explicit metric, akin to a delta width function, is introduced to classify shapes of different delta types.

AB Local wind speed variations influence the energy and mass fluxes over snow through snow accumulation, sublimation of drifting and blowing snow, or variations in turbulent fluxes over static snow and ice surfaces. We use idealized model experiments to analyze the sensitivity of turbulent fluxes over static snow surfaces to variations in wind speed under different climatic conditions. We find that the sensitivity (change in the turbulent flux per change of unit wind speed) increases with increasing air temperature and relative humidity. The sensitivity of turbulent fluxes to wind speed is highest when the stability parameter zeta = 1, which occurs at wind speeds typical for glacierized catchments (3-5 m s(-1)), and exponentially decreases either side of that range. That peak insensitivity is caused by atmospheric stability corrections in the model, and occurs independently of the flux-profile relationships we tested. Our results quantify the significant effect of local wind speed variations on turbulent fluxes over snow and ice and can be used to estimate potential model uncertainties indifferent climates, especially for the typical assumption in distributed hydrological models that the wind speed is spatially constant.

ID RICHARDS EQUATION; INFILTRATION; PERCOLATION; DRAINAGE; DROPS; PHASE
AB Interplay between capillary, gravity and viscous forces in unsaturated porous media gives rise to a range of complex flow phenomena affecting morphology, stability and dynamics of wetting and drainage fronts. Similar average phase contents may result in significantly different fluid distribution and patterns affecting macroscopic transport properties of the unsaturated medium. The formulation of general force balance within simplified pore spaces yields scaling relationships for motion of liquid elements in which gravitational force in excess of capillary pinning force scales linearly with viscous force. Displacement fluid front morphology is described using dimensionless force ratios expressed as Bond and Capillary numbers. The concise representations of a wide range of flow regimes with scaling relations, and predictive capabilities of front morphology based on dimensionless numbers lend support to certain generalizations. Considering available experimental data, we are able to define conditions for onset of unstable and intermittent flows leading to enhanced liquid and gas entrapment. These results provide a basis for delineation of a tentative value of Bo similar to 0.05 as an upper limit of applicability of the Richards equation (at pore to sample scales) and related continuum-based flow models.

AB The particle support volume is crucial for simulating reactive transport with Lagrangian methods as it dictates the interaction among particles. Assuming that it is constant in space, the particle support volume can be selected by means of kernel density estimation theory, an approach that has been shown to provide accurate estimates in simple setups. However, the particle support volume should intuitively vary with the particle position and evolve with time so as to mimic the local behavior of the solute plume. In this paper, we present a new approach to select a locally optimal particle support volume in reactive transport simulations. We consider that each particle has a different support volume that can locally adapt its shape and size with time based on the nearby particle distribution. By introducing a new optimality criterion, closed-form expressions of the particle support volume are presented under certain assumptions. In advection-dominated transport, we propose to orient the support volume along the local velocities. Numerical simulations of solute transport in a randomly heterogeneous porous medium demonstrate that the new approach can substantially increase accuracy with a more rapid convergence to the true solution with the number of particles. The error reduction seen in local approaches is particularly important in regions with extreme (high and low) density of particles. The method is shown to be computationally efficient, displaying better results than traditional histogram or global kernel methods for the same computational effort.

AB Hyperconcentrated confluent floods in the Middle Yellow River and its tributaries are characterized by the phenomena of extremely high backwater stage, flood water intrusion, and local channel blockage in confluence areas. In order to study the propagation process of hyperconcentrated confluent floods, most existing channel network models need reinforcement in the computation of sediment transport and improvement in the treatment of interior boundary at channel junctions. A river network model for hyperconcentrated confluent floods is proposed based on the finite volume method scheme, in which the study domain is represented by ordinary 1-D cells and junction cells. As a preprocess step, a bathymetry interpolation algorithm is developed to generate topography data and to extract the stage-volume relationship for the junction cell. The storage change and sediment transport in the junction cell are calculated in each time step with no need to distinguish convergent or divergent flow pattern, and the solution in each reach can be executed simultaneously. The model was validated by simulating the hyperconcentrated confluent flood events in 1977 and 1966, with the maximum backwater stage and the occurrence time of flood water intrusion in the Lower Weihe River being well predicted. The response was investigated of the Middle Yellow River and Lower Weihe River to the arrangement of peak times of confluent floods, with the critical condition for flood water intrusion and the scenario that achieves the most effective scouring in the downstream channel being identified.

AB Despite significant advances during the last decades, there are still many processes related to nonequilibrium flow and transport in macroporous soil that are far from completely understood. The use of X-rays for imaging time-lapse 3-D solute transport has a large potential to help advance the knowledge in this field. We visualized the transport of potassium iodide (20 g iodide l(-1) H2O) through a small undisturbed soil column (height 3.8 cm, diameter 6.8 cm) under steady state hydraulic conditions using an industrial Xray scanner. In addition, the electrical conductivity was measured in the effluent solution during the experiment. We attained a series of seventeen 3-D difference images which we related to iodide concentrations using a linear calibration relationship. The solute transport through the soil mainly took place in two cylindrical macropores, by-passing more than 90% of the bulk soil volume during the entire experiment. From these macropores the solute diffused into the surrounding soil matrix. We illustrated the properties of the investigated solute transport by comparing it to a 1-D convective-dispersive transport and by calculating the temporal evolution of the dilution index. We furthermore showed that the tracer diffusion from one of the macropores into the surrounding soil matrix could not be exactly fitted with the cylindrical diffusion equation. We believe that similar studies will help establish links between soil structure and solute transport processes and lead to improvements in models for solute transport through undisturbed soil.

AB [1] The influence of reduced dimensionality (two-dimensional (2-D) versus 3-D) on predictions of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) infiltration and entrapment in statistically homogeneous, nonuniform permeability fields was investigated using the University of Texas Chemical Compositional Simulator (UTCHEM), a 3-D numerical multiphase simulator. Hysteretic capillary pressure - saturation and relative permeability relationships implemented in UTCHEM were benchmarked against those of another lab-tested simulator, the Michigan-Vertical and Lateral Organic Redistribution (M-VALOR). Simulation of a tetrachloroethene spill in 16 field-scale aquifer realizations generated DNAPL saturation distributions with approximately equivalent distribution metrics in two and three dimensions, with 2-D simulations generally resulting in slightly higher maximum saturations and increased vertical spreading. Variability in 2-D and 3-D distribution metrics across the set of realizations was shown to be correlated at a significance level of 95 - 99%. Neither spill volume nor release rate appeared to affect these conclusions. Variability in the permeability field did affect spreading metrics by increasing the horizontal spreading in 3-D more than in 2-D in more heterogeneous media simulations. The assumption of isotropic horizontal spatial statistics resulted, on average, in symmetric 3-D saturation distribution metrics in the horizontal directions. The practical implication of this study is that for statistically homogeneous, nonuniform aquifers, 2-D simulations of saturation distributions are good approximations to those obtained in 3-D. However, additional work will be needed to explore the influence of dimensionality on simulated DNAPL dissolution.

AB In this paper we present the equation of capture zone of a multi-well system in wedge-shaped confined and unconfined aquifers. Three wedge boundary configurations: barrier-barrier wedge, barrier-constant head wedge and constant head-constant head wedge are considered. The well system may be consisted of any number of production or injection wells or a combination of both with various flow rates. Method of image wells is used in the wedge-shaped domain and an appropriate complex function is formulated to find the capture zone. The stream function and velocity potential are derived from the imaginary part and real part of the complex function, respectively. Solutions are provided for the wedge domains with and without a uniform regional flow and can also be used for aquifers of infinite extent. The presented equations are of general character and have removed the limitations of the previous equations in regards to well numbers, positions and types, extraction/injection rate, and regional flow rate and direction. Capture envelopes are presented in dimensionless form which can be used as tools in real engineering practices to plan pump-and-treat operations, groundwater remediation projects or well-head protection plans. It is also demonstrated that the equations may also be used for the verification of numerical models. The developed equations are constrained by the image well theory limitations.

AB Path reversibility and radial symmetry are often assumed in push-pull tracer test analysis. In reality, heterogeneous flow fields mean that both assumptions are idealizations. To understand their impact, we perform a parametric study which quantifies the scattering effects of ambient flow, local-scale dispersion, and velocity field heterogeneity on push-pull breakthrough curves and compares them to the effects of mobile-immobile mass transfer (MIMT) processes including sorption and diffusion into secondary porosity. We identify specific circumstances in which MIMT overwhelmingly determines the breakthrough curve, which may then be considered uninformative about drift and local-scale dispersion. Assuming path reversibility, we develop a continuous-time-random-walk-based interpretation framework which is flow-field-agnostic and well suited to quantifying MIMT. Adopting this perspective, we show that the radial flow assumption is often harmless: to the extent that solute paths are reversible, the breakthrough curve is uninformative about velocity field heterogeneity. Our interpretation method determines a mapping function (i.e., subordinator) from travel time in the absence of MIMT to travel time in its presence. A mathematical theory allowing this function to be directly "plugged into'' an existing Laplace-domain transport model to incorporate MIMT is presented and demonstrated. Algorithms implementing the calibration are presented and applied to interpretation of data from a push-pull test performed in a heterogeneous environment. A successful four-parameter fit is obtained, of comparable fidelity to one obtained using a million-node 3-D numerical model. Finally, we demonstrate analytically and numerically how push-pull tests quantifying MIMT are sensitive to remobilization, but not immobilization, kinetics.

AB In recent years, remote sensing satellites, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), continuously monitor SM of the earth. However, the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed SM is insufficient for some hydrological applications. In this paper, a data-driven model is proposed based on a hybrid approach called artificial neural network kriging (ANNK) to capture the interaction between SM and ancillary data (AD), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude, slope, Antecedent Moisture Condition, AMC (5-day cumulative precipitation), and daily air temperature (DAT)/land surface temperature (LST). By co-regionalization of the estimated SM from the ANNK and SMAP 36-km product, SM in any part of the study area is estimated more accurately and on a finer resolution (1-km). Finally, through a linear relationship between in-situ SM with the up-to-date AD including AMC (previous 5-day cumulative precipitation), LST or DAT, slope, NDVI, and the downscaled satellite SM, the soil moisture estimates are adjusted by also adding an error term. Estimation of the final SM product in terms of the Unbiased Root Mean Square Error of less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3) meets the accuracy requirements of the SMAP SM retrieval. Moreover, the results of SM validation show that the proposed technique has a potential for real-time SM estimations in developing areas.

AB Erosion prediction tools are essential for many different aspects of land management. In this paper we examine the applicability of scaling relationships developed for river networks for the description of hillslope erosion channel networks. Eight erosion channel networks were studied on mine spoil sites in Kemmerer, Wyoming. We analysed these networks using well-known geomorphological relationships such as Horton's laws and Melton's law. An analysis of the erosion channel hydraulic geometry described by a series of power functions was also conducted. We found that the network geometry resembles larger river networks, and that the cross-sectional shapes of individual erosion channels exhibit statistical characteristics of their larger river counterparts.

AB Quantification of heterogeneous multiscale permeability in geologic porous media is key for understanding and predicting flow and transport processes in the subsurface. Recent utilization of in situ imaging, specifically positron emission tomography (PET), enables the measurement of three-dimensional (3-D) time-lapse radiotracer solute transport in geologic media. However, accurate and computationally efficient characterization of the permeability distribution that controls the solute transport process remains challenging. Leveraging the relationship between local permeability variation and solute advection behavior, an encoder-decoder based convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented as a permeability inversion scheme using a single PET scan of a radiotracer pulse injection experiment as input. The CNN can accurately capture the 3-D spatial correlation between the permeability and the radiotracer solute arrival time difference maps in geologic cores. We first test the inversion accuracy using synthetic test datasets and then test the accuracy on a suite of experimental PET imaging datasets acquired on four different geologic cores. The network-predicted permeability maps from the geologic cores are used to parameterize forward numerical models that are directly compared with the experimental PET imaging data. The results indicate that a single trained network can generate robust 3-D permeability inversion maps in seconds. Numerical models parameterized with these permeability maps closely capture the experimentally observed solute arrival time behavior. This work provides an unprecedented approach for efficiently characterizing multiscale permeability heterogeneity in complex geologic samples.

AB Relative permeability is a critical parameter characterizing multiphase flow in porous media and it is strongly dependent on the wettability. In many situations, the porous media are nonuniformly wet. To investigate the effect of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability of two-phase flow in porous media, a multi-relaxation-time color-gradient lattice Boltzmann model is adopted to simulate oil/water two-phase flow in porous media with different oil-wet solid fractions. For the water phase, when the water saturation is high, the relative permeability of water increases with the increase of oil-wet solid fraction under a constant water saturation. However, as the water saturation decreases to an intermediate value (about 0.4-0.7), the relative permeability of water in fractionally wet porous media could be lower than that in purely water-wet porous media, meaning additional flow resistance exists in the fractionally wet porous media. For the oil phase, similar phenomenon is observed. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the wettability-related microscale fluid distribution. According to both our simulation results and theoretical analysis, it is found that the relative permeability of two-phase flow in porous media is strongly related to three parameters: the fluid saturation, the specific interfacial length of fluid, and the fluid tortuosity in the flow direction. The relationship between the relative permeability and these parameters under different capillary numbers is explored in this paper.

AB A pavement outcrop with excellent exposure of spatial relationships among joints, veins, small offset normal faults, and associated alteration halos (redox fronts) provided an opportunity to compare predictions of analytical models for reaction front propagation in a fracture-matrix system with a real-field situation. The results have important implications for fluid flow and pollutant transport through a fractured medium. The alteration halos observed suggest that all joints of different sets and most small faults are conductive to meteoric water at shallow depth. On the other hand, veins are local barriers to mass transport by diffusion. By using petrologic and petrophysical data, analytical modeling, and the width of the alteration halos, it was possible to estimate when the fracture network was open to fluid flow. The inferred time for fluid flow and diffusion through the fracture network is sensitive to the porosity n of the rock matrix used in the analytical solutions: 2200 +/- 500 years with n=0.08, 4600 +/- 900 years with n=0.05, and 16,000 +/- 4000 with n=0.02. The second and third age determinations are consistent with the landscape evolution of the area since the end of the last Wurmian ice age and with the timing required to fill the fractures observed in outcrop. We suggest that analytical modeling is an important tool for the determination of transport and reaction time scales in fractured formations where it is constrained by a robust petrophysical and chemical properties data set.

AB Understanding the spatial structure of daily streamflow is essential for managing freshwater resources, especially in poorly gaged regions. Spatial scaling assumptions are common in flood frequency prediction (e.g., index-flood method) and the prediction of continuous streamflow at ungaged sites (e.g. drainage-area ratio), with simple scaling by drainage area being the most common assumption. In this study, scaling analyses of daily streamflow from 173 streamgages in the southeastern United States resulted in three important findings. First, the use of only positive integer moment orders, as has been done in most previous studies, captures only the probabilistic and spatial scaling behavior of flows above an exceedance probability near the median; negative moment orders (inverse moments) are needed for lower streamflows. Second, assessing scaling by using drainage area alone is shown to result in a high degree of omitted-variable bias, masking the true spatial scaling behavior. Multiple regression is shown to mitigate this bias, controlling for regional heterogeneity of basin attributes, especially those correlated with drainage area. Previous univariate scaling analyses have neglected the scaling of low-flow events and may have produced biased estimates of the spatial scaling exponent. Third, the multiple regression results show that mean flows scale with an exponent of one, low flows scale with spatial scaling exponents greater than one, and high flows scale with exponents less than one. The relationship between scaling exponents and exceedance probabilities may be a fundamental signature of regional streamflow. This signature may improve our

AB The fluctuation in sea level induced by tides generates an upper saline plume (USP) in the intertidal region, which is closely related to groundwater flow and solute transport processes in coastal aquifers. Thus, a clearer understanding of the USP configuration is needed to accurately predict the extent of seawater intrusion and water chemical fluxes to the ocean. This study experimentally and numerically examined the effect of transient external forcing conditions on the stability of tide-induced USP, represented as seasonal subsurface inflow. In contrast to earlier studies, the USP was not always stable or unstable, but experienced a dynamic transformation of stability-instability as the seasonal subsurface inflow fluctuated. The same intensity of subsurface inflow caused a stable USP in the fixed cases but a dynamic USP state in the seasonal cases. The USP responded rapidly to the fluctuation of seasonal subsurface inflow and was drawn to expand into the intertidal zone. These features of the USP contributed to the increased potential for the onset of an unstable flow when the subsurface inflow varied seasonally. Therefore, ignoring the timescale changes on external forcing conditions may underestimate the generation of unstable USPs. The frequency contrast between seasonal subsurface inflow and tide also influenced the dynamic transformation process occurring in the intertidal region. There was an inverse relationship between the frequency contrast and the duration of the unstable flow. These findings provide a new understanding of the complex intertidal environment in coastal aquifers.

AB A data set containing hydrometeorological and hydroclimatological data for 3,540 watersheds in North America is described. The data set contains four main parts: (a) observed hydrometeorological data including daily streamflow observations, precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature; (b) 20 bias-corrected climate model projections for two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios and five bias correction methods; (c) hydrological model calibration parameters and simulated streamflow for 4 hydrological models, 2 objective functions, and 10 calibration parameter sets for the reference period; and (d) hydrological simulations for each of the combinations of the abovementioned elements of the climate change impact study chain, for a total of 16,000 combinations. The data set also contains simulations and bias-corrected climate for 30-year horizons corresponding to 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C temperature increases for a subset of the climate models, for an additional 8,000 combinations. All simulations in the reference period are also provided. Fifty-one precomputed hydrological indices are made available for each simulation. Overall, 2.89 x 10(12) years of simulations are classified, analyzed, compressed, and made available for all researchers. This data set can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of various components in the impact study chain, to establish relationships between catchment properties and hydrological response to climate change, and to evaluate the spatial distribution of hydrological change according to a multitude of hydrological indices.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

AB [ 1] The gas phase partitioning tracer method was used to measure air-water interfacial area as a function of water content for eight sandy porous media. The porous media comprised a series of sands with narrow particle size ranges, a sand with a wider particle size distribution, a sandy soil, and a loamy sandy soil. The measurement range was extended to very low water contents in an attempt to determine upper limits for air-water interfacial areas. The measured values were compared to the normalized surface areas of the porous media. The results of the experiments showed that the magnitude of the air-water interfacial areas increased with decreasing water saturation and approached that of the normalized surface areas. Generally, air-water interfacial areas were larger for media with larger specific surface areas. The change in air-water interfacial area with changing water saturation was less near saturated water contents and greater at smaller values. In addition, the change was greater for the poorly sorted media than the well-sorted media. An empirical equation was developed to describe the observed relationship between air-water interfacial area and water saturation. The coefficients of the equation were found to correlate to the porous medium uniformity coefficient. With this equation and associated correlations, only bulk density, specific surface area, and uniformity coefficient are needed to estimate air-water interfacial area for a given water saturation. The equation was shown to provide a reasonable description of a literature data set.

AB This paper presents a development of water potential functions for a dual porosity nonrigid aggregated soil medium defined and characterized by its characteristic shrinkage curve. Fractal and thermodynamic approaches to modeling soil water potential are evaluated using simultaneous and continuously measured soil shrinkage and tensiometric curves on a standard laboratory soil sample. Water potential relationships are developed and analyzed for five Ivory Cost soils with clay content ranging from 10 to 50%. Analysis of modeled and observed results showed that the tensiometric curve, for its entire range of measurement, is directly linked to the interped water pool. The tensiometric curve, which is a function of the interped water pool, was modeled using both the fractal and the thermodynamical equations. Fits to the measured tensiometric curves were very well. This study demonstrates the link between the tensiometric curve with some of the pedostructure (soil-water medium) variables and parameters determined by the shrinkage curve, which leads to physically based equations of soil water potential. An interpretation of the origin of the swelling pressure inside and outside the primary peds and of the resulting suction pressure in unsaturated aggregated soils is proposed and discussed. This interpretation explains the link between the generalized Low's [1979] equation for the thermodynamic properties of the hydration layers of water surrounding particles in primary peds and the equations given by Berezin et al. [1983] for the swelling and the suction pressures in unsaturated aggregates.

AB Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are an effective tool for identifying watershed biogeochemical source and transport dynamics over short and long timescales. We examined stormflow C-Q, hysteresis, and flushing patterns of total suspended sediment (TSS) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in two stream reaches of a severely impaired agricultural watershed in northeastern Wisconsin, USA. The upper watershed reach-draining a relatively flat, row crop-dominated contributing area-showed predominantly anti-clockwise TSS hysteresis during storms, suggesting that particulate materials were mobilized more from distal upland sources than near- and in-channel areas. In contrast, the incised lower watershed reach produced strong TSS flushing responses on the rising limb of storm hydrographs and clockwise hysteresis, signalling rapid mobilization of near- and in-channel materials with increasing event flows. C-Q relationships for SRP showed complex patterns in both the upper and lower reaches, demonstrating largely non-linear chemodynamic C-Q behaviour during events. As with TSS, anti-clockwise SRP hysteresis in the upper reach suggested a delay in the hydrologic connectivity between SRP sources and the stream, with highly variable SRP concentrations during some events. A broad range of clockwise, anti-clockwise, and complex SRP hysteresis patterns occurred in the lower watershed, possibly influenced by in-channel legacy P stores and connection to tile drainage networks in the lower watershed area. Total suspended sediment and SRP responses were also strongly related to precipitation event characteristics including antecedent precipitation, recovery period, and precipitation intensity, highlighting the complexity of stormflow sediment and phosphorus responses in this severely impaired agricultural stream.

AB Empirical prediction of soil erosion has both scientific and practical importance. This investigation tested USLE and USLE-based procedures to predict bare plot soil loss at the Sparacia area, in Sicily. Event soil loss per unit area, A(e), did not vary appreciably with plot length, , because the decrease in runoff with was offset by an increase in sediment concentration. Slope steepness, s, had a positive effective on A(e), and this result was associated with a runoff coefficient that did not vary appreciably with s and a sediment concentration generally increasing with s. Plot steepness did not have a statistically detectable effect on the calculations of the soil erodibility factor of both the USLE, K, and the USLE-M, K-UM, models, but a soil-independent relationship between K-UM and K was not found. The erosivity index of the USLE-MM model performed better than the erosivity index of the Central and Southern Italy model. In conclusion, the importance of an approach allowing soil loss predictions that do not necessarily increase with was confirmed together with the usability of already established and largely applied relationships to predict steepness effects. Soil erodibility has to be determined with reference to the specific mathematical scheme and conversion between different schemes seems to need taking into account the soil characteristics. The USLE-MM shows promise for further developments. The evolutionary concept applied in the development of the USLE should probably be rediscovered to improve development of soil erosion prediction tools. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Regionalization approaches to daily streamflow prediction are investigated for 13 catchments in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model of low complexity (six parameters). Model parameters are considered to represent the dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) of a catchment. It is demonstrated that all catchments within the region cannot be assumed to have a similar hydrological behaviour, and thence a regionalization approach considering differences in physical catchment descriptors (PCDs) is required. Such a regionalization approach can be regarded as a top-down method, in the sense that factors controlling parameter variability are identified first within the entire region under study, and then such information is exploited to predict runoff in a smaller sub-region. Regionalization results reveal that consideration of interrelations between dependent variables, which here are the parameters of the rainfall-runoff model, can improve performance of regression as a regionalization method. Breaking the parameter correlation structure inherent in the model, and exploiting merely relationships between model parameters and PCDs (no matter how weakly related they are), can result in a significant decrease in regionalization performance. Also, high significance of regression between values of PCDs and DRCs does not guarantee a set of parameters with a good predictive power. When there is a reason to believe that, in the sense of hydrological behaviour, a gauged catchment resembles the ungauged catchment, then it may be worthwhile to adopt the entire set of calibrated parameters from the gauged catchment instead of deriving quantitative relationships between catchment descriptors and model parameters.

ID IN-FIELD SOILS; TRANSPORT; CAHILL,ANTHONY,T.; MOVEMENT
AB Field measurements conducted by Cahill and Parlange (1998) are reanalyzed to verify if their conclusion that daytime peak values of 60-70 W m(-2) of latent heat flux divergence occurred in the 7-10 cm soil layer of a drying Yolo silt loam when maximum values of surface latent heat flux are estimated to have been about 100 W m(-2). The new analyses, as similar to theirs as possible, are validated using a numerical simulation of coupled soil moisture and heat flow based on Philip and de Vries (1957) as a test bed. The numerical simulation is extended to include the flow of air induced by diurnal soil heating and evaporative water loss to verify the flux divergence calculations reported in Parlange et al. (1998) that explained the findings of Cahill and Parlange (1998). It is shown that the conclusions of both of these papers are in error, so that the original version of the Philip and de Vries (1957) theory is consistent with their field measurements after all and the effects of airflow associated with soil heating and liquid water loss (and low-frequency barometric pressure variations also considered) are negligible in practice. In an additional investigation, enhancement of diffusive vapor flow (first postulated by Philip and de Vries (1957)) and discussed extensively in the literature since is shown to have negligible effects on cumulative evaporation under field conditions.

AB We propose a novel direct method for estimating steady state hydrogeological model parameters and model state variables in an aquifer where boundary conditions are unknown. The method is adapted from a recently developed potential theory technique for solving general inverse/reconstruction problems. Unlike many inverse techniques used for groundwater model calibration, the new method is not based on fitting and optimizing an objective function, which usually requires forward simulation and iterative parameter updates. Instead, it directly incorporates noisy observed data (hydraulic heads and flow rates) at the measurement points in a single step, without solving a boundary value problem. The new method is computationally efficient and is robust to the presence of observation errors. It has been tested on two-dimensional groundwater flow problems with regular and irregular geometries, different heterogeneity patterns, variances of heterogeneity, and error magnitudes. In all cases, parameters (hydraulic conductivities) converge to the correct or expected values and are thus unique, based on which heads and flow fields are constructed directly via a set of analytical expressions. Accurate boundary conditions are then inferred from these fields. The accuracy of the direct method also improves with increasing amount of observed data, lower measurement errors, and grid refinement. Under natural flow (i.e., no pumping), the direct method yields an equivalent conductivity of the aquifer, suggesting that the method can be used as an inexpensive characterization tool with which both aquifer parameters and aquifer boundary conditions can be inferred.

ID ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; WATER CONTENT; PROPAGATION
AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a proven, nondestructive method for the measurement of the permittivity and electrical conductivity of soils, using electromagnetic (EM) waves. Standard interpretation of TDR data leads to the estimation of the soil's equivalent electromagnetic properties since the wavelengths associated with the source signal are considerably greater than the microstructure of the soil. The aforementioned approximation tends to hide an important issue: the influence of the microstructure and phase configuration in the generation of a polarized electric field, which is complicated because of the presence of numerous length scales. In this paper, the influence of the microstructural distribution of each phase on the TDR signal has been studied. We propose a two-step EM modeling technique at a microscale range (200 mu m): first, we define an equivalent grain including a thin shell of free water, and second, we solve Maxwell's equations over the discretized, statistically distributed triphasic porous medium. Modeling of the TDR probe with the soil sample was performed using a three-dimensional finite difference time domain scheme. The effectiveness of this hybrid homogenization approach is tested on unsaturated Nemours sand with narrow granulometric fractions. The comparisons made between numerical and experimental results are promising, despite significant assumptions concerning (1) the TDR probe head and the coaxial cable and (2) the assumed effective medium theory homogenization associated with the electromagnetic processes arising locally between the liquid and solid phases at the grain scale.

AB Rates of mass and gene transfer reactions involving biotic phases are often expressed as proportional to local number densities of bacteria. When the reactions involve attached bacteria, reaction rates depend on local densities of bacteria attached to surfaces. Such may be the case with microbially-facilitated redox reactions involving mineral electron donors and mineral electron receivers (e.g., Sam RK, Peyton BM, Amonette JE, Dohnalkova A. Reoxidation of uranium in the presence of iron(III)-(hydr)oxides under sulfate reducing conditions. Environ Sci Technol 2005;39:2059-66), biofilm formation induced by quorum sensing (Purevdorj B, Costerton JW, Stoodley P. Influence of hydrodynamics and cell signaling on the structure and behavior of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms. Appl Environ Microbiol 2002;68(9):4457-64) and horizontal gene transfer among attached phase bacteria (Beaudoin DL, Bryers JD, Cunningham AB, Peretti SW. Mobilization of broad host range plasmid from Pseudomonas putida to established biofilm of Bacillus azotoformans. I. Experiments. Biotech Bioeng 1998a;57(3):272-79; Beaudoin DL, Bryers JD, Cunningham AB, Peretti SW. Mobilization of broad host range plasmid from Pseudomonas putida to established biofilm of Bacillus azotoformans. II. Modeling Biotech Bioeng 1998b;57(3):28086). Here we use the conceptual Happel sphere-in-cell model to determine the microscopic distribution of attached bacteria on idealized spherical grains of porous media, assuming azimuthal symmetry. We extend a Lagrangian model of colloid filtration to investigate the effects of motility of Escherichia coli on attachment rate and on the attachment distribution as a function of location on grain surface. The hydrodynamics of the Happel model is implicitly 3D and represented in 2D polar coordinates under the assumption of axisymmetric flow, while the motility of the E. coli cells is explicitly 3D. The model incorporates the fate and transport processes of colloid filtration theory in the particle tracking approach of Nelson and Ginn (Nelson KE, Ginn TR. Theoretical investigation of bacterial chemotaxis in porous media. Langmuir 2001;17:5636-45; Nelson KE, Ginn TR. Colloid filtration theory and the Happel sphere-in-cell model revisited with direct numerical simulation. Langmuir 2005;21:2173-84) and includes statistics reported in Biondi et al. (Biondi SA, Quinn JA, Goldfine H. Random motility of swimming bacteria in restricted geometries. AIChE J 1998;44(8):1923-29) to describe the "run & tumble" behavior of individual E. coli cells. Incorporation of the motility allowed for comparative modeling of diffusion-controlled vs. motility-controlled transport and attachment in the Happel sphere. It was found that, whereas the Levy distribution is often associated with the distribution of run lengths for this species, the data of Biondi is better fit by a Gamma distribution due to the low frequency of short runs, and that the turn distribution is non-uniform. Further, the motility mean free path is much larger than that corresponding to Brownian diffusion and the attachment frequency is higher in the case of motile cells as a result. However the distribution of attached cells is similar in both motile-and diffusive cases. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many studies have investigated the exchange processes that occur between rivers and groundwater systems and have successfully quantified the water fluxes involved. Specifically, these exchange processes include hyporheic exchange, river-aquifer exchange (groundwater discharge and river loss) and bank storage exchange. Remarkably, there are relatively few examples of field studies where more than one exchange process is quantified, and as a consequence, the relationships between them are not well understood. To compare the relative magnitudes of these common exchange processes, we have collected data from 54 studies that have quantified one or more of these exchange flux types. Each flux value is plotted against river discharge at the time of measurement to allow the different exchange flux types to be compared. We show that there are positive relationships between the magnitude of each exchange flux type and increasing river discharge across the different studies. For every one order of magnitude increase in river discharge, the hyporheic, river-aquifer and bank storage exchange fluxes increase by factors of 2.7, 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. On average, hyporheic exchange fluxes are almost an order of magnitude greater than river-aquifer exchange fluxes, which are, in turn, approximately four times greater than bank storage exchange fluxes for the same river discharge. Unless measurement approaches that can distinguish between different types of exchange flux are used, there is potential for hyporheic exchange fluxes to be misinterpreted as river-aquifer exchange fluxes, with possible implications for water resource management decisions.

AB Equatorial glacier-fed streams present unique hydraulic patterns when compared to glacier-fed observed in temperate regions as the main variability in discharge occurs on a daily basis. To assess how benthic fauna respond to these specific hydraulic conditions, we investigated the relationships between flow regime, hydraulic conditions (boundary Reynolds number, Re*), and macroinvertebrate communities (taxon richness and abundance) in a tropical glacier-fed stream located in the high Ecuadorian Andes (> 4000m). Both physical and biotic variables were measured under four discharge conditions (base-flow and glacial flood pulses of various intensities), at 30 random points, in two sites whose hydraulic conditions were representative to those found in other streams of the study catchment. While daily glacial flood pulses significantly increased hydraulic stress in the benthic habitats (appearance of Re*>2000), low stress areas still persisted even during extreme flood events (Re*<500). In contrast to previous research in temperate glacier-fed streams, taxon richness and abundance were not significantly affected by changes in hydraulic conditions induced by daily glacial flood pulses. However, we found that a few rare taxa, in particular rare ones, preferentially occurred in highly stressed hydraulic habitats. Monte-Carlo simulations of benthic communities under glacial flood reduction scenarios predicted that taxon richness would be significantly reduced by the loss of high hydraulic stress habitats following glacier shrinking. This pioneer study on the relationship between hydraulic conditions and benthic diversity in an equatorial glacial stream evidenced unknown effects of climate change on singular yet endangered aquatic systems.

TI What do we mean by sensitivity analysis? The need for comprehensive
   characterization of "global'' sensitivity in Earth and Environmental
   systems models
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
ID PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE
AB Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental Systems modeling. However, the term "sensitivity'' has a clear definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally around a particular point (e. g., optimal solution) in the problem space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for "global sensitivity'' across the problem space, when considering one or more model responses to different factors such as model parameters or forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different "intuitive'' understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting "global'' interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With this background, we identify several important properties of response surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.

AB A systematic approach has been developed to estimate the relationship between the permeability and connectivity of two-dimensional fracture networks, in which the network connectivity is evaluated with the concept of geological entropy as informative index of spatial disorder. The geological entropy is quantified by the entropic scale, a metric developed by Bianchi and Pedretti (2018), which is here applied to integrate multiple properties of two-dimensional fracture networks, including aperture, spacing, length, orientation. Through the comparisons among several existing connectivity indicators including the entropic scale in an illustrative example, only the entropic scale is positively correlated with the permeability concerning aperture and can be successfully used to quantify the network connectivity. In order to understand connectivity characteristics dependence of the permeability, a computational method combining fracture network generation and steady-state flow simulation is developed. Based on the results of detailed numerical simulations considering hydraulic behavior and connectivity characteristic in various fracture networks, the entropic scale and permeability are simultaneously inversely proportional to length and proportional to spacing with the same global entropy, but exhibit weak dependence on the orientation variation. A simple closed-form empirical expression in terms of quadratic polynomial model between the permeability and entropic scale is proposed. The results indicated that geological entropy is valid and appropriate to quantify the connectivity and predict the permeability of two-dimensional fracture networks.

AB Soil-moisture patterns in floodplains are highly dynamic, owing to the complex relationships between soil properties, climatic conditions at the surface, and the position of the water table. Given this complexity, along with climate change scenarios in many regions, there is a need for a model to investigate the implications of different conditions on water availability to riparian vegetation. We present a model, HaughFlow, which is able to predict coupled water movement in the vadose and phreatic zones of hydraulically connected floodplains. Model output was calibrated and evaluated at six sites in Australia to identify key patterns in subsurface hydrology. This study identifies the importance of the capillary fringe in vadose zone hydrology due to its water storage capacity and creation of conductive pathways. Following peaks in water table elevation, water can be stored in the capillary fringe for up to months (depending on the soil properties). This water can provide a critical resource for vegetation that is unable to access the water table. When water table peaks coincide with heavy rainfall events, the capillary fringe can support saturation of the entire soil profile. HaughFlow is used to investigate the water availability to riparian vegetation, producing daily output of water content in the soil over decadal time periods within different depth ranges. These outputs can be summarized to support scientific investigations of plant-water relations, as well as in management applications.

AB This study, building on the comprehensive discharge potential theory presented by Strack and Ausk (2015) https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR016887, discovered that the effects of layer arrangements on steady state seawater intrusion and groundwater discharge in stratified confined coastal aquifers can be approximated via transmissivity centroid elevation (TCE), defined as the summation of the product of the transmissivity and elevation (above the aquifer base) of each layer divided by the total aquifer transmissivity. Specifically, a higher TCE in aquifers with high transmissivity layers at high elevations results in a more landward interface-toe position in both flux- and head-controlled coastal aquifer systems, as well as a higher freshwater discharge rate in head-controlled systems. Furthermore, the toe position in head-controlled stratified systems is only a function of the TCE and independent of the total transmissivity. Therefore, we can estimate the upper limit of seawater intrusion, that is, the furthest inland toe position, in stratified aquifers by letting the TCE equal to the elevation of the aquifer top. Another important implication of our results is that the interface toe position in coastal aquifers containing a preferential flow layer is controlled by the elevation of the preferential flow layer. Additionally, effective parameters and homogenization of the interface flow in stratified aquifers were developed to approximate the toe position and discharge rate. The results developed in this study provide significant advances in understanding the effect of aquifer stratification on groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers.

AB Temporal fluctuations of water flux have been investigated as a mechanism that strongly enhances transverse dispersion in heterogeneous media. Unfortunately, most results have been obtained by linear stochastic theories on permeability fields of limited variability. Worse, results are inconsistent regarding the impact of fluctuations on longitudinal dispersion, which motivates our work to find the effect of temporal velocity fluctuations on macrodispersion. We perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations for highly variable permeability fields of up to 800 correlation lengths. We find that fluctuations longitudinal to the main flow direction hardly modify macrodispersion because they do not alter the flow lines. Fluctuations transverse to the main flow direction not only increase transverse dispersion, which is well known, but also reduce the longitudinal macrodispersion in a significant and consistent way, which contradicts previous findings. The reduction of the longitudinal dispersion is comparable to the increase of transverse dispersion. Most surprisingly, for high heterogeneity, temporal fluctuations cause total (longitudinal plus transverse) macrodispersion to drop with respect to the steady state one. Enhancement of the transverse macrodispersion comes from both the increase of the transverse velocity variability and Lagrangian correlation. Reduction of the longitudinal macrodispersion results from the reduction of the Lagrangian correlation of the longitudinal velocity. That is, temporal fluctuations reduce longitudinal spreading both by breaking the fastest velocity paths on the plume front and by letting solute bypass the low-permeability zones that tend to block or trap the solute in steady state flow conditions.

AB Soil moisture plays an important role in hydrology. Understanding factors (such as topography, vegetation, and meteorological conditions) that influence spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture, and how this influence is manifested, is important for understanding hydrological processes. A number of distributed (quasi-)physical hydrological models have been developed to investigate this subject. Previous studies have shown that the spatial differences in the distribution of soil types (residual and colluvial soils) dominantly reflect spatio-temporal fluctuations in soil moisture and runoff.
   We present a methodology for assessing the spatial distribution of residual and colluvial soils, which differ with respect to their physical characteristics, in a 0.88 km(2) forested catchment with complex topography and a complex land-use history. Our method is based on penetration resistance profile data; in this data set, each data point represents soil physical characteristics within an area of about 25 m(2). If the spatial distribution of soils under similar meteorological, geological, historical land use, and other conditions could be characterized on the basis of similarity in topographic features, then the spatial distribution of soil could be predicted based on relationships between various topographic indices (e.g. topographic index and local slope). We tested whether our model correctly assessed the reference data. The model's results were 90.5% correct for residual soils and 87.3% correct for colluvial soils. Further studies will quantify the relationships between topographic features of land covered by residual and colluvial soils and changes in spatio-temporal variations in the catchment (e.g. vegetation and land use) as a function of geology or meteorology.

AB Hydrogen is a promising alternative to carbon based energy carriers and may be stored in large quantities in subsurface storage deposits. This work assesses the impact of static (density and phase equilibria) and dynamic (viscosity and diffusion coefficients) properties on the pressure field during the injection and extraction of hydrogen in the porous subsurface. In a first step, we derive transport properties for water, hydrogen and their mixture using the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory equation of state in combination with an entropy scaling approach and compare model predictions to alternative models from the literature. Our model compares excellently to experimental transport coefficients and models from literature with a higher number of adjustable parameters, such as GERG2008, and shows a clear improvement over empirical correlations for transport coefficients of hydrogen. In a second step, we determine the effect of further model reduction by comparing our against a much simpler model applying empirical transport coefficients from the literature. For this purpose, hydrogen is periodically injected into and extracted out of a dome-shaped porous aquifer under a caprock. Our results show that density and viscosity of hydrogen have the highest impact on the pressure field, and that a thermodynamic model like the new model presented here is essential for modeling the storage aquifer, while keeping the number of coefficients at a minimum. In diffusion-dominated settings such as the diffusion of hydrogen through the caprock, our developed diffusion coefficients show a much improved dependence on temperature and pressure, leading to a more accurate approximation of the diffusive fluxes.

AB The movement of particulate matter within wetland surface waters affects nutrient cycling, contaminant mobility, and the evolution of the wetland landscape. Despite the importance of particle transport in influencing wetland form and function, there are few data sets that illuminate, in a quantitative way, the transport behavior of particulate matter within surface waters containing emergent vegetation. We report observations from experiments on the transport of 1 mm latex microspheres at a wetland field site located in Water Conservation Area 3A of the Florida Everglades. The experiments involved line source injections of particles inside two 4.8-m-long surface water flumes constructed within a transition zone between an Eleocharis slough and Cladium jamaicense ridge and within a Cladium jamaicense ridge. We compared the measurements of particle transport to calculations of two-dimensional advection-dispersion model that accounted for a linear increase in water velocities with elevation above the ground surface. The results of this analysis revealed that particle spreading by longitudinal and vertical dispersion was substantially greater in the ridge than within the transition zone and that particle capture by aquatic vegetation lowered surface water particle concentrations and, at least for the timescale of our experiments, could be represented as an irreversible, first-order kinetics process. We found generally good agreement between our field-based estimates of particle dispersion and water velocity and estimates determined from published theory, suggesting that the advective-dispersive transport of particulate matter within complex wetland environments can be approximated on the basis of measurable properties of the flow and aquatic vegetation.

AB Understanding ecologically sensitive wetlands often requires non-invasive methods to characterize their complex structure (e.g., deposit heterogeneity) and hydrogeological parameters (e.g., porosity and hydraulic conductivity). Here, electrical conductivities of a riparian wetland were obtained using frequency domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) methods. The wetland was previously characterized by extensive intrusive measurements and 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys and hence offers an ideal opportunity to objectively assess EMI methods. Firstly, approaches to obtain structural information (e.g., elevation and thickness of alluvium) from EMI data and inverted models were assessed. Regularized and sharp inversion algorithms were investigated for ERT calibrated EMI data. Moreover, the importance of EMI errors in inversion was investigated. The hydrological information content was assessed using correlations with piezometric data and petrophysical models. It was found that EMI data were dominated by the thickness of peaty alluvial soils and relatively insensitive to topography and total alluvial thickness. Furthermore, although error weighting in the inversion improved the accuracy of alluvial soil thickness predictions, the multi-linear regression method performed the best. For instance, an iso-conductivity method to estimate the alluvial soil thickness in the regularized models had a normalized mean absolute difference (NMAD) of 21.4%, and although this performed better than the sharp inversion algorithm (NMAD = 65.3%), the multi-linear regression approach (using 100 intrusive observations) achieved a NMAD = 18.0%. In terms of hydrological information content, correlations between EMI results and piezometric data were poor, however robust relationships between petrophysically derived porosity and hydraulic conductivity were observed for the alluvial soils and gravels.

AB Explaining the response of catchments with a mix of pervious and impervious surfaces requires the inclusion of controls other than catchment imperviousness. In this study, we made use of a large sample of 70,227 events in 852 U.S. catchments to analyze the interplay of total impervious area (TIA) and antecedent soil moisture (ASM) in determining the event runoff ratio (RR). First, we investigated the importance of TIA as a spatial control compared to other catchment attributes (describing climate and catchment landscape) in explaining the differences between catchments in terms of median event-scale RR. Second, we examined the importance of ASM as a temporal control of the variability of RR in comparison with spatial settings and event characteristics. Third, events were grouped into 30 classes of TIA and 30 classes of ASM, and linear regression models were used to analyze the evolution of RR depending on each one of the two independent variables. Results showed the following: (1) Analysis of the importance of space-varying catchment descriptors highlighted the relevance of TIA as a control of catchment response, whereas ASM showed a stronger ability compared to other event characteristics. (2) ASM played a significant role in urbanized catchments as in rural ones. The absence of abrupt changes in the linear model parameters indicates that the impact of urbanization on the relationship between RR and ASM was relatively gradual. (3) Differences in RR between rural and intensively urbanized catchments were observable not only for dry pre-event conditions but also for wet short-term conditions.

AB Horizontal drilling has become an appealing technology for water resource exploration or aquifer remediation in recent decades, due to decreasing operational cost and many technical advantages over vertical wells. However, many previous studies on flow into horizontal wells were based on the Uniform Flux Boundary Condition (UFBC), which does not reflect the physical processes of flow inside the well accurately. In this study, we investigated transient flow into a horizontal well in an anisotropic confined aquifer laterally bounded by two constant-head boundaries. Three types of boundary conditions were employed to treat the horizontal well, including UFBC, Uniform-Head Boundary Condition (UHBC), and Mixed-Type Boundary Condition (MTBC). The MTBC model considered both kinematic and frictional effects inside the horizontal well, in which the kinematic effect referred to the accelerational and fluid-inflow effects. A new solution of UFBC was derived by superimposing the point sink/source solutions along the axis of a horizontal well with a uniform flux distribution. New solutions of UHBC and MTBC were obtained by a hybrid analytical-numerical method, and an iterative method was proposed to determine the well discretization required for achieving sufficiently accurate results. This study showed that the differences among the UFBC, UHBC, and MTBC solutions were obvious near the well screen, decreased with distance from the well, and became negligible near the constant-head boundary. The relationship between the flow rate and the drawdown was nonlinear for the MTBC solution, while it was linear for the UFBC and UHBC solutions.

AB Precipitation data in mountain basins are typically sparse and subject to uncertainty due to difficulties in measurement and capturing spatial variability. Streamflow provides indirect information about basin-mean precipitation, but inferring precipitation from streamflow requires assumptions about hydrologic model structure that influence precipitation amounts. In this study, we test the extent to which using both snow and streamflow observations reduces differences in inferred annual total precipitation, compared to inference from streamflow alone. The case study area is the upper Tuolumne River basin in the Sierra Nevada of California, where distributed and basin-mean snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates have been made using LiDAR as part of the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). To reconstruct basin-mean SWE for years prior to the ASO campaign, we test for a robust relationship between SWE estimates from ASO and from snow courses and pillows, which have a longer record. Relative to ASO's distributed SWE observations, point SWE measurements in this part of the Sierra Nevada tend to overestimate SWE at a given elevation, but undersample high-elevation areas. We then infer precipitation from snow and streamflow, obtained from multiple hydrologic model structures. When included in precipitation inference, snow data reduce by up to one third the standard deviations of the water year total precipitation between model structures and improve the consistency between structures in terms of the yearly variability in precipitation. We reiterate previous findings that multiple types of hydrologic data improve the consistency of modeled physical processes and help identify the most appropriate model structures.

AB Although ephemeral catchments are widespread in arid and semiarid climates, the relationship of their water balance with climate, geology, topography, and land cover is poorly known. Here we use 4 years (2011-2014) of rainfall, streamflow, and groundwater level measurements to estimate the water balance components in two adjacent ephemeral catchments in south-eastern Australia, with one catchment planted with young eucalypts and the other dedicated to grazing pasture. To corroborate the interpretation of the observations, the physically based hydrological model CATHY was calibrated and validated against the data in the two catchments. The estimated water balances showed that despite a significant decline in groundwater level and greater evapotranspiration in the eucalypt catchment (104-119% of rainfall) compared with the pasture catchment (95-104% of rainfall), streamflow consistently accounted for 1-4% of rainfall in both catchments for the entire study period. Streamflow in the two catchments was mostly driven by the rainfall regime, particularly rainfall frequency (i.e., the number of rain days per year), while the downslope orientation of the plantation furrows also promoted runoff. With minimum calibration, the model was able to adequately reproduce the periods of flow in both catchments in all years. Although streamflow and groundwater levels were better reproduced in the pasture than in the plantation, model-computed water balance terms confirmed the estimates from the observations in both catchments. Overall, the interplay of climate, topography, and geology seems to overshadow the effect of land use in the study catchments, indicating that the management of ephemeral catchments remains highly challenging.

AB The study of the relationship between flow structure and morphodynamic of bars in a channel expansion/contraction is essential to better understand the processes that control the evolution of rivers. Thus, multibeam echosoundings and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP) measurements were performed with a high temporal resolution in an expansion/contraction zone of the Loire River (France) occupied by bars. During the monitoring period, the macroforms presented successively an alternate, a lateral and a transverse configuration. Field data were analyzed to study how the primary and secondary velocities, the flow directions, the bed shear stresses, and the bed roughnesses (associated to dunes) evolve as a function of the water discharge and bars configuration. The bars modify the flow structure imposed by the channel width variations. In fact, the bars induce a topographic forcing which enables the separation and reducing of the mixing of two currents formed in the upstream channel expansion. This forcing is enhanced by the turbulence formed by the large dunes superimposed on the bars. Therefore, the bars promote a nonuniform flow in the channel. In turn, in the channel expansion/contraction, the migrating bars' morphodynamics are affected by the downstream channel narrowing which stops their downstream migration and forced the bars in the system. Then the nonuniformity of the flow encourages the lateral migration of the macroforms until they reach a bank and become nonmigrating. Finally, the nonmigrating bars are eroded by the flow deflected during the migration of a new bar in the channel expansion/contraction.

TI Accelerated lake expansion on the Tibetan Plateau in the 2000s: Induced

AB Alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are minimally disturbed by human activities and are sensitive indicators of climate variability. Accelerated lake expansion in the 2000s has been confirmed by both dramatic lake-area increases (for 312 lakes larger than 10 km(2)) derived from optical images, and rapid water-level rises (for 117 lakes with water-level data) measured by satellite altimetry. However, the underlying climate causes remain unclear. This paper analyzes the relationship between the water-level changes of lakes on the plateau and the potential driving factors, such as the glacier meltwater supply and a dependency on precipitation and runoff over the whole plateau and in each zone. The results show that the rates of change of non-glacier-fed lakes in the 2000s were as high as those of glacier-fed lakes across the whole plateau and the lake-level changes were closely associated with the lake supply coefficients (the basin/lake area ratio). The lake variations agreed well with the spatial pattern of precipitation changes. However, in different zones, especially at around 33 degrees N north of the plateau, glacier-fed lakes did exhibit faster lake level increases than no-glacier-fed lakes, indicating that the presence of a glacier meltwater supply augmented the precipitation-driven lake expansions in these areas. Despite the absence of quantitative modeling due to limited data availability, this study provides qualitative support that the lake expansions on the Tibetan Plateau in the 2000s have been driven primarily by changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration and not solely by the effect of glacier wastage.

AB Understanding the space-time variability of runoff has important implications for climate because of the linkage of runoff and evapotranspiration and is a practical concern as well for the prediction of drought and floods. In contrast to many studies investigating the space-time variability of precipitation and temperature, there has been relatively little work evaluating climate teleconnections of runoff, in part because of the absence of data sets that lend themselves to commonly used techniques in climate analysis like principal components analysis. We examine the space-time variability of runoff over North America using a 50-year retrospective spatially distributed data set of runoff and other land surface water cycle variables predicted using a calibrated macroscale hydrology model, thus avoiding some shortcomings of past studies based more directly on streamflow observations. We determine contributions to runoff variability of climatic teleconnections, soil moisture, and snow for lead times up to a year. High and low values of these sources of predictability are evaluated separately. We identify patterns of runoff variability that are not revealed by direct analysis of observations, especially in areas of sparse stream gauge coverage. The presence of nonlinear relationships between large-scale climate changes and runoff pattern variability, as positive and negative values of the large-scale climate indices rarely show opposite teleconnections with a runoff pattern. Dry soil moisture anomalies have a stronger influence on runoff variability than wet soil. Snow, and more so soil moisture, in many locations enhance the predictability due to climatic teleconnections.

AB Plant roots and bacteria alter the soil physical properties by releasing polymeric blends into the soil pore space (e.g., extracellular polymeric substances and mucilage). The physical mechanisms by which these substances interact with the soil matrix and alter the spatial configuration of the liquid phase and the related hydraulic properties remain unclear. Here, we propose a theory to explain how polymer solutions form one-dimensional filaments and two-dimensional interconnected structures spanning across multiple pores. Unlike water, primarily shaped by surface tension, these polymeric structures remain connected during drying due to their high viscosity. The integrity of one-dimensional structures is explained by the interplay of viscosity and surface tension forces (elegantly characterized by the Ohnesorge number), while the formation of two-dimensional structures requires consideration of the interaction of the polymer solution with the solid surfaces and external drivers (e.g., drying rate). During drying, the viscosity of the liquid phase increases and at a critical point, when the friction between polymers and solid surfaces overcomes the water absorption of the polymers, the concentration of the polymer solution at the gas-liquid interface increases asymptotically. At this critical point, polymers are deposited as two-dimensional surfaces, such as hollow cylinders or interconnected surfaces. A model is introduced to predict the formation of such structures. Viscosity of the soil solution, specific soil surface, and drying rate are the key parameters determining the transition from one-to two-dimensional structures. Model results are in good agreement with observed structures formed in porous media during drying.

AB We combine experimental and modeling results from a headwater catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA, to explore the link between stream solute dynamics and water age. A theoretical framework based on water age dynamics, which represents a general basis for characterizing solute transport at the catchment scale, is here applied to conservative and weathering-derived solutes. Based on the available information about the hydrology of the site, an integrated transport model was developed and used to compute hydrochemical fluxes. The model was designed to reproduce the deuterium content of streamflow and allowed for the estimate of catchment water storage and dynamic travel time distributions (TTDs). The innovative contribution of this paper is the simulation of dissolved silicon and sodium concentration in streamflow, achieved by implementing first-order chemical kinetics based explicitly on dynamic TTD, thus upscaling local geochemical processes to catchment scale. Our results highlight the key role of water stored within the subsoil glacial material in both the short-term and long-term solute circulation. The travel time analysis provided an estimate of streamflow age distributions and their evolution in time related to catchment wetness conditions. The use of age information to reproduce a 14 year data set of silicon and sodium stream concentration shows that, at catchment scales, the dynamics of such geogenic solutes are mostly controlled by hydrologic drivers, which determine the contact times between the water and mineral interfaces. Justifications and limitations toward a general theory of reactive solute circulation at catchment scales are discussed.

AB Highly seasonal boreal catchments are hydrologically complex and generally data poor and, hence, are ripe for investigation using tracer-aided hydrologic models. The influence of physiography on isotopic metrics was assessed to identify the catchment characteristics dominating evaporative enrichment. A multiyear stable isotope of water dataset was collected at the outlets of 16 boreal catchments in central Canada ranging in area from 12 to 15,282km(2). Physiographic characteristics were obtained through raster analysis of freely available land cover images, stream networks, and digital elevation models. Correlation analysis indicated that as the percentage coverage of open water increased, so too did the evaporative effects observed at the catchment outlet. Correlation to wetland metrics indicated that increasing the percentage coverage of wetlands can reduce or increase evaporative effects observed, depending on the isotopic metric used and the corresponding drainage density, catchment slope, and presence of headwater lakes. The slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines appear to reflect multifaceted relationships, strongest between catchment slope, headwater lakes, and connected wetlands, whereas mean line-conditioned excess is more directly linked to physiographic variables. Hence, the slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines and mean line-conditioned excess are not interchangeable metrics of evaporative enrichment in a catchment. Relationships identified appear to be independent of catchment scale. These results suggest that adequate inclusion of the distribution of open water throughout a catchment, adequate representation of wetland processes, catchment slope, and drainage density are critical characteristics to include in tracer-aided hydrologic models in boreal environments in order to minimize structural uncertainty.

AB Successful management of flooding and erosion hazards on floodplains depends on our ability to predict a river channel's shape and the lifespan during which it will continue to flow. Recent progress has improved our understanding of what sets the lifespan and width of single-thread channels; the next challenge is to extend this knowledge to braided channels and their interwoven sub-channels (threads). In this study, we investigate the lifespan and width of braided channel threads in a large experimental data set, coupled with particle-image velocimetry-derived measurements of riverbank erosion and accretion. We find that, unlike single-thread channels, braided channels in the experiment do not exhibit an equilibrium between bank erosion and accretion. Instead, bank erosion outpaces lateral accretion, causing individual threads to widen and infill until they are abandoned. Thread lifespan is limited to the time it takes for threads to triple their width: tripling of the width yields enough bank material to aggrade more than half the channel depth, at which point flow is rerouted to a narrower thread. In consequence the width of active threads is limited to three times their initial width. Threshold channel theory accurately predicts the median thread width, which is roughly double the initial width and two-thirds the limiting width. The results are consistent with existing field data and suggest that differential bank migration is sufficient to explain why braided channels show greater width variability and higher width-to-depth ratios than their single-thread counterparts.

AB The planning and management of water resources in the Shiyang River basin, China require a tool for assessing the impact of groundwater and stream use on water supply reliabilities and improving many environment-related problems Such as soil desertification induced by recent water-related human activities. A Coupled model, integrating rule-based lumped surface water model and distributed three-dimensional groundwater flow model, has been established to investigate surface water and groundwater management scenarios that may be designed to restore the deteriorated ecological environment of the downstream portion of the Shiyang River basin. More than 66% of the water level among 24 observation wells have simulation error less than 1.0 m. The overall trend of the temporal changes of simulated and observed surface runoff at the Caiqi gauging station remains almost the same. The calibration was considered satisfactory. Initial frameworks for water allocation, including agricultural water-saving projects, water diversion within the basin and inter-basin water transfer, reducing agricultural irrigation area and surface water use instead of groundwater exploitation at the downstream were figured out that would provide a rational use of water resources throughout the whole basin. Sixteen scenarios were modelled to find out the most appropriate management strategies. The results showed that in the two selected management options, the groundwater budget at the Minqin basin was about 1.4 x 10(8) m(3)/a and the ecological environment Would be improved significantly, but the deficit existed at the Wuwei basin and the number was about 0.8 x 10(8) m(3)/a. Water demand for domestic, industry and urban green area Would be met in the next 30 years, but the water shortage for meeting the demand of agricultural water use in the Shiyang River basin was about 2.2 x 108 m(3)/a. It is suggested that more inter-basin water transfer should be required to obtain sustainable water resource use in the Shiyang River basin. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Due to a lack of sufficient theoretical relations, equations for bed load transport in alluvial channel flow have been developed using a variety of empirical assumptions. A linear relationship exhibited in the complex interactions among the three essential components of a river (channel geometry, bed load transport and flow resistance) has led this study to develop a more accurate form of the Meyer-Peter and Muller (1948, hereafter MPM) relationship, one of the world's most widely used bed load transport equations. This study demonstrates that the application of linearity theory can significantly improve its performance. On the basis of the dataset originally used by MPM, it is shown that the applicable form of the Manning-Strickler flow resistance relationship can be very satisfactorily determined. The MPM equation is consequently found to be expressible more accurately as Phi = 6[eta tau(b)*-0.047](5/3), where Phi, eta and tau(b)* are the normalized, dimensionless bed load transport rate, bed-form correction, and flow-strength parameters, respectively.

AB When a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, a Lagrangian and meshfree numerical scheme, is used to solve the advection-dispersion equation (ADE), SPH solutions may not be accurate when particles are irregularly distributed, i.e., the distance between two neighbor particles varies irregularly in a simulation domain. Particle irregularity may be caused by nonuniform groundwater flow in a heterogeneous field of hydraulic conductivity. This study explores for the first time whether the Finite Particle Method (FPM) can provide more accurate ADE solutions than SPH does for irregularly distributed particles. FPM is similar to SPH in theory, but uses a modified kernel gradient to construct a SPH approximation of solute concentration gradients. Performance of SPH and FPM with irregularly distributed particles is evaluated by using two numerical cases. The first case considers only diffusive transport, and has an analytical solution for the evaluation. The second case considers both advection and dispersion, and uses a numerical solution as a reference for the evaluation. For each of the two cases, several numerical experiments are conducted using multiple sets of irregularly distributed particles with different levels of particle irregularity due to different levels of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity. Numerical results indicate that, for the numerical experiments of this study, FPM outperforms SPH to yield more accurate ADE solutions. However, FPM solutions are still subject to numerical errors, and the errors increase when the level of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity increases. Further improvement of FPM is warranted in a future study.

AB Accurate prediction of soil detachment capacity is fundamental to establish process-based erosion models and improve soil loss assessment. Few studies were conducted to reveal the mechanism of detachment process for yellow soil on steep cropland in the subtropical region of China using field experiments. This study was performed to determine soil detachment characteristics and explore the relationships between soil detachment capacity (D-c) and flow rate, slope gradient, mean velocity, shear stress, stream power and unit stream power. Field experiments were conducted on intact soil with flow rates ranging from 0.2 x 10(-3) to 0.5 x 10(-3) m(-3) s(-1) and slope gradients varying from 8.8 to 42.4%. The results showed the following. (a) D-c of yellow soil was smaller than other soils because of its high clay content. (b) D-c was more susceptible to flow than to slope gradient. Power functions were derived to depict the relationship between D-c and the flow rate and slope gradient (R-2 = 0.91). (c) D-c was better simulated by power functions of the stream power (R-2 = 0.83) than functions of the shear stress or the unit stream power. (d) Considering its accuracy, simplicity and accessibility, the power function based on flow rate and slope gradient is recommended to predict D-c of yellow soil in the field. The results of this study provide useful support for revealing soil detachment mechanism and developing process-based soil erosion models for the subtropical region of China.

AB As a result of climate change/variation and its aggravation by human activities over the past several decades, the hydrological conditions in the middle Yellow River in China have dramatically changed, which has led to a sharp decrease of streamflow and the drying up of certain tributaries. This paper simulated and analysed the impact of sediment-trapping dams (STDs, a type of large-sized check dam used to prevent sediment from entering the Yellow River main stem) on hydrological processes, and the study area was located in the 3246km(2) Huangfuchuan River basin. Changes in the hydrological processes were analysed, and periods of natural and disturbed states were defined. Subsequently, the number and distribution of the STDs were determined based on data collected from statistical reports and identified from remote sensing images, and the topological relationships between the STDs and high-resolution river reaches were established. A hydrological model, the digital Yellow River integrated model, was used to simulate the STD impact on the hydrological processes, and the maximum STD impact was evaluated through a comparison between the simulation results with and without the STDs, which revealed that the interception effect of the STDs contributed to the decrease of the streamflow by approximately 39%. This paper also analysed the relationship between the spatial distribution of the STDs and rainfall in the Huangfuchuan River basin and revealed that future soil and water conservation measures should focus on areas with a higher average annual rainfall and higher number of rainstorm hours.

AB The interaction of sub-surface, gravity-driven flows with inclusions of different permeabilities are investigated theoretically using a model that exploits the relative shallowness of the motion. Numerically computed solutions for steady motion around cylindrical inclusions reveal a range of behaviors dependent on the ratio of the interior to exterior permeability and a dimensionless flow parameter that measures the far-field thickness to the product of the gradient of the slope down which the fluid flows and the width of the inclusion. When the inclusion is relatively narrow, the depth of the flow is little changed from its far-field value and the fluid is focused into inclusions of higher permeability and deflected around those of lower permeability. However, if the inclusion is relatively wide then three qualitatively different regimes emerge, dependent on the ratio of permeabilities. When the interior and exterior permeabilities are similar, then negligible deviation of the flow occurs apart from within thin transition layers at the boundary of the inclusion. When the permeabilities differ significantly, the flow forms deep ponds at either the upstream or downstream boundary of the inclusion for relatively low or high permeability inclusion, respectively, which arise due to deflection or focusing. In each case, asymptotic relationships are derived between the depth of the flow and the parameters. Inclusions of differing cross-section are also analyzed numerically and analytically to draw out the interplay between adjustment, deflection and focusing.

AB Testing competing conceptual model hypotheses in hydrology is complicated by uncertainties from a wide range of sources, which result in multiple simulations that explain catchment behaviour. In this study, the limits of acceptability uncertainty analysis approach used to discriminate between 78 competing hypotheses in the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors for 24 catchments in the UK. During model evaluation, we test the model's ability to represent observed catchment dynamics and processes by defining key hydrologic signatures and time step-based metrics from the observed discharge time series. We explicitly account for uncertainty in the evaluation data by constructing uncertainty bounds from errors in the stage-discharge rating curve relationship. Our study revealed large differences in model performance both between catchments and depending on the type of diagnostic used to constrain the simulations. Model performance varied with catchment characteristics and was best in wet catchments with a simple rainfall-runoff relationship. The analysis showed that the value of different diagnostics in constraining catchment response and discriminating between competing conceptual hypotheses varies according to catchment characteristics. The information content held within water balance signatures was found to better capture catchment dynamics in chalk catchments, where catchment behaviour is predominantly controlled by seasonal and annual changes in rainfall, whereas the information content in the flow-duration curve and time-step performance metrics was able to better capture the dynamics of rainfall-driven catchments. We also investigate the effect of model structure on model performance and demonstrate its (in) significance in reproducing catchment dynamics for different catchments.

ID INTERRILL OVERLAND-FLOW; DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL; SOIL; ELEVATION; BASIN;

AB There is considerable interest in large-scale spatial patterns of sediment transport in catchments, and this topic is often approached. using terrain-based modelling. In such models topography influences the discharge of overland now and its sediment transport capacity. The sediment transport capacity of overland flow is commonly expressed as a power function of slope and discharge (i.e, q(s) = k(1)q(beta)S(gamma)). The relationship between discharge and contributing area can also be expressed as a power function. Several reviews reveal a limited range of values for the two exponents beta and gamma. In this paper we examine the sensitivity of catchment-scale patterns of sediment delivery to valley Boors to a range of sediment transport capacity and hillslope hydrology parameterizations, using two catchments on the southern tablelands of New South Wales. The results indicate that, over the limited range of beta and gamma identified within the literature, sediment deliveries to valley floors across the two catchments al e similar for all but one of five sediment transport capacity relationships. The patterns are dominated by the trend in slope through each catchment. The sensitivity to hillslope hydrology of predicted sediment delivery patterns is strong in the catchment with systematic variation in unit hillslope area, and weak in the catchment for which there are no systematic trends in unit hillslope area. We believe there is less experimental evidence to restrict choice of hillslope hydrology parameters than there is for sediment transport capacity. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The importance of conceptualizing the dynamics of storage-driven saturation area connectivity in runoff generation has been central to the development of TOPMODEL and similar low parameterized rainfall-runoff models. In this contribution, we show how we developed a 40-year hydrometric data base to simulate storage-discharge relationships in the Girnock catchment in the Scottish Highlands using a simple conceptual model. The catchment is a unique fisheries reference site where Atlantic salmon populations have been monitored since 1966. The modelling allowed us to track storage dynamics in hillslopes, the riparian zone and groundwater, and explicitly link non-linear changes of streamflows to landscape storage and connectivity dynamics. This provides a fundamental basis for understanding how the landscape and riverscape are hydrologically connected and how this regulates in-stream hydraulic conditions that directly influence salmonids. We use the model to simulate storage and discharge dynamics over the 40-year period of fisheries records. The modelled storage-driven connectivity provides an ecohydological context for understanding the dynamics in stream flow generation which determine habitat hydraulics for different life stages of salmon population. This new, long-term modelling now sets this variability in the riverscape in a more fundamental context of the inter-relationships between storage in the landscape and stream flow generation. This provides a simple, robust framework for future ecohydrological modelling at this site, which is an alternative to more increasingly popular but highly parameterized and uncertain commercial ecohydrological models. It also provides a wider, novel context that is a prerequisite for any model-based scenario assessment of likely impacts resulting from climate or land use change.

AB Soil is the largest reservoir of water in a catchment and evapotranspiration is the largest yearly output flux of water from the soil in semiarid environments at the catchment scale. Hydrologic stress is one of the typical characteristics of semiarid environments. The shortage of water affects all the biophysical processes and increases the nonlinearity in the rainfall-runoff relationship. A proper description of semiarid watersheds should include an accurate description of the wetting-drying cycle of the soil, which is critical to properly describe important processes Such it.,; the connection between the surface and the soil saturated zone, the production of runoff or the growth of plants. Evapotranspiration is typically modelled in comprehensive distributed hydrologic models (e.g. MIKE-SHE or MODHMS) using functions that relate evapotranspiration to soil moisture and plant biomass through a set of empirical coefficients, which typically adopt some default values regardless of the conditions of the area where the model is applied. In this work, using a global and a local search algorithm, a three-dimensional soil water flow model coupled to an evapotranspiration model is calibrated in it soil profile covered with grass in a semiarid environment. Four parameters for the water flow model and three parameters for the evapotranspiration model are calibrated. An existing trend between daily average Soil Moisture and daily maximum temperature is used as extra information during the calibration process. The results showed that the known relationship between maximum temperature and average soil moisture includes information on the seasonality of the atmospheric demand. Although total evapotranspiration is similar in all calibrations, the trade-off between evaporation and transpiration is sensitive to this extra information mainly through one model parameter. Further research is necessary to identify the value of the parameter that produces the correct trade-off. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Characterization and modeling of spatial variability in a complex
   alluvial aquifer: Implications on solute transport
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID HETEROGENEITY; CONDUCTIVITY; FLOW
AB Field investigations of stratified alluvial deposits suggest that they can give rise to a hierarchy of permeability modes across scales, corresponding to a hierarchy of sedimentary unit types and thus may lead to enhanced plume spread in such media. In this work, we model the sedimentary architecture of the alluvium deposits in Fortymile Wash, Nevada, using a hierarchical transition probability geostatistical approach. The alluvial aquifer comprises a segment of the groundwater flow pathway from the potential high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada to the downstream accessible environment and may be a natural barrier to radionuclide migration. Thus our main goal is to quantify the impact of spatial variability in the alluvium on solute transport. The alluvial aquifer is a gravel-dominated braid-belt deposit, having lower-permeability paleosols interstratified with higher-permeability gravel-bar deposits. A three-dimensional hierarchical hydrofacies model is developed through fusion of multiple geologic data types and sources. Markov chain models of transition probabilities are employed to represent complex patterns of spatial variability at each hierarchical level in a geostatistical fashion and to impose realistic constraints to such variations through conditioning on existing data. The link between the alluvium spatial variability and solute dispersion at different spatiotemporal scales is demonstrated using the stochastic-Lagrangian transport theory. We show that the longitudinal macrodispersivity can be on the order of hundreds to thousands of meters, and it may not reach its asymptotic value until after 1,000 years of traveltime.

AB [1] Large eddy simulation is used to investigate the dynamics of the main coherent structures present in the flow around two vertical submerged groynes situated in a long flatbed open channel. The mass exchange processes between the embayment region and the main channel are investigated by studying the ejection of a contaminant introduced instantaneously inside the embayment. The instantaneous and mean structure of the horseshoe vortex system forming at the base of the upstream groyne and the bed shear distributions that determine the evolution of the scour in the groyne region are investigated. It is found that the amplification of the bed shear stress in the accelerating region around the tip of the upstream groyne is around one order of magnitude larger relative to the mean bed shear stress in the incoming flow. Analysis of the instantaneous flow fields shows that the eddies that are shed inside the horizontal and vertical detached shear layers play an important role in controlling the mass exchange at the lateral and roof interfaces. It is found that most of the pollutant leaves the embayment through the roof and bottom lateral sections. The overall mass exchange process is qualitatively different and substantially accelerated compared to the case when the groynes are emerged. However, it is shown that similar to the emerged case, the decay of the mass of contaminant within the embayment cannot be characterized by a unique value of the exchange coefficient used in simple dead zone theory models.

AB In this paper, we consider an approach for estimating the effective hydraulic conductivity of a 3-D medium with a binary distribution of local hydraulic conductivities. The medium heterogeneity is represented by a combination of matrix medium conductivity with spatially distributed sets of inclusions. Estimation of effective conductivity is based on a self-consistent approach introduced by Shvidler [ 1985]. The tensor of effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated numerically by using a simple system of equations for the main diagonal elements. Verification of the method is done by comparison with theoretical results for special cases and numerical results of Desbarats [ 1987] and our own numerical modeling. The method was applied to estimating the effective hydraulic conductivity of a 2-D and 3-D fractured porous medium. The medium heterogeneity is represented by a combination of matrix conductivity and a spatially distributed set of highly conductive fractures. The tensor of effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated for parallel- and random-oriented sets of fractures. The obtained effective conductivity values coincide with Romm's [ 1966] and Snow's [ 1969] theories for infinite fracture length. These values are also physically acceptable for the sparsely fractured medium case with low fracture spatial density and finite fracture length. Verification of the effective hydraulic conductivity obtained for a fractured porous medium is done by comparison with our own numerical modeling for a 3-D case and with Malkovsky and Pek's [ 1995] results for a 2-D case.

AB A method to represent fracture networks as grid cell conductivities in a continuum model is described and evaluated. The method-is developed for a sparsely fractured rock with a conductivity field that is dominated by major fractures and fracture zones. For such a fracture system it is believed that an accurate description of the correlation and anisotropy structure is essential. The proposed method will capture these features of the fracture system.
   The basic approach of the method is to evaluate accurate cell conductivity values for a staggered grid arrangement, i.e. velocities are stored at cell walls and scalars at cell centres. The balance of farces, i.e. the Darcy law, is evaluated for a control volume centred around the point where the velocity component is stored. Fractures are assumed to have a thickness and conductivity. The conductivity of a velocity control volume is calculated from the intersecting volume between the fracture and the velocity control volume. Intersecting volumes, with their respective conductivities, are added up to form the control volume conductivity.
   The general conclusion is that the method results is accurate simulations. It is expected that the method can be utilised in many practical groundwater simulations. This statement is based on the results from three test cases with analytical solution and one test case where results are compared with those from established theories. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A snow depletion curve (SDC), the relationship between snow mass (e.g., snow depth [SD]) and fractional snow cover area (SCF), is essential to parameterize the effect of snowpack within a physically based snow model. Existing SDCs are constructed using traditional statistic methods may not be applicable in complex mountainous areas. In this study, we developed an information fusion framework to define the relationship between SCF and SD as well as 12 auxiliary factors by using a traditional statistical method and four prevailing machine learning (ML) algorithms, which have comprehensively considered the variable conditions that cause spatiotemporal heterogeneity of snow cover. We also performed a single-dimensional sensitivity analysis to investigate the physical rationality of the newly developed SDCs. The Northern Xinjiang, Northwest China, is selected as the study area, and the data from 46 meteorological stations covering five snow seasons from 2010 to 2015 are used. The results illustrated that ML techniques can be used to establish high-accuracy and robust SDCs for complex mountainous areas. Compared with SDCs constructed by traditional statistical, the performance of the four ML-based SDCs is significantly improved, the RMSE values can be reduced by 50%, R-2 above 0.75, and an average relative variance close to 0. ML-based SDCs predicted SCF values showed a range of sensitivities to different input variables (e.g., Land surface temperature, aspect, longwave radiation and land cover type), in addition to SD, that were physically representative of effects that snow cover is sensitive to. Moreover, the complexity of SDCs can be reduced by removing insensitive input variables.

AB Large river floods are a key water source for many lakes in fluvial periglacial settings. Where permeable sediments occur, the distribution of permafrost may play an important role in the routing of floodwaters across a floodplain. This relationship is explored for lakes in the discontinuous permafrost of Yukon Flats, interior Alaska, using an analysis that integrates satellite-derived gradients in water surface elevation, knowledge of hydrogeology, and hydrologic modelling. We observed gradients in water surface elevation between neighbouring lakes ranging from 0.001 to 0.004. These high gradients, despite a ubiquitous layer of continuous shallow gravel across the flats, are consistent with limited groundwater flow across lake basins resulting from the presence of permafrost. Permafrost impedes the propagation of floodwaters in the shallow subsurface and constrains transmission to 'fill-and-spill' over topographic depressions (surface sills), as we observed for the Twelvemile-Buddy Lake pair following a May 2013 ice-jam flood on the Yukon River. Model results indicate that permafrost table deepening of 1-11m in gravel, depending on watershed geometry and subsurface properties, could shift important routing of floodwater to lakes from overland flow (fill-and-spill) to shallow groundwater flow ('fill-and-seep'). Such a shift is possible in the next several hundred years of ground surface warming and may bring about more synchronous water level changes between neighbouring lakes following large flood events. This relationship offers a potentially useful tool, well suited to remote sensing, for identifying long-term changes in shallow groundwater flow resulting from thawing of permafrost.

AB The classic Ghyben-Herzberg estimate of the depth of the freshwater-saltwater interface together with the Dupuit approximation is a useful tool for developing analytical solutions to many seawater intrusion problems. On the basis of these assumptions, Strack (1976) developed a single-potential theory to calculate critical pumping rates in a coastal pumping scenario. The sharp interface assumption and, in particular, this analytical solution are widely used to study seawater intrusion and the sustainable management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers. The sharp interface assumption neglects mixing and implicitly assumes that salt water remains static. Consequently, this approximation overestimates the penetration of the saltwater front and underestimates the critical pumping rates that ensure a freshwater supply. We investigate the error introduced by adopting the sharp interface approximation, and we include the effects of dispersion on the formulation of Strack (1976). To this end, we perform numerical three-dimensional variable density flow simulations. We find that Strack's equations can be extended to the case of mixing zone if the density factor is multiplied by an empirically derived dispersion factor [1 - (alpha(T)/b')(1/6)], where alpha(T) is transverse dispersivity and b' is aquifer thickness. We find that this factor can be used not only to estimate the critical pumping rate but also to correct the Ghyben-Herzberg estimate of the interface depth. Its simplicity facilitates the generalization of sharp interface analytical solutions and good predictions of seawater penetration for a broad range of conditions.

AB We used a recently developed simple mathematical network model to upscale pore-scale colloid transport information determined under unfavorable attachment conditions. Classical log-linear and nonmonotonic retention profiles, both well-reported under favorable and unfavorable attachment conditions, respectively, emerged from our upscaling. The primary attribute of the network is colloid transfer between bulk pore fluid, the near-surface fluid domain (NSFD), and attachment (treated as irreversible). The network model accounts for colloid transfer to the NSFD of downgradient grains and for reentrainment to bulk pore fluid via diffusion or via expulsion at rear flow stagnation zones (RFSZs). The model describes colloid transport by a sequence of random trials in a one-dimensional (1-D) network of Happel cells, which contain a grain and a pore. Using combinatorial analysis that capitalizes on the binomial coefficient, we derived from the pore-scale information the theoretical residence time distribution of colloids in the network. The transition from log-linear to nonmonotonic retention profiles occurs when the conditions underlying classical filtration theory are not fulfilled, i.e., when an NSFD colloid population is maintained. Then, nonmonotonic retention profiles result potentially both for attached and NSFD colloids. The concentration maxima shift downgradient depending on specific parameter choice. The concentration maxima were also shown to shift downgradient temporally (with continued elution) under conditions where attachment is negligible, explaining experimentally observed downgradient transport of retained concentration maxima of adhesion-deficient bacteria. For the case of zero reentrainment, we develop closed-form, analytical expressions for the shape, and the maximum of the colloid retention profile.

AB Immiscible displacement in porous media is important in many applications such as soil remediation and enhanced oil recovery. When gravitational forces are negligible, two-phase immiscible displacement at the pore level is controlled by capillary and viscous forces whose relative importance is quantified through the dimensionless capillary number Ca and the viscosity ratio M between liquid phases. Depending on the values of Ca and M, capillary fingering, viscous fingering, or stable displacement may be observed resulting in a variety of patterns affecting the phase entrapment. The Capillary Desaturation Curve (CDC), which represents the relationship between the residual oil saturation and Ca, is an important relation to describe the phase entrapment at a given Ca. In the present study, we investigated the CDC as influenced by the viscosity ratio. To do so, we have conducted a comprehensive series of experiments using a high-resolution microscope and state-of-art micromodels to investigate the dynamics and patterns of phase entrapment at different Ca and M. By postprocessing of the experimental high-resolution images, we calculated the CDC and quantified the effects of the Ca and M on the phase entrapment and number of blobs trapped in the micromodel and their size distributions during immiscible two-phase flow. Our results show that CDCs are not necessarily monotonic for all M, and the physical mechanisms causing this nonmonotonic behavior are discussed.

AB [ 1] This paper describes two approaches for estimating sensible heat flux, using surface renewal and similarity concepts. One approach depends on a temperature structure function parameter and is valid in the inertial sublayer. The other approach depends on the temperature standard deviation and operates when measurements are made above the canopy top, either in the roughness or inertial sublayer. The approaches were tested over grass, rangeland grass, wheat, grape vineyard, and nectarine and olive orchards. It is shown that the free convection limit expression for the standard deviation method holds for slightly unstable conditions. When surface homogeneity and fetch requirements are not fully met in the field, the results show that the equations based on surface renewal principles are more robust and accurate than equations exclusively based on similarity backgrounds. It is likely that the two methods are less sensitive to site-specific adjustment of the similarity relationships unless the canopy is rather heterogeneous. Under unstable conditions, the free convection limit equation, which depends on the temperature standard deviation, can provide online sensible heat flux estimates using affordable battery-powered data logger with temperature data as the only input. The approach performed well when measuring above the canopy in the roughness and inertial sublayers, thus suggesting that the method is useful for long-term monitoring over growing vegetation.

AB The production and use of nanomaterials will inevitably lead to their disposal in the natural environment. To assess the risk that these materials pose to human and ecosystem health an understanding of their mobility and ultimate fate is essential. To date, however, relatively little research has been conducted on the fate of nanoparticles in subsurface systems. In this study the subsurface mobility of two carbon nanoparticles: nano-fullerenes (nC(60)) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is assessed. A two-dimensional finite element model was used to simulate the movement of these nanoparticles under a range of hydrologic and geological conditions, including a heterogeneous permeability field. The numerical model is based on colloid filtration theory (CFT) with a maximum retention capacity term. For the conditions evaluated the carbon nanotubes are much more mobile than nC(60) due to the smaller collector efficiency associated with carbon nanotubes. However, the mobility of nC(60) increased significantly when a maximum retention capacity term was included in the model. Model results also demonstrate that, for the systems examined, nanoparticles were predicted to be less mobile in heterogeneous systems compared to the homogeneous systems with the same average hydraulic properties.

AB Malaria transmission is a complex system and in many parts of the world is closely related to climate conditions. However, studies on environmental determinants of malaria generally consider only concurrent climate conditions and ignore the historical or initial conditions of the system. Here, we demonstrate the concept of hysteresis in malaria transmission, defined as non-uniqueness of the relationship between malaria prevalence and concurrent climate conditions. We show the dependence of simulated malaria transmission on initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. Using realistic time series of environmental variables, we quantify the effect of hysteresis in a modeled population. In a set of numerical experiments using HYDREMATS, a field-tested mechanistic model of malaria transmission, the simulated maximum malaria prevalence depends on both the initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. We found the effects of initial conditions to be of comparable magnitude to the effects of interannual variability in environmental conditions in determining malaria prevalence. The memory associated with this hysteresis effect is longer in high transmission settings than in low transmission settings. Our results show that efforts to simulate and forecast malaria transmission must consider the exposure history of a location as well as the concurrent environmental drivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bed particles were tracked using passive integrated transponder tags in a wandering reach of the San Juan River, British Columbia, Canada, to assess particle movement around three major bars in the river. In-channel topographic changes were monitored through repeat LiDAR surveys during this period and used in concert with the tracer data set to assess the relationship between particle displacements and changes in channel morphology, specifically, the development and re-working of bars. This has direct implications for virtual velocity and morphologic based estimates of bedload flux, which rely on accurate estimates of the variability and magnitude of particle path lengths over time. Tracers were deployed in the river at three separate locations in the Fall of 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, with recovery surveys conducted during the summer low-flow season the year after tracer deployment and multiple mobilizing events. Tracers exhibited path length distributions reflective of both morphologic controls and year to year differences related to the annual flow regime. Annual tracer transport was restricted primarily to less than one riffle-pool-bar unit, even during years with a greater number of peak floods and duration of competent flow. Tracer deposition and burial was focused along bar margins, particularly at or downstream of the bar apex, reflecting the downstream migration and lateral bar accretion observed on Digital Elevation Models of difference. This highlights the fundamental importance of bar development and re-working underpinning bedload transport processes in bar-dominated channels.

AB While the majority of hydrological prediction methods assume that observed interannual variability explores the full range of catchment response dynamics, recent cases of prolonged climate drying suggest otherwise. During the similar to decade-long Millennium drought in south-eastern Australia significant shifts in hydrologic behavior were reported. Catchment rainfall-runoff partitioning changed from what was previously encountered during shorter droughts, with significantly less runoff than expected occurring in many catchments. In this article, we investigate the variability in the magnitude of shift in rainfall-runoff partitioning observed during the Millennium drought. We re-evaluate a large range of factors suggested to be responsible for the additional runoff reductions. Our results suggest that the shifts were mostly influenced by catchment characteristics related to predrought climate (aridity index and rainfall seasonality) and soil and groundwater storage dynamics (predrought interannual variability of groundwater storage and mean solum thickness). The shifts were amplified by seasonal rainfall changes during the drought (spring rainfall deficits). We discuss the physical mechanisms that are likely to be associated with these factors. Our results confirm that shifts in the annual rainfall-runoff relationship represent changes in internal catchment functioning, and emphasize the importance of cumulative multiyear changes in the catchment storage for runoff generation. Prolonged drying in some regions can be expected in the future, and our results provide an indication of which catchments characteristics are associated with catchments more susceptible to a shift in their runoff response behavior.

ID PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; MODEL
AB [1] Statistical downscaling provides a technique for deriving local-scale information of precipitation and temperature from numerical weather prediction model output. The K-nearest neighbor (K-nn) is a new analog-type approach that is used in this paper to downscale the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 1998 medium-range forecast model output. The K-nn algorithm queries days similar to a given feature vector in this archive and using empirical orthogonal function analysis identifies a subset of days (K) similar to the feature day. These K days are then weighted using a bisquare weight function and randomly sampled to generate ensembles. A set of 15 medium-range forecast runs was used, and seven ensemble members were generated from each run. The ensemble of 105 members was then used to select the local-scale precipitation and temperature values in four diverse basins across the contiguous United States. These downscaled precipitation and temperature estimates were subsequently analyzed to test the performance of this downscaling approach. The downscaled ensembles were evaluated in terms of bias, the ranked probability skill score as a measure of forecast skill, spatial covariability between stations, temporal persistence, consistency between variables, and conditional bias and to develop spread-skill relationships. Though this approach does not explicitly model the space-time variability of the weather fields at each individual station, the above statistics were extremely well captured. The K-nn method was also compared with a multiple-linear-regression-based downscaling model.

AB On the basis of a spatially distributed sediment budget across a large basin, costs of achieving certain sediment reduction targets in rivers were estimated. A range of investment prioritization scenarios were tested to identify the most cost-effective strategy to control suspended sediment loads. The scenarios were based on successively introducing more information from the sediment budget. The relationship between spatial heterogeneity of contributing sediment sources on cost effectiveness of prioritization was investigated. Cost effectiveness was shown to increase with sequential introduction of sediment budget terms. The solution which most decreased cost was achieved by including spatial information linking sediment sources to the downstream target location. This solution produced cost curves similar to those derived using a genetic algorithm formulation. Appropriate investment prioritization can offer large cost savings because the magnitude of the costs can vary by several times depending on what type of erosion source or sediment delivery mechanism is targeted. Target settings which only consider the erosion source rates can potentially result in spending more money than random management intervention for achieving downstream targets. Coherent spatial patterns of contributing sediment emerge from the budget model and its many inputs. The heterogeneity in these patterns can be summarized in a succinct form. This summary was shown to be consistent with the cost difference between local and regional prioritization for three of four test catchments. To explain the effect for the fourth catchment, the detail of the individual sediment sources needed to be taken into account.

AB How well city leaders represent their constituents and meet their needs are key concerns in transitioning to local sustainable water governance. To date, however, there is little research documenting the influence of social position between elected leaders who make policy, career staff water managers who design and operate systems and implement policies, and the members of the public whose individual water use behaviors are important drivers of water sustainability outcomes. In this study, we ask: "How does social position explain variation in water perceptions and concerns between different actors in a socio-hydrological system?" Using a mixed method approach with survey and interview data, we explore the ways that positioning within the governance system, geographic context, and citizen engagement in local government mediate perceptions of the urban water system. Regardless of local biophysical water supply conditions, residents showed most concern about future water shortages and high water costs, while their leaders were consistently most concerned about deteriorating local water infrastructure. Further, constituents who received water-related information directly from public utility mailings or served on community committees and boards had perceptions that were more aligned with leaders' concerns. The importance of social structure over natural and built environments in shaping water issue perceptions underscores the value of social analysis in socio-hydrology studies. Further, practitioners looking to increase consensus for a transition to sustainable water governance might work to develop institutional mechanisms to increase opportunities for water user involvement in local water system governance.
   Plain Language Summary Do city leaders differ from the public on key water issues, and if so, why? We use surveys and interviews with urban Utah Mayors, City Council persons, public utilities staff, and residents to compare their concerns about the current and future water supply, water shortages, quality, cost, and infrastructure. We find that residents were more concerned about future water shortages and high water costs, while leaders were more concerned about deteriorating water infrastructure. This was the case no matter where cities were located or what their water source was. Leaders also thought that their relationship with their publics was largely reactive. The results suggest that socio-hydrology models that presume that actors in the social structure are equally and fully informed of the issues or would respond to cues in the same way may lead to oversimplified results. Where misaligned expectations between leaders and constituents result in unintended consequences, a greater attention to the values, norms, and attitudes held by different actors with different roles serves both policymakers as well as socio-hydrological modelers.

AB Droughts, which can strongly affect both hydrologic and biogeochemical systems, are projected to become more prevalent in the tropics in the future. We assessed the effects of an extreme drought during 2015 on stream water composition in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. We demonstrated that drought base flow in the months leading up to the study was sourced from trade-wind orographic rainfall, suggesting a resistance to the effects of an otherwise extreme drought. In two catchments (Mameyes and Icacos), we sampled a series of four rewetting events that partially alleviated the drought. We collected and analyzed dissolved constituents (major cations and anions, organic carbon, and nitrogen) and suspended sediment (inorganic and organic matter (particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen)). The rivers appeared to be resistant to extreme drought, recovering quickly upon rewetting, as (1) the concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships deviated little from the long-term patterns; (2) new water dominated streamflow during the latter events; (3) suspended sediment sources had accumulated in the channel during the drought flushed out during the initial events; and (4) the severity of the drought, as measured by the US drought monitor, was reduced dramatically after the rewetting events. Through this interdisciplinary study, we were able to investigate the impact of extreme drought through rewetting events on the river biogeochemistry.

AB Excessive mobilization and delivery of fine sediments to water bodies has detrimental impacts on those biotic elements used for waterbody status classification, including macroinvertebrates, fish and macrophytes. The relationship between fine sediment and diatoms is a reciprocal one, with diatoms influencing the production and retention of fine sediments, as well as being impacted by fine sediment derived from the catchment. Diatoms can increase the retention of fine sediments in benthic environments as a result of various mechanisms, including shear stress modification, surface adhesion and bed clogging. Enhanced retention of fines can have important implications for the transfer and fate of sediment-associated nutrients and contaminants. Excessive fine sediment loadings impact diatom assemblages via shading, burial and scouring. Indirect impacts of increased fine sediment stress can result from changes in habitat availability, herbivory or predator changes, which cascade down the food chain. Indices based on the relative abundance of motile species have been proposed for using diatoms to assess waterbody status. However, disentangling the potential confounding impacts of alternative environmental stressors on these simplistic indices remains a significant challenge. Coupling sediment pressure models, capable of predicting the potential impact of mitigation, with meaningful diatom-based indices, remains a challenge for catchment planning for sediment abatement and the attainment of improved, or protection of, ecological status. Existing targets for sediment management in river catchments are largely based on relationships between sediment stress and impacts on fish, but these thresholds have been widely criticized. There remains a need to develop generic modelling toolkits coupling sediment stress and impacts on a range of biological quality elements to support a weight-of-evidence approach.

TI Modelling guidelines - terminology and guiding principles

ID VALIDATION; CALIBRATION; CONSTRUCTION; UNCERTAINTY; CANNOT
AB Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of new strategies for the operation of existing dams is essential for restoring ecosystems that have already been affected by the construction and current regulation of these dams. The assessment of environmental flows (EFs) is significant in guiding such strategic dam operations. However, most of the existing methods just focus on one species or guild without simultaneously considering the interactions with other aquatic organisms. This study proposes an innovative method to determine comprehensive environmental flows (CEFs) for multi-guilds (fish, macroinvertebrates, and hygrophytes) based on the habitat simulation model. We focused on the riparian habitats in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, coupled the biological preferences of multi-guilds with suitable habitat factors, including velocity, depth, and substrate, and then analyzed the relationships of flow and weighted usable areas to determine the CEFs for multi-guilds. The results showed that while the optimal CEFs could be satisfied only in Spring and Summer, the threshold CEF conditions could be met in the Jianli reach throughout the year after the impoundment of Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The results obtained by using the CEFs assessment could better satisfy the EFs for multi-guilds than the ones developed for individual species. The CEFs could be also used to evaluate the impact of TGD on multi-guilds' habitats and optimize ecologically-friendly operations in already designed dams. This study is helpful for maintaining ecosystem integrity in Yangtze River and provides a good example for use in other dams facing similar issues.

AB Semiarid ecosystems attract attention, because they support the life of large human populations, while functioning under growing threats of degradation due to global climate change that may lead to reduced productivity and possibly irreversible desertification. Empirical support is consequently highly sought after to validate the soil-moisture-biomass relationship at the local scale in these ecosystems. Combining physically based models and a database of 32 years of field and remotely sensed data, we examined the effect of soil-moisture content (SMC) on vegetation cover and patch size distribution in the heterogenous semiarid Lehavim LTER in the Negev Desert, Israel. Results from numerical solutions of flow equations in the shallow soil layer allowed predictions of distributions of SMC as the outcome of vertical and lateral water fluxes. The association of vertical fluxes with patch size distribution and vegetation cover did not support the notion that direct rainfall is sufficient for the shrubs' survival in drought conditions. However, re-infiltration of downslope runoff, generated in sealed bare intershrub soil area, significantly contributed to the water available to supporting shrub patches. Accordingly, our approach determines potential vegetation cover in semiarid areas, due to the dependency on contributing area and rainfall-infiltration-runoff processes. This underscores the fact that, additionally to infiltration from direct rainfall, run-on contribution controls vegetation cover in semiarid environments. We therefore suggest that estimations of shrub resilience to water stress should consider scenarios involving surface sealing, rainfall duration and intensity, and contributing area size-each in accordance with the contribution of lateral flows to the water available to shrubs.

DE anisotropic sediment layer; dissolved oxygen; high&#8208; Schmidt&#8208;
   number; large eddy simulation; turbulent channel flow
AB The concentration and distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) are critical to the self-purification capacity of water and the survival of aquatic organisms, and they are important factors considered in the ecological balance system of water resources. In this work, the high-Schmidt number DO transfer phenomenon in open channel flows with anisotropic sediment beds is studied using large eddy simulation. The volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Monod equation is used to describe the in-sediment flow and the sediment oxygen demand of micro-organisms, so as to examine the transport characteristics of DO inside and outside the sediment layer. The effects of various permeable conditions of sediments (characterized by the anisotropy index of permeability, i.e., lambda) on the distribution of DO concentration and flux, penetration depth, and mass transfer processes is studied by means of the time-averaged statistics variations in flow and scalar fields. A larger anisotropy index lambda is found can enhance the transport of DO from the water flowing into the sediment layer, which is caused by turbulent diffusions and turbulence bursting events. It suggests that the lambda-dependent distributions of the DO fluctuations and fluxes are highly correlated with the coherent structures in the turbulence over the sediment-water interface (SWI). A key relationship between the Sherwood number and the anisotropy index is found by means of the current simulations and also is verified by our theoretical analysis. The dependence of lambda on DO penetration depth is consistent with the hypothesis that coherent turbulence in the water column drives mass transport across the SWI.

AB Vulnerability-based frameworks are increasingly used to better understand water system performance under climate change. This work advances the use of stochastic weather generators for climate vulnerability assessments that simulate weather based on patterns of regional atmospheric flow (i.e., weather regimes) conditioned on global-scale climate features. The model is semiparametric by design and includes (1) a nonhomogeneous Markov chain for weather regime simulation; (2) block bootstrapping and a Gaussian copula for multivariate, multisite weather simulation; and (3) modules to impose thermodynamic and dynamical climate change, including Clausius-Clapeyron precipitation scaling, elevation-dependent warming, and shifting dynamics of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this way, the model can be used to evaluate climate impacts on water systems based on hypotheses of dynamic and thermodynamic climate change. The model is developed and tested for cold-season climate in the Tuolumne River Basin in California but is broadly applicable across the western United States. Results show that eight weather regimes exert strong influences over local climate in the Tuolumne Basin. Model simulations adequately preserve many of the historical statistics for precipitation and temperature across sites, including the mean, variance, skew, and extreme values. Annual precipitation and temperature are somewhat underdispersed, and precipitation spell statistics are negatively biased by 1-2 days. For simulations of future climate, the model can generate a range of Clausius-Clapeyron scaling relationships and modes of elevation-dependent warming. Model simulations also suggest a muted response of Tuolumne climate to changes in ENSO variability.

AB The focus of this study is on the climatology of atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the central United States using six atmospheric reanalysis products. This climatology is used to understand the long-term impacts of ARs on annual precipitation, precipitation extremes, and flooding over the central United States. The relationship between the frequency of ARs and three prominent large-scale atmospheric modes [Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection, Artic Oscillation (AO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)] is investigated, and the results are used to statistically model the frequency of ARs at the seasonal scale. AR characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration) are generally robust across the different reanalysis products. ARs exhibit a marked seasonality, with the largest activity in winter (more than 10 ARs per season on average), and the lowest in summer (less than two ARs per season on average). Overall, the duration of most ARs is less than 3 days, but exceptionally persistent ARs (more than 6 days) are also observed. The year-to-year variations in the total annual precipitation over the central United States are largely explained by the variations in AR-related precipitation. Moreover, 40% of the top 1% daily precipitation extremes are associated with ARs, and more than 70% of the annual instantaneous peak discharges and peaks-overthreshold floods are associated with these storms, in particular during winter and spring. The seasonal frequency of ARs can be described in terms of large-scale atmospheric modes, with PNA playing a major role in particular in winter and spring.

AB Sustainable water management requires an understanding of the effects of flow regulation on riparian ecomorphological processes. We investigated the transient response of Salix viminalis by examining the effect of water-level regimes on its above-ground and below-ground biomass. Four sets of Salix cuttings, three juveniles (in the first growing season) and one mature (1 year old), were planted and initially grown under the same water-level regime for 1 month. We imposed three different water-level regime treatments representing natural variability, a seasonal trend with no peaks, and minimal flow (characteristic of hydropower) consisting of a constant water level and natural flood peaks. We measured sap flux, stem water potential, photosynthesis, growth parameters, and final root architecture. The mature cuttings were not affected by water table dynamics, but the juveniles displayed causal relationships between the changing water regime, plant growth, and root distribution during a 2 month transient period. For example, a 50% drop in mean sap flux corresponded with a -1.5 Mpa decrease in leaf water potential during the first day after the water regime was changed. In agreement with published field observations, the cuttings concentrated their roots close to the mean water table of the corresponding treatment, allowing survival under altered conditions and resilience to successive stress events. Juvenile development was strongly impacted by the minimum flow regime, leading to more than 60% reduction of both above-ground and below-ground biomass, with respect to the other treatments. Hence, we suggest avoiding minimum flow regimes where Salix restoration is prioritized.

AB The primary aim of this paper is to present a fuzzy probabilistic approach for optimal design and rehabilitation of water distribution systems, combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in a unified framework. The randomness and imprecision in future water consumption are characterized using fuzzy random variables whose realizations are not real but fuzzy numbers, and the nodal head requirements are represented by fuzzy sets, reflecting the imprecision in customers' requirements. The optimal design problem is formulated as a two-objective optimization problem, with minimization of total design cost and maximization of system performance as objectives. The system performance is measured by the fuzzy random reliability, defined as the probability that the fuzzy head requirements are satisfied across all network nodes. The satisfactory degree is represented by necessity measure or belief measure in the sense of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. An efficient algorithm is proposed, within a Monte Carlo procedure, to calculate the fuzzy random system reliability and is effectively combined with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to derive the Pareto optimal design solutions. The newly proposed methodology is demonstrated with two case studies: the New York tunnels network and Hanoi network. The results from both cases indicate that the new methodology can effectively accommodate and handle various aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty sources arising from the design process and can provide optimal design solutions that are not only cost-effective but also have higher reliability to cope with severe future uncertainties.

AB In this paper, a four-parameter Budyko equation is derived for mean annual water balance by applying the proportionality relationship to a two-stage partitioning of precipitation. The four dimensionless parameters include the Horton index (H, defined as the ratio of evaporation to total wetting) and (the ratio of initial evaporation to total wetting) for slow runoff, and (the ratio of initial wetting to total wetting) and (the ratio of total wetting to its potential) for fast runoff. The derived four-parameter equation balances model parsimony and representation of dominant hydrologic processes and provides a framework to disentangle the roles of climate variability, vegetation, soil, and topography on long-term water balance in gauged watersheds. The four parameters are determined for 165 watersheds by using observations of precipitation, potential evaporation, streamflow, and soil properties. Based on the principal component regression analysis, average time interval between rainfall events, slope, normalized difference vegetation index, and wilting point are identified as the dominant controlling factors on H and ; saturated hydraulic conductivity and the difference between field capacity and residual soil moisture are identified as the dominant controlling factors on ; and is controlled by effective soil water storage capacity, frequency of rainfall events, and climate seasonality. The combination of four-parameter Budyko equation and the principal component regression equations provides a model to assess the long-term responses of evaporation and runoff to climate and watershed property changes in ungauged watersheds.

AB Observed streamflow of headwater catchments of the Tarim River (Central Asia) increased by about 30% over the period 1957-2004. This study aims at assessing to which extent these streamflow trends can be attributed to changes in air temperature or precipitation. The analysis includes a data-based approach using multiple linear regression and a simulation-based approach using a hydrological model. The hydrological model considers changes in both glacier area and surface elevation. It was calibrated using a multiobjective optimization algorithm with calibration criteria based on glacier mass balance and daily and interannual variations of discharge. The individual contributions to the overall streamflow trends from changes in glacier geometry, temperature, and precipitation were assessed using simulation experiments with a constant glacier geometry and with detrended temperature and precipitation time series. The results showed that the observed changes in streamflow were consistent with the changes in temperature and precipitation. In the Sari-Djaz catchment, increasing temperatures and related increase of glacier melt were identified as the dominant driver, while in the Kakshaal catchment, both increasing temperatures and increasing precipitation played a major role. Comparing the two approaches, an advantage of the simulation-based approach is the fact that it is based on process-based relationships implemented in the hydrological model instead of statistical links in the regression model. However, data-based approaches are less affected by model parameter and structural uncertainties and typically fast to apply. A complementary application of both approaches is recommended.

AB Emerging groundwater contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may impact surface-water quality and groundwater-dependent ecosystems of gaining streams. Although complex near-surface hydrogeology of stream corridors challenges sampling efforts, recent advances in heat tracing of discharge zones enable efficient and informed data collection. For this study, we used a combination of streambed temperature push-probe and thermal infrared methods to guide a discharge-zone-oriented sample collection along approximately 6 km of a coastal trout stream on Cape Cod, MA. Eight surface-water locations and discharging groundwater from 24 streambed and bank seepages were analysed for dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance, stable water isotopes, and a range of PFAS compounds, which are contaminants of emerging concern in aquatic environments. The results indicate a complex system of groundwater discharge source flowpaths, where the sum of concentrations of six PFAS compounds (corresponding to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule "UCMR 3") showed a median concentration of 52 +/- 331 (SD) ng/L with two higher outliers and three discharges with PFAS concentrations below the quantification limit. Higher PFAS concentration was related (-0.66 Spearman rank, p < .001) to discharging groundwater that showed an evaporative signature (deuterium excess), indicating flow through at least one upgradient kettle lake. Therefore, more regional groundwater flowpaths originating from outside the local river corridor tended to show higher PFAS concentrations as evaluated at their respective discharge zones. Conversely, PFAS concentrations were typically low at discharges that did not indicate evaporation and were adjacent to steep hillslopes and, therefore, were classified as locally recharged groundwater. Previous research at this stream found that the native brook trout spawn at discharge points of groundwater recharged on local hillslopes, likely in response to generally higher levels of DO. Our study shows that by targeting high oxygen discharges the trout may thereby be avoiding emerging contaminants such as PFAS in groundwater recharged farther from the stream.

AB On the cultivated plateau of the loess belt area, the redistribution of precipitation is controlled by topography, cultural techniques and sealing processes. Recent multi-scale studies carried out in northern France have provided quantitative references of interrill erosion rates. These experimental references have highlighted significant differences and evolution trends of mean sediment concentration in interrill flow between different defined categories of soil surface conditions, vegetation and rainfall characteristics. Thus, a classification of sediment concentration in interrill flow has been elaborated (Cerdan O, et al. 2002. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 27(2): 193-205). The objective of this paper is to incorporate these results in the elaboration of the interrill erosion module of the STREAM model. At the field scale, this classification is used to assign a potential sediment concentration value to each agricultural field. For situations where there is no, or insufficient, experimental references, the classification is completed using a fuzzy logic approach. At the catchment scale, sediment is transported in proportion of the runoff volumes computed with the STREAM runoff module, and is deposited as a function of topography (vertical curvature, slope gradient), or vegetation cover. Sediment concentration thresholds were defined after field experiments; these thresholds define the limits above which sediment mass is deposited. The erosion component of the model has been tested with a data set from a small (ca 90 ha) intensively cultivated catchment. The quality of prediction given by the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is ca 8 t of precision on sediment delivery at the catchment outlet for observed sediment delivery that goes from 0.075 to 21 t (with an RMSE of ca 0.9 t for observed sediment delivery below 1 t and of ca 10.6 t for observed sediment delivery between 1 and ca. 21 1). The evaluation also showed that the results at the outlet of the catchment are more sensitive to the concentration thresholds of the deposition rules than to the potential sediment concentration values assigned to each field.

AB Location probability can be used to describe the likely position of a solute particle as it travels through an aquifer. Forward location probability describes the likely future positions of a particle, and can be used to predict the movement of a contaminant plume. Backward location probability describes the likely prior positions of a solute particle, and can be used to identify sources of contamination. For sorbing solutes, the probability distributions must also account for the phase (aqueous or sorbed) of a solute particle. We present new phase-dependent forward and backward location probabilities to describe transport of a solute undergoing linear non-equilibrium sorption. The effects of sorption are incorporated directly into the governing equations that are used to calculate the probability distributions. The shape and magnitude of the distributions depend on the phase of the contamination at both the source (or prior location) and receptor (or future location). These probabilities are related to adjoint states of concentration. Using adjoint theory, Bayes' theorem, and a clever transformation, we develop a model to efficiently calculate backward location probabilities for one or a few receptors. We illustrate important features of backward location probabilities for a sorbing solute with a hypothetical, one-dimensional confined aquifer, and we demonstrate their use in identifying sources of contamination for a trichloroethylene plume at the Massachusetts Military Reservation using a three-dimensional numerical model.

AB The Budyko framework, widely regarded as a simple and convenient tool to synthesize catchment water balance, is often employed with the atmospheric evaporative potential (E-p) that responds to water availability over a land surface. In this study, we demonstrated how the responsiveness of E-p to soil moisture deficiency affects outcomes from a conventional Budyko equation. We combined a two-parameter Budyko equation with the state-of-the-art complementary relationship (CR) of evaporation (E), and analytically showed that the two-parameter Budyko equation corrects E-p to the wet environment E (E-w) of the CR. Using the Budyko equation combined with the CR, we assessed runoff sensitivity to climatic and land surface changes. Results showed that the CR could become a constraint for calibrating the implicit parameter of the Budyko equation. When compared to the Turc-Mezentsev equation with E-p, the shape parameters of the two-parameter Budyko equation increased to regenerate an ensemble of global E data sets. Correcting E-p to E-w via the Budyko equation with CR reduced runoff elasticities to land property changes, suggesting that climatic changes are more important to changes in runoff than a prior sensitivity assessment would suggest. This study also suggests that the two-parameter Budyko equation isolates the effect of the E-p adjustment from the shape parameter, allowing it to more properly account for surface energy availability.

AB A two-dimensional, spatially distributed flow dynamics model was developed and tested for a 1.5 by 4 km area of the patterned ridge and slough landscape of the Florida Everglades. This model is intended to support a deepened understanding of the system ecohydrological dynamics, and provide a useful tool for management decision support. The model was constructed with a fine enough mesh structure to ensure proper representation of ridge and slough topographic detail as well as capture local hydrologic influences. Upstream and downstream stage data collected near the study area in central Water Conservation Area 3A were used to establish the initial and boundary conditions. Water velocities measured in the ridges and sloughs over a 3-year period were used to calibrate and verify the model. Hydraulic resistance was computed using a power-law relationship with water depth. The simulated water levels, water depths, and flow velocities showed good agreement with the 3-year field-monitored data with percent model errors of approximately 4%, 12%, and 10%, respectively. Computed differences in hydraulic resistance between ridge and slough were reduced significantly during the storm season compared to the dry season. This suggests that more solute and suspended solid mass can be redistributed from the sloughs to the ridges in particular during wet seasons, due to the weakened heterogeneity of hydraulic resistance during high flows.

AB The effect of emergent stems on the transport of downstream floating particles (e.g., buoyant seeds) is explored theoretically and experimentally at moderate to high Reynolds number (R-d = 2U(b)a(s)/nu > 300) in an open channel, where U-b is the bulk velocity, a(s) is stem radius, and nu is the kinematic viscosity. Longitudinal dispersion (D-l) of such seeds is shown to be given by D-l = U-p(3)tau(2)(0)eta(1 - eta)/2/S-1 + eta tau U-0(p)) thereby requiring the bulk transport velocity of particles U-p, spacing between canopy elements S-1, collision efficiency eta between a particle and the stem, and a wake trapping time scale tau(0). Linkages between U-p and U-b, and terms eta and tau(0) are then derived using inhomogeneous flow characteristics adjacent to the stem with physical properties of particles. A semiempirical model with potential flow theory around the stem is introduced to estimate eta whereas tau(0) is shown to be related to the bulk drag coefficient and radius of stems. The D-l is experimentally determined across a wide range of R-d and particle sizes and shown to be in good agreement with the proposed model calculations.

AB This paper presents the fundamental theory and laboratory test results on a new device that is deployed in boreholes in fractured rock aquifers to characterize vertical distributions of water and contaminant fluxes, aquifer hydraulic properties, and fracture network properties (e.g., active fracture density and orientation). The device, a fractured rock passive flux meter (FRPFM), consists of an inflatable core assembled with upper and lower packers that isolate the zone of interest from vertical gradients within the borehole. The outer layer of the core consists of an elastic fabric mesh equilibrated with a visible dye which is used to provide visual indications of active fractures and measures of fracture location, orientation, groundwater flux, and the direction of that flux. Beneath the outer layer is a permeable sorbent that is preloaded with known amounts of water soluble tracers which are eluted at rates proportional to groundwater flow. This sorbent also captures target contaminants present in intercepted groundwater. The mass of contaminant sorbed is used to quantify cumulative contaminant flux; whereas, the mass fractions of resident tracers lost are used to provide measures of water flux. In this paper, the FRPFM is bench tested over a range of fracture velocities (2-20 m/day) using a single fracture flow apparatus (fracture aperture = 0.5 mm). Test results show a discoloration in visible dye corresponding to the location of the active fracture. The geometry of the discoloration can be used to discern fracture orientation as well as direction and magnitude of flow in the fracture. Average contaminant fluxes were measured within 16% and water fluxes within 25% of known imposed fluxes.

AB Pool-riffle dynamics is governed by complex time and spatial interactions between water and sediment flows. In the last few decades, significant advances have been made in characterizing and modeling the hydrodynamics of pool-riffle sequences, and this information has been extensively used as the basis of conceptual models to describe or infer pool-riffle morphodynamics. A lot less attention, however, has been paid to the coupled dynamics of flow and sediment, which is essential to fully understand these complex geomorphic systems. This paper uses an unsteady 1-D flow-morphology and bed-sorting model to analyze pool-riffle dynamics. The model is first applied to a pool-riffle sequence on a 1.1 km reach of the lower Bear Creek, Arkansas, United States. After showing the model's ability to describe the general reach hydrodynamics and morphological evolution over 1 year, the detailed sediment and flow information is used to investigate pool-riffle dynamics in terms of self-maintenance mechanisms. Two effects that have been only marginally explored in the past, i.e., bed sediment sorting and downstream riffle control, are explained and quantified with the help of the model's outputs. The results show that self-maintenance occurs more frequently than previously thought as a result of grain sorting and that erosion or deposition of contiguous riffles also constitutes a self-maintenance mechanism. These findings provide the support for a physically based, integral description of pool-riffle morphodynamics and highlight the importance of flow and sediment variability on pool-riffle self-maintenance. The morphodynamic analysis bridges the gap between observations and current theories based mainly on hydrodynamic information.

AB Natural hillslopes are mostly composed of complex slope shapes, which significantly affect soil erosion. However, existing studies have mainly focused on uniform slopes to simplify complex hillslopes, and the mechanisms responsible for the influence of slope shape on soil and nutrient losses are still not well understood, especially in the application of soil improvers to reduce soil loss. To investigate the effects of slope shape and polyacrylamide (PAM) application on runoff, soil erosion and nutrient loss, this study conducted artificial field rainfall experiments involving two PAM application rates and nine slope shapes. The results indicate that the average amount of soil loss from convex slopes was 1.5 and 1.3 times greater than that from concave and uniform slopes, respectively, and the average amount of ammonia nitrogen loss and phosphate loss increased by 24.0%-58.6%. Soil and nutrient losses increased as the convexity of the convex slopes increased. For runoff, there was little difference between concave and convex slopes, but the runoff amount for both slopes was greater than that for uniform slopes. After PAM application, the soil loss decreased by more than 90%, and the nutrient loss decreased by 28.2%-68.1%. The application of PAM was most effective in reducing soil erosion and nutrient loss from convex slopes, and it is recommended to appropriately increase the PAM application rate for convex slopes. A strong linear relationship between ammonia nitrogen and phosphate concentrations and sediment concentrations was found in the runoff on slopes with no PAM application. However, this linear relationship weakened for slopes with PAM application. The findings of this study may be valuable for optimizing nonpoint source pollution management in basins.

AB Improving empirical prediction of plot soil erosion at the event temporal scale has both scientific and practical importance. In this investigation, 492 runoff and soil loss data from plots of different lengths, (1144m), and steepness, s (14.9s26.0%), established at the Sparacia experimental station, in Sicily, South Italy, were used to derive a new version of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-MM model, by only assuming a value of one for the topographic length, L, and steepness, S, factors for =22m and s=9%, respectively. An erosivity index equal to (Q(R)EI(30))(b1), Q(R) and EI30 being the runoff coefficient and the event rainfall erosivity index, respectively, with b(1)>1 was found to be an appropriate choice for the Sparacia area. The specifically developed functions for L and S did not differ appreciably from other, more widely accepted relationships (maximum differences by a factor of 1.22 for L and 1.09 for S). The new version of the USLE-MM performed particularly well for highly erosive events, because predicted soil loss differed by not more than a factor of 1.19 from the measured soil loss for measured values of more than 100Mgha(-1). The choice of the relationships to predict topographic effects on plot soil loss should not represent a point of particular concern in the application of the USLE-MM in other environments. However, tests of the empirical approach should be carried out in other experimental areas in an attempt to develop analytical tools, usable at the event temporal scale, reasonably simple and of wide validity.

TI Monitoring reservoir storage in South Asia from multisatellite remote

ID RADAR ALTIMETER; LEVEL CHANGES; WATER; LAKES; SERIES
AB Reservoir storage information is essential for accurate flood monitoring and prediction. South Asia, however, is dominated by international river basins where communications among neighboring countries about reservoir storage and management are extremely limited. A suite of satellite observations were combined to achieve high-quality estimation of reservoir storage and storage variations in South Asia from 2000 to 2012. The approach used water surface area estimations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices product and the area-elevation relationship to estimate reservoir storage. The surface elevation measurements were from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In order to improve the accuracy of water surface area estimations for relatively small reservoirs, a novel classification algorithm was developed. In this study, storage information was retrieved for a total of 21 reservoirs, which represents 28% of the integrated reservoir capacity in South Asia. The satellite-based reservoir elevation and storage were validated by gauge observations over five reservoirs. The storage estimates were highly correlated with observations (i.e., coefficients of determination larger than 0.9), with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 9.51% to 25.20%. Uncertainty analysis was also conducted for the remotely sensed storage estimations. For the parameterization uncertainty associated with surface area retrieval, the storage mean relative error was 3.90%. With regard to the uncertainty introduced by ICESat/GLAS elevation measurements, the storage mean relative error was 0.67%.

AB Climate models suggest an important role for land-atmosphere feedbacks on climate, but exhibit a large dispersion in the simulation of this role. We focus here on the role of continental recycling in the intraseasonal variability of continental moisture, and we explore the possibility of using water isotopic measurements to observationally constrain this role. Based on water tagging, we design a diagnostic, named D1, to estimate the role of continental recycling on the intraseasonal variability of continental moisture simulated by the general circulation model LMDZ. In coastal regions, the intraseasonal variability of continental moisture is mainly driven by the variability in oceanic moisture convergence. More inland, the role of continental recycling becomes important. The simulation of this role is sensitive to model parameters modulating evapotranspiration. Then we show that D in the low-level water vapor is a good tracer for continental recycling, due to the enriched signature of transpiration. Over tropical land regions, the intraseasonal relationship between D and precipitable water, named D1_iso, is a good observational proxy for D1. We test the possibility of using D1_iso for model evaluation using two satellite data sets: GOSAT and TES. LMDZ captures well the spatial patterns of D1_iso, but underestimates its values. However, a more accurate description of how atmospheric processes affect the isotopic composition of water vapor is necessary before concluding with certitude that LMDZ underestimates the role of continental recycling.

AB A pore-scale simulation technique based on level set interface tracking has been developed for modeling coupled reactive flow and structure evolution in porous media and fracture apertures. Advection, diffusion, and mineral precipitation resulting in changes in pore geometries are treated simultaneously by solving fully coupled fluid flow and reactive solute transport equations. The reaction-induced evolution of solid grain surfaces is captured using a level set method, and a subgrid representation of the interface based on the level set approach is used instead of a pixel representation of the interface often used in cellular automata and lattice-Boltzmann simulations. Precipitation processes within a 2-D porous medium represented by nonoverlapping discs were simulated under various flow conditions and reaction rates, and the resulting changes of pore geometry are discussed. The simulation results indicate that under reaction-limited conditions, precipitation is nearly uniform over the grain surfaces. However, this is no longer true when reaction is relatively fast and diffusion is the dominant transport process. In such cases, precipitation occurs mostly near the throat inlet and results in rapid permeability reduction with only a small reduction of porosity. In the case of fast reaction with transport dominated by advection (which is mostly likely in engineered remediation applications), solute can be delivered deep into fracture apertures and precipitation occurs mostly along preferential flow paths. Quantitative relationships between permeability and porosity under various flow conditions and reaction rates are also reported.

AB Moving toward high-resolution gridded hydrologic models asks for novel parametrization approaches. A high-resolution conceptual hydrologic model (wflow_sbm) was parameterized for the Rhine basin in Europe based on point-scale (pedo)transfer functions, without further calibration of effective model parameters on discharge. Parameters were estimated on the data resolution, followed by upscaling of parameter fields to the model resolution. The method was tested using a 6-hourly time step at four model resolutions (1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 km), followed by a validation with discharge observations and a comparison with actual evapotranspiration (ETact) estimates from an independent model (DMET Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility). Additionally, the scalability of parameter fields and simulated fluxes was tested. Validation of simulated discharges yielded Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, except for the Alps where a volume bias caused lower performance. Catchment-averaged temporal ETact dynamics were comparable with independent ET estimates (KGE approximate to 0.7), although wflow_sbm model simulations were on average 115 mm yr(-1) higher. Spatially, the two models were less in agreement (SPAEF = 0.10), especially around the Rhine valley. Consistent parameter fields were obtained, and by running the model at the different resolutions, preserved ETact fluxes were found across the scales. For recharge, fluxes were less consistent with relative errors around 30% for regions with high drainage densities. However, catchment-averaged fluxes were better preserved. Routed discharge in headwaters was not consistent across scales, although simulations for the main Rhine River were. Better processing (scale independent) of the river and drainage network may overcome this issue.
   Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models are used for flood and drought predictions. Most models have parameters, and to increase model performance, hydrologists often tune these parameters by calibration. State-of-the-art gridded hydrologic models have parameter sets per grid cell, leading to many parameters and making current calibration procedures far from ideal. Here, we tested the use of well-known (pedo)transfer functions from literature to estimate these parameter values, something which can reduce the calibration burden. By using parameter-specific upscaling rules to derive seamless parameter maps for the wflow_sbm model, which explicitly takes subsurface lateral flows into account, this gives a model which is scalable to different grid cell sizes. We assessed the approach on multiple model resolutions, and we found consistent parameter fields and the preservation of vertical fluxes. Only routed discharge, a key output, deteriorates for headwater catchments on coarser resolutions. We attribute this to model structure and the derivation procedure of the river network on different scales, resulting in the loss of lateral flow representation on coarser resolutions. Nevertheless, discharge and evapotranspiration simulations are similar to observations and other models. Hence, regionalization with literature transfer functions and upscaling techniques can further lower the calibration burden and enable predictions in ungauged basins.
   Key Points
   Seamless distributed parameter maps can be obtained for the gridded hydrologic model wflow_sbm with transfer functions from literature Application of wflow_sbm with these seamless parameter maps yields simulation results with high KGE and NSE across the Rhine basin Fluxes matched across model scales for evapotranspiration, but this match was considerably less for fluxes affected by (sub)surface flows

AB Increasing our understanding of the small scale variability of drop size distributions (DSD), and therefore of several bulk characteristics of rainfall processes, has major implications for our interpretation of the remote sensing based estimates of precipitation and its uncertainty. During the spring and summer of 2002 the authors conducted the DEVEX experiment (disdrometer evaluation experiment) to compare measurements of natural rain made with three different types of disdrometers collocated at the Iowa City Municipal Airport in Iowa City, Iowa in the Midwestern United States. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the instruments rather than analysis of the hydrometeorological aspects of the observed events. The comparison demonstrates discrepancies between instruments. The authors discuss the systematic and random effects in terms of rainfall quantities, drop size distribution properties, and the observed drop size vs. velocity relationships. Since the instruments were collocated, the effects of the natural variability of rain are reduced some with time integration, isolating the instrumental differences. The authors discuss the status of DSD measurement technologies and the implications for a range of hydrologic applications from remote sensing of rainfall to atmospheric deposition to soil erosion and sediment transport in the environment. The data set collected during the DEVEX experiment is made available to the research community. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impacts of crop insurance on water withdrawals for irrigation
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARTICIPATION
AB Agricultural production remains particularly vulnerable to weather fluctuations and extreme events, such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Crop insurance is a risk management tool developed to mitigate some of this weather risk and protect farmer income in times of poor production. However, crop insurance may have unintended consequences for water resources sustainability, as the vast majority of freshwater withdrawals go to agriculture. The causal impact of crop insurance on water use in agriculture remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the empirical relationship between crop insurance and irrigation water withdrawals in the United States. Importantly, we use an instrumental variables approach to establish causality. Our methodology exploits a major policy change in the crop insurance system - the 1994 Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act - which imposed crop insurance requirements on farmers. We find that a 1% increase in insured crop acreage leads to a 0.223% increase in irrigation withdrawals, with most coming from groundwater aquifers. We identify farmers growing more groundwater-fed cotton as an important mechanism contributing to increased withdrawals. A 1% increase in insured crop acreage leads to a 0.624% increase in cotton acreage, or 95,602 acres. These results demonstrate that crop insurance causally leads to more irrigation withdrawals. More broadly, this work underscores the importance of determining causality in the water-food nexus as we endeavor to achieve global food security and water resources sustainability.

AB Probability amplitudes are fundamental to quantum mechanics and offer robust descriptions of complicated systems, which have allowed physicists to explain behaviors inaccessible to classical physics. This article ponders how some of the same conceptual underpinnings of the mathematics used for modeling quantum systems might be applied to subsurface water resources problems and speculates how these tools could facilitate applications on quantum computers. A probability amplitude-based model for describing advective-dispersive transport in porous media using linear operators is investigated. The proposed complex valued model decomposes spreading into two "sub-continuum partial dispersion" coefficients, and this recovers classical spreading when the sum of these coefficients is the Fickian dispersion coefficient. However, the probability amplitudes have a many-to-one relationship to a probability distribution, so it embeds a level of heterogeneity into seemingly equivalent functions. Two propagators with different sub-continuum coefficients may have the same macroscopic behavior when either is considered in isolation, but when they act on the other the system's behavior changes. Differences in the amplitudes cause a reduction in spreading as velocity correlations are disrupted, despite both propagators having identical dispersion coefficients, and this cannot be achieved using classical methods without changing the dispersion coefficient. The main point is that these amplitude-based models offer a way to embed information about the system into the propagators, instead of just "averaging it out" when making an upscaled model.

AB Quantifying the spatial configuration of hydraulic conductivity (K) in heterogeneous geological environments is essential for accurate predictions of contaminant transport, but is difficult because of the inherent limitations in resolution and coverage associated with traditional hydrological measurements. To address this issue, we consider crosshole and surface-based electrical resistivity geophysical measurements, collected in time during a saline tracer experiment. We use a Bayesian Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (McMC) methodology to jointly invert the dynamic resistivity data, together with borehole tracer concentration data, to generate multiple posterior realizations of K that are consistent with all available information. We do this within a coupled inversion framework, whereby the geophysical and hydrological forward models are linked through an uncertain relationship between electrical resistivity and concentration. To minimize computational expense, a facies-based subsurface parameterization is developed. The Bayesian-McMC methodology allows us to explore the potential benefits of including the geophysical data into the inverse problem by examining their effect on our ability to identify fast flowpaths in the subsurface, and their impact on hydrological prediction uncertainty. Using a complex, geostatistically generated, two-dimensional numerical example representative of a fluvial environment, we demonstrate that flow model calibration is improved and prediction error is decreased when the electrical resistivity data are included. The worth of the geophysical data is found to be greatest for long spatial correlation lengths of subsurface heterogeneity with respect to wellbore separation, where flow and transport are largely controlled by highly connected flowpaths.

AB In order to optimize the operation rule curve of the Shahrchay reservoir in the north-west of Iran under climate change, a new integrated simulation-optimization framework under different climate change scenarios was introduced in the current study. The proposed framework contains several steps: First, the more accurate general circulation models (GCMs) were chosen among several available GCMs and the predictors screening based on decision tree model (M5) was applied to select the most important predictors among enormous number of potential large-scale climate variables of GCMs. Then, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained by the observed temperature and precipitation time series and the selected dominant predictors to downscale the precipitation and temperature parameters of GCMs for the base period (1951-2000) over the case area and the future monthly predictions of temperature and precipitation were implemented by the trained ANNs under A1B, B1, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios to assess the future changes of precipitation and temperature between 2020 and 2060. Thereafter, the estimated precipitation values were imposed to the hybrid Wavelet-M5 model to simulate inflow (runoff) to the Shahrchay reservoir and finally, genetic algorithm (GA) was used in order to optimize the operation rule curves of the reservoir system using the predicted average monthly precipitation, evaporation, inflow and considering water supply for agricultural and municipal targets and minimization of total squared deficiencies for future. The Wavelet-M5 model could result in a reliable performance in the one-step-ahead runoff prediction as the obtained correlation coefficient (CC) for training and verifying data sets were 98% and 97.7%, respectively. The results showed that the average long-term annual runoff volume may be decreased between 0.08% and 2.27% in the future with regard to the base period, and the simulation results for present and future conditions indicated a decrease in water availability. Also, the estimated optimal rule curves for the reservoir showed a different shape for all scenarios employed in this study.

AB Physicochemical forces are responsible for the swelling pressure development in saturated bentonites. In this paper, the swelling pressures of several compacted bentonite specimens for a range of dry density of 1.10-1.73 Mg/m(3) were measured experimentally. The clay used was a divalent-rich Ca-Mg-bentonite with 12% exchangeable Na(+) ions. The theoretical swelling pressure-dry density relationship for the bentonite was determined from the Gouy-Chapman diffuse double-layer theory. A comparison of experimental and theoretical results showed that the experimental swelling pressures are either smaller or greater than their theoretical counterparts within different dry density ranges. It is shown that for dry density of the clay less than about 1.55 Mg/m(3), a possible dissociation of ions from the surface of the clay platelets contributed to the diffuse double-layer repulsion. At higher dry densities, the adsorptive forces due to surface and ion hydration dominated the swelling pressures of the clay. A comparison of the modified diffuse double-layer theory equations proposed in the literature to determine the swelling pressures of compacted bentonites and the experimental results for the clay in this study showed that the agreement between the calculated and experimental swelling pressure results is very good for dry densities less than 1.55 Mg/m(3), whereas at higher dry densities the use of the equations was found to be limited.

AB With the development of large-scale rice cultivation management initiatives in East Asia, there is concern that a reduction in the number of human cultivators per unit area may lead to poor water management, which could result in decreased land productivity, owing to abnormally high- and low-temperature damage to crops. Accurate simulation of paddy field water temperature is important for studying its impact on crops and providing timely information to aid in decision-making for more efficient management under limited resources. We propose a neural-network framework that considers the heat transfer by the vegetation canopy and applies physical-theory constraints in its training. A novel tuning method is proposed to cope with the trade-off between water temperature accuracy and physical consistency during training to ensure that the calculated water temperature variations in a paddy field enjoy high accuracy and physical consistency. In the experiments, the proposed framework outperforms physical process models and pure neural network models while maintaining high accuracy in the case of sparse data sets. Furthermore, an attention-mechanism input layer is integrated into the model to rank feature importance, providing global interpretation to the proposed framework. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the physical process and propose models to compare their different strategies of feature ranking. The results show that the two methods have different sensitivities to different feature patterns, but they complement each other. In summary, the proposed model is credible and stable for practical applications and has the potential to guide more efficient paddy management.

AB Does a dynamic drainage density have a role on species persistence in the river basin? The general viability of a focus species under time-varying hydrologic connectivity and habitat quality is a topic gaining traction in view of recent advances in our understanding of flowing fluvial network dynamics and of ecological interactions occurring on directed trees. Here, we combine metapopulation dynamics and scaling theory to investigate how the structure of river networks and time-changing hydrological and geomorphological attributes control local metapopulation survival. This is done by introducing seasonal fluctuations of the drainage density subsuming overall time-changing connectivity and distributed changes in habitat quality of the fluvial domain. Suitable replicas of channel networks within an assigned domain are used to compute the statistics of evolving metapopulation capacities, properties of a landscape matrix measuring the viability of the focus species. To obtain consistent replicas of the substrate for ecological interactions, we employ constructs whose suitability for the task has long been established. We find that the river network structure blends the fluctuations into a nontrivial scaling of the metapopulation capacity with the sum of total active contributing sites at any point of the flowing network. The latter is proportional to the mean distance to the outlet of the flowing dendrite and to the tree diameter-a measure of the overall connectivity of the active stream links. Scaling emerges as a robust ensemble property that enables the linkage of ecological patterns across a river network to clearly identified hydrological and geomorphological factors.

AB This paper develops a coupled hydrologic-economic model that estimates the effects of six tax institutions that theory predicts will lead to equal amounts of aquifer withdrawal. That said, the distributive effects of the tax institutions are expected to differ because each involves different combinations of tax thresholds and side payments (returned tax revenue). The tax policies can lead to groundwater users being worse off than they would be using an unmanaged aquifer. This study explores whether the distributive impacts of specific policies that have equal marginal incentives lead to differences in the behavior of participants in an experiment involving a common pool groundwater resource. The results reveal that each of the tax policies results in approximately the same reduction in resource use but affects participants' earnings and opinions regarding the policies differently. A tax imposed on groundwater use above a threshold and without a side payment is most effective in increasing the net social benefit associated with using the aquifer; participant earnings under that scheme are almost equal to earnings from an unmanaged aquifer (1.04% less), and overall social efficiency is greater (4.34%). Unfortunately, participants tend to prefer an unmanaged aquifer and tax policies with high side-payments-treatments that led to lower overall social efficiency. The evidence suggests that aquifer management may require a two-fold approach: (1) a carefully selected threshold that can make water users financially indifferent between a managed and unmanaged aquifer and (2) education to increase the political acceptability of the managed aquifer policy.

AB We investigated the frequency domain relationships between four atmospheric teleconnections (Trans-Nino Index TNI, Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO, Northern Annular Mode/Arctic Oscillation Index NAM/AO, and Pacific/North American PNA pattern) and water levels in the Great Lakes from 1948 to 2002 by quantifying the coherence between these time series. The levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the TNI in the frequency range (3-7)(-1) cycles year(-1), and with the PDO in interdecadal frequencies. The levels in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie are significantly correlated with the PNA pattern in interdecadal frequencies, and the levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the NAM/AO in interannual frequencies.
   We investigated also the coherence, or "climate link", between atmospheric teleconnections and the Great Lakes regional climate, namely precipitation, evaporation, air temperature, and connecting channel flows, and the coherence, or "hydrologic link" between regional climate and lake levels. The effect of the teleconnections on lake levels is mostly transmitted through the "climate links" and the "hydrologic links", particularly through the channel inflows to Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario. Connecting channel flows depend on the cumulative effect of upstream lakes and their watersheds and transmit interannual and interdecadal signals better than precipitation, evaporation, and air temperature.

AB The period of direct groundwater storage measurements is often too short to allow reliable inferences of groundwater storage trends at catchment scales. However, as groundwater storage sustains low flows in catchments during dry periods, groundwater storage can also be estimated indirectly from daily stream-flow based on hydraulic groundwater theory; this idea was applied herein to 17 selected Australian catchments to examine their long-term (half a century or longer) groundwater storage trends. On average, over past 45 years, groundwater storage exhibited negative trends in all the selected catchments, except in the Katherine River catchment located in the Northern Territory. These negative trends persisted over longer periods, close to 100 years in some catchments and the strongest decreasing trend of 0.241 mm per year was observed in the Barron River catchment in New South Wales. However, groundwater storage exhibited different trends over the different shorter periods. Thus, while during the period of 1997-2007, 15 out of the 17 catchments showed negative trends in groundwater storage, during the period of 1980-2000, 12 out of the 17 catchments exhibited positive trends in groundwater storage; this underscores the fact that record lengths of one or even two decades are inadequate to derive meaningful trends. Strong consistencies in the trends exist across most catchments, indicating that groundwater storage is affected by large-scale climate factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the shallow groundwater areas of the North China Plain (NCP), precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration in the vertical direction are the main processes of the water cycle, in which the unsaturated zone plays an important role in the transformation process between precipitation and groundwater. In this paper, two typical sites in Cangzhou (CZ) and Hengshui (HS) of Hebei province with shallow water tables were selected to analyse the relationship among precipitation, soil water and groundwater. At each site, precipitation, soil water at depths 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300 cm, and groundwater were sampled to analyse the stable isotope compositions of hydrogen and oxygen. The soil water potentials at the corresponding depths were observed. Although the climates at the two sites are similar, there are some differences in the infiltration process, soil water movement and groundwater recharge sources. Evaporation occurred at the upper depths, which led to the decrease of soil potential and the enrichment of heavy isotopes. At the CZ site, precipitation infiltrated with piston mode, and an obvious mixture effect existed during the infiltration process. Preferential flow may exist in the soil above 100 cm depth. However, at the HS site soil water moved in piston mode, and groundwater was mainly recharged by precipitation. When precipitation recharged the groundwater it experienced a strong evaporation effect. The results of the soil water movement mechanism provides the transformation relationship among precipitation, soil water and groundwater in the middle and eastern NCP.

AB The generalization of the parameters of rainfall-runoff models, to enable application at ungauged sites, is an important and ongoing area of research. This paper compares the performance of three alternative methods of generalization, for two parameter-sparse conceptual models (PDM and TATE), specifically for use in flood frequency estimation using continuous simulation. Two of the methods are based on fitting regression relationships between catchment properties and calibrated parameter values, using weighted or sequential regression (with weights based on estimates of calibration uncertainty), and the third is based on the use of pooling groups, defined through measures of site-similarity based on catchment properties. The study uses a relatively large sample of catchments in Britain.
   For the PDM, the site-similarity method performs best, but not greatly better than either regression method, so there may be cases where the use of regression would be preferable. For the TATE model, weighted regression performs best (with a very similar level of performance to that of the PDM with site-similarity), whereas site-similarity performs worst (due to poor performance for catchments with higher baseflow), indicating that the choice of model and generalization method should not be separated. The use of sequential regression, which was developed to try to allow for parameter interdependence, shows no clear advantage for either model. Other than the poor performance of the TATE model with site-similarity for catchments with a higher baseflow index, there are no clear relationships between performance of any model/method and catchment type.

AB The Richards equation is unsuccessful at describing gravity-driven unstable flow with nonmonotonic water content distribution. This shortcoming is resolved in the current study by introducing the moving-boundary approach. Following this approach, the flow domain is divided into two subdomains with a sharp change in fluid saturation between them (moving boundary). The upper subdomain consists of water and air, whose relationship varies with space and time following the imposed boundary condition at the soil surface calculated by the Richards equation. The lower subdomain consists of an initially dry soil that remains constant. The location of the boundary between the two subdomains is part of the solution, rendering the problem nonlinear. The moving boundary solution was used after verification to demonstrate the effect of contact angle, soil characteristic curves and incoming flux on the dynamic water-entry pressure of the soil, which depends on the soil's wettability, incoming flux at the soil surface and the wetting front's propagation rate. Lower soil wettability hinders spontaneous invasion of the dry pores and, together with a higher input flux, induces water accumulation behind the wetting front (saturation overshoot). The wetting front starts to propagate once the pressure building up behind it exceeds the dynamic water-entry pressure. To conclude, the physically based novel moving-boundary approach for solving stable and gravity-driven unstable flow in soils was developed and verified. It supports the conjecture that saturation overshoot is a prerequisite for gravity-driven fingering.

AB Hysteretic processes have been recognized for decades as an important characteristic of soil hydraulic behavior. Several studies confirmed that wetting and drying periods cannot be described by a simple functional relationship, and that some nonequilibrium of the water retention characteristics has to be taken into account. A large number of models describing the hysteresis of the soil water retention characteristic were successfully tested on soil cores under controlled laboratory conditions. However, its relevance under field conditions under natural forcings has rarely been investigated. In practice, the modeling of field soils usually neglects the hysteretic nature of soil hydraulic properties. In this study, long-term observations of water content and matric potential in lysimeters of the lysimeter network TERENO-SoilCan are presented, clearly demonstrating the hysteretic behavior of field soils. We propose a classification into three categories related to different time scales. Based on synthetic and long-term monitoring data, three different models of hysteresis were applied to data sets showing different degrees of hysteresis. We found no single model to be superior to the others. The model ranking depended on the degree of hysteresis. All models were able to reflect the general structure of hysteresis in most cases but failed to reproduce the detailed trajectories of state variables especially under highly transient conditions. As an important result we found that the temporal dynamics of wetting and drying significantly affects these trajectories which should be accounted for in future model concepts.

AB This study uses numerical simulations to define the salient controls on regional groundwater flow in 3-D mountainous terrain by systematically varying topographic and hydrogeologic variables. Topography for idealized multiple-basin mountainous terrain is derived from geomatic data and literature values. Water table elevation, controlled by the ratio of recharge to hydraulic conductivity, largely controls the distribution of recharged water into local, regional, and perpendicular flow systems, perpendicular flow being perpendicular to the regional topographic gradient. Both the relative (%) and absolute ( m(3)/d) values of regional flow and perpendicular flow are examined. The relationship between regional flow and water table elevation is highly nonlinear. With lower water table elevations, relative and absolute regional flow dramatically increase and decrease, respectively, as the water table is lowered further. However, for higher water table elevations above the top of the headwater stream, changes in water table elevation have little effect on regional flow. Local flow predominates in high water table configurations, with regional and perpendicular flow < 15% and < 10%, respectively, of total recharge in the models tested. Both the relative and the maximum absolute regional flow are directly controlled by the degree of incision of the mountain drainage network; the elevation of mountain ridges is considerably less important. The percentage of the headwater stream with perennial streamflow is a potentially powerful indicator of regional flow in all water table configurations and may be a good indicator of the susceptibility of mountain groundwater systems to increased aridity.

AB Extreme droughts may be characterized by their duration, severity ( magnitude or intensity), spatial extent, and frequency or return period. Comparing the time series of water supply and water demand and analyzing droughts based on the theory of runs may determine these characteristics. This study is focused on drought analysis where the underlying water supply process is periodic stochastic, such as for monthly streamflows. The probability mass function (pmf) of drought length and associated low-order moments are derived assuming a periodic simple Markov chain. The derived pmf allows estimating the occurrence probability of droughts of a given length and its return period. The applicability of the drought formulations has been illustrated using a variety of water supply series such as monthly and weekly precipitation, monthly streamflows, the Palmer hydrologic drought index, and the standardized precipitation index. The results obtained confirm the validity of the analytical derivations for drought lengths and associated return periods. The overall conclusion of the study is that simple definitions of droughts enables one characterizing droughts using stochastic approaches and analytical derivations. They are particularly useful for drought analysis because the limited hydrologic records that are generally available do not allow observing many drought events of a particular duration and, in fact, extremely long droughts may not even be observable from the historical sample. This hinders the applicability of an inferential approach for finding the probability distributions of drought lengths and their associated return periods because it is either impractical or not feasible.

AB The spontaneous imbibition of water into the matrix and gas-filled fractures of unsaturated porous media is an important phenomenon in many geotechnical applications. Previous studies have focused on the imbibition behavior of water in the matrix, but few works have considered spontaneous imbibition along fractures. In this work, a new fractal model, considering the water losses from the fracture to the matrix, was established to predict the sorptivity of rough-walled fracture. A fractal model, considering the fractal dimension of tortuosity, was modified to estimate the sorptivity of the matrix. Both of the models have a time exponent a and can be simplified to the classical Lucas-Washburn (L-W) equation with alpha = 0.50. To verify the proposed models, quantitative data on the imbibition of water in both the matrix and the fracture of unsaturated sandstone were acquired by neutron radiography. The results show that the motion of the wetting front in both the matrix and the fracture does not obey the L-W equation. Both theory and experimental observations indicate that fracture can significantly increase spontaneous imbibition in unsaturated sandstone by capillary action. Compared with the classical L-W equation, the models proposed in this study offers a better description of the dynamic imbibition behavior of water in unsaturated fractured sandstone and, thus, more reliable predictions of the sorptivity of the matrix and the fracture. Moreover, a new method to estimate the time exponent of rough-walled fracture in sandstone was also provided.

AB Identification of groundwater contaminant sources in a highly-heterogenous geosystems results in a highdimensional inverse problem and is often solved based on a surrogate model to alleviate the computational burden. Surrogate modeling through deep learning has a great potential for learning complex nonlinear relationships between model inputs and outputs. Most of the developed surrogates, however, can only estimate the contaminant concentration fields at a limit number of time-steps with a relatively large lag. In this paper, a transformer-based surrogate model is developed to provide a detailed release history of contaminant, which allows more accurate analyzing the distributions and planning. As such, a Koopman-operator-based convolutional autoencoder is trained and fixed prior to the training of transformer. Here, the encoder converts the concentration fields into a one-dimensional embedding space and the transformer is trained on this space to learn the system dynamics and predict the embedding feature at next time step, which is reconstructed back to the original space with the decoder. The proposed surrogate model is tested on a complex problem and the results demonstrate that the proposed transformer-based surrogate can efficiently provide an accurate estimation of the evolution of contaminant concentration field at a greater number of time-steps compared to the previous works.

AB Separating effects of climate change (Delta Q(c)) and human activity (Delta Q(h)) on stream discharge at the watershed scale is needed for developing adaptive measures to climate change. However, information is scarce in existing literature regarding whether such separating is feasible and whether reliable results can be produced. The objectives of this overview were to: (1) compare currently-used methods; (2) assess assumptions and issues of the methods; and (3) present a generic framework that overcomes possible issues. Based on the overview of fifteen recent representative studies, two methods can be used to estimate absolute magnitudes of Delta Q(c) and Delta Q(h), while another method can be used to distinguish relative magnitudes of Delta Q(c) versus Delta Q(h) only. Because the methods' fundamental assumptions about baseline versus altered period, water storage change and deep groundwater loss, precipitation-runoff relationship, hysteresis influence of human activity, and record of time series can seldom be satisfied for many watersheds, it is more realistic and practical to distinguish relative effects than to estimate absolute magnitudes of Delta Q(c) and Delta Q(h). Moreover, a generic framework was presented for gauged watersheds with negligible groundwater loss, aiming to avoid misuse of the methods in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Macroscopic root water uptake models proportional to a root density distribution function (RDDF) are most commonly used to model water uptake by plants. As the water uptake is difficult and labor intensive to measure, these models are often calibrated by inverse modeling. Most previous inversion studies assume RDDF to be constant with depth and time or dependent on only depth for simplification. However, under field conditions, this function varies with type of soil and root growth and thus changes with both depth and time. This study proposes an inverse method to calibrate both spatially and temporally varying RDDF in unsaturated water flow modeling. To overcome the difficulty imposed by the ill-posedness, the calibration is formulated as an optimization problem in the framework of the Tikhonov regularization theory, adding additional constraint to the objective function. Then the formulated nonlinear optimization problem is numerically solved with an efficient algorithm on the basis of the finite element method. The advantage of our method is that the inverse problem is translated into a Tikhonov regularization functional minimization problem and then solved based on the variational construction, which circumvents the computational complexity in calculating the sensitivity matrix involved in many derivative-based parameter estimation approaches (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt optimization). Moreover, the proposed method features optimization of RDDF without any prior form, which is applicable to a more general root water uptake model. Numerical examples are performed to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, discussions on the stability and extension of this method are presented.

AB A mixture model for general description of sediment-laden flows is developed based on an Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase flow theory, with the aim at gaining computational speed in the prediction, but preserving the accuracy of the complete two-fluid model. The basic equations of the model include the mass and momentum conservation equations for the sediment-water mixture, and the mass conservation equation for sediment. However, a newly-obtained expression for the slip velocity between phases allows for the computation of the sediment motion, without the need of solving the momentum equation for sediment. The turbulent motion is represented for both the fluid and the particulate phases. A modified kappa-epsilon model is used to describe the fluid turbulence while an algebraic model is adopted for turbulent motion of particles. A two-dimensional finite difference method based on the SMAC scheme was used to numerically solve the mathematical model. The model is validated through simulations of fluid and suspended sediment motion in steady open-channel flows, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, as well as in oscillatory flows. The computed sediment concentrations, horizontal velocity and turbulent kinetic energy of the mixture are all shown to be in good agreement with available experimental data, and importantly, this is done at a fraction of the computational efforts required by the complete two-fluid model.

Here, we exploit a well-established hydrological model and a derived distribution approach to develop a coupled probabilistic description for the dynamics of the catchment discharge and the corresponding active network length. Analytical expressions for the flow duration curve (FDC) and the stream length duration curve (SLDC) were derived and used to provide a consistent classification of streamflow and active length regimes in temporary rivers. Two distinct streamflow regimes (persistent and erratic) and three different types of active length regimes (ephemeral, perennial, and ephemeral de facto) were identified depending on the value of two dimensionless parameters. These key parameters, which are related to the underlying streamflow fluctuations and the sensitivity of active length to changes in the catchment discharge (here quantified by the scaling exponent b), originate seven different behavioral classes characterized by contrasting shapes of the underlying SLDCs and FDCs. The analytical model was tested using data gathered in three study catchments located in Italy and USA, with satisfactory model performances in most cases. Our analytical and empirical results show the existence of a structural relationship between streamflow and active length regimes, which is chiefly modulated by the scaling exponent b. The proposed framework represents a promising tool for the coupled analysis of discharge and river network length dynamics in temporary streams.

AB Applications using simulation-optimization approaches are often limited in practice because of the high computational cost associated with executing the simulation-optimization analysis. This research proposes a nonlinearity interval mapping scheme (NIMS) to overcome the computational barrier of applying the simulation-optimization approach for a waste load allocation analysis. Unlike the traditional response surface methods that use response surface functions to approximate the functional form of the original simulation model, the NIMS approach involves mapping the nonlinear input-output response relationship of a simulation model into an interval matrix, thereby converting the original simulation-optimization model into an interval linear programming model. By using the risk explicit interval linear programming algorithm and an inverse mapping scheme to implicitly resolve nonlinearity in the interval linear programming model, the NIMS approach efficiently obtained near-optimal solutions of the original simulation-optimization problem. The NIMS approach was applied to a case study on Wissahickon Creek in Pennsylvania, with the objective of finding optimal carbonaceous biological oxygen demand and ammonia (NH4) point source waste load allocations, subject to daily average and minimum dissolved oxygen compliance constraints at multiple points along the stream. First, a simulation-optimization model was formulated for this case study. Next, a genetic algorithm was used to solve the problem to produce reference optimal solutions. Finally, the simulation-optimization model was solved using the proposed NIMS, and the obtained solutions were compared with the reference solutions to demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and solution quality of the NIMS.

AB Predicting inter-catchment groundwater flow (IGF) is essential because IGF greatly affects stream water discharge and water chemistry. However, methods for estimating sub-annual IGF and clarifying its mechanisms using minimal data are limited. Thus, we quantified the sub-annual IGF and elucidated its driving factors using the short-term water balance method (STWB) for three forest headwater catchments in Japan (named here catchment A, B and As). Our previous study using the chloride mass balance indicated that annual IGF of catchment A (49.0 ha) can be negligible. Therefore, we calculated the daily evapotranspiration (ET) rate using the Priestley-Taylor expression and the 5-year water balance in catchment A (2010-2014). The sub-annual IGF of the three catchments was then calculated by subtracting the ET rate from the difference between rainfall and stream discharge during the sub-annual water balance periods selected using the STWB. The IGF rates of catchment B (7.0 ha), which is adjacent to catchment A, were positive in most cases, indicating that more groundwater flowed out of the catchment than into it, and exhibited positive linear relationships with rainfall and stream discharge. This suggested that as the catchments became wetter, more groundwater flowed out of catchment B. Conversely, the IGF rates of catchment As (5.3 ha), included in catchment A, were negative in most cases, indicating that more groundwater flowed into the catchment than out from it, and exhibited negative linear relationships with rainfall and stream discharge. Given the topography of the catchments studied, infiltration into the bedrock was the probable reason for the IGF outflow from catchment B. We hypothesized that in catchment As, the discrepancy between the actual hydrological boundary and the surface topographic boundary could have caused an IGF inflow. This study provides a useful tool for determining an IGF model structure to be incorporated into rainfall-runoff models.

AB We examined the fire-induced changes in groundwater recharge rate. This aspect is particularly important in the case of large forested areas growing over a coastal aquifer affected by saltwater intrusion. In the Ravenna coastal area (Italy), pine forests grow on coastal dune belts, overlying a sandy unconfined aquifer, which is strongly affected by marine ingression. Three groundwater profiles across the forest and perpendicular to the coastline were monitored for groundwater level, physical, and chemical parameters. The aims were to define groundwater quality, recharge rate, freshwater volume, and highlight change, which occurred after a forest fire with reference to pre-fire conditions. Analytical solutions based on Darcy Law and the Dupuit Equation were applied to calculate unconfined flow and compare recharge rates among the profiles. The estimated recharge rates increased in the partially and completely burnt areas (219 and 511mmyear(-1), respectively) compared with the pristine pine forest area (73mmyear(-1)). Although pre-fire conditions were similar in all monitored profiles, a post-fire decrease in salinity was observed across the burnt forest, along with an increase in infiltration and freshwater lens thickness. This was attributed to decrease canopy interception and evapotranspiration caused by vegetation absence after the fire. This research provided an example of positive forest fire feedback on the quantity and quality of fresh groundwater resources in a lowland coastal aquifer affected by saltwater intrusion, with limited availability of freshwater resources. The fire provided an opportunity to evaluate a new forest management approach and consider the restoration and promotion of native dune herbaceous vegetation.

AB This study has been addressed the mechanisms of the co-current fluid flow in a heterogeneous porous media using the lattice Boltzmann method. Since the smallest interaction between viscous and capillary forces at the interface is of great importance, the simulations are performed with the hybrid phase-field model at the pore level. This is because the main advantage of this model is that due to its connection with the phase-field theory, it has a solid physical basis to record interface dynamics. Model verification is followed by recording viscous coupling effects. The relative permeability curves and the velocity profiles are compared with the analytical solution, so that the observations confirm the accuracy claim of the model. In the following, the fluid flow through the heterogeneous porous structure is simulated, so that its sweep efficiency and corresponding velocity field at the breakthrough time are discussed. The results show that increasing the injection velocity reduces the displacement efficiency and increases the velocity field fluctuations due to the viscous fingering regime. Changing the wetting conditions to strong imbibition (SI) will increase the efficiency due to the role of capillary pressure and corner flow mechanism. Also, increasing the interfacial tension in the SI and the strong drainage will increase and decrease the sweep efficiency, respectively, so the rate of changes in fully immiscible flow is much higher than the near miscible flow. The velocity fluctuations in the fully immiscible flow are more significant than in the near miscible flow, which is reasonable given the flow properties.

AB Water-resource management has become a major global issue in a world threatened by climate change. High-resolution geophysical methods may be of valuable help in monitoring the water masses, both in space and time. Passive seismic interferometry takes advantage of ambient seismic noise to recover the variations in seismic wave velocity induced by changes in groundwater. We present hereafter the time and space monitoring of an hydraulic dome artificially formed to prevent biological and chemical pollutants from entering the exploitation field of Crepieux-Charmy (Lyon, France). We use a dense seismic network to passively monitor the water table changes induced by infilling of an infiltration basin at the water supply facility for the two million inhabitants of the Lyon Metropolis (France). We assess the hourly seismic velocity variations over 19 days, during which two filling and drainage cycles were performed. The use of a dense three-component seismic network allows fine characterization of the seismic wavefield, and offers the possibility to include the analysis of 4,851 raypaths in a robust inversion algorithm based on ray theory. The velocity variations are mapped with high resolution. They are directly related to the water table variations and to residual water saturation changes within the unsaturated zone. This seismic experiment highlights the three-dimensional (3D) implementation and evolution of a hydraulic dome under the infiltration basin. This dynamic information helps in the understanding and modeling of water flows between the water table and a river, which represents a fundamental issue for discussions on the effectiveness of the barrier.

AB [ 1] This paper addresses a field-scale application of the integral pumping test (IPT) method, which is a method for quantitative characterization of contaminant plumes ( e. g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), chlorinated hydrocarbons, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons) in groundwater. We extend the associated analytical framework by formal consideration of linear, instantaneous sorption/retardation and provide novel nonrecursive analytical solutions for estimation of field-scale contaminant mass flows. We find that estimates of the average concentration obtained through IPTs are independent of the retardation factor under equilibrium conditions, although linear retardation due to sorption decreases the investigation volume in comparison with the nonretarded case. Furthermore, whereas previous studies were based on single-well analyses, we present in this paper developments relevant for multiple-well analyses by introducing a simple, analytical multiple-well framework for evaluation of IPTs considering overall water budgets. Although single-well analyses provide consistent results in isolation, their applicability on multiwell systems suffer from the fact that the theory does not include mass balance considerations for the gallery of wells that constitutes a control plane. Through application of the developed multiple-well methods to measurement data from the field we show that the estimated total mass flows across well galleries can differ considerably from corresponding estimates using single-well methods, which to some extent, also influences natural attenuation (NA) rate estimates. We believe that the developments presented here can provide a useful basis for biogeochemical studies of field-scale NA processes, including assessments of changes in isotope ratios.

AB To elucidate the factors involved in interception loss, we conducted experiments in which we measured environmental variables such as rainfall intensity, forest structure, and weather conditions. An artificial forest consisting of 24 vinyl trees was used to examine the influences of forest structure and rainfall conditions on interception loss. The interception rate was higher at higher plant area index (PAI) values and wind speeds and lower with greater rainfall intensity.
   We confirmed the factors affecting interception loss by using an interception model based on the tank model. The artificial forest simulations provide new evidence that interception loss is influenced by the PAI, rainfall intensity, saturation deficit, and wind speed. The effect of the saturation deficit on the interception rate was unclear from the experimental results, but the single-tank model revealed that wind speed strongly influences the effects of the saturation deficit on interception loss. Thus, whereas interception loss was not significantly affected by the saturation deficit at low wind speeds, it increased significantly with the saturation deficit under windy conditions. The model simulation also showed the sensitivity of each factor with regard to the interception rate. The sensitivity of rainfall intensity decreased as the PAI increased, and the sensitivity of the saturation deficit increased as the wind speed increased.
   The experiments and model calculations clarified the main elements affecting interception loss and their sensitivities. Compared with previous studies on interception loss, this study revealed a positive relationship between the PAI and interception loss, a negative exponential relationship with rainfall intensity, and the effects of the saturation deficit on interception loss.

AB Flint, Michigan reignited the public discourse surrounding lead contamination in drinking water with Newark, New Jersey recently experiencing its own lead-in-water crisis. Following Flint's experience, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed changes to the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), but these changes may not produce better detection of contamination. LCR testing requirements were evaluated for their ability to predict or identify problems from the recent (2015-2019) Newark lead exceedance data. LCR compliance and water quality data were obtained from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) website. Between 2002 and 2015, Newark sampled on a reduced sampling plan (50 samples once every 3 years), as required, for lead and copper. These samples were divided between Newark's two water sources with uneven sampling distribution across the city, further limiting the potential to identify a risk of lead in drinking water. Results suggest a more rigorous testing requirement may have identified the problem sooner. Limitations related to the LCR that prevented Newark water suppliers from earlier detection of lead risk will continue under the revised LCR.

AB Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) provides the potential for developing innovative and environmentally friendly techniques to improve the engineering properties of soil through reduction of permeability in soil and increase of soil stiffness and strength. In the present research work, coupled bio-chemo-hydraulic modelling was developed to enhance the understanding of the coupled processes involved in MICP and to predict the MICP performance in permeability reduction. In the model, an overall kinetically controlled model is adopted to describe the biochemical reactions, where the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of both bacteria and chemical reactants. Specifically, an effective porosity concept was proposed and implemented in the model to capture the effects of pore throat blockage on permeability reduction caused by precipitated calcite. Correspondingly, the Kozeny-Carman equation was modified to describe the permeability variation during MICP. This model has been applied to simulate two laboratory experiments. The observed changes in chemical components and hydraulic conductivity can be well reproduced in the model. Through comparisons of the effective porosity concept to other commonly used porosity-permeability relationships, it is estimated that effective porosity should be considered to simulate the permeability reduction observed in MICP. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the reaction-related parameters was conducted. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the maximum urease rate has a strong influence on the biochemical hydraulic responses in MICP.

AB The use of acoustic and optic devices has become more and more common for estimating suspended sediment loads in rivers. The echo intensity levels (EIL) recorded by means of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) have been applied in different methods, which provided relationships between scattering particles features derived from samples (i.e., concentration and grain size) and corresponding backscattering strength and sound attenuation. At the same time, the laser diffraction was applied by an in-stream sampler (LISST-SL) to measure suspended sediment concentration and the corresponding particle size distribution (PSD). These two techniques exhibited different limitations in terms of the measured range of concentration, sensitivity to a certain spectrum of particle sizes, and instruments deploy feasibility especially in large rivers, in a way that the use of sampled PSD by LISST-SL to validate ADCP methods may not be trivial. The aim of this study was to combine the vertical profiling of EIL by an ADCP with results from LISST-SL, eventually demonstrating the possibility of using moving ADCP measurements to detect different suspended matters along a Danube River section characterized by a small tributary junction. At the same time, this work elucidates optical to acoustic method deviations that hinders an actual validation of ADCP methods based on LISST-SL rather than with physical samplings.

AB Managed aquifer recharge through bank filtration is an important method to produce sustainable drinking water. Yet, water quality related to transport of pathogens (bacteria and viruses) into groundwater systems from surface waters can be a matter of concern, especially in urbanized regions. Based on a 1-year monitoring campaign, a reactive transport model was developed for bacteria transport at a riverbank filtration site located in Germany. The model allows simulating advective-dispersive transport and relies on the colloid filtration theory to mimic attachment and detachment of bacteria to and from the sediment in addition to inactivation, straining and blocking of bacteria. Due to the complexity of the investigated processes, the reactive transport model is characterized by a high level of parametrization, encompassing parameters driving flow as well as solute and colloid transport. A global sensitivity analysis has been applied to identify the most relevant model parameters with respect to piezometric pressure heads, groundwater temperature, and concentrations of chloride, oxygen, coliforms, and Escherichia coli. The model has been calibrated within a stochastic framework, to provide model parameter estimates and to quantify their uncertainty. Our results suggest that bacteria transport models are highly sensitive to inactivation coefficients, straining coefficients, and bacteria size. Permeability of the colmation layer at the riverbank is a key factor for bacteria transport through its influence on residence times. Seasonal variability of boundary conditions, especially anoxic aquifer conditions in the summer and high groundwater flow velocities during flooding periods, resulted in a reduction of inactivation and increased bacteria concentrations at observation wells.

AB Induced polarization (IP) is increasingly applied for hydrological, environmental and agricultural purposes. Interpretation of IP data is based on understanding the relationship between the IP signature and the porous media property of interest. Mechanistic models on the IP phenomenon rely on the Poisson-Nernst-Plank equations, where diffusion and electromigration fluxes are the driving forces of charge transport and are directly related to IP. However, to our knowledge, the impact of advection flux on IP was not investigated experimentally and was not considered in any IP model. In this work, we measured the spectral IP (SIP) signature of porous media under varying flow conditions, in addition to developing and solving a model for SIP signature of porous media, which takes flow into consideration. The experimental and the model results demonstrate that as bulk velocity increases, polarization and relaxation time decrease. Using a numerical model, we established that fluid flow near the particle deforms the electrical double layer (EDL) structure, accounting for the observed reduction in polarization. We found a qualitative agreement between the model and the measurements. Still, the model overestimates the impact of flow rate on SIP signature, which we explain in terms of the flow boundary conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate the sensitivity of the SIP signature to fluid flow, highlighting the need to consider fluid velocity in the interpretation of the SIP signature of porous media, and opening an exciting new direction for noninvasive measurements of fluid flow at the EDL scale.

AB Although mechanistic reaction networks have been developed to quantify the biogeochemical evolution of subsurface systems associated with bioremediation, it is difficult in practice to quantify the onset and distribution of these transitions at the field scale using commonly collected wellbore datasets. As an alternative approach to the mechanistic methods, we develop a data-driven, statistical model to identify biogeochemical transitions using various time-lapse aqueous geochemical data (e.g., Fe(II), sulfate, sulfide, acetate, and uranium concentrations) and induced polarization (IP) data. We assume that the biogeochemical transitions can be classified as several dominant states that correspond to redox transitions and test the method at a uranium-contaminated site. The relationships between the geophysical observations and geochemical time series vary depending upon the unknown underlying redox status, which is modeled as a hidden Markov random field. We estimate unknown parameters by maximizing the joint likelihood function using the maximization-expectation algorithm. The case study results show that when considered together aqueous geochemical data and IP imaginary conductivity provide a key diagnostic signature of biogeochemical stages. The developed method provides useful information for evaluating the effectiveness of bioremediation, such as the probability of being in specific redox stages following biostimulation where desirable pathways (e.g., uranium removal) are more highly favored. The use of geophysical data in the approach advances the possibility of using noninvasive methods to monitor critical biogeochemical system stages and transitions remotely and over field relevant scales (e.g., from square meters to several hectares).

AB Traditional continuum-based multiphase simulators incorporate a capillary pressure-saturation relationship that assumes instantaneous attainment of equilibrium following a disturbance. This assumption may not be appropriate for systems where the capillary pressure is a function of the rate of change of saturation, a phenomenon referred to as dynamic capillary pressure. Previous studies have investigated the impact of soil and fluid properties on dynamic effects in capillary pressure; however, the impact of wettability on this phenomenon has not been investigated to date. In this study, two-phase multistep outflow (MSO) experiments conducted in chemically treated sands with different equilibrium contact angles were used to investigate the influence of wettability variations on dynamic effects in capillary pressure during displacement of water by tetrachloroethene (PCE). Data from the MSO experiments were modeled with a multiphase flow simulator that includes dynamic effects and were also analyzed through comparisons with theoretical model predictions for interface movement in a single capillary tube. Results showed that a faster approach to equilibrium, characterized by smaller fitted damping coefficients, occurred in sands with larger equilibrium contact angles. Damping coefficients for sands with an operational contact angle greater than 80 were found to be an order of magnitude smaller than those with an operational contact angle less than 65. These results suggest that it may be possible to neglect dynamic effects in capillary pressure in systems that approach intermediate-wet conditions but that these effects will be increasingly important in more water-wet systems.

AB Antecedent soil moisture or soil moisture status has a great impact on hydrological processes. Hydraulic redistribution (HR), a widely observed phenomenon, is defined as water distributed (typically at night) from moist soil to drier soil via plant roots, which plays an important role in soil moisture replenishment. Knowledge on seasonal patterns of HR and on the relationship between HR and soil water use is not fully understood. We investigated temporal variations in HR and total daily water use (Delta theta) at stands of camphor and peach by monitoring soil moisture content in a humid region in eastern China. HR at the three locations reached its maximum values in summer (0.68 mm d(-1) to 1.15 mm d(-1)) at depths of 15 cm and 35 cm. Redistributed water replenished 41% of water depleted in the soil at a 5-45-cm depth. Interestingly, normalized HR (i.e., HR/Delta theta) showed a constant pattern during the growing season implying it is independent of seasonal climate alterations. This also indicated that HR had a stable effect on the replenishment of daily water use. Positive linear relationships between HR and Delta theta were found at three measuring locations (camphor: R-2 = .35, p < .01; peach1: R-2 = .57, p < .01; peach2: R-2 = .63, p < .01), suggesting a relatively stable inherent linkage between HR and Delta theta. This study suggested that hydrological processes involving soil moisture status or antecedent soil moisture, needs to take the HR effect into account across timescales from intraday to seasonal.

AB Seepage flux from disconnected streams can be a main source of groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid regions. The seepage into the streambed will respond to a change in stream stage; however, the relationship between seepage flux and stream stage is uncertain due to a lack of in situ observations. This study investigated the change in seepage flow regime with stream stage in a natural streambed through field measurements along a 50.1 km long disconnected stream. Seepage fluxes were quantified using a seepage meter method involving the measurement and simulation of the variable stream stages in a seasonal stream. Flow regimes in the streambed were then evaluated using a developed model. Two seepage flow regimes were observed, the Darcy flow regime and the non-Darcy flow regime, with the change of the stream stage in the streambed. Our analysis of the mechanisms of seepage flow indicates that drainable porosity and particle size of streambed media are the key factors controlling non-Darcy seepage flow behavior. We demonstrated that the Reynolds number based on the particle diameter d(30) instead of d(50) can provide a more accurate criterion for non-Darcy flow in natural heterogeneous streambeds. Model evaluation showed that predicted streambed seepage regimes and fluxes were consistent with field observations. Together, these results provide new insights into the seepage mechanisms, which have significant implications for the establishment of a better seepage model and the joint development of regional surface water and groundwater.

AB Although it is widely recognized that urbanization has a notable impact on streamflow characteristics, the relative influence of the extent, spatial configuration, and positioning of urban development on low, high, and peak flow regimes is still not fully understood. The overarching research objective of this study was to clarify these relationships by analyzing 119 watersheds throughout the Charlanta megaregion, which stretches from Charlotte, NC to Atlanta, GA. Spatial metrics were derived from land use/land cover data sets to quantify the urban development patterns of each watershed while the streamflow characteristics were evaluated using mean daily discharge and annual peak streamflow data. Analysis of variance tests, bivariate correlations, and multivariate regression models were used to identify intraregional variability and quantify the impact of urban development patterns on streamflow characteristics while controlling for the physical differences between watersheds. The statistical analysis revealed that increasing the extent of urban development enhanced high and low flow frequency as well as annual peak unit discharge. Therefore, urbanization within Charlanta generally produced a more extreme streamflow regime. In terms of the spatial configuration of urban development, the models indicated that more contiguous developed open space increased high and low flow frequency. Finally, the positional analysis suggested that clustering impervious surfaces in source areas distant from streams increased the frequency of high flows. The study highlights the overall importance of considering the extent, configuration, and positioning of urban development when devising land use policies aimed at minimizing streamflow alteration due to urbanization.

AB The role of upslope soil pore water pressure on lateral subsurface storm flow dynamics is poorly understood. Further development of hillslope hydrologic models requires new understanding from field understanding. In particular, we need new, quantifiable measures that link upslope soil pore pressure and water table dynamics to the timing and volume of subsurface storm flow. Here we examine the relationship between hillslope-scale pore pressure and lateral outflow from slope base using the fine-temporal-resolution hydrometric data (10 min interval) from two steep unchanneled concave hillslopes, one hillslope (Fudoji) covered by relatively high hydraulic conductivity sandy soil and the other (Toinotani) covered by relatively low hydraulic conductivity clay soil. In both hillslopes, pore pressures in the area close to the slope base were only weakly related to subsurface storm flow dynamics. During periods of storm flow production, hillslope discharge was strongly related to the cross-sectional area of the upslope saturated layer. During slope seepage periods between events, hillslope discharge from the highly permeable hillslope was still related to the upslope cross-sectional subsurface saturated area. However, during this same period at the low-permeability site, hillslope discharge was not related to the upslope subsurface saturated area. Through intersite comparison we show that the soil matrix permeability has a large impact on the hydrological extension of preferential flow and hence the linkage between upslope pore pressure and subsurface storm flow dynamics.

ID AQUIFER SYSTEM COMPACTION; LAND SUBSIDENCE; CALIFORNIA; FIELD
AB Analyses of areal variations in the subsidence and rebound occurring over stressed aquifer systems, in conjunction with measurements of the hydraulic head fluctuations causing these displacements, can yield valuable information about the compressibility and storage properties of the aquifer system. Historically, stress-strain relationships have been derived from paired extensometer/piezometer installations, which provide only point source data. Because of the general unavailability of spatially detailed deformation data, areal stress-strain relations and their variability are not commonly considered in constraining conceptual and numerical models of aquifer systems. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can map ground displacements at a spatial scale of tens of meters over 100 km wide swaths. InSAR has been used previously to characterize larger magnitude, generally permanent aquifer system compaction and land subsidence at yearly and longer timescales, caused by sustained drawdown of groundwater levels that produces intergranular stresses consistently greater than the maximum historical stress. We present InSAR measurements of the typically small-magnitude, generally recoverable deformations of the Las Vegas Valley aquifer system occurring at seasonal timescales. From these we derive estimates of the elastic storage coefficient for the aquifer system at several locations in Las Vegas Valley. These high-resolution measurements offer great potential for future investigations into the mechanics of aquifer systems and the spatial heterogeneity of aquifer system structure and material properties as well as for monitoring ongoing aquifer system compaction and land subsidence.

AB A steady increase in the consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products worldwide is increasing their occurrence in the biosphere. The current study describes the abundance of 42 selected emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), including human and veterinary antibiotics, UV-filters and analgesics in the groundwater of the urban aquifer of Zaragoza (Spain), which is affected by intensive exploitation of shallow geothermal resources. The presence of groundwater heat pump systems in the aquifer studied offered the opportunity to study the occurrence of EOCs in relation to groundwater temperature and other physicochemical effects derived from this technology. Analysis of the data obtained allowed us to identify statistically significant relationships between the presence of EOCs and temperature, as well as other physicochemical and geochemical properties of groundwater. The results obtained suggest that temperature is a minor factor controlling the degradation of the organic compounds analysed compared to the oxygen input from groundwater heat pump systems which is possibly increasing the aerobic redox conditions, thus preventing the degradation of organic pollutants. Intensive use of shallow geothermal resources therefore seems to contribute in the prevalence of such compounds in the aquifer close to geothermal systems.

AB Changes in the properties of extreme rainfall events have been observed worldwide. In relation to the discussion of ongoing climatic changes, it is of high importance to attribute these changes to known sources of climate variability. Focusing on spatial and temporal changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall events, a statistical model is tested for this purpose. The model is built on the theory of generalized linear models and uses Poisson regression solved by generalized estimation equations. Spatial and temporal explanatory variables can be included simultaneously, and their relative importance can be assessed. Additionally, the model allows for a spatial correlation between the measurements. Data from a Danish rain gauge network are used as a case study for model evaluation. Focusing on 10 min and 24 h rainfall extremes, it was found that regional variation in the mean annual precipitation could explain a significant part of the spatial variability. Still, this variable was found to be of minor influence in comparison to explanatory variables in the temporal domain. The identified significant temporal variables comprise the East Atlantic pattern, the average summer precipitation, and the average summer temperature. The two latter showed a high relative importance. The established link will be beneficial when predicting future occurrences of precipitation extremes. Citation: Gregersen, I. B., H. Madsen, D.

AB Spatially distributed models can potentially provide improved hydrologic predictions because of their ability to exploit spatially distributed data while providing estimates of hydrologic variables at interior catchment locations. However, attempts to estimate spatially distributed parameter fields via model calibration have been fraught with difficulty. This paper examines the factors that can influence the ability to infer spatial properties of a distributed model when the only information available for model evaluation is catchment streamflow response. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which spatial variability in parameters and rainfall cause sufficiently strong variations in the streamflow hydrographs to justify their representation in catchment models and whether such information can be detected via commonly used model performance measures. Our results show that spatial variability in parameter and precipitation fields can, indeed, have a detectable impact on the properties of the streamflow hydrograph but that this impact can be so greatly diminished by the damping and dispersive effects of routing that it is virtually nondetectable by conventional performance measures by the time the water reaches the catchment outlet. And although measures based on information theory may be able to detect subtle variations of this kind, the information may not ultimately be useful in the face of model structure and data errors. The only reasonable way forward therefore is to explore other kinds of catchment information (including multiple interior flow gauging locations) for use in estimation of spatially distributed parameter fields.

AB Distributed hydrological models have the potential to provide improved streamflow forecasts along the entire channel network, while also simulating the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration, soil moisture content, water quality, soil erosion, and land use change impacts. However, they are perceived as being difficult to parameterize and evaluate, thus translating into significant predictive uncertainty in the model results. Although a priori parameter estimates derived from observable watershed characteristics can help to minimize obstacles to model implementation, there exists a need for powerful automated parameter estimation strategies that incorporate diagnostic information regarding the causes of poor model performance. This paper investigates a diagnostic approach to model evaluation that exploits hydrological context and theory to aid in the detection and resolution of watershed model inadequacies, through consideration of three of the four major behavioral functions of any watershed system; overall water balance, vertical redistribution, and temporal redistribution (spatial redistribution was not addressed). Instead of using classical statistical measures (such as mean squared error), we use multiple hydrologically relevant "signature measures'' to quantify the performance of the model at the watershed outlet in ways that correspond to the functions mentioned above and therefore help to guide model improvements in a meaningful way. We apply the approach to the Hydrology Laboratory Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-DHM) of the National Weather Service and show that diagnostic evaluation has the potential to provide a powerful and intuitive basis for deriving consistent estimates of the parameters of watershed models.

AB The study of runoff is a crucial issue because it is closely related to flooding, water quality and erosion. In cultivated catchments, agricultural ditch drainage networks are known to influence runoff. As anthropogenic elements, agricultural ditch drainage networks can therefore be altered to better manage surface runoff in cultivated catchments. However, the relationship between the spatial configuration, i.e. the density and the topology, of agricultural ditch drainage networks and surface runoff in cultivated catchments is not understood. We studied this relationship by using a random network simulator that was coupled to a distributed hydrological model. The simulations explored a large variety of spatial configurations corresponding to a thousand stochastic agricultural ditch drainage networks on a 6.4?km(2) Mediterranean cultivated catchment. Next, several distributed hydrological functions were used to compute water flow paths and runoff for each simulation. The results showed that (i) denser networks increased the drained volume and the peak discharge and decreased hillslopes runoff, (ii) greater network density did not affect the surface runoff any further above a given network density, (iii) the correlation between network density and runoff was weaker for small subcatchments (< 2?km(2)) where the variability in the drained area that resulted from changes in agricultural ditch drainage networks increased the variability of runoff and (iv) the actual agricultural ditch drainage network appeared to be well optimized for managing runoff as compared with the simulated networks. Finally, our results highlighted the role of agricultural ditch drainage networks in intercepting and decreasing overland flow on hillslopes and increasing runoff in drainage networks.

AB The challenge of sustainable freshwater management requires identification and characterization of the underlying components and dynamic interactions within the coupled human-hydrology system. This paper builds a model that captures the dynamic water balance evolution and coupled human response within the Lake Toolibin catchment in West Australia's wheatbelt region. Two subcatchments in different parts of the landscape were selected to examine the key emergent properties of the coupled socio-hydrology system over a 100 year period, by analyzing the two-way feedbacks of land use management (human system feedback) and land degradation (natural system feedback). Using a relatively simple parameterization of community sensitivity to land degradation within the model, we identified positive and negative feedbacks, the presence of threshold behavior, time scale differences between fast and slow moving variables, differences in time lags resulting from disparate resistance levels of the natural system, and the degree of adaptive learning inherent in the human system. Specifically, the valley floor subcatchment transitioned through four phases-expansion, contraction, recession, and recovery-demonstrating a threshold shift in the human feedback after 60 years, while the upslope subcatchment appears to still be in the contraction phase, with no sign of reaching a threshold shift in 100 years. These results demonstrate that the model is capable of isolating the two-way feedbacks of the coupled system and has implications for resilience theory, suggesting that greater resistance in the underlying natural system counteracts the onset of a negative feedback loop and instigation of adaptive behaviors in the human system.

AB The difficulties in predicting whole catchment water balance from observations at patch scales motivate a search for theories that can account for the complexity of interactions in catchments. In this paper we suggest that the spatial patterns of vegetation may offer a lens through which to investigate scale dependence of hydrology within catchments. Vegetation patterns are attractive because they are observable drivers of evapotranspiration, often a dominant component in catchment water balance, and because the spatial distribution of vegetation is often driven by patterns of water availability. We propose that nontrivial, scale-dependent spatial patterns in both vegetation distribution and catchment water balance are generated by the presence of a convergent network of flow paths and a two-way feedback between vegetation as a driver of evapotranspiration and vegetation distribution as a signature of water availability. Implementing this hypothesis via a simple network model demonstrated that such organization was controlled by catchment properties related to aridity, the network topology, the sensitivity of the vegetation response to water availability, and the point-scale controls on partitioning between evapotranspiration and lateral drainage. The resulting self-organization generated spatial dependence in areally averaged hydrologic variables, water balance, and parameters describing hydrological partitioning. This spatial scale dependence provides a theoretical approach to connect water balance at patch and catchment scales. Theoretical and empirical studies for understanding the controls of vegetation spatial distribution, point-scale hydrological partitioning, and the implications of complex flow network topologies on the spatial scale dependence of catchment water balance are proposed as a research agenda for catchment ecohydrology.

AB We present a data-driven model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), for long lead time streamflow forecasting using oceanic-atmospheric oscillations. The SVM is based on statistical learning theory that uses a hypothesis space of linear functions based on Kernel approach and has been used to predict a quantity forward in time on the basis of training from past data. The strength of SVM lies in minimizing the empirical classification error and maximizing the geometric margin by solving inverse problem. The SVM model is applied to three gages, i.e., Cisco, Green River, and Lees Ferry in the Upper Colorado River Basin in the western United States. Annual oceanic-atmospheric indices, comprising Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and E1 Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) for a period of 1906-2001 are used to generate annual streamflow volumes with 3 years lead time. The SVM model is trained with 86 years of data (1906-1991) and tested with 10 years of data (1992-2001). On the basis of correlation coefficient, root means square error, and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient the model shows satisfactory results, and the predictions are in good agreement with measured streamflow volumes. Sensitivity analysis, performed to evaluate the effect of individual and coupled oscillations, reveals a strong signal for ENSO and NAO indices as compared to PDO and AMO indices for the long lead time streamflow forecast. Streamflow predictions from the SVM model are found to be better when compared with the predictions obtained from feedforward back propagation artificial neural network model and linear regression.

AB Water management usually considers economic and ecological objectives, and involves tradeoffs, conflicts, compromise, and cooperation among objectives. Pareto optimality often is championed in water management, but its relationships with the mathematical representation of objectives, and implications of tradeoffs for Pareto optimal decisions, are rarely examined. We evaluate the mathematical properties of optimized tradeoffs to identify promising regions for compromise, suggest strategies for reducing conflicts, and better understand whether decision-makers are more or less likely to cooperate on environmental water allocations. Cooperation and compromise among objectives can be easier when tradeoff curves are concave and more adversarial when tradeoff curves are convex. "Knees," or areas with maximum curvature, bulges, or breakpoints in concave Pareto frontiers, suggest more promising areas for compromise. Evaluating the shape of Pareto curves based on each objective's performance function can screen for the existence of knees amenable to compromise. We explore water management and restorations actions that improve and shift the location and prominence of knees in concave Pareto frontiers. Connecting river habitats and other non-flow management actions may add knees on locally concave regions of Pareto frontiers. Managing multiple streams regionally, rather than individually, can sometimes turn convex local tradeoffs into concave regional tradeoffs more amenable to compromise. Overall, this analysis provides a deep investigation of how the shape of tradeoffs influences the range and promise of decisions to improve performance, and illustrates that management actions may encourage cooperation and reduce conflict.

AB The Karhunen-Loeve moment equation (KLME) approach is implemented to model stochastic transient water-NAPL two-phase flow in heterogeneous subsurface media with random soil properties. To describe the constitutive relationships between water saturation, capillary pressure, and phase relative permeability, the widely used van Genuchten model and Parker and Lenhard models are adopted. The log-transformed intrinsic permeability, soil pore size distribution, and van Genuchten fitting parameter n are treated as normally distributed stochastic variables with a separable exponential covariance model. The perturbation part of these three log-transformed variables is decomposed via Karhunen-Loeve expansion. The dependent variables (phase pressure, phase mobility, and capillary pressure) are expanded by polynomial expansions and the perturbation method. Incorporating these expansions of random soil properties variables and dependent variables into the governing equations yields a series of differential equations in different orders. We construct the moments of the dependent variables from the solutions of these differential equations. We demonstrate the stochastic model with two-dimensional examples of transient two-phase flow. We also conduct Monte Carlo simulations using the finite element heat and mass (FEHM) transfer code, whose results are considered "true" solutions. The match between the results from FEHM and KLME indicates the validity of the proposed KLME application in transient two-phase flow. The computational efficiency of the KLME approach over Monte Carlo methods is at least an order of magnitude for transient two-phase flow problems.

AB Thinning of semi-arid forests to reduce wildfire risk is believed to improve forest health by increasing soil moisture. Increased snowpack, reduced transpiration and reduced rainfall interception are frequently cited mechanisms by which reduced canopy density may increase soil moisture. However, the relative importance of these factors has not been rigorously evaluated in field studies. We measured snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and the spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture at four experimental paired treatment-control thinning sites in high elevation ponderosa pine forest northern Arizona, USA. We compared snow and soil moisture measurements with forest structure metrics derived from aerial imagery and 3-dimensional lidar data to determine the relationship between vegetation structure, snow and soil moisture throughout the annual hydrologic cycle. Soil moisture was consistently and significantly higher in thinned forest plots, even though the treatments were performed 8-11 years before this study. However, we did not find evidence that SWE was higher in thinned forests across a range of snow conditions. Regression tree analysis of soil moisture and vegetation structure data provided some evidence that localized differences in transpiration and interception of precipitation influence the spatial pattern of soil moisture at points in the annual hydrologic cycle when the system is becoming increasingly water limited. However, vegetation structure explained a relatively low amount of the spatial variance (R-2 < 0.23) in soil moisture. Continuous measurements of soil moisture in depth profiles showed stronger attenuation of soil moisture peaks in thinned sites, suggesting differences in infiltration dynamics may explain the difference in soil moisture between treatments as opposed to overlying vegetation alone. Our results show limited support for commonly cited relationships between vegetation structure, snow and soil moisture and indicate that future research is needed to understand how reduction in tree density alters soil hydraulic properties.

AB Spatial information on soil properties is an important input to hydrological models. In current hydrological modelling practices, soil property information is often derived from soil category maps by the linking method in which a representative soil property value is linked to each soil polygon. Limited by the area-class nature of soil category maps, the derived soil property variation is discontinuous and less detailed than high resolution digital terrain or remote sensing data. This research proposed dmSoil, a data-mining-based approach to derive continuous and spatially detailed soil property information from soil category maps. First, the soil-environment relationships are extracted through data mining of a soil map. The similarity of the soil at each location to different soil types in the soil map is then estimated using the mined relationships. Prediction of soil property values at each location is made by combining the similarities of the soil at that location to different soil types and the representative soil property values of these soil types. The new approach was applied in the Raffelson Watershed and Pleasant Valley in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, United States to map soil A horizon texture (in both areas) and depth to soil C horizon (in Pleasant Valley). The property maps from the dmSoil approach capture the spatial gradation and details of soil properties better than those from the linking method. The new approach also shows consistent accuracy improvement at validation points. In addition to the improved performances, the inputs for the dmSoil approach are easy to prepare, and the approach itself is simple to deploy. It provides an effective way to derive better soil property information from soil category maps for hydrological modelling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB As is frequently cited. dispersivity increases with solute travel distance in the subsurface. This behaviour has been attributed to the inherent spatial variation of the pore water velocity in geological porous media. Analytically solving the advection-dispersion equation With distance-dependent dispersivity is extremely difficult because the equation coefficients are dependent Upon the distance variable. This study presents all analytical technique to solve a two-dimensional (2D) advection-dispersion equation with linear distance-dependent longitudinal and transverse dispersivities for describing solute transport in a uniform How field. The analytical approach is developed by applying the extended power series method coupled with the Laplace and finite Fourier cosine transforms. The developed solution is then compared to the corresponding numerical solution to assess its accuracy and robustness. The results demonstrate that the breakthrogh curves at different spatial locations obtained from the power series solution show good agreement with those obtained Front the numerical solution. However, owing, to the limited numerical Operation for large values the power series functions. the developed analytical solution call only he numerically, evaluated when the values of longitudinal dispersivity/distance ratio e(L) exceed 0.075. Moreover. breakthrough curves obtained from the distance-dependent solution are compared with those form the constant dispersivity solution 10 investigate the relationship between the transport parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that a previously derived relationship is invalid for large e(L) values. The analytical power series solution derived ill this study is efficient and can be a useful tool for future Studies in the field of 2D and distance-dependent dispersive transport.

AB A novel statistical approach is developed and implemented for the stochastic reconstruction of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zone realizations and the quantification of source zone metrics and associated uncertainty. The approach employs discriminative random field (DRF) models, to simulate the spatial distributions and relationships among source zone properties (i.e., permeability, NAPL saturation, and aqueous concentration distributions) consistent with commonly collected field data. Application of DRF models requires a limited number of full-scale simulations to train the model parameters. Monte Carlo sampling methods based on these trained models then provide an efficient method to generate contaminant mass realizations conditioned on measured boreholes, bypassing the need to run computationally intensive, partial differential equation-based simulations of physical flow and transport. Postprocessing of these realizations yields approximations of uncertainty to inform further sampling for characterization and remediation. The reconstructed contaminant mass realizations provide sufficient information for calculating averaged characterization metrics, such as total contaminant mass and pool fraction, used to predict source zone longevity, mass recovery behavior, and remedial performance. The model performance is evaluated through comparisons of these predicted source zone metrics with those obtained from the "true" mass distributions generated with validated flow and transport models. These comparisons clearly demonstrate that stochastic application of a DRF model can reconstruct realistic saturation and concentration fields, conditioned to borehole data at different times. The present study should be viewed as the first step in generating a three-dimensional characterization tool that can be applied over a wide range of conditions observed at contaminated sites.

AB Hydrometeorological processes are typically characterized by temporal dependence, short- or long-range (e.g., Hurst behavior), as well as by non-Gaussian distributions (especially at fine time scales). The generation of long synthetic time series that resembles the marginal and joint properties of the observed ones is a prerequisite in many uncertainty-related hydrological studies, since they can be used as inputs and hence allow the propagation of natural variability and uncertainty to the typically deterministic water-system models. For this reason, it has been for years one of the main research topics in the field of stochastic hydrology. This work presents a novel model for synthetic time series generation, termed Symmetric Moving Average (neaRly) To Anything, that holds out the promise of simulating stationary univariate and multivariate processes with any-range dependence and arbitrary marginal distributions, provided that the former is feasible and the latter have finite variance. This is accomplished by utilizing a mapping procedure in combination with the relationship that exists between the correlation coefficients of an auxiliary Gaussian process and a non-Gaussian one, formalized through the Nataf's joint distribution model. The generality of Symmetric Moving Average (neaRly) To Anything is stressed through two hypothetical simulation studies (univariate and multivariate), characterized by different dependencies and distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed model through two real-world cases, one that concerns the generation of annual non-Gaussian streamflow time series at four stations and another that involves the synthesis of intermittent, non-Gaussian, daily rainfall series at a single location.

AB Drought, generally characterized by below-average water supply, propagates through the hydrologic system with consequent ecological and societal impacts. Compared with other drought aspects, the recovery of drought especially in the hydrological components, which directly relates to the recovery of water resources for agricultural, ecological and human needs, is less-understood. Here, taking the Millennium drought in southeast Australia (similar to 1997-2009) as an illustrating case, we comprehensively examined multiple aspects of the meteorological (i.e., precipitation) and hydrological (i.e., streamflow and base flow) droughts across 130 unimpaired catchments using long-term hydro-meteorological observations. Results show that the duration and intensity of the meteorological drought are both lengthened and amplified in the hydrological drought, suggesting a nonstationarity in the rainfall-runoff relationship during a prolonged drought. Additionally, we find a time lag commonly exists between the end of the meteorological droughts and the end of the hydrological drought, with the recovery of base flow showing a longer lag than the recovery of streamflow. The recovery rate of precipitation after drought was found to be the dominant factor that controls the recovery of hydrological droughts while catchment landscape (i.e., valley bottom flatness) plays an important but secondary role in controlling the lags in the hydrological recovery. Other hydro-climatic factors and catchment properties appear to have only minor influences governing hydrological drought recovery. Our findings highlight a delayed response in the terrestrial components of the hydrological cycle to precipitation after prolonged drought, and provide valuable scientific guidance to water resources management and water security assessment in regions facing future droughts.

TI Quantitative generalizations for catchment sediment yield following
   forest logging

AB Published data for temperate forests across the world are analyzed to investigate the potential for generalized quantitative expressions of catchment sediment yield impact in the years immediately following logging. Such generalizations would be useful in a variety of forestry and engineering tasks and would aid the spread of knowledge amongst both relevant professionals and new students. Data were assembled for paired catchment studies (51 catchments including 16 controls) that enabled the postlogging sediment yield impact to be compared with both the prelogging period and an undisturbed control catchment, using a specially defined relative response factor. Three categories of impact were derived: low-moderate, high, and very high, defined by specific ranges in the maximum value of the relative response factor. The maximum increase in specific sediment yield (in t km(-2) yr(-1)) following logging is 1 order of magnitude above the control sediment yield at both the annual and storm event scales, at least under normal circumstances of Best Management Practice. There is no apparent relationship between sediment yield and the proportion of catchment logged, at least at the general scale. A cumulative probability distribution for the year in which the maximum postlogging sediment yield occurs, shows the majority of cases falling in the first 2 years. These generalizations refer to the broad response to logging as a function of ground disturbance, for example, by logging technique, roads, and burning. Although limited to order of magnitude quantification, they provide a basis for first estimates and for a general appreciation of an impact problem.

AB Ideally, a seasonal streamflow forecasting system would ingest skilful climate forecasts and propagate these through calibrated hydrological models initialized with observed catchment conditions. At global scale, practical problems exist in each of these aspects. For the first time, we analyzed theoretical and actual skill in bimonthly streamflow forecasts from a global ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) system. Forecasts were generated six times per year for 1979-2008 by an initialized hydrological model and an ensemble of 1 degrees resolution daily climate estimates for the preceding 30 years. A post-ESP conditional sampling method was applied to 2.6% of forecasts, based on predictive relationships between precipitation and 1 of 21 climate indices prior to the forecast date. Theoretical skill was assessed against a reference run with historic forcing. Actual skill was assessed against streamflow records for 6192 small (<10,000 km(2)) catchments worldwide. The results show that initial catchment conditions provide the main source of skill. Post-ESP sampling enhanced skill in equatorial South America and Southeast Asia, particularly in terms of tercile probability skill, due to the persistence and influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Actual skill was on average 54% of theoretical skill but considerably more for selected regions and times of year. The realized fraction of the theoretical skill probably depended primarily on the quality of precipitation estimates. Forecast skill could be predicted as the product of theoretical skill and historic model performance. Increases in seasonal forecast skill are likely to require improvement in the observation of precipitation and initial hydrological conditions.

AB We describe a regional parameter estimation scheme for the unified land model developed using a set of 220 river basins (10(2)-10(4) km(2)) distributed across the conterminous United States. We evaluate predictive relationships between geographically varying catchment features and the model's soil parameters using principal components analysis. In addition to commonly used catchment descriptors (meteorological, geomorphic, and land-cover characteristics), we used satellite remote-sensing products and the United States Geologic Survey Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow (GAGES-II) database. In a series of regionalization experiments, we contrast the more conventional procedure of using locally optimized parameters as predictands, with an approach that searches for zonally representative parameter values, using limited additional simulations. Parameters were evaluated through hydrologic model simulations in which daily flows were compared with observations over a 20 year period. We show that the penalty in streamflow prediction skill for using zonal parameters at a given basin (i.e., locally) is comparatively smaller than the penalty for using local parameters zonally. Regionalizations using zonal parameters and local catchment descriptors had the best model performance for both training and validation periods. Finally, we investigate the potential for transferring parameters globally by repeating the regionalization using only catchment attributes derived from globally available data and show that for the United States, model performance is only slightly worse than when U. S.-specific data area used. Citation: Livneh, B., and D. P. Lettenmaier (2013), Regional parameter estimation for the unified land model, Water Resour. Res., 49, 10.1029/2012WR012220.

AB Drought in the Philippines has been monitored for agricultural and economic losses, but spatial and temporal characterization at the basin scale has not been quantified. The relationship between different drought types, and how these can be integrated into timely water-resource-management planning in the agriculture and water sector of the Pampanga River basin, were considered. Specifically, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to propose a standardized anomaly (SA) index for assessing different types of drought impacts at the basin scale; (2) to quantify vulnerability of the agriculture and water sectors using physically consistent hydrological parameters with temporal variation and spatial heterogeneity; (3) to develop a method for combining the drought index calculated from the inputs and outputs of WEB-DHM on the basis of sturdy algorithms for the physics of water and energy movement in the basin using monthly and seasonal differences of various drought types; and (4) to combine hydrological parameters with crop production to determine its effects on rice. The SA was calculated for the variables related to each drought type: rainfall (meteorological), streamflow and groundwater (hydrological), and soil moisture (agricultural) during 1983, 1987, 1990-1992, and 1998 droughts. El Nino is one of the major driving forces leading to drought in the country. The drought intensified on the second year of the average two-year El Nino Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) composites with a 1 to 7 month time lag between parameters and hot spots in the upland and central plains of the basin. Recommended adaptation strategies include crop scheduling, crop/livelihood substitutes, and alternative water sources.

AB We present expressions satisfied by the first statistical moments (mean and variance-covariance) of travel time and trajectory of conservative solute particles advected in a three-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer under uniform in the mean flow conditions. Closure of the model is obtained by means of a consistent second-order expansion in sigma(Y) (standard deviation of the log hydraulic conductivity) of (statistical) moments of quantities of interest. As such, the results obtained are nominally limited to mildly non-uniform fields, with sigma(Y) < 1. Resulting mean and variance of particles travel time and trajectory are functions of first and second moments and cross-moments of trajectory and velocity components. Our solution is applicable to infinite domains and is free of distributional assumptions. As an important application of the methodology we obtain closed-form expressions for the unconditional mean and variance of travel time and particle trajectory for isotropic log-conductivity domain characterized by an exponential variogram. This allows us to recover the non linear behavior of mean travel time versus distance, in agreement with numerical results published in the literature, as well as a non-linear effect in the mean trajectory. The analysis of trajectory variance allows recovering some known results regarding transverse macro-dispersion, evidencing some limitations typical of perturbation theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We develop an efficient computational model for simulating fluid invasion patterns emerging in variable aperture fractures. This two-dimensional model takes into account the effect of capillary force on the fluid-fluid interfaces and viscous pressure drop in both fluid phases. The pressure distribution is solved at each time step based on mass balance and local cubic law, considering an imposed pressure jump condition at the fluid-fluid interface. This pressure jump corresponds to the Laplace pressure which includes both terms related to the out-of-plane (aperture-spanning) curvature and to the in-plane curvature. Simulating a configuration that emulates viscous fingering in two-dimensional random porous media confirms that the model accounts properly for the role of viscous forces. Furthermore, direct comparison with previously obtained experimental results shows that the model reproduces the observed drainage patterns in a rough fracture reasonably well. The evolutions of tip location, the inlet pressures, and the invading phase fractal dimensions are analyzed to characterize the transition from capillary fingering to viscous fingering regimes. A radial injection scenario of immiscible invasion is also studied with varying modified capillary number and viscosity ratio, showing displacement patterns ranging from capillary fingering to viscous fingering to stable displacement. Such simulations using two contact angles show that the invading phase becomes more compact when the wetting condition changes from strong to weak drainage, as already observed in 2-D porous media. The model can be used to bridge the gap in spatial scales of two-phase flow between pore-scale modeling approaches and the continuum Darcy-scale models.
   Plain Language Summary The flow of two or more fluids in fractured media is an important process involved in many industrial and environmental applications in the subsurface with examples spanning from contaminant transport to petroleum recovery to geological storage of carbon dioxide. Understanding and controlling two-phase flow in fractures is critical from both the scientific and technological points of view. In this study, we focus on the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible one in a rough fracture, a fundamental process underlying two-phase flow in fractured media. We develop an efficient computational model for simulating fluid invasion patterns emerging in rough fractures. This model takes into account the effect of capillary force on the fluid-fluid interfaces and viscous pressure drop in both fluid phases. Direct comparison with experimental results shows that the model output matches the observed patterns reasonably well. In addition, generic simulations demonstrate the ability of the model to produce flow patterns that fall into regimes whose dependence on the viscosity ratio and capillary number is similar to that of the classical phase diagram. The model can be used to bridge the gap in spatial scales of two-phase flow between pore-scale modeling approaches and the continuum Darcy-scale models.

AB Measurements in forest catchments in Fukushima Prefecture indicate that cesium-137 (Cs-137) leaching from forest litter affects dissolved Cs-137 levels in river water. Existing simulations have been unsuccessful in reproducing this phenomenon due to mechanistic limitations in the models connecting the forest ecosystem and the river system. This paper introduces a new coupled watershed-geochemical model to address this. We connected a forest ecosystem compartment model to the 3D watershed model General-purpose Terrestrial Fluid-Flow Simulator to describe Cs-137 transfer between forests and the river system. The compartment model included nonleachable and leachable Cs-137 sites in the organic layer. The latter sites model how leachable Cs-137 stocks increase with ambient temperature owing to decomposing organic matter. The model was tested by simulating dissolved and particulate Cs-137 discharges from a forested catchment upstream of the Ohta River, Fukushima Prefecture. The results for dissolved Cs-137 concentrations in river water for 1 January 2014, to 31 December 2015, correlated well with catchment measurements. The simulations reproduced dissolved Cs-137 concentration peaks that occurred during three typhoon events and the seasonal variations under baseflow conditions. The results support the theory that leaching from the organic layer in forests is a primary factor affecting river water dissolved Cs-137 concentrations. The wider contribution of this study is it introduces a coupled watershed-geochemical model, applicable not only for evaluating the dynamics of Cs-137, but also those of other substances that adsorb onto sediments and soil particles, and leach from forest organic matter.

ID SPACE-TIME CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; MODEL
AB Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is a key input to hydrological models. Its estimation has often been via the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, most recently in the form of an estimate of reference evapotranspiration (RET) as recommended by FAO-56. In this paper the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model is implemented to estimate PET directly in a form that recognizes vegetation diversity and temporal change without reference to experimental measurements and without calibration. The threshold values of vegetation parameters are drawn from the literature based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme land cover classification. The spatial and temporal variation of the LAI of vegetation is derived from the composite NOAA-AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using a method based on the SiB2 model, and the Climate Research Unit database is used to provide the required meteorological data. All these data inputs are publicly and globally available. Consequently, the implementation of the S-W model developed in this study is applicable at the global scale, an essential requirement if it is to be applied in data-poor or ungauged large basins. A comparison is made between the FAO-56 method and the S-W model when applied to the Yellow River basin for the whole of the last century. The resulting estimates of RET and PET and their association with vegetation types and leaf area index (LAI) are examined over the whole basin both annual and monthly and at six specific points. The effect of NDVI on the PET estimate is further evaluated by replacing the monthly NDVI product with the 10-day product. Multiple regression relationships between monthly PET, RET, LAI, and climatic variables are explored for categories of vegetation types. The estimated RET is a good climatic index that adequately reflects the temporal change and spatial distribution of climate over the basin, but the PET estimated using the S-W model not only reflects the changes in climate, but also the vegetation distribution and the development of vegetation in response to climate. Although good statistical relationships can be established between PET, RET and/or climatic variables, applying these relationships likely will result in large errors because of the strong non-linearity and scatter between the PET and the LAI of vegetation. It is concluded that use of the implementation of the S-W model described in this study results in a physically sound estimate of PET that accounts for changing land surface conditions.

ID RULE-BASED MODELS
AB Rainfall-runoff models are used to describe the hydrological behaviour of a river catchment. Many different models exist to simulate the physical processes of the relationship between precipitation and runoff. Some of them are based on simple and easy-to-handle concepts, others on highly sophisticated physical and mathematical approaches that require extreme effort in data input and handling. Recently, mathematical methods using linguistic variables, rather than conventional numerical variables applied extensively in other disciplines, are encroaching in hydrological studies. Among these is the application of a fuzzy rule-based modelling. In this paper an attempt was made to develop fuzzy rule-based routines to simulate the different processes involved in the generation of runoff from precipitation. These routines were implemented within a conceptual, modular, and semi-distributed model-the HBV model. The investigation involved determining which modules of this model could be replaced by the new approach and the necessary input data were identified. A fuzzy rule-based routine was then developed for each of the modules selected, and application and validation of the model was done on a rainfall-runoff analysis of the Neckar River catchment, in southwest Germany.

AB Various dispersion mechanisms are known to link the spatial heterogeneity of the basin morphology and flow dynamics to the hydrologic response. Recent studies have conducted spatial analysis of the kinematic and geomorphological dispersion coefficients that characterize these mechanisms, as well as identified the influence of hillslopes, channels, and runoff production on their values. Nevertheless, an explicit and distributed dynamic representation of the travel times has not been used for this purpose. This study quantifies dispersion mechanisms by calculating spatially distributed flood wave travel times and hillslope and channel velocities, with a spatially distributed kinematic-wave based model that explicitly accounts for the path heterogeneity, the dynamics of upstream flow contributions, and the nonlinear dependence on runoff intensity. Hence, the role of these factors and their influence on the dispersion mechanisms across different scales is studied in detail. Using different runoff intensities, the scaling of the dispersion mechanism coefficients according to the contributing areas within the Quintero Creek basin and two of its sub-basins (in central Chile) is obtained. These scaling relationships are compared against those previously reported in the literature, which were obtained with approaches that simplify the treatment of travel times. Both basin-specific and more general factors manifesting in the behavior of the dispersion mechanisms are found. Dispersion coefficients increase with area, and the role of the hillslope-channel transition is controlled by runoff intensity, affecting the relative contribution of the dispersion mechanisms to the total dispersion at different spatial scales.

AB Due to the diminishing availability of good quality water for irrigation, it is increasingly important that irrigation and salinity management tools be able to target submaximal crop yields and support the use of marginal quality waters. In this work, we present a steady-state irrigated systems modeling framework that accounts for reduced plant water uptake due to root zone salinity. Two explicit, closed-form analytical solutions for the root zone solute concentration profile are obtained, corresponding to two alternative functional forms of the uptake reduction function. The solutions express a general relationship between irrigation water salinity, irrigation rate, crop salt tolerance, crop transpiration, and (using standard approximations) crop yield. Example applications are illustrated, including the calculation of irrigation requirements for obtaining targeted submaximal yields, and the generation of crop-water production functions for varying irrigation waters, irrigation rates, and crops. Model predictions are shown to be mostly consistent with existing models and available experimental data. Yet the new solutions possess advantages over available alternatives, including: (i) the solutions were derived from a complete physical-mathematical description of the system, rather than based on an ad hoc formulation; (ii) the analytical solutions are explicit and can be evaluated without iterative techniques; (iii) the solutions permit consideration of two common functional forms of salinity induced reductions in crop water uptake, rather than being tied to one particular representation; and (iv) the utilized modeling framework is compatible with leading transient-state numerical models.

AB Groundwater-fed irrigation has been shown to deplete groundwater storage, decrease surface water runoff, and increase evapotranspiration. Here we simulate soil moisture-dependent groundwater-fed irrigation with an integrated hydrologic model. This allows for direct consideration of feedbacks between irrigation demand and groundwater depth. Special attention is paid to system dynamics in order to characterized spatial variability in irrigation demand and response to increased irrigation stress. A total of 80 years of simulation are completed for the Little Washita Basin in Southwestern Oklahoma, USA spanning a range of agricultural development scenarios and management practices. Results show regionally aggregated irrigation impacts consistent with other studies. However, here a spectral analysis reveals that groundwater-fed irrigation also amplifies the annual streamflow cycle while dampening longer-term cyclical behavior with increased irrigation during climatological dry periods. Feedbacks between the managed and natural system are clearly observed with respect to both irrigation demand and utilization when water table depths are within a critical range. Although the model domain is heterogeneous with respect to both surface and subsurface parameters, relationships between irrigation demand, water table depth, and irrigation utilization are consistent across space and between scenarios. Still, significant local heterogeneities are observed both with respect to transient behavior and response to stress. Spatial analysis of transient behavior shows that farms with groundwater depths within a critical depth range are most sensitive to management changes. Differences in behavior highlight the importance of groundwater's role in system dynamics in addition to water availability.

AB Discharge is a master variable that controls many processes in stream ecosystems. However, there is uncertainty of which discharges are most important for driving particular ecological processes and thus how flow regime may influence entire stream ecosystems. Here the analytical method of effective discharge from fluvial geomorphology is used to analyze the interaction between frequency and magnitude of discharge events that drive organic matter transport, algal growth, nutrient retention, macroinvertebrate disturbance, and habitat availability. We quantify the ecological effective discharge using a synthesis of previously published studies and modeling from a range of study sites. An analytical expression is then developed for a particular case of ecological effective discharge and is used to explore how effective discharge varies within variable hydrologic regimes. Our results suggest that a range of discharges is important for different ecological processes in an individual stream. Discharges are not equally important; instead, effective discharge values exist that correspond to near modal flows and moderate floods for the variable sets examined. We suggest four types of ecological response to discharge variability: discharge as a transport mechanism, regulator of habitat, process modulator, and disturbance. Effective discharge analysis will perform well when there is a unique, essentially instantaneous relationship between discharge and an ecological process and poorly when effects of discharge are delayed or confounded by legacy effects. Despite some limitations the conceptual and analytical utility of the effective discharge analysis allows exploring general questions about how hydrologic variability influences various ecological processes in streams.

AB Understanding controls of P movement through watersheds are essential for improved landscape management in intensively managed regions. Here, we analyze observational data from 104 gaged river sites and 176 nongaged river sites within agriculturally dominated watersheds of Minnesota, USA, to understand the role of landscape features, land use practices, climate variability, and biogeochemical processes in total, dissolved and particulate P dynamics at daily to annual scales. Our analyses demonstrate that factors mediating P concentration-discharge relationships varied greatly across watersheds and included near-channel sediment sources, lake and wetland interception, assimilation by algal P, and artificial land drainage. The majority of gaged sites exhibited mobilizing behavior for all forms of P at event (i.e., daily) timescales and chemostatic behavior at annual timescales. The large majority of watershed P export (>70%, on average) occurred during high flow conditions, suggesting that more frequent large storm events arising from climate change will drive increased P losses from agricultural watersheds without substantial management changes. We found that P export could be dominated by dissolved P, particulate P, or an even mix of the two forms, depending on watershed attributes. Implementation of management practices to control P losses must be guided by understanding of how local landscapes interact with current and future climate conditions. Managing for both dissolved and particulate P is required to reduce overall P load in many agricultural watersheds.

AB Large storage facilities in hydropower-dominated river basins have traditionally been designed and managed to maximize revenues from energy generation. In an attempt to mitigate the externalities downstream due to a reduction in flow fluctuation, minimum flow requirements have been imposed to reservoir operators. However, it is now recognized that a varying flow regime including flow pulses provides the best conditions for many aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a methodology to derive a trade-off relationship between hydropower generation and ecological preservation in a system with multiple reservoirs and stochastic inflows. Instead of imposing minimum flow requirements, the method brings more flexibility to the allocation process by building upon environmental valuation studies to derive simple demand curves for environmental goods and services, which are then used in a reservoir optimization model together with the demand for energy. The objective here is not to put precise monetary values on environmental flows but to see the marginal changes in release policies should those values be considered. After selecting appropriate risk indicators for hydropower generation and ecological preservation, the trade-off curve provides a concise way of exploring the extent to which one of the objectives must be sacrificed in order to achieve more of the other. The methodology is illustrated with the Zambezi River basin where large man-made reservoirs have disrupted the hydrological regime.

   modeling; river water quality; River Thames
AB High-resolution river modeling is valuable to study diurnal scale phytoplankton dynamics and understand biomass response to short-term, rapid changes in its environmental controls. Based on theory contained in the Quality Evaluation and Simulation Tool for River-systems model, a new river model is developed to simulate hourly scale phytoplankton growth and its environmental controls, thus allowing to study diurnal changes thereof. The model is implemented along a 62 km stretch in a lowland river, River Thames (England), using high-frequency water quality measurements to simulate flow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and phytoplankton concentrations for 2 years (2013-2014). The model satisfactorily simulates diurnal variability and transport of phytoplankton with Nash and Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.7 at all calibration sites. Even without high-frequency data inputs, the model performs satisfactorily with NSE > 0.6. The model therefore can serve as a powerful tool both for predictive purposes and for hindcasting past conditions when hourly resolution water quality monitoring is unavailable. Model sensitivity analysis shows that the model with cool water diatoms as dominant species with an optimum growth temperature of 14 degrees C performs the best for phytoplankton prediction. Phytoplankton blooms are mainly controlled by residence time, light and water temperature. Moreover, phytoplankton blooms develop within an optimum range of flow (21-63 m(3) s(-1)). Thus, lowering river residence time with short-term high flow releases could help prevent major bloom developments. The hourly model improves biomass prediction and represents a step forward in high-resolution phytoplankton modeling and consequently, bloom management in lowland river systems.

AB I developed a new model named POLARIS describing the complex conductivity of (pyrite-free) shaly poorly sorted sands. This model is based on the solution given by the effective medium theory for grains coated by an electrical double layer and immersed in a background electrolyte. The electrical double layer comprises the Stern layer and the diffuse layer. Both layers play very distinct roles in the in-phase and quadrature conductivities. The polarization of the shaly sands is mainly controlled by the polarization of the Stern layer (except at very high salinities) with a very small mobility of the counterions contained in this layer. The in-phase component of the conductivity is controlled by the conductivity of the pore water with a contribution associated with the diffuse layer (the contribution of the Stern layer seems negligible). The fraction of counterions in the Stern layer is computed from a simple sorption isotherm and is used to infer the quadrature conductivity. The quadrature conductivity is assumed to be frequency independent, which is a reasonable approximation in clayey sands and sandstones, in agreement with observations. The polarization model is also based on the assumption that the Stern layer is discontinuous between grains, an assumption that is consistent with recent models of ionic transport in clayey sands. POLARIS explains the dependence of the quadrature conductivity on the salinity, cation exchange capacity, specific surface area (or specific surface per unit pore volume), and temperature. It can be used to predict the saturation and the permeability (inside 1 order of magnitude).

AB The water retention curve (theta(h)), which defines the relationship between the volumetric water content (theta) and the matric potential (h), is of paramount importance to characterize the hydraulic behaviour of soils. Because current methods to estimate theta(h) are, in general, tedious and time consuming, alternative procedures to determine theta(h) are needed. Using an upward infiltration curve, the main objective of this work is to present a method to determine the parameters of the van Genuchten (1980) water retention curve (alpha and n) from the sorptivity (S) and the beta parameter defined in the 1D infiltration equation proposed by Haverkamp et al. (1994). The first specific objective is to present an equation, based on the Haverkamp et al. (1994) analysis, which allows describing an upward infiltration process. Secondary, assuming a known saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, calculated on a finite soil column by the Darcy's law, a numerical procedure to calculate S and beta by the inverse analysis of an exfiltration curve is presented. Finally, the alpha and n values are numerically calculated from K-s, S and beta. To accomplish the first specific objective, cumulative upward infiltration curves simulated with HYDRUS-1D for sand, loam, silt and clay soils were compared to those calculated with the proposed equation, after applying the corresponding beta and S calculated from the theoretical K-s, alpha and n. The same curves were used to: (i) study the influence of the exfiltration time on S and beta estimations, (ii) evaluate the limits of the inverse analysis, and (iii) validate the feasibility of the method to estimate alpha and n. Next, the theta(h) parameters estimated with the numerical method on experimental soils were compared to those obtained with pressure cells. The results showed that the upward infiltration curve could be correctly described by the modified Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation. While S was only affected by early-time exfiltration data, the beta parameter had a significant influence on the long-time exfiltration curve, which accuracy increased with time. The 1D infiltration model was only suitable for beta < 1.7 (sand, loam and silt). After omitting the clay soil, an excellent relationship (R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.005) was observed between the theoretical alpha and n values of the synthetic soils and those estimated from the inverse analysis. Consistent results, with a significant relationship (p < 0.001) between the n values estimated with the pressure cell and the upward infiltration analysis, were also obtained on the experimental soils.

AB It is well recognized that the time series of hydrologic variables, such as rainfall and streamflow are significantly influenced by various large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. The influence of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) on hydrologic variables, through hydroclimatic teleconnection, is recognized throughout the world. Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) has been proved to be significantly influenced by ENSO. Recently, it was established that the relationship between ISMR and ENSO is modulated by the influence of atmospheric circulation patterns over the Indian Ocean region. The influences of Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode and equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation (EQUINOO) on ISMR have been established in recent research. Thus, for the Indian subcontinent, hydrologic time series are significantly influenced by ENSO along with EQUINOO. Though the influence of these large-scale atmospheric circulations on large-scale rainfall patterns was investigated, their influence on basin-scale stream-flow is yet to be investigated. In this paper, information of ENSO from the tropical Pacific Ocean and EQUINOO from the tropical Indian Ocean is used in terms of their corresponding indices for stream-flow forecasting of the Mahanadi River in the state of Orissa, India. To model the complex non-linear relationship between basin-scale stream-flow and such large-scale atmospheric circulation information, artificial neural network (ANN) methodology has been opted for the present study. Efficient optimization of ANN architecture is obtained by using an evolutionary optimizer based on a genetic algorithm. This study proves that use of such large-scale atmospheric circulation information potentially improves the performance of monthly basin-scale stream-flow prediction which, in turn, helps in better management of water resources.

AB Time series of groundwater head measurements serve as a primary source of information on groundwater systems. In different groundwater systems, and across several scales, we observe a multitude of patterns in groundwater time series, resulting from complex hydrogeological setups. Unlike in surface hydrology, there is no generalized classification to categorize and quantify the dynamics in groundwater time series. This leads to a lack of tools that could help us disentangle the information contained in groundwater time series in a systematic way. To approach such a classification, we present a principle for organization to qualitatively describe and to quantify groundwater dynamics in a nonredundant and data efficient way. We devise a descriptive typology of groundwater dynamics and assign quantitative measures, mathematically expressing these dynamics. Based on an extensive data set of daily groundwater hydrographs from central Europe, we analyze the relationship between indices and typology based on principal component analysis. The principal component analysis is also used to investigate and discuss redundancy, that is, indices expressing similar information content of hydrographs. Further, the indices' sensitivity to measurement interval and length of the overall observed period is investigated. Finally, a case study demonstrates the potential of the typology and index approach to link groundwater dynamics to the underlying hydrogeological process controls. The tools provided for characterization and quantification of groundwater dynamics should improve future efforts of groundwater classification and prediction in ungauged aquifers and other applications.

AB The highly dynamic processes within a hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) continuum are known to affect streamflow generation, but are yet not fully understood. Within this study, we simulated a headwater HRS continuum in western Luxembourg with an integrated hydrologic surface subsurface model (HydroGeoSphere). The model was setup with thorough consideration of catchment-specific attributes and we performed a multicriteria model evaluation (4 years) with special focus on the temporally varying spatial patterns of surface saturation. We used a portable thermal infrared (TIR) camera to map surface saturation with a high spatial resolution and collected 20 panoramic snapshots of the riparian zone (approx. 10 m x 20 m) under different hydrologic conditions. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of the processed TIR panoramas and the corresponding model output panoramas revealed a good agreement between spatiotemporal dynamic model and field surface saturation patterns. A double logarithmic linear relationship between surface saturation extent and discharge was similar for modeled and observed data. This provided confidence in the capability of an integrated hydrologic surface subsurface model to represent temporal and spatial water flux dynamics at small (HRS continuum) scales. However, model scenarios with different parameterizations of the riparian zone showed that discharge and surface saturation were controlled by different parameters and hardly influenced each other. Surface saturation only affected very fast runoff responses with a small volumetric contribution to stream discharge, indicating that the dynamic surface saturation in the riparian zone does not necessarily imply a major control on runoff generation.

AB As glaciers around the world rapidly lose mass, the tight coupling between glaciers and downstream ecosystems is resulting in widespread impacts on global hydrologic and biogeochemical cycling. However, a range of challenges make it difficult to conduct research in glacierized systems, and our knowledge of seasonally changing hydrologic processes and solute sources and signatures is limited. This in turn hampers our ability to make predictions on solute composition and flux. We conducted a broad water sampling campaign in order to understand the present-day partitioning of water sources and associated solutes in Alaska's Wolverine Glacier watershed. We established a relationship between electrical conductivity and streamflow at the watershed outlet to divide the melt season into four hydroclimatic periods. Across hydroclimatic periods, we observed a shift in nonglacial source waters from snowmelt-dominated overland and shallow subsurface flow paths to deeper groundwater flow paths. We also observed the shift from a low- to high-efficiency subglacial drainage network and the associated flushing of water stored subglacially with higher solute loads. We used calcium, the dominant dissolved ion, from watershed outlet samples to estimate solute fluxes for each hydroclimatic period across two melt seasons. We found between 40% and 55% of Ca2+ export occurred during the late season rainy period. This partitioning of the melt season coupled with a characterization of the chemical makeup and magnitude of solute export provides new insight into a rapidly changing watershed and creates a framework to quantify and predict changes to solute fluxes across a melt season.

AB The M-W 7.1 Darfield (Canterbury) earthquake, 4 September 2010, generated widespread hydrological effects in New Zealand ranging from instantaneous changes of piezometric levels, to more sustained postseismic changes in spring flow, river discharge and groundwater levels, and increased turbidity and declined yields of water abstracted from wells. Four years later, piezometric levels remained elevated in deeper (>40 m) aquifers along the north-western (upper) side of the Canterbury Plains near the Greendale Fault, with changes in mean piezometric level reaching 113 m. Linear reservoir modeling (eigen modeling) suggests that sustained high groundwater was not the result of changes in abstraction or land surface recharge. Step-drawdown tests at six wells within 15 km of Greendale Fault were carried out prior to the earthquake and were retested following fault rupture. Eden-Hazel analysis of discharge/drawdown relationships discriminates potential sources of head losses, and how these changed (or otherwise) as a result of the earthquake. Objective application of Eden-Hazel analysis provided confidence levels for the interpretation, including when step tests provide reliable/unreliable estimates of transmissivity change. Increases in both aquifer losses and well losses were observed in four wells, reflecting both a change in sediment transmissivity and decrease in well efficiency. At two locations, the data were unable to provide results that can be interpreted with confidence. As the majority of local groundwater flow occurs through high-permeability open framework gravel lenses, we suggest that reduction in the permeability of these gravels, due to fine-sediment incursion, is the cause of the reduction in transmissivity and increase in well losses.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a poorly constrained flux in the North American monsoon (NAM) region, leading to potential errors in land-atmosphere feedbacks. We quantified the spatiotemporal variations of ET using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, modified to account for soil evaporation (E-soil), irrigated agriculture, and the variability of land surface properties derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer during 2000-2012. Simulated ET patterns were compared to field observations at 59 eddy covariance towers, water balance estimates in nine basins, and six available gridded ET products. The modified VIC model performed well at eddy covariance towers representing the natural and agricultural land covers in the region. Simulations revealed that major sources of ET were forested mountain areas during the summer season and irrigated croplands at peak times of growth in the winter and summer, accounting for 22% and 9% of the annual ET, respectively. Over the NAM region, E-soil was the largest component (60%) of annual ET, followed by plant transpiration (T, 32%) and evaporation of canopy interception (8%). E-soil and T displayed different relationships with P in natural land covers, with E-soil tending to peak earlier than T by up to 1 month, while only a weak correlation between ET and P was found in irrigated croplands. Based on the model performance, the VIC-based estimates are the most realistic to date for this region. Furthermore, spatiotemporal patterns reveal new information on the magnitudes, locations, and timing of ET in the North American monsoon region with implications on land-atmosphere feedbacks.

AB An understanding of pollutant processes in rivers under different hydrological conditions is essential to assess its long-term evolution. This is especially relevant in Mediterranean rivers during rain events, when most of the water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and pollutants are delivered. This study investigates the hydrochemical changes and pollutant fluxes in the Odiel River (SW Spain) during rainy conditions. For this purpose, high-resolution sampling (6 h) was performed to monitor dissolved and total concentrations of pollutants. During the rises in discharge, most dissolved elements had decreased concentrations due to the dilution effect of runoff waters and Fe precipitation processes. However, the particulate concentrations of some elements (As, Fe, Pb, Cr, Ti, V, and Ba) increased due to Fe-rich sediment remobilization, and to a lesser extent, direct precipitation. A two end-member mixing model applied to the collected data showed that the contribution of nonaffected waters was similar to 85%-98% of the total discharge, highlighting the importance of mining lixiviates in the deterioration of Odiel water quality. An innovative methodology was applied to estimate dissolved and total pollutant loads, based on the relationships between dissolved concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC), and total concentrations and river flow. The importance of particulate metal transport during rain events in the Odiel River was significant. The total transport of Fe was 37 times higher than dissolved Fe, was almost 7 times higher for Pb, and 5 times higher for Cr, while As (1.1 t) was totally transported by particulate matter.

AB The time it takes water to travel through a catchment, from when it enters as rain and snow to when it leaves as streamflow, may influence stream water quality and catchment sensitivity to environmental change. Most studies that estimate travel times do so for only a few, often rain-dominated, catchments in a region and use relatively short data records (<10 years). A better understanding of how catchment travel times vary across a landscape may help diagnose inter-catchment differences in water quality and response to environmental change. We used comprehensive and long-term observations from the Turkey Lakes Watershed Study in central Ontario to estimate water travel times for 12 snowmelt-dominated headwater catchments, three of which were impacted by forest harvesting. Chloride, a commonly used water tracer, was measured in streams, rain, snowfall and as dry atmospheric deposition over a 31 year period. These data were used with a lumped convolution integral approach to estimate mean water travel times. We explored relationships between travel times and catchment characteristics such as catchment area, slope angle, flowpath length, runoff ratio and wetland coverage, as well as the impact of harvesting. Travel time estimates were then used to compare differences in stream water quality between catchments. Our results show that mean travel times can be variable for small geographic areas and are related to catchment characteristics, in particular flowpath length and wetland cover. In addition, forest harvesting appeared to decrease mean travel times. Estimated mean travel times had complex relationships with water quality patterns. Results suggest that biogeochemical processes, particularly those present in wetlands, may have a greater influence on water quality than catchment travel times.

AB Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

AB Major-ion compositions of groundwater are employed in this study of the water-rock interactions and hydrogeochemical evolution within a carbonate aquifer system. The groundwater samples were collected from boreholes or underground tunnels in the Ordovician limestone of Yanzhou Coalfield where catastrophic groundwater inflows can be hazardous to mining and impact use of the groundwater as a water supply. The concentration of total dissolved solid (TDS) ranged from 961 to 3555mg/l and indicates moderately to highly mineralized water. The main water-type of the middle Ordovician limestone groundwater is Ca-Mg-SO4, with SO42- ranging from 537 to 2297mg/l, and average values of Ca2+ and Mg2+ of 455.7 and 116.6mg/l, respectively. The water samples were supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite and undersaturated or saturated with respect to gypsum. Along the general flow direction, deduced from increases of TDS and Cl-, the main water-rock interactions that caused hydrogeochemical evolution of the groundwater within the aquifer were the dissolution of gypsum, the precipitation of calcite, the dissolution or precipitation of dolomite, and ion exchange. Ion exchange is the major cause for the lower mole concentration of Ca2+ than that of SO42-. The groundwater level of Ordovician aquifer is much higher than that of C-P coal-bearing aquifers, so the potential flow direction is upward, and the pyrite in coal is not a possible source of sulfate; additional data on the stable sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of the sulfate may be helpful to identify its origin. Although ion exchange probably accounts for the higher mole concentration of Na+ than that of Cl-, the dissolution of aluminosilicate cannot be ruled out. The data evaluation methods and results of this study could be useful in other areas to understand flow paths in aquifers and to provide information needed to identify the origin of groundwater.

AB To enhance the understanding of solute dynamics within the stream-to-riparian continuum during flood event-driven water fluctuation (i.e., flood wave), a variable saturated groundwater flow and solute transport model were developed and calibrated against in situ measurements of the Inbuk stream, Korea, where seasonal flooding prevails. The solute dynamics were further investigated for flood waves (varying by amplitude [A], duration [T], roundness [r], and skewness [t(p)]) that were parameterised by real-time stream stage fluctuations. We found that the solute transferred faster and farther in the riparian zone, especially within the phreatic zone, above which in the variable saturated zone the concentration required a significantly longer time, particularly at higher altitudes, to return to the initial state. By comparison, solute transferred shallowly in the streambed where the solute plume exhibited an exponential growth trend from the centre to the bank. The dynamic changes of solute flux and mass along the stream-aquifer interface and stream concentration were linked to the shape of flood wave. As the flood wave became higher (A NE arrow), wider (T NE arrow), rounder (r SE arrow), and less skewed (t(p)NE arrow), the maximum solute storage in aquifer increased. Maximum stream concentration (C-str_max) not only presented a positive linear relationship with A or t(p) but also showed a negative logarithmic trend with increasing T or r. The sensitivity of C-str_max to A was approximately two times that of t(p), and between these values, the r was slightly more sensitive than T. C-strmax linearly increased as hydraulic conductivity increased and logarithmically increased as longitudinal dispersivity increased. The former relationship was more sensitive than the latter.

AB The dynamics of suspended sediment involves inherent non-linearity and complexity because of existence of both spatial variability of the basin characteristics and temporal climatic patterns. This complexity, therefore, leads to inaccurate prediction by the conventional sediment rating curve (SRC) and other empirical methods. Over past few decades, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have emerged as one of the advanced modelling techniques capable of addressing inherent non-linearity in the hydrological processes. In the present study, feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm of ANNs is used to model stage-discharge-suspended sediment relationship for ablation season (May-September) for melt runoff released from Gangotri glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Himalaya. The simulations have been carried out on primary data of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) discharge and stage for ablation season of 11-year period (1999-2009). Combinations of different input vectors (viz. stage, discharge and SSC) for present and previous days are considered for development of the ANN models and examining the effects of input vectors. Further, based on model performance indices for training and testing phase, a suitable modelling approach with appropriate model input structure is suggested. The conventional SRC method is also used for modelling discharge-sediment relationship and performance of developed models is evaluated by statistical indices, namely; root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). Statistically, the performance of ANN-based models is found to be superior as compared to SRC method in terms of the selected performance indices in simulating the daily SSC. The study reveals suitability of ANN approach for simulation and estimation of daily SSC in glacier melt runoff and, therefore, opens new avenues of research for application of hybrid soft computing models in glacier hydrology.

AB This study offers an unprecedented opportunity to estimate total sapwood area over an entire catchment (A(scat)/A(g)) using small-footprint light detection and ranging technology with a minimal amount of labour in field. Forty-two-year-old plantations of Japanese cypress (Hinoki; Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc.) and Japanese cedar (Sugi; Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) vegetated the 2.98 ha experimental catchment. Field observations identified diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees and produced the relationship between DBH and tree sapwood area (A(stre)). The sum of A(stre) generated actual values of A(scat)/A(g). For light detection and ranging data analyses, local maximum filtering revealed height of tree apices (H) and tree number (N) with 9% omission errors. A novel process was developed to identify tree species by their apices based on height of the apices and canopy roughness. Four methods were tested. In Methods A-C, H was converted to A(str)e directly or via DBH, then, the sum of A(stre) created A(scat)/A(g). H-A(stre) or H-DBH relationships were varied irrespective of labour-intensive measurements, and A(scat)/A(g) was underestimated up to 85% of actual value because of the smaller N. On the other hand, in Method D, ready-made stand density management diagrams (SDMDs) overestimated mean DBH. However, a product of overestimated mean A(stre) and the underestimated N was almost identical to the actual A(scat)/A(g). The estimates were 84% and 95% of the true A(scat)/A(g) in Hinoki and Sugi, respectively, and the former will be more precise if the SDMD is suitable for the site as indicated through sensitivity analysis.

AB An increasing impervious area is quickly extending over the Wu-Tu watershed due to the endless demands of the people. Generally, impervious paving is a major result of urbanization and more recently has had the potential to produce more enormous flood disasters than those of the past. In this study, 40 available rainfall-runoff events were chosen to calibrate the applicable parameters of the models and to determine the relationships between the impervious surfaces and the calibrated parameters. Model inputs came from the outcomes of the block kriging method and the non-linear programming method. In the optimal process, the shuffled complex evolution method and three criteria were applied to compare the observed and simulated hydrographs. The tendencies of the variations of the parameters with their corresponding imperviousness were established through regression analysis. Ten cases were used to examine the established equations of the parameters and impervious covers. Finally, the design flood routines of various return periods were furnished through use of approaches containing a design storm, block kriging, the SCS model, and a rainfall-runoff model with established functional relationships. These simulated flood hydrographs were used to compare and understand the past, present, and future hydrological conditions of the watershed studied. In the research results, the time to peak of flood hydrographs for various storms was diminished approximately from 11 h to 6 h in different decrements, whereas peak flow increased respectively from 127 m(3) s(-1) to 629 m(3) s(-1) for different storm intensities. In addition, this study provides a design diagram for the peak flow ratio to help engineers and designers to construct hydraulic structures efficiently and prevent possible damage to human life and property.

AB The effects of spatial variability of rainfall, geomorphology, and climatology of precipitation and temperature on the hydrologic response remain poorly understood. This study characterizes the catchment response in terms of a variable called flashiness, that describes the severity of the flood response as the rate of rise of the unit discharge. It overcomes limitations of prior works based on limited case studies or simulations by gathering information on basins of widely varying characteristics and by using a high-resolution rainfall and flooding event data set spanning 10 years over the Continental United States. The objective is to develop a robust understanding of how rainfall spatial variability influences flash flood severity and to assess its contribution relative to basin physiography and climatology. This study explores the first-order dependencies as well as the variability in these relationships and investigates the complex interactions using a multi-dimensional statistical modeling approach. The results confirm that the spatial organization of rainfall influences the basin response on par with geomorphology and climatology. Basin physiography dampens the effect of lower rainfall intensities, while higher rainfall overwhelms other factors and primarily contributes to flashiness. Dispersion of precipitation with respect to the flow path decreases flood severity. An improved understanding of sub-basin scale rainfall spatial variability aids in developing a robust flash flood severity index to identify and mitigate flash flooding situations as well as identifying basins which could most benefit from distributed hydrologic modeling.

AB Over the last few decades, automatic sensors that record groundwater levels at high-frequency intervals have become widely used in groundwater monitoring practice. These sensors provide large amounts of data regarding diurnal groundwater fluctuations, which can be treated as stochastic periodic time series. In this study, a simple relationship between the average standard deviation of diurnal groundwater level fluctuations and the daily evapotranspiration over relatively short periods (days or weeks) was developed for estimating groundwater consumption by phreatophytes in arid/semiarid areas. Our approach allows estimating groundwater evapotranspiration ( ETg) using stable statistical characteristics of diurnal groundwater fluctuations, and it is useful for analyzing large amounts of data obtained from digital groundwater level monitoring sensors. A comparison of the ETg results from a synthetic set of groundwater level fluctuations with predefined values shows that this technique behaves consistently and is robust. A numerical analysis of one-dimensional saturated-unsaturated water flow to a root system using Richards' equation indicates that this method provides a reliable estimate of ETg when the basic assumptions of the White method are met. The method was also applied to two phreatophyte-dominated riparian sites in New Mexico to demonstrate its usefulness, which provides better results than the commonly used White method.

AB Understanding streambed thermal processes is of fundamental importance due to the effects of temperature dynamics on stream ecology and solute exchange processes. Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) between fluid and solid is usually assumed for modelling heat exchange in streambeds and for inferring pore water flow velocities from streambed temperature data. By examining well established experimental and theoretical relationships of the fluid-solid heat transfer coefficient in a numerical scheme for a range of Reynolds (Re) numbers (0.01 > Re > 0.001), we show here that, for a range of typical streambed conditions, LTE is not attained. Thus errors in velocity estimates obtained when inverting streambed temperature data assuming LTE can be considerable especially at relatively low flow rates. We show that for certain conditions were the LTE assumption is not valid, inferred pore water velocities of up to 1 m/d can be obtained with LTE assumption even if the actual velocities are much smaller or even zero. Ignoring the possibility of Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE) will have consequences for the correct estimation of streambed pore water velocity and heat fluxes at low Re values. More laboratory studies are urgently needed to supplement the sparse existing data in this area and further test the findings of this study (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The transport and fate of reactive chemicals in groundwater is governed by equations which are often difficult to solve due to the nonlinear relationship between the solute concentrations for the liquid and solid phases. The nonlinearity may cause mass balance errors during the numerical simulation in addition to numerical errors for linear transport system. We have generalized the modified Picard iteration algorithm of Celia et al.(5) for unsaturated flow to solve the nonlinear transport equation. Written in a 'mixed-form' formulation, the total solute concentration is expanded in a Taylor series with respect to the solution concentration to linearize the transport equation, which is then solved with a conventional finite element method. Numerical results of this mixed-form algorithm are compared with those obtained with the concentration-based scheme using conventional Picard iteration. In general, the new solver resulted in negligible mass balance errors (<\10(-8)\%) and required less computational time than the conventional iteration scheme for the test examples, including transport involving highly nonlinear adsorption under steady-state as well as transient flow conditions. In contrast, mass balance errors resulting from the conventional Picard iteration method were higher than 10% for some highly nonlinear problems. Application of the modified Picard iteration scheme to solve the nonlinear transport equation may greatly reduce the mass balance errors and increase computational efficiency.

AB In water resources it is common to consider that two scalars have a similar behavior in the atmospheric surface layer. This is a consequence of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory whose direct implication is that all similarity functions between two scalars are equal. However, many works show that scalar similarity does not always hold under unstable conditions, a fact for which it is often difficult to establish a physical cause. In this paper, using a data set measured during winter over a tropical lake in Brazil (Furnas Lake), we found a relation between temperature-water vapor similarity and the strength of the surface forcing; we also confirmed that the classical balance between gradient production and molecular dissipation of scalar variance and covariance is key to scalar similarity. This balance can be disrupted by large values of the third-order transport terms, and possibly by nonstationary terms as well. In connection with the scalar variance and covariance budgets, we propose a new set of dimensionless scalar flux numbers which are able to make a good diagnosis of the aforementioned balance (or the lack thereof) for each budget. The fact that different Monin-Obukhov functions are not equally capable of identifying scalar similarity is also demonstrated and a new bulk indicator of scalar flux similarity is proposed whose absolute value, unlike the relative transfer efficiency, is bounded above by 1; this new indicator holds also in the spectral domain. Finally, we verify that low-frequency dissimilarity has a larger impact over scalar similarity than over scalar flux similarity.

AB Water table elevations are usually sampled in space using piezometric measurements that are unfortunately expensive to obtain and are thus scarce over space. Most of the time, piezometric data are sparsely distributed over large areas, thus providing limited direct information about the level of the corresponding water table. As a consequence, there is a real need for approaches that are able at the same time to (1) provide spatial predictions at unsampled locations and (2) enable the user to account for all potentially available secondary information sources that are in some way related to water table elevations. In this paper, a recently developed Bayesian data fusion (BDF) framework is applied to the problem of water table spatial mapping. After a brief presentation of the underlying theory, specific assumptions are made and discussed to account for a digital elevation model and for the geometry of a corresponding river network. On the basis of a data set for the Dijle basin in the north part of Belgium, the suggested model is then implemented and results are compared to those of standard techniques such as ordinary kriging and cokriging. Respective accuracies and precisions of these estimators are finally evaluated using a "leave-one-out'' cross-validation procedure. Although the BDF methodology was illustrated here for the integration of only two secondary information sources (namely, a digital elevation model and the geometry of a river network), the method can be applied for incorporating an arbitrary number of secondary information sources, thus opening new avenues for the important topic of data integration in a spatial mapping context.

AB Solute transport in rivers and streams with hyporheic zone exchange and/or in-stream storage is typically affected by the prevailing flow rate. The research reported here focuses on stream tracer experiments repeated many times along the same Austrian (Modlingbach) and Italian (Torrente Lura) channel reaches to characterize parameter dependency on flow rate. Both groups of data sets showed an increase of storage zone area and main stream area with discharge. In either case, a strong negative correlation was obtained between storage zone residence time and flow rate. From the Modlingbach data, no clear relationship with Q emerged for the dispersion coefficient and the dead zone ratio, whereas Torrente Lura showed a clear positive correlation of the dispersion coefficient with the flow rate and a slightly negative Q-dependency for the dead zone ratio. Modlingbach and Torrente Lura results are presented against the background of other repeat experiments reported in literature.
   In practical applications, the computation of peak concentrations frequently rests on the transfer of transport parameters from one flow rate to another. Using the above Austrian and Italian data sets it was shown that the errors in simulated Modlingbach peak concentrations remain within a 40% margin, if the ratio of flow rates (for calibration and simulation, resp.) does not exceed 2:1. With Torrente Lura, parameter transfer resulted in somewhat lower peak errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Siberian rivers are of global importance as they impact on the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean, which affects the Thermo-Haline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. Siberian rivers, in particular the tributaries to the larger rivers, are under-represented in the international river-regime databases. The runoff of three Russian rivers in the Central Siberian taiga (Kureyka, Karabula and Erba) is modelled to analyse the relative influence of climate. In addition three rivers (Rhine, Maas and Odra) in Western Europe are similarly assessed as a control. The results show that the role of precipitation and autocorrelation as factors in the formation of river runoff is stronger under oceanic climate conditions, increasing from the central regions of Northern Eurasia towards the Arctic Ocean in the North and the Atlantic in the West. At the same time the influence of summer temperatures is weakened. The formation of Northern Eurasian river runoff appears to be influenced by periodically thawing top horizons of permafrost soil. Time served as an indicator for land use change after inclusion of meteorological data in the models. Maas and Erba showed a significant influence of the time factor. For the Erba the onset of agricultural land use in the catchment coincides with a drop in runoff. A similar causal relationship is suggested for the Maas. Land use can change the formation of runoff, which in turn can be used as an environmental indicator for sustainable land use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hyporheic exchange (HE) is essential to riverine ecosystem, water quality, and energy cycling in a stream due to its governing role in physicochemical and biological processes in hyporheic zone (HZ). Alternate bars, characterized by a repetitive sequence of diagonal bars with a pool-riffle bedform, are common geomorphic features that generally form in straight streams. Following similar laboratory and numerical methodology as Huang and Chui (2021, ) who investigated the HE induced by pool-riffle sequences, this study focused on the HE induced by alternate bars (i.e., geomorphic features on stream banks instead of streambed) where the influences of key factors were systematically examined. The results show that alternate bars strongly influence surface flow and induce significant hyporheic flows in both stream banks and streambed, whose patterns, magnitudes, and influential patterns of key factors could be similar to the HE induced by pool-riffle sequences. The HE flowrate increases linearly with discharge, bed slope, and bar spacing. However, influential patterns of bar width on HE vary, and the bar width changes the influential patterns of discharge and bed slope on HZ scale, highlighting the influence of bar width in the complex interactions among discharge, bed slope, and bar width. All indicators of HE characteristics generally increase with bar spacing and follow exponential relationships with groundwater flow. Findings in this study lay the foundation in research on riparian ecosystems and water quality in the streams with alternate bars and help guide the design of bars during river restorations.

AB The exposure of urban populations to flooding is highly heterogeneous, with the negative impacts of flooding experienced disproportionately by the poor. In developing countries experiencing rapid urbanization and population growth a key distinction in the urban landscape is between planned development and unplanned, informal development, which often occurs on marginal, flood-prone land. Flood risk management in the context of informality is challenging, and may exacerbate existing social inequalities and entrench poverty. Here, we adapt an existing socio-hydrological model of human-flood interactions to account for a stratified urban society consisting of planned and informal settlements. In the first instance, we use the model to construct four system archetypes based on idealized scenarios of risk reduction and disaster recovery. We then perform a sensitivity analysis to examine the relative importance of the differential values of vulnerability, risk-aversion, and flood awareness in determining the relationship between flood risk management and social inequality. The model results suggest that reducing the vulnerability of informal communities to flooding plays an important role in reducing social inequality and enabling sustainable economic growth, even when the exposure to the flood hazard remains high. Conversely, our model shows that increasing risk aversion may accelerate the decline of informal communities by suppressing economic growth. On this basis, we argue for urban flood risk management which is rooted in pro-poor urban governance and planning agendas which recognize the legitimacy and permanence of informal communities in cities.

AB Baseflow is essential for stream ecosystems and human water uses, particularly in areas with Mediterranean climates. Yet the factors controlling the temporal and spatial variability of baseflow and its sources are poorly understood. Measurements of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were used to evaluate controls on baseflow in the stream network of a 64-km(2) catchment in western Oregon. A total of 607 water samples were collected to contrast baseflow in a year of near average precipitation (2016) to a year with low winter snowpack and subsequent summer drought conditions (2015). Spatial autocorrelation structures and relationships between surface water isotopic signatures and geologic and topographic metrics throughout the network were determined using Spatial Stream Network models. Isotope values varied widely in space and between years, indicating disparate baseflow water sources. During average flow conditions, the spatial variation in delta O-18 was primarily related to elevation, reflecting the influence of prior precipitation and input of water from snowmelt at higher elevation. In contrast, during drought conditions, the spatial variation in delta O-18 was also related to terrain slope and roughness-proxies for local water storage in deep-seated earthflows and other Quaternary deposits. A prominent spring-fed tributary with high unit baseflow discharge illustrated the importance of subsurface water storage in porous volcanic bedrock. As drought increases in a warming climate, baseflow in mountain catchments may become more dependent on storage in geologic and geomorphic features.

AB Climate, groundwater extraction, and surface water flows have complex nonlinear relationships with groundwater level in agricultural regions. To better understand the relative importance of each driver and predict groundwater level change, we develop a new ensemble modeling framework based on spectral analysis, machine learning, and uncertainty analysis, as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. We apply and evaluate this new approach in the context of two aquifer systems supporting agricultural production in the United States: the High Plains aquifer (HPA) and the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA). We select input data sets by using a combination of mutual information, genetic algorithms, and lag analysis, and then use the selected data sets in a Multilayer Perceptron network architecture to simulate seasonal groundwater level change. As expected, model results suggest that irrigation demand has the highest influence on groundwater level change for a majority of the wells. The subset of groundwater observations not used in model training or cross-validation correlates strongly (R>0.8) with model results for 88 and 83% of the wells in the HPA and MRVA, respectively. In both aquifer systems, the error in the modeled cumulative groundwater level change during testing (2003-2012) was less than 2 m over a majority of the area. We conclude that our modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater level change and water availability, especially in regions where subsurface properties are unknown.

AB Nanoparticle transport and retention within porous media is treated by conceptualizing the porous media as a series of independent collectors (e.g., Colloid Filtration Theory). This conceptualization assumes that flow phenomena near grain-grain contacts, such as immobile zones (areas of low flow), exert a negligible influence on nanoparticle transport and assumes that retention and release of particles depends only on surface chemistry. This study investigated the impact of immobile zones on nanoparticle transport and retention by employing synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography (SXCMT) to examine pore-scale silver nanoparticle distributions during transport through three sand columns: uniform iron oxide, uniform quartz, and well-graded quartz. Extended tailing was observed during the elution phase of all experiments suggesting that hydraulic retention in immobile zones, not detachment from grains, was the source of tailing. A numerical simulation of fluid flow through an SXCMT data set predicted the presence of immobile zones near grain-grain contacts. SXCMT-determined silver nanoparticle concentrations observed that significantly lower nanoparticle concentrations existed near grain-grain contacts throughout the duration of all experiments. In addition, the SXCMT-determined pore-scale concentration gradients were found to be independent of surface chemistry and grain size distribution, suggesting that immobile zones limit the diffusive transport of nanoparticles toward the collectors. These results suggest that the well-known overprediction of nanoparticle retention by traditional CFT may be due to ignoring the influences of grain-grain contacts and immobile zones. As such, accurate prediction of nanoparticle transport requires consideration of immobile zones and their influence on both hydraulic and surface retention.

AB Temporal patterns of solute transport and transformation through the vadose zone are driven by the stochastic variability of water fluxes. This is determined by the hydrologic filtering of precipitation variability into infiltration, storage, drainage, and evapotranspiration. In this work we develop a framework for examining the role of the hydrologic filtering and, in particular, the effect of evapotranspiration in determining the travel time and delivery of sorbing, reacting solutes transported through the vadose zone by stochastic rainfall events. We describe a 1-D vertical model in which solute pulses are tracked as point loads transported to depth by a series of discrete infiltration events. Numerical solutions of this model compare well to the Richards equation-based HYDRUS model for some typical cases. We then utilize existing theory of the stochastic dynamics of soil water to derive analytical and semianalytical expressions for the probability density functions (pdf's) of solute travel time and delivery. The moments of these pdf's directly relate the mean and variance of expected travel times to the water balance and show how evapotranspiration tends to reduce (and make more uncertain) the mass of a degrading solute delivered to the base of the vadose zone. The framework suggests a classification of different modes hydrologic filtering depending on hydroclimatic and landscape controls. Results suggest that variability in travel times decreases with soil depth in wet climates but increases with soil depth in dry climates. In dry climates, rare large storms can be an important mechanism for leaching to groundwater.

AB [1] Downscaling precipitation is a difficult challenge for the climate community. We propose and study a new stochastic weather typing approach to perform such a task. In addition to providing accurate small and medium precipitation, our procedure possesses built-in features that allow us to model adequately extreme precipitation distributions. First, we propose a new distribution for local precipitation via a probability mixture model of Gamma and Generalized Pareto (GP) distributions. The latter one stems from Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The performance of this mixture is tested on real and simulated data, and also compared to classical rainfall densities. Then our downscaling method, extending the recently developed nonhomogeneous stochastic weather typing approach, is presented. It can be summarized as a three-step program. First, regional weather precipitation patterns are constructed through a hierarchical ascending clustering method. Second, daily transitions among our precipitation patterns are represented by a nonhomogeneous Markov model influenced by large-scale atmospheric variables like NCEP reanalyses. Third, conditionally on these regional patterns, precipitation occurrence and intensity distributions are modeled as statistical mixtures. Precipitation amplitudes are assumed to follow our mixture of Gamma and GP densities. The proposed downscaling approach is applied to 37 weather stations in Illinois and compared to various possible parameterizations and to a direct modeling. Model selection procedures show that choosing one GP distribution shape parameter per pattern for all stations provides the best rainfall representation amongst all tested models. This work highlights the importance of EVT distributions to improve the modeling and downscaling of local extreme precipitations.

AB [1] Vegetation patterns, such as regular spots and bands, have been observed in arid and semiarid lands. One of the most common explanations for vegetation banding is that the homogeneous steady state solution of soil moisture and vegetation biomass density balance, expressed in the form of a bucket model, may be unstable under conditions of scarce mean annual rainfall. Even though the theory seems to support our intuitive explanation of the phenomenon, there are still unresolved questions concerning soil parameterization, relevant hydrological processes, and the way plant physiology should be modeled in arid and semiarid environments where vegetation patterns have been observed. This paper examines the interrelation between hydrological processes and plant physiology. The biomass growth rate resembles plant physiology within the bucket model and determines the survival plant strategy given a limited soil moisture availability. The fact that very different hypotheses concerning the biomass growth rate have been formulated has not yet been given the important consideration it deserves. Different models for vegetation banding will be considered here. They are formulated by introducing different growth rates within the same soil moisture and vegetation balance equations. Linear stability analysis and numerical integration of the different models showed some relevant interrelation between hydrological and physiological features. It was demonstrated that the relation between biomass growth rate and biomass density determines which hydrological process enables vegetation pattern initiation. The discussion of this result leads to a critical review of previously published hypotheses on plant physiology and hydrological processes inducing vegetation organization.

AB The flow and sediment transport processes near steep streambanks, which are commonly found in meandering, braided, and anastomosing stream systems, exhibit complex patterns that produce intricate interactions between bed and bank morphologic adjustment. Increasingly, multi-dimensional computer models of riverine morphodynamics are used to aid in the study of these processes. A number of depth-averaged two-dimensional models are available to simulate morphologic adjustment of both bed and banks. Unfortunately, these models use overly simplified conceptual models of riverbank erosion, are limited by inflexible structured mesh systems, or are unable to accurately account for the flow and sediment transport adjacent to streambanks of arbitrary geometry. A new, nonlinear model is introduced that resolves these limitations. The model combines the river morphodynamics computer models TELEMAC-2D and SISYPHE of the open source TELEMAC-MASCARET suite of solvers with the bank erosion modules of the CONCEPTS channel evolution computer model. The performance of the new model is evaluated for meander-planform initiation and development. The most important findings are: (1) the model is able to simulate a much greater variety and complexity in meander wavelengths; (2) simulated meander development agrees closely with the unified bar-bend theory of Tubino and Seminara (1990); and (3) the rate of meander planform adjustment is greatly reduced if the wavelength of alternate bars is similar to that of meanders.

AB Estimating the dependence structure of concurrent extremes is a fundamental issue for accurate assessment of their occurrence probabilities. Identifying the extremal dependence behavior is also crucial for scientific understanding of interactions between the variables of a multidimensional environmental process. This study investigates the suitability of parametric multivariate extreme value models to correctly represent and estimate the dependence structure of concurrent extremes. Probabilistic aspects of multivariate extreme value theory with point process representation are discussed and illustrated with application to the concurrence of rainfall deficits, soil moisture deficits, and high temperatures. Application is concerned with the investigation of extremal behavior and risk assessment in Marathwada, a drought-prone region of Maharashtra state, India. To characterize the multivariate extremes, marginal distributions are specified first and transformed into unit Frechet margins. Standardized distributions are represented by a Poisson point process and coordinates of data points are transformed to pseudo-polar coordinates to make the dependence form more explicit. The extremal dependence structure is described through angular densities on the unit simplex. Strong dependence is observed between soil moisture deficits and high temperatures, whereas rainfall deficits are mildly dependent on these two variables. Overall, a weak dependence is observed between the variables considered. Estimated extremal dependence is further used to compute probabilities of a few critical extreme combinations. Results demonstrate the ability of parametric multivariate models to characterize the complex dependence structure of concurrent extremes. These models can provide a powerful new perspective for appropriate statistical analysis of dependent hydroclimatic extremes in higher dimensions.

AB This paper proposes a multistage method for burst leak localization through valve operations (VOs) and smart demand metering in district meter areas (DMAs) of water distribution systems (WDSs). Each stage includes partitioning of the DMA into two subregions using VOs and identification of potentially leaking pipes within the subregions through water balance analysis based on smart demand meters. Such a process is performed repeatedly (multiple stages) to narrow down the spatial range for pinpointing leak locations. To improve efficiency, a bisection optimization problem is formulated to localize the minimum leak areas using the lowest number of VOs, which is solved by a graph theory-based method. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated using two DMAs (DMA1 and DMA2) of a real WDS with different topological properties. Results show that the proposed method can efficiently localize artificial burst leaks in DMA1 within 7-15% of the total pipe length, implying that the proposed method is theoretically effective in localizing pipe burst leaks. The real application to DMA2 has identified two leak regions with 2.3 and 4.2 km of pipe length (around 3-6% of the entire DMA2) using 18 VOs. These two burst leaks have been subsequently confirmed and pinpointed using listening rods by practitioners of the local water utility. These results indicate that the proposed multistage method is effective and efficient for burst leak localization, which can be promising for wide practical applications due to rapid developments of smart WDSs (e.g., smart demand meters or control valves).

AB The accurate estimation of hydrologic extremes is central to planning and engineering mitigation and adaptation measures. The traditional extreme value theory is based on often overlooked assumptions that preclude the use of all available observations and negatively affect estimation uncertainty. The Metastatistical Extreme Value Distribution (MEVD) was introduced to make full use of available data and was shown to significantly improve estimation uncertainty for large extremes. However, no systematic understanding existed as to how to optimally apply the MEVD depending on the statistical properties of the observed variables. With reference to daily rainfall, we identify here the local climatic factors that define the optimal MEVD formulation. We analyze a large set of long daily rainfall records, as well as synthetic time series with prescribed statistical characteristics, and find that (1) in most climates the MEVD should be based on yearly estimates of the ordinary rainfall distributions, and only in climates with less thann over bar =20-25 year the estimation of distributional/year the estimation of distributional parameters requires samples longer than 1 year; (2) the interannual variability in the distributions of rainfall should be explicitly resolved whenn over bar >20-25 rainy days/year. Finally, we use the optimized MEVD to study the variability of daily rainfall extremes over 294 years in Padova (Italy) and compare it to traditional extreme value estimates. We find that, through its improved accuracy for short observations, MEVD better resolves high-quantile fluctuations and allows the emergence of long-term trends over estimation noise.

AB [1] We studied in situ colloid mobilization under transient flow conditions using columns repacked with Hanford sediments. Rainfall infiltration was experimentally simulated using different flow rates and initial moisture conditions. Five series of column experiments were performed with initial infiltration rates of 0.018, 0.036, 0.072, 0.144, and 0.288 cm/min, and the columns reached water saturations in the range of 53 to 81%. The infiltration of water into the columns provided unfavorable conditions for colloid attachment to the sediments. Colloids were eluted by the infiltrating water with the peak colloid concentrations in the outflow coinciding with the arrival of the infiltration front. A larger flow rate led to a greater amount of colloids released from the column. The cumulative amount of colloids released was proportional to the column water content established after steady state flow rates were achieved. We used the advection-dispersion equation with a first-order colloid release reaction to analyze the experimental data. The colloid release rate coefficient increased with the increase of water content. We calculated forces exerted on colloids, and found that electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, calculated based on the DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory, and hydrodynamic forces, were all less important than capillary forces in controlling colloid release. In one experiment, the ionic strength of the infiltration solution was increased, such that colloid attachment was favorable. Nonetheless, colloids were mobilized and eluted with the infiltration front, implying that non-DLVO forces, such as capillary forces, played a prominent role in colloid mobilization.

AB Closing the gap between theoretical reservoir operation and the real-world implementation remains a challenge in contemporary reservoir operations. Past research has focused on optimization algorithms and establishing optimal policies for reservoir operations. In this study, we attempt to understand operators' release decisions by investigating historical release data from 79 reservoirs in California and the Great Plains, using a data-mining approach. The 79 reservoirs are classified by hydrological regions, intra-annual seasons, average annual precipitation (climate), ratio of maximum reservoir capacity to average annual inflow (size ratio), hydrologic uncertainty associated with inflows, and reservoirs' main usage. We use information theory - specifically, mutual information - to measure the quality of inference between a set of classic indicators and observed releases at the monthly and weekly timescales. Several general trends are found to explain which sources of hydrologic information dictate reservoir release decisions under different conditions. Current inflow is the most important indicator during wet seasons, while previous releases are more relevant during dry seasons and in weekly data (as compared with monthly data). Inflow forecasting is the least important indicator in release decision making, but its importance increases linearly with hydrologic uncertainty and decreases logarithmically with reservoir size. No single hydrologic indicator is dominant across all reservoirs in either of the two regions. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrological processes in karst basins are controlled by permeable multimedia, consisting of soil pores, epikarst fractures, and underground conduits. Distributed modelling of hydrological dynamics in such heterogeneous hydrogeological conditions is a challenging task. Basing on the multilayer structure of the distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM), a distributed hydrological model for a karst basin was developed by integrating mathematical routings of porous Darcy flow, fissure flow and underground channel flow. Specifically, infiltration and saturated flow movement within epikarst fractures are expressed by the 'cubic law' equation which is associated with fractural width, direction, and spacing. A small karst basin located in Guizhou province of southwest China was selected for this hydrological simulation. The model parameters were determined on the basis of field measurement and calibrated against the observed soil moisture contents, vegetation interception, surface runoff, and underground flow discharges from the basin outlet. The results show that due to high permeability of the epikarst zone, a significant amount of surface runoff is only generated after heavy rainfall events during the wet season. Rock exposure and the epikarst zone significantly increase flood discharge and decrease evapotranspiration (ET) loss; the peak flood discharge is directly proportional to the size of the aperture. Distribution of soil moisture content (SMC) primarily depends on topographic variations just after a heavy rainfall, while SMC and actual ET are dominated by land cover after a period of consecutive non-rainfall days. The new model was able to capture the sharp increase and decrease of the underground streamflow hydrograph, and as such can be used to investigate hydrological effects in such rock features and land covers.

AB Dendrohydrogeology can be used to simulate historical groundwater depth, water table drawdown, groundwater recharge and piezometric lines. We simulated paleohydrogeologic conditions via tree-rings and vessel chronologies using an artificial neural network (ANN) in the alluvial aquifer of the Caspian southern coast of Iran during the past century. Tree-ring width, vessel features, secondary piezometric well data, and precipitation from different sites within the study area were evaluated. After cross-dating, standardization and time series analysis, the relationships between tree-rings and vessel chronologies with groundwater depth were defined and simulated. Additionally, paleohydrogeologic records during the past century were simulated. The results generally demonstrate that tree-ring width is a better index than vessel features. However, we obtained the most exact groundwater depth modeling results by using the combination of tree-rings and earlywood vessel diameter from periods of low precipitation and groundwater fluctuations and significant temperature fluctuations. We also found that dendrohydrogeology has more applicability in groundwater modeling in areas where groundwater depth fluctuates 10-20m below ground surface (based on root depth and water access). Moreover, using the simulated groundwater depths, piezometric lines in 1927 and 2000 (the years with maximum natural recharge and maximum drawdown respectively) were extracted using an interpolation technique and Geographic Information System (GIS). Finally, we suggest applying dendrohydrogeology for paleohydrogeologic modeling in alluvial aquifers.

AB Effective hydraulic conductivity (K-e) for Hortonian overland flow modeling has been defined as a function of rainfall intensity and runon infiltration assuming a distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivities (K-s). But surface boundary condition during infiltration and its interactions with the distribution of K-s are not well represented in models. As a result, the mean value of the K-s distribution ((K-S) over bar), which is the central parameter for K-e, varies between scales. Here we quantify this discrepancy with a large infiltration data set comprising four different methods and scales from fire-affected hillslopes in SE Australia using a relatively simple yet widely used conceptual model of K-e. Ponded disk (0.002 m(2)) and ring infiltrometers (0.07 m(2)) were used at the small scales and rainfall simulations (3 m(2)) and small catchments (ca 3000 m(2)) at the larger scales. We compared (K-S) over bar between methods measured at the same time and place. Disk and ring infiltrometer measurements had on average 4.8 times higher values of (K-S) over bar than rainfall simulations and catchment-scale estimates. Furthermore, the distribution of K-s was not clearly log-normal and scale-independent, as supposed in the conceptual model. In our interpretation, water repellency and preferential flow paths increase the variance of the measured distribution of K-s and bias ponding toward areas of very low K-s during rainfall simulations and small catchment runoff events while areas with high preferential flow capacity remain water supply-limited more than the conceptual model of K-e predicts. The study highlights problems in the current theory of scaling runoff generation.

AB Based on the back analysis of equivalent continuum theory in frcatued media by Snow (1969), an equivalent fracture network model is proposed to evaluate steady seepage problems with free surface in porous media. In contrast to the continuum-based approaches on seepage flow, the continuum is replaced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures. The relationships between the permeability coefficients of porous media and equivalent parameters of fracture dip, spacing and aperture are deduced. The corresponding governing equations and finite element procedure according to the variational inequality theory are developed. Through good agreements of free surface locations between the proposed method, numerical data and field measurement in four typical examples, the proposed equivalent fracture network model is validated in modelling free surface flow in porous media. The solutions on the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams show that the proposed model has weak sensitivity of the fracture dip and mesh size, and its equivalence to the continuumbased method is also proved. In addition, the proposed model can be successfully used for the fractured media as well as porous media, the fracture direction has a significant impact on the free surface flow behavior in the fractured media, in which the fracture directions are negative for the antidip slope and positive for the dip slope to drain ground water. Finally, the results from the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model in complex dam engineerings with isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneity media.

AB In this paper, we use a physical modeling approach to explore the effect of lateral confinement on gravel bed river planform style, bed morphology, and sediment transport processes. A set of 27 runs was performed in a large flume (25 m long, 2.9 m wide), with constant longitudinal slope (0.01) and uniform grain size (1 mm), changing the water discharge (1.5-2.5 L/s) and the channel width (0.15-1.5 m) to model a wide range of channel configurations, from narrow, straight, embanked channels to wide braided networks. The outcomes of each run were characterized by a detailed digital elevation model describing channel morphology, a map of dry areas and areas actively transporting sediment within the channel, and continuous monitoring of the amount of sediment transported through the flume outlet. Analysis reveals strong relationships between unit stream power and parameters describing the channel morphology. In particular, a smooth transition is observed between narrow channels with an almost rectangular cross-section profile (with sediment transport occurring across the entire channel width) and complex braided networks where only a limited proportion (30%) of the bed is active. This transition is captured by descriptors of the bed elevation frequency distribution, e.g., standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. These summary statistics represent potentially useful indicators of bed morphology that are compared with other commonly used summary indicators such as the braiding index and the type and number of bars.

AB Dams affect ecosystems, but their physical link to the variations in fluvial fluxes and downstream ecological consequences are inadequately understood. After estimating the current effects of the Three Gorges project and other reservoirs upstream on the Yangtze River on the fluvial phosphorus (P) in the middle and lower Yangtze River, we further investigated the long-term effects of dams on the fluvial regimes of P and P-enriched sediment (PES). Simultaneously measured P distributions with sediment size (PDSS) from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) proved that the areal density of particulate P (PP) bound on graded sediment can be measured using the surface area concentration of the total sediment. A PDSS relationship is obtained and the selective transport and long-term sedimentation of P are simulated using a nonuniform suspended sediment model, which incorporates the PDSS formula. The computations revealed that a reservoir would significantly lower the downstream availability of P in the dry season and promote high pulses of P in summer when the reservoir is flushed as sedimentation accumulates. As a result, the P buffering and replenishing mechanism in the pristine ecosystem from upstream supplies and local re-suspension are permanently eliminated when a regulating reservoir is built upstream. This change is irreversible if reservoir regulation continues. Changes could potentially aggravate the existing P-limitation, decrease the water's ability to adjust nutrient/pollutant fluctuations, accumulate a greater surplus of carbon and nitrogen, and even exacerbate blooms in favorable conditions.

AB Hydraulic conductivity is one of the most critical and at the same time one of the most uncertain parameters in many groundwater models. One problem commonly faced is that the data are usually not collected at the same scale as the discretized elements used in a numerical model. Moreover, it is common that different types of hydraulic conductivity measurements, corresponding to different spatial scales, coexist in a studied domain, which have to be integrated simultaneously. Here we address this issue in the context of Image Quilting, one of the recently developed multiple-point geostatistics methods. Based on a training image that represents fine-scale spatial variability, we use the simplified renormalization upscaling method to obtain a series of upscaled training images that correspond to the different scales at which measurements are available. We then apply Image Quilting with such a multiscale training image to be able to incorporate simultaneously conditioning data at several spatial scales of heterogeneity. The realizations obtained satisfy the conditioning data exactly across all scales, but it can come at the expense of a small approximation in the representation of the physical scale relationships. In order to mitigate this approximation, we iteratively apply a kriging-based correction to the finest scale that ensures local conditioning at the coarsest scales. The method is tested on a series of synthetic examples where it gives good results and shows potential for the integration of different measurement methods in real-case hydrogeological models.

AB This research systematically analyzed the influence of antecedent soil wetness, rainfall depth, and the subsequent impact on peak flows in a 45 km(2) watershed. Peak flows increased with increasing antecedent wetness and rainfall depth, with the highest peak flows occurring under intense precipitation on wet soils. Flood mitigation structures were included and investigated under full and empty initial storage conditions. Peak flows were reduced at the outlet of the watershed by 3-17%. The highest peak flow reductions occurred in scenarios with dry soil, empty project storage, and low rainfall depths. These analyses showed that with increased rainfall depth, antecedent moisture conditions became increasingly less impactful. Scaling invariance of peak discharges were shown to hold true within this basin and were fit through ordinary least squares regression for each design scenario. Scale-invariance relationships were extrapolated beyond the outlet of the analyzed basin to the point of intersection of with and without structure scenarios. In each scenario extrapolated peak discharge benefits depreciated at a drainage area of approximately 100 km2. The associated drainage area translated to roughly 2 km downstream of the Beaver Creek watershed outlet. This work provides an example of internal watershed benefits of structural flood mitigation efforts, and the impact the may exert outside of the basin. Additionally, the influence of $1.8 million in flood reduction tools was not sufficient to routinely address downstream flood concerns, shedding light on the additional investment required to alter peak flows in large basins.

AB A topographic index (flood descriptor) that combines the scaling of bankfull depth with morphology was shown to describe the tendency of an area to be flooded. However, this approach depends on the quality and availability of flood maps and assumes that outcomes can be directly extrapolated and downscaled. This work attempts to relax these problems and answer two questions: (1) Can functional relationships be established between a flood descriptor and geomorphic and climatic-hydrologic catchment characteristics? (2) If so, can they be used for low-complexity predictive modeling of envelope flood extents? Linear stepwise and random forest regressions are developed based on classification outcomes of a flood descriptor, using high-resolution flood modeling results as training benchmarks, and on catchment characteristics. Elementary catchments of four river basins in Europe (Thames, Weser, Rhine, and Danube) serve as training data set, while those of the Rhone river basin in Europe serve as testing data set. Two return periods are considered, the 10- and 10,000-year. Prediction of envelope flood extents and flood-prone areas show that both models achieve high hit rates with respect to testing benchmarks. Average values were found to be above 60% and 80% for the 10- and the 10,000-year return periods, respectively. In spite of a moderate to high false discovery rate, the critical success index value was also found to be moderate to high. It is shown that by relating classification outcomes to catchment characteristics, the prediction of envelope flood extents may be achieved for a given region, including ungauged basins.

AB A major challenge in critical zone science is to understand and predict the interaction between above-ground and below-ground ecohydrologic processes. One process that facilitates this connection is hydraulic redistribution, a phenomenon by which roots serve as preferential pathways for water movement from wet to dry soil layers. We use a multilayer canopy model in conjunction with experimental data to quantify the influence of hydraulic redistribution on ecohydrologic processes in order to characterize the competitive and facilitative interaction between mesquite trees and bunchgrasses in a semiarid savanna. Both measured and simulated results show that hydraulic descent dominates during the wet monsoon season, whereas hydraulic lift occurs between precipitation events. For 2015 year-long simulation, we find about 17% of precipitation is absorbed as soil moisture, with the rest of the precipitation returning to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration. In the wet season, 13% of precipitation is transferred to deep soil (>1.5 m) through roots, and in the dry season, 9% of this redistributed water is then transported back to shallow soil depths (<0.5 m). Assuming water supplied through hydraulic redistribution is well-mixed with moisture transported directly through the soil matrix and supports vegetation evapotranspiration, hydraulic redistribution supports 47% of mesquite transpiration and 9% of understory transpiration. Through modeling and experimental synthesis, this study demonstrates that in semiarid savanna ecosystems, mesquite exhibits a competitive advantage over understory bunchgrass through hydraulic redistribution. This analysis evaluates the relationship between two coexisting vegetation types that could be expanded to multiple vegetation species sharing resources in an ecosystem.

AB Stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations display high spatial and temporal variation in boreal catchments. Understanding and predicting these patterns is a challenge with great implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates. Although several biogeochemical models have been used to estimate stream water DOC dynamics, model biases common during both rain and snowmelt-driven events. The parsimonious DOC-model, K-DOC, with 10 calibrated parameters, uses a nonlinear discharge and catchment water storage relationship including soil temperature dependencies of DOC release and consumption. K-DOC was used to estimate the stream water DOC concentrations over 5 years for eighteen nested boreal catchments having total area of 68 km(2) (varying from 0.04 to 67.9 km(2)). The model successfully simulated DOC concentrations during base flow conditions, as well as, hydrological events in catchments dominated by organic and mineral soils reaching NSEs from 0.46 to 0.76. Our semimechanistic model was parsimonious enough to have all parameters estimated using statistical methods. We did not find any clear differences between forest and mire-dominated catchments that could be explained by soil type or tree species composition. However, parameters controlling slow release and consumption of DOC from soil water behaved differently for small head-water catchments (less than 2 km(2)) than for those that integrate larger areas of different ecosystem types (1068 km(2)). Our results emphasize that it is important to account for nonlinear dependencies of both, soil temperature, and catchment water storage, when simulating DOC dynamics of boreal catchments.

AB An entropy-based method is developed to estimate estuarine river discharge from surface velocity measurements. A two-dimensional velocity profile based on the principle of maximum entropy is employed to express the mean velocity as a function of average surface velocity. The entropy-based flow profile is parameterized by the location of maximum velocity in the channel and the shape of the velocity distribution. The entropy parameters are quantified over the tidal cycle to account for the unsteady nature of estuarine flow. The method was tested using experiments conducted at the Danshui River, the largest estuarine system in Taiwan. Surface velocities were measured using an Automated River-Estuary Discharge Imaging System (AREDIS), and full-channel velocity profiles were measured with a moving-boat ADP survey. Entropy parameters were calibrated over the tidal cycle and linearly correlated with the average surface velocity to facilitate estimation from AREDIS measurements. The discharge calculated from average surface velocity and entropy relationships exhibits a 7.7% relative error compared to the ADP velocity profiles. The error nearly doubles when the mean values for entropy parameters are used instead of the variable parameters, indicating the importance of accounting for the unsteady nature of estuarine flows. Furthermore, the effects of measurement coverage area, types of entropy distribution, and wind-induced drift current on the surface velocity-based discharge measurement are evaluated and discussed. Overall, surface velocity measurements in conjunction with the entropy profiles well represent the flow in a complex estuarine environment to provide a reliable estimate of discharge.

AB A lack of empirical evidence impedes assessment of the spatial and temporal extent of critical conditions for recurring high turbidity in large wind-exposed shallow lakes. Here spatiotemporal variation in total suspended matter (TSM) concentration was captured by processing 30 Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images of a shallow lake (Markermeer) with a spectral matching algorithm. The TSM maps showed elevated downwind concentrations for moderate winds (from 4 to 9 m s(-1)), which occur 68% of the time. Regressions confirmed the relationship between hourly averaged wind speed and TSM. To explore critical conditions for resuspension, wind speed, linear fetch, and water depth were combined in a spatial model based on simplified linear wave equations. Remotely sensed TSM patterns matched predicted areas of resuspension from these wave equations. On average, over 70% of cells were true positive or negative, with elevated TSM matching the predicted resuspending bottom area and background TSM matching no resuspension. Images acquired during moderate winds register local resuspension. This implies that under these conditions, a critical shear stress threshold for resuspension is passed, followed by upward mixing over the few meters of water column. Images acquired during low wind speeds (<= 3 m s(-1)) either do not show a TSM pattern or display settling because it takes several hours of low wind before all particles are removed from the visible top layer. Because of the good spatial matching, the resuspension model can also be used for future verification of the retrieval capacity of the spectral matching algorithm.

TI Effects of watershed land use and geomorphology on stream low flows

AB Land use and physiographic variability influence stream low flows, yet their interactions and relative influence remain unresolved. Our objective was to assess the influence of land use and watershed geomorphic characteristics on low-flow variability in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and Georgia. Ten minute interval discharge data for 35 streams (in watersheds from 3 to 146 km(2)) were measured for two late summer low-flow seasons, coinciding with a severe drought period in the southeastern United States. Three low-flow metrics were calculated (1 and 7 day minimum flows and 1st percentile flow) for each low-flow season (5 August to 12 November 2007 and 1 August to 12 November 2008). A comprehensive suite of watershed characteristics, including factors of topography, channel network morphometry, soils, land use, and precipitation were used in multiple regression analysis of low-flow variability among the 35 watersheds. Additionally, low flows in groups of lower-and higher-forest cover watersheds were compared. Drainage density, areal coverage of colluvium, topographic variability (as slope standard deviation), and percent of the channel network as first order stream emerged as the most important variables for explaining low-flow variability. Watershed forest cover demonstrated a consistent, significant positive relationship with low flows, despite the higher evapotranspiration rates associated with forest compared with other land covers and despite the relatively small range of disturbance in this study area. This highlights the importance of infiltration and recharge under undisturbed land cover in sustaining low flows, and it bears noteworthy implications for environmental flows and water resource sustainability.

TI Snapshot selection for groundwater model reduction using proper
   orthogonal decomposition
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COHERENT STRUCTURES; ORDER REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT
AB [1] Water resources systems management often requires complex mathematical models whose use may be computationally infeasible for many advanced analyses, e. g., optimization, data assimilation, model uncertainty, etc. The computational demand of these analyses can be reduced by approximating the model with a simpler reduced model. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is an efficient model reduction technique based on the projection of the original model onto a subspace generated by full-model snapshots. In order to implement this method, an appropriate number of snapshots of the full model must be taken at the appropriate times such that the resulting reduced model is as accurate as possible. Since confined aquifers reach steady state in an exponential manner, we present a simple exponential function that can be used to select snapshots for these types of models. This selection method is then employed to determine the optimal snapshot set for a unit, dimensionless model. The optimal snapshot set is found by maximizing the minimum eigenvalue of the snapshot covariance matrix, a criterion similar to those used in experimental design. The resulting snapshot set can then be translated to any complex, real world model based on a simple, approximate relationship between dimensionless and real-world times. This translation is illustrated using a basin scale model of Central Veneto, Italy. We show that this method is very easy to implement and produces an accurate reduced model that, in the case of Central Veneto, Italy, runs approximately 1,000 times faster than the full model.

AB A small research watershed in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire was equipped with a spatially distributed instrument network designed to continuously monitor hydrometric responses in the shallow subsurface. We analyzed rainfall events during seasonal wet up from late summer through autumn to investigate the mechanisms of runoff generation and the patterns of rainfall-runoff response at the catchment outlet. Our results show that storm quick flow depths displayed a threshold relationship with two independently measured soil moisture indices: a maximum water table height index and the sum of gross precipitation and antecedent soil moisture. Quick flow depths during events with below-threshold criteria were not significantly correlated with either index, while quick flow depths during events with above-threshold criteria were strongly correlated with both indices (r >= 0.98). The effective runoff contributing area (estimated by event runoff ratios) also changed significantly between above-and below-threshold conditions, as did the synchronicity between groundwater fluctuations and streamflow. Below the threshold, we inferred that catchment runoff was generated primarily in the near-stream zones, while above the threshold the contributing area likely expanded laterally onto neighboring hillslopes. Our results show that the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity appeared to increase significantly during runoff events with above-threshold conditions, possibly owing to water tables rising into highly transmissive near-surface soils. We believe the observed threshold pattern may partially be explained as a transmissivity feedback mechanism and/or preferential flows through macropore networks which allowed for a rapid expansion of the runoff contributing area onto hillslopes, resulting in increased runoff yields.

AB Percolation of fine sediment is a common process in gravel bed rivers, which often exhibit extended and overlapping grain size distributions of the bed and the supplied fine sediment. Yet existing sediment infiltration theory assumes well-sorted fine material with smaller grain size than the bed pores, and as such, is not suitable for many situations encountered in gravel bed streams. Previous developments for infiltration of uniform material are here generalized to consider poorly sorted sediment mixtures. Governing equations and a numerical solution to model the vertical distribution of infiltrating sediment are presented. The equations are solved as a function of a trapping coefficient, dependent on the relative size of infiltrating fines in relation to bed material. A method is developed to generate equivalent grain size distributions to calculate the trapping coefficient, when grain sizes of the infiltrating and bed materials overlap. Moreover, a bed cutoff size is defined and computed with a semiempirical packing-porosity model, to distinguish particles smaller than the bed pores. Published experimental data are used to test the new model and calibrate the trapping coefficient. It is shown that this coefficient is highly sensible to the fine and coarse tails of fine and coarse materials grain size distributions. Accordingly, calibrated values of the coefficient are set as a function of a mean size ratio, computed from the geometric mean of the tails of the size distributions. Incorporating this relation, the model performed well in reproducing indirect observations of sediment infiltration from experiments reported in the literature.

AB Knowledge of hydrological model complexity can aid selection of an optimal prediction model out of a set of available models. Optimal model selection is formalized as selection of the least complex model out of a subset of models that have lower empirical risk. This may be considered equivalent to minimizing an upper bound on prediction error, defined here as the mathematical expectation of empirical risk. In this paper, we derive an upper bound that is free from assumptions on data and underlying process distribution as well as on independence of model predictions over time. We demonstrate that hydrological model complexity, as defined in the presented theoretical framework, plays an important role in determining the upper bound. The model complexity also acts as a stabilizer to a hydrological model selection problem if it is deemed ill-posed. We provide an algorithm for computing complexity of any arbitrary hydrological model. We also demonstrate that hydrological model complexity has a geometric interpretation as the size of model output space. The presented theory is applied to quantify complexities of two hydrological model structures: SAC-SMA and SIXPAR. It detects that SAC-SMA is indeed more complex than SIXPAR. We also develop an algorithm to estimate the upper bound on prediction error, which is applied on five different rainfall-runoff model structures that vary in complexity. We show that a model selection problem is stabilized by regularizing it with model complexity. Complexity regularized model selection yields models that are robust in predicting future but yet unseen data.

AB Climate change impact assessment on water resources with downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) simulation output is characterized by uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge about the underlying geophysical processes of global change ( GCM uncertainties) and due to uncertain future scenarios ( scenario uncertainties). Disagreement between different GCMs and scenarios in regional climate change impact studies indicates that overreliance on a single GCM with a scenario could lead to inappropriate planning and adaptation responses. This paper focuses on modeling GCM and scenario uncertainty using possibility theory in projecting streamflow of Mahanadi river, at Hirakud, India. A downscaling method based on fuzzy clustering and Relevance Vector Machine ( RVM) is applied to project monsoon streamflow from three GCMs with two green house emission scenarios. Possibilities are assigned to all the GCMs with scenarios based on their performance in modeling the streamflow of the recent past ( 1991 - 2005), when there are signals of climate forcing. The possibilities associated with different GCMs and scenarios are used as weights in computing the possibilistic mean of the CDFs projected for three standard time slices 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The result shows that the value of streamflow at which the CDF reaches 1 reduces with time, which shows the reduction in probability of occurrence of extreme high flow events in future. Historic record of monsoon streamflow of Mahanadi river also shows similar decreasing trend, which may be due to the effect of high surface warming. Reduction in Mahandai streamflow is likely to pose a major challenge for water resources engineers in meeting water demands in future.

AB Fluid injection and withdrawal in a porous medium create changes in pore pressure that alter effective stresses within the medium. This leads to pore volume changes, which can be described by the poroelastic theory. These changes in pore volume can influence fluid flow processes, such as capillary diffusion and imbibition, potentially altering multiphase flow characteristics in subsurface reservoirs with a focus on oil recovery in the naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs. In this study, a semi-analytical model is developed to analyze the impact of stress-dependent spontaneous imbibition. The model allows us to study the influence of stress-dependent effects on porosity, absolute permeability, relative permeability, and capillary pressure on the imbibition and oil recovery mechanisms of both intact rock and fracture in naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs. In order to capture the geomechanical interactions involved, pure compliance poroelastic definitions and nonlinear joint normal stiffness equations are used to assess the deformation of intact rock and fracture, respectively. The model shows that increasing effective confining stress shifts the imbibition capillary pressure curve upward, resulting in improved absorption of the wetting phase into the smaller pores and enhanced extraction of the nonwetting phase. Model calculations provide a rationale for how and why irreducible water saturation increases during compression of mixed-wet carbonates and decreases in the case of initially strong water-wet carbonates. It is also shown how higher relative permeability of the wetting phase leads to a greater diffusion of the wetting phase and improved oil recovery for the less deformed mixed-wet rock.

AB Hydrology is an integrative discipline linking the broad array of water-related research with physical, ecological, and social sciences. The increasing breadth of hydrological research, often where subdisciplines of hydrology partner with related sciences, reflects the central importance of water to environmental science, while highlighting the fractured nature of the discipline itself. This lack of coordination among hydrologic subdisciplines has hindered the development of hydrologic theory and integrated models capable of predicting hydrologic partitioning across time and space. The recent development of the concept of the critical zone (CZ), an open system extending from the top of the canopy to the base of groundwater, brings together multiple hydrological subdisciplines with related physical and ecological sciences. Observations obtained by CZ researchers provide a diverse range of complementary process and structural data to evaluate both conceptual and numerical models. Consequently, a cross-site focus on critical zone hydrology has potential to advance the discipline of hydrology and to facilitate the transition of CZ observatories into a research network with immediate societal relevance. Here we review recent work in catchment hydrology and hydrochemistry, hydrogeology, and ecohydrology that highlights a common knowledge gap in how precipitation is partitioned in the critical zone: how is the amount, routing, and residence time of water in the subsurface related to the biogeophysical structure of the CZ? Addressing this question will require coordination among hydrologic subdisciplines and interfacing sciences, and catalyze rapid progress in understanding current CZ structure and predicting how climate and land cover changes will affect hydrologic partitioning.

AB [1] This contribution reviews recent findings that illuminate the processes governing colloid retention in porous media under environmentally relevant conditions. In the environment, colloids act as conveyors of contaminants, or even as contaminants themselves; however, despite decades of research, we are unable to accurately predict the retention of colloids in granular aquifer media under environmental conditions, where repulsion exists between colloids and surfaces. This failure cannot be blamed solely on the complexities of the subsurface, since colloid filtration theory (CFT) works well in the absence of colloid-collector repulsion despite its idealization of porous media as consisting of spherical grains completely surrounded by fluid envelopes. Rather, the failure of CFT stems from failure to incorporate the correct mechanisms of retention when repulsion exists. Recent observations implicate wedging in grain-to-grain contacts and retention in secondary energy minima as dominant mechanisms of colloid retention in the presence of an energy barrier. Mechanistic simulations in unit cells containing grain-to-grain contacts corroborate these mechanisms of colloid retention. The resulting concept for colloid retention in the presence of an energy barrier involves translation of colloids across the collector surfaces until they become wedged within grain-to-grain contacts, or are retained via secondary energy minima ( without attachment) in zones where the balance of fluid drag, diffusion, gravitational, and colloid-collector interaction forces allow retention. The above findings highlight the pore domain geometry as a dominant governor of colloid retention in so far as the geometry gives rise to grain-to-grain contacts and zones of relatively low fluid drag.

AB Simplification is an unavoidable aspect of model usage. Even complex, physically based models are simplifications of reality. More profound simplification is required to construct the lumped parameter models of semiphysical basis that are often employed for simulation of large-scale processes operative over one or many watersheds. Simplification can lead to model predictive error beyond that which would be expected on the basis of study-area information deficits alone. Building on a recently developed mathematical description of the model simplification process, this work employs linear subspace methods to analyze in detail the nature and ramifications of that process when applied to a 1-D, Richards equation-based unsaturated zone model used to predict recharge to a groundwater system. Two simplified versions of this model are examined. The first achieves simplification through assuming vertical parameter uniformity. The second achieves simplification through use of a lumped parameter model in place of the Richards equation-based model. Relationships between parameters employed by the complex model and those used by each of the simplified models are analyzed. The nature of predictive errors incurred through simplification is explored. Also explored is the ability of the calibration process to decrease the propensity for model error in making some predictions, while increasing the propensity for model error in the making of others (an outcome that may be considered counterintuitive from a Bayesian perspective, but which is a natural consequence of suboptimal simplification).

AB Repeatable snow depth patterns have been identified in many regions between years with similar meteorological characteristics. This suggests that snow patterns from previous years could adjust snow deposition in space as a substitution for unmodeled snow processes. Here, we tested a pattern-based snow deposition downscaling routine which assumes (a) a spatially consistent relationship between snow deposition and snow depth, (b) interannually repeatable snow patterns, and (c) unbiased mean snowfall. We investigated these assumptions, and future avenues for improvement, in water-year 2014 over the California Tuolumne River Watershed. 6 km snowfall from an atmospheric model was downscaled to 25 m resolution using snow depth patterns from seven different years, and was compared to a more common terrain-based downscaling method. Snow depth patterns were influenced not only by snow accumulation, but also snowmelt, snow sublimation, and snow density, resulting in pattern-based snow deposition downscaling that was too spatially heterogeneous. However, snow depth simulated using terrain-based downscaling was too spatially homogeneous, and less spatially correlated with observations (r = 0.27), than simulations with pattern-based downscaling using snow depth patterns from the simulation season (r = 0.76), or from a different year (r = 0.52). Overall, modeled snow depth errors at peak-snowpack timing were driven more by atmospheric model snowfall biases than different downscaling methods. In order of most- to least-importance, future research should focus on bias-correcting coarse-scale snowfall estimates, correcting snow deposition patterns for winter snow losses and snow density spatial variability, and identifying the historic periods of most-similar snow accumulation.

AB The interleaving of impermeable and permeable surfaces along a runoff flow path controls the hillslope hydrograph, the spatial pattern of infiltration, and the distribution of flow velocities in landscapes dominated by overland flow. Predictions of the relationship between the pattern of (im)permeable surfaces and hydrological outcomes tend to fall into two categories: (i) generalized metrics of landscape pattern, often referred to as connectivity metrics, and (ii) direct simulation of specific hillslopes. Unfortunately, the success of using connectivity metrics for prediction is mixed, while direct simulation approaches are computationally expensive and hard to generalize. Here we present a new approach for prediction based on emulation of a coupled Saint Venant equation-Richards equation model with random forest regression. The emulation model predicts infiltration and peak flow velocities for every location on a hillslope with an arbitrary spatial pattern of impermeable and permeable surfaces but fixed soil, slope, and storm properties. It provides excellent fidelity to the physically based model predictions and is generalizable to novel spatial patterns. The spatial pattern features that explain most of the hydrological variability are not stable across different soils, slopes, and storms, potentially explaining some of the difficulties associated with direct use of spatial metrics for predicting landscape function. Although the current emulator relies on strong assumptions, including smooth topography, binary permeability fields, and only a small collection of soils, slope, and storm scenarios, it offers a promising way forward for applications in dryland and urban settings and in supporting the development of potential connectivity indices.

AB Catchment storage sustains ecologically important low flows in headwater systems. Understanding the factors controlling storage is essential in analysis of catchment vulnerability to global change. We calculated catchment storage and storage sensitivity of streamflow for 61 boreal headwater catchments in Finland. We also explored the connection between computed storage indices and low flow conditions. The relationships between selected climate, snow, and catchment characteristics and calculated storage properties and low flows were investigated, in order to assess the importance of different factors that render catchments vulnerable to climate and environmental change. We found that the most sensitive areas to climate change were located in the southern boreal coastal zone, with fine-grained soils and agricultural areas. In contrast, catchments in the middle and northern boreal zone, with till and peatland soils and higher snow water equivalent values, were less sensitive under current conditions. In addition, we found a threshold at a snow to precipitation ratio of 0.35. Above that threshold, summer low flows were generally sensitive to changes in snow conditions, whereas below that threshold catchment characteristics gained importance and the sensitivity was more directly related to changes in temperature and timing of rainfall. These findings suggest that a warming climate will have pronounced impacts on hydrology and catchment sensitivity related to snow quantity and snow cover duration in certain snow to precipitation ratio zones. Moreover, land use activities had an impact on storage properties in agricultural and drained peatland areas, resulting in a negative effect on low flows.

AB Spatiotemporal behaviors of meteorological droughts are basic for understanding the development and driving forces of droughts. Currently, there are a limited number of approaches mainly used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale soil moisture/hydrological drought events at global or continental scales. These behavior description approaches on the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought are not perfect and should be improved further. To this end, a new approach was proposed to investigate the migration of meteorological droughts based on topological spatial relations. It was used to identify drought clusters, migration trajectories, and migration directions of meteorological droughts. In the Poyang Lake basin (24 degrees 29' to 30 degrees 04'N, 113 degrees 34' to 118 degrees 28'E), China, monthly precipitation data were available from 1960 to 2007. The one-month standardized precipitation index was used to characterize meteorological droughts. The proposed approach identified a total of 77 drought events and 454 drought clusters during the study period. Their drought centroids were tracked and analyzed. The migration distances of drought events exhibited a significant linear relationship with the drought duration (R-2 > 0.8, slope of 165 km per month). More than 70% of drought events had a migrating displacement greater than 1 degrees (approximately 100 km). These results indicated that the meteorological drought events traveled actively and occurred on a widespread basis in the basin. Moreover, two main patterns of drought cluster migration (northward and southward) were identified. The approach and findings can provide some important implications to investigate the migration of meteorological droughts in other regions.

AB To better address the dynamic interactions between human and hydrologic systems, we develop an integrated modeling framework that employs a System of Systems optimization model to emulate human development decisions which are then incorporated into a watershed model to estimate the resulting hydrologic impacts. The two models are run interactively to simulate the coevolution of coupled human-nature systems, such that reciprocal feedbacks between hydrologic processes and human decisions (i.e., human impacts on critical low flows and hydrologic impacts on human decisions on land and water use) can be assessed. The framework is applied to a Midwestern U.S. agricultural watershed, in the context of proposed biofuels development. This operation is illustrated by projecting three possible future coevolution trajectories, two of which use dedicated biofuel crops to reduce annual watershed nitrate export while meeting ethanol production targets. Imposition of a primary external driver (biofuel mandate) combined with different secondary drivers (water quality targets) results in highly nonlinear and multiscale responses of both the human and hydrologic systems, including multiple tradeoffs, impacting the future coevolution of the system in complex, heterogeneous ways. The strength of the hydrologic response is sensitive to the magnitude of the secondary driver; 45% nitrate reduction target leads to noticeable impacts at the outlet, while a 30% reduction leads to noticeable impacts that are mainly local. The local responses are conditioned by previous human-hydrologic modifications and their spatial relationship to the new biofuel development, highlighting the importance of past coevolutionary history in predicting future trajectories of change.

AB Recent hydrologic synthesis efforts have presented evidence that the seasonal water balance is at the core of overall catchment responses, and understanding it will assist in predicting signatures of streamflow variability at other time scales, including interannual variability, the flow duration curve, low flows, and floods. In this study, we group 321 catchments located across the continental U. S. into several clusters with similar seasonal water balance behavior. We then delineate the boundaries between these clusters on the basis of a similarity framework based on three hydroclimatic indices that represent aridity, precipitation timing, and snowiness. The clustering of catchments based on the seasonal water balance has a strong relationship not only with regional patterns of the three climate indices but also with regional ecosystem, soil, and vegetation classes, which point to the strong dependence of these physiographic characteristics on seasonal climate variations and the hydrologic regimes. Building on these catchment clusters, we demonstrate that the seasonal water balance does have an imprint on signatures of streamflow variability over a wide range of time scales (daily to decadal) and a wide range of states (low flows to floods). The seasonal water balance is well integrated into variability at seasonal and longer time scales, but is only partly reflected in the signatures at shorter time scales, including flooding responses. Overall, the seasonal water balance has proven to be a similarity measure that serves as a link between both short-term hydrologic responses and long-term adaptation of the landscape with climate.

AB Remote sensing offers an efficient means of mapping bathymetry in river systems, but this approach has been applied primarily to clear-flowing, gravel bed streams. This study used field spectroscopy and radiative transfer modeling to assess the feasibility of spectrally based depth retrieval in a sand-bed river with a higher suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and greater water turbidity. Attenuation of light within the water column was characterized by measuring the amount of downwelling radiant energy at different depths and calculating a diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d. Attenuation was strongest in blue and near-infrared bands due to scattering by suspended sediment and absorption by water, respectively. Even for red wavelengths with the lowest values of K-d, only a small fraction of the incident light propagated to the bed, restricting the range of depths amenable to remote sensing. Spectra recorded above the water surface were used to establish a strong, linear relationship (R-2 = 0.949) between flow depth and a simple band ratio; even under moderately turbid conditions, depth remained the primary control on reflectance. Constraints on depth retrieval were examined via numerical modeling of radiative transfer within the atmosphere and water column. SSC and sensor radiometric resolution limited both the maximum detectable depth and the precision of image-derived depth estimates. Thus, although field spectra indicated that the bathymetry of turbid channels could be remotely mapped, model results implied that depth retrieval in sediment-laden rivers would be limited to shallow depths (on the order of 0.5 m) and subject to a significant degree of uncertainty.

AB Growing season soil CO2 efflux is known to vary laterally by as much as seven fold within small subalpine watersheds (< 5 km(2)), and such degree of variability has been strongly related to the landscape-imposed redistribution of soil water. Current empirical or process models offer low potential to simulate this variability or to simulate watershed-scale dynamics of soil CO2 efflux. We modified an existing process soil CO2 production and efflux model to include spatially variable soil moisture, and applied it to a well-studied and moderately complex watershed of the northern Rocky Mountains. We started at the point scale and progressively modeled processes up to the watershed scale. We corroborated model performance using an independent data set of soil CO2 efflux measurements from 53 sites distributed across the 393 ha watershed. Our approach (1) simulated the seasonality of soil CO2 efflux at riparian sites; (2) reproduced short-term (diel) dynamics of soil CO2 concentration ([CO2]) at riparian sites, particularly observed hysteresis patterns in the soil [CO2]-soil temperature relationship; and (3) simulated growing season estimates of soil CO2 efflux at dry sites across the landscape (98% of area). Model limitations included poor simulation of growing season (cumulative) soil CO2 efflux at sites with a large drainage area, likely as a result of poorly modeled soil water content and challenges in parametrization of root and microbial activities. Our study provides important insight into coupling hydrological and biogeochemical models at landscape scales, and highlights the role of landscape structure and heterogeneity when modeling spatial variability of biogeochemical processes.

AB Changes in both climate and vegetation may dramatically impact the amount of water stored in seasonal snow cover and the timing of spring snowmelt. This study quantifies how spatial variability in solar radiation affects the spatial and temporal patterns in snow water equivalent (SWE), snow chemistry, and snow water isotopes in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico. Depth, density, stratigraphy, temperature, and snow samples were collected approximately monthly from five locations between January and April 2007 to quantify the effects of solar forcing on snowpack water and chemical balance. Locations varied in solar forcing due to topography and vegetation, while minimizing variability in precipitation, elevation, aspect, interception, and wind redistribution. Snowfall (340 +/- 5 mm) was similar across all sites, but peak SWE at maximum accumulation ranged from 187 to 340 mm. Solute concentrations were highest directly under canopies, intermediate in nonshaded forest openings, and lowest in shaded forest openings. Conservative solute concentrations (SO42-, R-2 = 0.80), Cl- (R-2 = 0.60), and isotope values (delta O-18 R-2 = 0.96) were inversely related to SWE at maximum accumulation. Mass balance estimates of snowpack water balance using solute concentrations and isotopes indicated that sublimation ranged from <2% to similar to 20% of winter precipitation, consistent with previous studies at the site. The strong relationships between solar forcing, SWE, and chemistry suggest that snow chemistry at maximum accumulation can be used to estimate overwinter sublimation. Furthermore, variability in solar forcing also can be used to refine spatial estimates of catchment solute and isotope input at melt.

AB The Penman-Monteith equation is often used to estimate transpiration, but an important limitation to this approach, especially for mountainous forested sites, is an accurate estimate of canopy conductance averaged over the area of interest (G(s)). We propose a method for estimating watershed-scale transpiration using estimates of G(s) derived from measurements of stable isotopes. To estimate G(s), we first determined the isotopic composition of ecosystem respiration (delta C-13(ER)) as derived from the C-12:C-13 ratio of respired CO2 entrained within nocturnal cold air drainage flows exiting the base of the watershed. An isotope-derived estimate of recent canopy conductance over the entire watershed (G(s-I)) was derived using biophysical models. To estimate daily average transpiration, we applied G(s-I) and other measured environmental variables to the Penman-Monteith equation. The results were compared with an independent measure of transpiration using the heat dissipation method at four locations within the watershed. Considering the large number of assumptions required for both estimates of transpiration, the two estimates were remarkably similar. The relationship between the values derived by the two techniques was statistically significant (p value < 0.01), the slope of the line (slope = 1.7) was not statistically different from 1 (p value > 0.1), but the standard error was large (SE = 0.48). The results demonstrate that this technique holds promise, but the effects of potential limitations require further attention. The future research necessary to fully demonstrate the validity of this potentially promising method is discussed.

AB The intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of low streamflow events are often considered stationary in time. Given droughts are likely to become more frequent and extreme, here those IDFs are analyzed for their non-stationarity in relation to three climate drivers, namely, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Southern Annular Mode. For this, low flow events were identified for 161 unregulated catchments in Victoria, Australia. The relationship between the climate drivers and the IDFs were developed using covariate-based non-stationary statistical models. We found that several of these catchments exhibit strong non-stationary influences from the climate modes. Such catchments have a higher probability of experiencing more intense, prolonged, and/or frequent low flows when a dry phase of these climate drivers occurs. We found that catchments having strong evidence of non-stationary frequency (n = 77) were more compared to those having non-stationary intensity (n = 19) or duration (n = 34). Further, we derived projected indices of these climate drivers from CMIP5 models for the RCP8.5 scenario. These indicate an intensification in the dry phase of the climate drivers. Using information of the projected indices in the IDF models, we found that future dry phases of these climate drivers are likely to further increase the probability of experiencing higher magnitudes of low flow IDFs in catchments non-stationary in these characteristics in relation to one or more of these climate drivers. Frequency shows greater response to future dry phases of these drivers than intensity or duration of low flows.

AB Understanding suspended sediment dynamics and their driving factors is essential for effective watershed management. In this study, the spatiotemporal patterns of suspended sediment were identified for 11 sub-watersheds of the Goodwin Creek, Mississippi, USA, for the period 1982-2002 using wavelet transforms. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) results of streamflow time series showed that a near-continuous annual periodicity influenced all stations over the study period, yet an overall decline occurred in wavelet spectral power of sediment load during the 1990s. This decline in sediment load is a result of the indirect effect of decreased cultivation on reducing the rate of peak flow and thus fluvial erosion processes. The CWTs of fine sediment (clays and silts) concentration (FSC) time series showed that factors other than land-use (e.g., ponds, ephemeral gullies, and bed composition) better explain the variations in FSC. A comparison of CWTs of FSC at two stations with different bed composition in their channels showed that sandy channels are less responsive to erosion control measures compared to gravely channels indicating that they are major sources of sediment. A change in phase relationship between flow and FSC for the gravel-dominated channel was associated with the transition in upland land-use indicating a change in sediment supply mechanisms. The CWTs of sand concentrations reflected the spatiotemporal impact of bank materials, the growth cycle of riparian vegetation, and in-channel sand availability on sand dynamics. While CWT-based analysis is sensitive to input conditions, the method is able to provide valuable outcomes for distinguishing patterns in complex temporal datasets.

AB Water scarcity is a global risk that could arguably be mitigated by using water more efficiently, that is, increasing water's productivity. However, the effects of water productivity on water stress have not been empirically tested or validated across countries. Evidence from other natural resource sectors suggests that improving productivity may, in fact, lead to "rebound" effects that exacerbate resource exploitation. An econometric analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between water stress and productivity at the country level. A 1.0% increase in productivity is associated with a 0.81% decrease in water stress through time within a country, on average, and accounts for 75% of the variance of water stress. This suggests that targeting improvements in productivity have the ability to lower water stress. Analysis of trends in stress and productivity demonstrates that several developed countries are starting to exhibit decreasing trends in stress. Conversely, stress is low in developing countries, but rising. Productivity is generally increasing across all countries. Fixed effects panel regressions demonstrate that population, cultivated land, and political stability are also related to a variance in stress within a country. Differences in gross domestic product and precipitation explain variations in stress when looking across countries. The results of this analysis show that as a country develops, water stress is initially likely to increase. Increasing water productivity, which typically occurs later in a country's development pathway, is linked to decreasing stress, so water stress has the potential to be mitigated if a "productivity transition" were to take place sooner.

AB The pore-scale processes governing water drainage behavior in porous media have implications for geoscience multiphase scenarios including carbon capture and storage, contaminant site remediation, oil recovery, and vadose zone processes. However, few studies report directly observed pore-scale water drainage phenomena in 3-D soils. This knowledge gap limits our ability to verify assumptions underlying existing models and develop optimal solutions. This paper utilizes synchrotron X-ray microtomography to present an experimental pore-scale examination of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)/water distribution along a primary drainage front as dense NAPL was injected upward into water wetting (WW) and intermediate wetting (IW) sand-packed columns. Pore-network structures were extracted from imaged data sets and mapped onto segmented NAPL/water data sets which allowed quantitative examinations of wettability impacts on (a) the extent to which NAPL fills individual pore bodies and (b) relationships between pore size and the phase occupying the pore, with both considered as a function of distance (and capillary pressure) relative to the NAPL front. These results revealed that several hypotheses treating IW sand similarly to WW sands are simplistic. IW systems exhibited a sequence of pore filling that deviated from traditional capillary pressure-based model predictions: NAPL invades smaller pores, while larger, adjacent pores are bypassed leaving multipore residual water ganglia. NAPL pore saturations were close to 1 and did not change with capillary pressure in IW systems. Overall, the results illustrate how a relatively small change in operative contact angle alters NAPL distribution during water drainage, with important implications for geoscience multiphase flow scenarios.

AB Environmental models have become increasingly complex with greater attention being given to the spatially distributed representation of processes. Distributed models have large numbers of parameters to be specified, which is typically done either by recourse to a priori methods based on observable physical watershed characteristics, by calibration to watershed input-state-output data, or by some combination of both. In the case of calibration, the high dimensionality of the parameter search space poses a significant identifiability problem. This article discusses how this problem can be addressed, utilizing additional information about the parameters through a process known as regularization. Regularization, in its broadest sense, is a mathematical technique that utilizes additional information or constraints about the parameters to reduce problems related to over-parameterization. This article develops and applies a regularization approach to the calibration of a version of the Hydrology Laboratory Distributed Hydrologic Model ( HL-DHM) developed by the US National Weather Service. A priori parameter estimates derived using the approach by Koren et al. ( 2000) were used to develop regularization relationships to constrain the feasible parameter space and enable existing global optimization techniques to be applied to solve the calibration problem. In a case study for the Blue River basin, the number of unknowns to be estimated was reduced from 858 to 33, and this calibration strategy improved the model performance while preserving the physical realism of the model parameters. Our results also suggest that the commonly used parameter field "multiplier'' approach may often not be appropriate.

AB The impact of the timing of dust deposition on glacier runoff was evaluated using a glacier mass-balance model with a newly improved scheme to track a dusted layer in a snow layer of a glacier. The lowering of surface albedo due to the dusted layer appearing leads to a drastic increase of glacier runoff even under the same meteorological conditions. Calculations of seasonal sensitivity, the relationship between dusted date and resulting runoff, have shown that dust deposition during a melting season might cause a drastic mass outflow from a glacier through changing the surface albedo during the melting season.

AB The traditional viewpoint in hydrology and soil physics purports that water tables appearing in porous media described by Darcy's law and the extended Darcy's law arc not singular surfaces. Several particular solutions in which singularities occur are presented as counter-examples to the traditional viewpoint and as evidence supporting the new theory that waiter tables are generally singular surfaces.

AB Wildfire can induce an increase in infiltration excess overland flow, which varies from barely detectible to extreme. Soil properties are an important contributor to this variability. Several studies found that a landscape's aridity (the balance of energy and water) is strongly correlated with an increased quantity of post-wildfire overland flow, with burnt forests of higher aridity producing higher peak flow compared to wetter forests. Related process-based studies suggested that this relationship can be explained by an interaction between inherent soil macroporosity (varies inversely with aridity) and fire induced water repellency; soils of higher macro-porosity maintain high infiltration rates despite fire-enhanced water repellence. Although the observed post-wildfire runoff/aridity relationship has proven useful in mapping hydrological risk, its transferability is potentially limited for areas where other soil formation factors have greater influence. Here we propose that measurements related to landscape productivity may provide a mappable landscape metric that is based on soil formation processes that influence post-fire infiltration capacity and may provide a more robust and transferable proxy of fire induced hydrologic change. To test this hypothesis, post-wildfire runoff data from three new experimental sites with a coastal climate influence were combined with previously published data collected inland across a gradient of aridity. The results showed that post-wildfire runoff was better correlated with measures of productivity than with aridity, supporting the hypothesis. It is therefore proposed that long-term average productivity may be a more robust and transferable proxy in estimating the magnitude of increase in overland flow after fire than aridity. This most likely results from a stronger causal link between productivity and soil macroporosity, though this was not measured in this study. As with aridity, this proxy is mappable at high resolution using climate and remotely sensed data, enabling the application of landscape productivity metrics when predicting post-wildfire hydrologic risk.

AB Hydrological classification systems seek to provide information about the dominant processes in the catchment to enable information to be transferred between catchments. Currently, there is no widely agreed-upon system for classifying river catchments. This paper develops a novel approach to classifying catchments based on the temporal dependence structure of daily mean river flow time series, applied to 116 near-natural benchmark' catchments in the UK. The classification system is validated using 49 independent catchments. Temporal dependence in river flow data is driven by the flow pathways, connectivity and storage within the catchment and can thus be used to assess the influence catchment characteristics have on moderating the precipitation-to-flow relationship. Semi-variograms were computed for the 116 benchmark catchments to provide a robust and efficient way of characterising temporal dependence. Cluster analysis was performed on the semi-variograms, resulting in four distinct clusters. The influence of a wide range of catchment characteristics on the semi-variogram shape was investigated, including: elevation, land cover, physiographic characteristics, soil type and geology. Geology, depth to gleyed layer in soils, slope of the catchment and the percentage of arable land were significantly different between the clusters. These characteristics drive the temporal dependence structure by influencing the rate at which water moves through the catchment and/or the storage in the catchment. Quadratic discriminant analysis was used to show that a model with five catchment characteristics is able to predict the temporal dependence structure for un-gauged catchments. This method could form the basis for future regionalisation strategies, as a way of transferring information on the precipitation-to-flow relationship between gauged and un-gauged catchments.

AB The interpretation of groundwater ages in coastal aquifers requires an improved understanding of relationships between age distributions and the processes accompanying dispersive, density-dependent flow and transport. This study uses numerical modeling to examine the influence of mixing and a selection of other hydrogeological factors on steady-state age distributions in coastal aquifers. Three methods of age estimation are compared: the piston flow age, the direct age, and the tracer-based age. These are applied to various forms of the Henry problem, as well as to three variants of a larger, hypothetical coastal aquifer. Circulation of water within the seawater wedge results in markedly higher ages in the transition zone than in the underlying saltwater or overlying freshwater. Piston flow ages show a sharp increase where the freshwater and saltwater systems meet, whereas direct- and tracer-based simulations result in a smoother age distribution, as expected. Greater degrees of mixing result in larger differences between piston flow and direct or tracer-based ages, and bring about lower ages in the saltwater wedge. Tracer-based ages are preferred over direct-and piston flow ages for comparison with field data, especially in cases with wide transition zones. Despite the relatively simple conditions used for the simulations, complex age distributions with depth were obtained. Hence, the assessment of ages in field cases will be difficult, particularly where accurate ages in the transition zone are sought. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Virtual water flow can alleviate the pressure of regional water resources. Differences in water resources endowment and industrial structure among regions cause regional differences in water use in China. Water use in agriculture, especially irrigation, heavily relies on both surface water and groundwater. Virtual water flow may have different influence on the utilization and exploitation of regional surface water and groundwater. However, few studies have separately investigated the impacts of virtual water transfer on them. According to virtual water theory, contribution rate and regional differences, this study evaluates the effects of virtual water flow on water resources among provinces in China. The results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50% of surface water supply in only four provinces, namely Hebei, Henan, Beijing, and Shanxi. In the Northern region and mainly in North China, the dependence on groundwater is very high. The total virtual water flow in China increased from 75.8 Gm(3) in 1998 to 124.6 Gm(3) in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions. Given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export, the decline of groundwater level in North China is not further aggravated. Water-saving irrigation is the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use. The results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas.

AB Managing river bar formation in alluvial channels remains a challenging issue related to the need to free intakes, improve navigation and optimise river restoration works. This work studies the effects of locally varying the channel width on bar formation to see whether channel widening and narrowing could be feasible bar control measures. The investigation focuses on steady (hybrid) bars, the most common type of bars in lowland rivers. Several numerical experiments are performed using a two-dimensional physics-based finite-difference code. Model simplifications include capacity-limited sediment transport, uniform grain size and constant discharge. Previous tests on field and experimental data show that the simulations of the relevant processes are realistic. The results indicate that the formation of steady alternate bars downstream of lateral structures occurs at a distance that depends on the local width reduction and that narrowing the channel for a distance of 10 times the original width appears sufficient to locally suppress alternate bars. A symmetric inflow forces the formation of symmetric bed topography, as for instance a flat bed or central bars. Similarly, an asymmetric inflow forces asymmetric bed topography, as alternate bars. Upstream flow asymmetries disrupt the symmetry of central bars leading to a compound bed configuration characterised by a dominant wandering channel, a common feature in wide lowland rivers. Central and alternate bars are found to coexist even if bar stability theories predict the development of alternate bars only. These results are promising and raise fundamental questions, but need experimental and field confirmation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land subsidence and uplift, ground ruptures, and induced seismicity are the principal geomechanic effects of groundwater withdrawal and injection. The major environmental consequence of groundwater pumping is anthropogenic land subsidence. The first observation concerning land settlement linked to subsurface processes was made in 1926 by the American geologists Pratt and Johnson, who wrote that the cause of subsidence is to be found in the extensive extraction of fluid from beneath the affected area. Since then, impressive progress has been made in terms of: (a) recognizing the basic hydrologic and geomechanic principles underlying the occurrence; (b) measuring aquifer compaction and ground displacements, both vertical and horizontal; (c) modeling and predicting the past and future event; and (d) mitigating environmental impact through aquifer recharge and/or surface water injection. The first milestone in the theory of pumped aquifer consolidation was reached in 1923 by Terzaghi, who introduced the principle of effective intergranular stress. In the early 1970s, the emerging computer technology facilitated development of the first mathematical model of the subsidence of Venice, made by Gambolati and Freeze. Since then, the comprehension, measuring, and simulation of the occurrence have improved dramatically. More challenging today are the issues of ground ruptures and induced/triggered seismicity, which call for a shift from the classical continuum approach to discontinuous mechanics. Although well known for decades, anthropogenic land subsidence is still threatening large urban centers and deltaic areas worldwide, such as Bangkok, Jakarta, and Mexico City, at rates in the order of 10 cm/yr.

AB This study focuses on the probabilistic estimation of monthly soil moisture variation by considering (a) the influence of hydrometeorological forcing to model the temporal variation and (b) the information of Hydrological Soil Groups (HSGs) and Agro-Climatic Zones (ACZs) to capture the spatial variation. The innovative contributions of this study are: (i) development of a Combined Hydro-Meteorological (CHM) index to extract the information of different influencing hydrometeorological variables, (ii) consideration of soil-hydrologic characteristics (through HSGs) and climate regime-based zoning for agriculture (through ACZs), and (iii) quantification of uncertainty range of the estimated soil moisture. Usage of Supervised Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) in the development of the CHM index helps to eliminate the curse of dimensionality, typically arises in the multivariate analysis. The usage of SPCA also ensures the maximum possible association between the developed CHM index and soil moisture variation. The association between these variables is modeled through their joint distribution which is obtained by using the theory of copula. The proposed approach is also spatially transferable, since the information on HSGs and ACZs is considered. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) approach is adopted for stations belong to a particular HSG to examine the spatial transferability. The simulated soil moisture values are also compared with a few existing soil moisture data sets, derived from different Land Surface Models (LSMs) or retrieved from different satellite-based missions. The potential of the proposed approach is found to be promising and even applicable to crop land also, though with a lesser degree of efficiency as compared to bare land conditions.

AB The historical variability of streamflow and salinity was examined for three large estuaries of the Mid Atlantic region of the United States (US) in order to determine how they are influenced by large-scale circulation patterns. New wavelet methods identified 2- and 4-year periodicities from the streamflow time series. A composite analysis of meteorological data revealed that the anomalously high daily streamflow events coincided with Rossby waves emanating from the tropical Pacific and an eastern mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) dipole pattern in which negative MSLP anomalies were situated over the southeast US and positive MSLP anomalies were situated over the northwestern North Atlantic Ocean. Based on this pattern, a new Eastern North American (ENA) index was constructed that could explain more daily streamflow variance than existing climate indices. A Wavelet coherence analysis identified ENA index relationships with streamflow and salinity at periods of 2-4 years, suggesting that the ENA index may offer predictability beyond the weather forecasting timescale. The ENA index was also found to be phase-locked to the Gulf Stream index at a period of 74 months. Because the MSLP dipole pattern is linked to the upstream Rossby wave train, salinity variability at that timescale may have resulted from MSLP dipole-related changes in precipitation.

AB Storage and subsequent release of water is a key function of catchments that moderates the impact of meteorological and climate extremes. Despite the fact that many key hydrological processes depend upon storage, there are relatively few studies that focus on storage itself. Storage is difficult to quantify due to catchment heterogeneity and the paucity of data on key catchment characteristics that largely determine storage, such as soil, hydrogeology, and topography. We adopt a multi-method approach to estimate the dynamic and extended dynamic storages using hydrometric data in 69 catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin in south-eastern Australia. We test relationships between the derived catchment storages and hydrological and physical characteristics that potentially control storage. The study catchments tended to have small dynamic storages relative to the extended dynamic storage; proportionally the dynamic storages were all less than 10% of the extended dynamic storage. While storage estimates produced by the different methods and study catchments varied, the order in which they ranked was consistent. Correlations between catchment characteristics and estimates of storage were inconsistent; however, the results indicated that greater storage is strongly associated with steeper catchments and smoother hydrographs. This study highlights limitations in the current methodology to derive storage and the quality of widely applied hydrometric data. We reinforce the need to collect data that can validate storage estimates and call for new approaches that can broadly estimate storage at the catchment scale.

TI Examining the large-time wellbore flux of constant head test
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The function 1/[p ln (p/lambda)] comes from the wellbore flux solution in the Laplace domain for a constant head aquifer test when the Laplace variable p is small. The resulting inverse Laplace transform v(lambda t), representing the large-time wellbore flux, grows exponentially with time, which does not agree with the physical behavior of the wellbore flux. Based on this result, Chen and Stone (1993) asserted that the well-known relationship of small p-large t may fail to yield the correct large-time asymptotic solution. Yeh and Wang (2007) pointed out that the large-time wellbore flux is not n(lambda t) if the inversion of 1/[p ln (p/lambda)] is subject to the constraint Re p > lambda. Chen (2009) subsequently questioned the necessity of imposing this constraint on the Laplace transform in the inversion of the large-time wellbore flux. Motived by Chen's comment, we reexamine the inversion of 1/[p ln (p/lambda)] and demonstrate that this contradictory issue originates from a spurious pole introduced when applying the small p-large t correspondence to the Laplace domain solution. We explain why this occurs and why the actual wellbore flux at large times is proportional to the function N(lambda t), known as Ramanujan's integral. The function N(lambda t) does decay at large time, which agrees with the steady state wellbore flux of the constant head test.

AB This study focuses on characterizing the contributions of key terrestrial pathways that deliver dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to streams during hydrological events and on elucidating factors governing variation in water and DOC fluxes from these pathways. We made high-frequency measurements of discharge, specific conductance (SC), and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) during 221 events recorded over 2 years within four Vermont (USA) watersheds that range in area from 0.4 to 139 km(2). Using the SC measurements, together with statistical information on discharge, we separated the event hydrographs into contributions from three terrestrial pathways, which we refer to as riparian quickflow, subsurface quickflow, and slow-flow groundwater. The pathway discharges were used as input to a mixing model that closely approximated sub-hourly streamwater DOC concentrations as measured with the FDOM sensors. Subsurface quickflow, comprised of pre-event water, was the leading contributor to streamwater DOC fluxes, while riparian quickflow, comprised of event water, was the second-leading contributor to streamwater DOC fluxes, despite comprising the smallest proportion of streamflow yield among the three end-member pathways. Fixed-effects regression analysis revealed that the relationship between DOC fluxes from the end-member pathways and event magnitude was consistent across the four watersheds. This analysis also showed that DOC fluxes from the quickflow pathways increased significantly with temperature and varied inversely, but weakly, with catchment antecedent wetness. We believe that our approach, which leverages in-stream sensors that enable high-frequency measurements over extended periods, may be applicable for evaluating controls on DOC export from other watersheds within and beyond our study region.

AB The U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service's (ARS) Experimental Watershed Network grew from Dust Bowl era efforts of the Soil Conservation Service in the mid-1930s with the establishment of small experimental watersheds. In the 1950s, five watershed research centers with intensively instrumented watersheds at the scale of 100 to 700 km(2) were established. Primary network research objectives were to quantify on-site and downstream effects of conservation practices and develop rainfall-runoff relationships for design of water conservation structures. With passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, research objectives have evolved to add a variety of observations relevant to the water quality issues. Many of the watersheds within the network have served, and continue to serve, as core validation sites for satellite sensors. As a result of the network's long history and intensive monitoring, coupled with mission-driven research, a deep knowledge base of watershed processes has been developed. This has led to the extensive development and validation of numerous watershed models that are in widespread use today. The visionary investments in building and maintaining this network and associated scientific investigations for more than half a century have not only resulted in numerous high-impact research accomplishments but also a wide array of accomplishments that directly benefit society. The ARS Experimental Watersheds formed the core of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) as well as the recently established Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network. LTAR will expand the mission of the ARS Watersheds Network to include agricultural intensification, maintaining or improving ecosystem services while enhancing rural prosperity.

AB Hydrologic variability is a fundamental driver of ecological processes and species distribution patterns within river systems, yet the paucity of gauges in many catchments means that streamflow data are often unavailable for ecological survey sites. Filling this data gap is an important challenge in hydroecological research. To address this gap, we first test the ability to spatially extrapolate hydrologic metrics calculated from gauged streamflow data to ungauged sites as a function of stream distance and catchment area. Second, we examine the ability of statistical models to predict flow regime metrics based on climate and catchment physiographic variables. Our assessment focused on Australia's largest catchment, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). We found that hydrologic metrics were predictable only between sites within similar to 25 km of one another. Beyond this, correlations between sites declined quickly. We found less than 40% of fish survey sites from a recent basin-wide monitoring program (n=777 sites) to fall within this 25 km range, thereby greatly limiting the ability to utilize gauge data for direct spatial transposition of hydrologic metrics to biological survey sites. In contrast, statistical model-based transposition proved effective in predicting ecologically relevant aspects of the flow regime (including metrics describing central tendency, high- and low-flows intermittency, seasonality, and variability) across the entire gauge network (median R-2 similar to 0.54, range 0.39-0.94). Modeled hydrologic metrics thus offer a useful alternative to empirical data when examining biological survey data from ungauged sites. More widespread use of these statistical tools and modeled metrics could expand our understanding of flow-ecology relationships.

AB Little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of the stable isotopic composition of precipitation in the North Atlantic and its relationship to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and anthropogenic climate change. The islands of the Azores archipelago are uniquely positioned in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean to address this knowledge gap. A survey of spatial and temporal variability of the stable isotope composition of precipitation in Azores is discussed using newly presented analyses along with Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation data. The collected precipitation samples yield a new local meteoric water line (delta H-2 = 7.1 * delta O-18 + 8.46) for the Azores region and the North Atlantic Ocean. The annual isotopic mean of precipitation shows a small range for the unweighted and precipitation mass-weighted delta O-18-H2O values. Results show an inverse relation between the monthly delta O-18-H2O and the amount of precipitation, which increases in elevation and into the interior of the island. Higher amounts of precipitation (from convective storm systems) do not correspond to the most depleted values of stable isotopes in precipitation. Precipitation shows an orographic effect with depleted delta O-18-H2O values related to the Rayleigh effect. Monthly delta O-18-H2O values for individual precipitation sampling stations show little relationship to air temperature. Results show a local source of moisture during the summer with the characteristics of the first vapour condensate. The stable isotope composition of precipitation is strongly correlated to the NAO index, and delta O-18-H2O values show a statistically significantly trend towards enrichment since 1962 coincident with the increased air temperature and relative humidity due to climate change. Results are in line with observations of increasing sea surface temperature and relative humidity.

AB This work presents a rigorous numerical validation of analytical stochastic models of steady state unsaturated flow in heterogeneous porous media. It also provides a crucial link between stochastic theory based on simplifying assumptions and empirical field and simulation evidence of variably saturated flow in actual or realistic hypothetical heterogeneous porous media. Statistical properties of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, soil water tension, and soil water flux in heterogeneous soils are investigated through high resolution Monte Carlo simulations of a wide range of steady state flow problems in a quasi-unbounded domain. In agreement with assumptions in analytical stochastic models of unsaturated flow, hydraulic conductivity and soil water tension are found to be lognormally and normally distributed, respectively. In contrast, simulations indicate that in moderate to strong variable conductivity fields, longitudinal flux is highly skewed. Transverse flux distributions are leptokurtic. the moments of the probability distributions obtained from Monte Carlo simulations are compared to modified first-order analytical models. Under moderate to strong heterogeneous soil flux conditions (sigma(y)(2)greater than or equal to 1), analytical solutions overestimate variability in soil water tension by up to 40% as soil heterogeneity increases, and underestimate variability of both flux components by up to a factor 5. Theoretically predicted model (cross-)covariance agree well with the numerical sample (cross-)covarianaces. Statistical moments are shown to be consistent with observed physical characteristics of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

AB Recent advances in microbiology have enabled the quantitative simulation of microbial metabolism and growth based on genome-scale characterization of metabolic pathways and fluxes. We have incorporated a genome-scale metabolic model of the iron-reducing bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens into a pore-scale simulation of microbial growth based on coupling of iron reduction to oxidation of a soluble electron donor (acetate). In our model, fluid flow and solute transport is governed by a combination of the Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion-reaction equations. Microbial growth occurs only on the surface of soil grains where solid-phase mineral iron oxides are available. Mass fluxes of chemical species associated with microbial growth are described by the genome-scale microbial model, implemented using a constraint-based metabolic model, and provide the Robin-type boundary condition for the advection-diffusion equation at soil grain surfaces.
   Conventional models of microbially-mediated subsurface reactions use a lumped reaction model that does not consider individual microbial reaction pathways, and describe reactions rates using empirically-derived rate formulations such as the Monod-type kinetics. We have used our pore-scale model to explore the relationship between genome-scale metabolic models and Monod-type formulations, and to assess the manifestation of pore-scale variability (microenvironments) in terms of apparent Darcy-scale microbial reaction rates. The genome-scale model predicted lower biomass yield, and different stoichiometry for iron consumption, in comparison to prior Monod formulations based on energetics considerations. We were able to fit an equivalent Monod model, by modifying the reaction stoichiometry and biomass yield coefficient, that could effectively match results of the genome-scale simulation of microbial behaviors under excess nutrient conditions, but predictions of the fitted Monod model deviated from those of the genome-scale model under conditions in which one or more nutrients were limiting.
   The fitted Monod kinetic model was also applied at the Darcy scale; that is, to simulate average reaction processes at the scale of the entire pore-scale model domain. As we expected, even under excess nutrient conditions for which the Monod and genome-scale models predicted equal reaction rates at the pore scale, the Monod model over-predicted the rates of biomass growth and iron and acetate utilization when applied at the Darcy scale. This discrepancy is caused by an inherent assumption of perfect mixing over the Darcy-scale domain, which is clearly violated in the pore-scale models. These results help to explain the need to modify the flux constraint parameters in order to match observations in previous applications of the genome-scale model at larger scales. These results also motivate further investigation of quantitative multi-scale relationships between fundamental behavior at the pore scale (where genome-scale models are appropriately applied) and observed behavior at larger scales (where predictions of reactive transport phenomena are needed).

AB Based on combined laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, this paper examined seawater intrusion (SWI) and seawater retreat (SWR) processes caused by abrupt inland watertable changes in a laboratory-scale unconfined aquifer (length of 7.7 m and thickness of 1.0 m) subjected to a synthetic sinusoidal fide. The results showed that the salinity distribution was relatively stable and that SWI and SWR processes were almost temporally symmetrical given relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients (0.0269, 0.0209 and 0.0149) between the inland watertable and the mean sea level. However, the salt distribution changed significantly in response to the inland watertable variations when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was relatively small (0.0030). The speed of the SWI and SWR response to the inland watertable variations was temporally asymmetric, e.g., SWR was quicker than SWI by a factor of 9 with respect to the observed saltwater wedge toe locations. As a relatively thick mixing zone (transition between freshwater and saltwater zones) was induced by the fide, simulated saltwater wedge toe locations, as indicated by the 5%, 50% and 95% isohalines, changed inconsistently. Different hysteresis behaviors were found in the relationship between the SW toe locations and total salt mass stored in the aquifer. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the response of both SWI and SWR to the inland watertable variations could be prolonged by a decreased tidal amplitude or decreased tidal period.

It is now recognized that water is not exclusive to the Earth but, rather, is a major constituent of the matter in the universe and may be a proxy for life in other planets as well. In this paper, we reflect on the need to expand the boundaries of the current water sciences from the description of mere terrestrial hydrological processes to a comprehensive inclusion of the physical laws and processes pertaining to water dynamics off Earth.

AB We examine the upper tail of flood peak distributions through analyses of annual peak observations from more than 8,000 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gaging stations and through hydrometeorological analyses of the storms that produce the most extreme floods. We focus on the distribution of the upper tail ratio, which is defined as the peak discharge for the flood of record at a stream gaging station divided by the sample 10-year flood magnitude. The 14 June 1903 Heppner storm, which produced an upper tail ratio of 200, was the product of a hailstorm that formed along the Blue Mountains in eastern Oregon, a region dominated by snowmelt flooding. A striking contrast between record flood peaks and the larger distribution of annual flood peaks in the United States is in the seasonality of flood occurrence, with record floods reflecting a much stronger contribution from warm season thunderstorm systems. Mountainous terrain and intense convective rainfall are important elements of the geography and hydrometeorology of extreme upper tail ratio flood peaks. The distribution of upper tail ratio values for USGS stream gaging stations does not depend on basin area, a result which is consistent with scaling results based on extreme value theory. Downscaling simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to examine the storm environment of the 1903 Heppner storm, along with two other record flood peaks near the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon from the USGS miscellaneous flood record, the July 1956 Meyers Canyon flood and the July 1965 Lane Canyon flood.

TI The solution of groundwater quality management problems with a nonconvex
   feasible region using a cutting plane optimization technique
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY THEORY; SIMULATION
AB In groundwater quality management problems the concentration constraints have a nonlinear behavior which may be described either as a convex or a nonconvex function. Therefore the feasible region, which is defined as the intersection of all of these constraints, can be either a convex or a nonconvex set. A review of existing optimization algorithms for the solution of the groundwater quality management problem indicates that the majority of them have an inability to determine a global optimum when nonconvexity occurs. In an earlier paper that appeared in this journal [Karatzas and Pinder, 1993], the outer approximation method, a global optimization technique, was presented for the solution of groundwater management problems with convex constraints. The problem was formulated to minimize a concave objective function over a compact convex set of constraints. In the present study the same concept is applied to problems with nonconvex constraints. While the main concept of the current approach remains the same as that in our earlier study, there is a significant difference in the determination of the cutting hyperplane. The nonconvexity of the domain requires a special approach to insure that the introduction of the cutting hyperplane does not eliminate any part of the nonconvex feasible region. In this work the theory of the developed algorithm is presented and subsequently applied to two groundwater quality problems. In the first example a hypothetical aquifer is considered to illustrate the performance of the methodology. In the second example a groundwater quality management problem in Woburn, Massachusetts, is solved. Results obtained are compared with those generated by MINOS 5.1.

AB For large-scale hydrological modeling, the accuracy of the models used is a trade-off with the computational requirements. The models that perform well on the daily/meter scale may not perform well when applied at the yearly/kilometer scale. We compare two models of water flow and nitrate and bromide transport in a tile drained soil. The first model is based on a 2-D grid with an explicit drain node, here called the Dynamic Drainage Model (DDM). The second and less computationally expensive model is based on an 1-D vertical discretization where the horizontal flow is included as a sink term based on the Hooghoudt theory, here called the Hooghoudt Drainage Model (HDM). Both are based on Finite Volume Method solutions to Richard's equation and to the advection-dispersion equation (ADE), and embedded within the Daisy agroecological model, which includes the nitrogen cycle. The two models are run with 10 years of weather data and three different lower-boundary conditions. Losses of water, nitrogen, and bromide to both drain pipes and deep percolation/leaching are compared between the models, at daily and yearly time scales. In no case do we find the discrepancy large enough to warrant a rejection of the use of the faster HDM instead of DDM. For the daily time scale, we find in general a higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for water (0.98-1.00) than for nitrate (0.97-1.00), and the lowest for bromide (0.95-1.00).

AB Ecohydrological processes in semiarid shrublands and other dryland ecosystems are sensitive to discrete pulses of precipitation. Anticipated changes in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation events are expected to impact the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in these drylands, thereby impacting their ecohydrological processes. Recent field studies have shown that in dryland ecosystems, transpiration dynamics and plant productivity are largely a function of deep soil moisture available after large precipitation events, regardless of where the majority of plant roots occur. However, the strength of this relationship and how and why it varies throughout the year remains unclear. We present eddy covariance, soil moisture, and sap flow measurements taken over an 18-month period in conjunction with an analysis of biweekly precipitation, shallow soil, deep soil, and stem stable water isotope samples from a creosotebush-dominated shrubland ecosystem at the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southern Arizona. Within the context of a hydrologically defined two-layer conceptual framework, our results support that transpiration is associated with the availability of deep soil moisture and that the source of this moisture varies seasonally. Therefore, changes in precipitation pulses that alter the timing and magnitude of the availability of deep soil moisture are expected to have major consequences for dryland ecosystems. Our findings offer insights that can improve the representation of drylands within regional and global models of land surface atmosphere exchange and their linkages to the hydrologic cycle.

AB As an important source of income in the region's economy, the jujube plantations are very common in arid north-western China, and their planted areas continue to expand. In the central Heihe River Basin of arid north-western China, Linze jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. var. inermis (Bunge) Relid.) plantations cover more than 10,000 ha, too. Water use by this species is expected to change or modify catchment hydrological process. To Our knowledge, there is no information on the transpiration and canopy conductance of the jujube plantations in arid north-western China. Therefore, Transpiration and canopy conductance were monitored in a 14-year-old Linze jujube orchard. The experiment was carried out in the central Heihe River Basin, near Pingchuan Town (Linze County, Gansu Province, China) during growing season of 2006, from May to the first ten days of October. Eight trees were used to measure sap flow using the heat-pulse-velocity method. The orchard was irrigated adequately during the study. Transpiration was estimated from the sap flow measurements. During the experiment, the transpiration rate of the orchard ranged from 0-32 to 1.40 mm per day. Canopy Conductance was obtained from estimated daily transpiration and climatic variables measured on a half-hour basis, and canopy conductance for water vapour transfer was between 1.20 to 82.57 mm s(-1), with a mean of 11.86 +/- 6.84 mm s(-1) during the observation period. Air temperature and vapour-pressure deficit exhibited it linear relationship with sap flow velocity and the relationship between these factors and canopy conductance Could be represented by an exponential decay function.

AB Streams and rivers play a major role in the global carbon cycle as they collect, transform and deliver terrestrial organic carbon to the ocean. The rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal depends on hydrological factors (primarily water depth and residence time) that change predictably within the river network and local DOC concentration and composition is the result of transformation and removal processes in the whole upstream catchment. We thus combine theory of the form and scaling of river networks with a model of DOC removal from streamwater to investigate how the structure of river networks and the related hydrological drivers control DOC dynamics. We find that minimization of energy dissipation, the physical process that shapes the topological and metric properties of river networks, leads to structures that are more efficient in terms of total DOC removal per unit of streambed area. River network structure also induces a scaling of the DOC mass flux with the contributing area that does not depend on the particular network used for the simulation and is robust to spatial heterogeneity of model parameters. Such scaling enables the derivation of removal patterns across a river network in terms of clearly identified biological, hydrological and geomorphological factors. In particular, we derive how the fraction of terrestrial DOC load removed by the river network scales with the catchment area and with the area of a region drained by multiple river networks. Such results further our understanding of the impact of streams and rivers on carbon cycling at large scales.

TI Hydrograph recession extraction algorithm (HYDRA): Minimizing influence
   of stage uncertainty in identification of recession events
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Recession analysis; Recession parameters; Watershed function
AB Fine temporal resolution streamflow records offer valuable information to further our understanding of watershed function. Among the many tools to decipher watershed processes, recession analysis can be used to gain insight into storage-discharge properties and watershed storage by analyzing portions of stream hydrographs whose behavior is attributed to the relationship between aquifer structure and groundwater outflow to the steam channel. Although numerous methods have been employed to advance recession analysis methodology, no comprehensive approach to identify the cessation or continuation of recession events from fine temporal resolution data has been established. A new extraction algorithm, the HYDrograph Recession extraction Algorithm (HYDRA), is proposed to improve identification of recession events from fine temporal resolution hydrographs. HYDRA exploits site-specific stage-discharge relations to qualify the beginning or end of a hydrograph recession by accounting for stage measurement error which translates to uncertainty in the stream hydrograph. Experiments compared HYDRA to previous published methods, revealing that HYDRA led to significant improvements in identifying the continuation of recession events, resulting in superior estimation of theoretical recession parameter values. Additional case studies assert that HYDRA robustly identifies recession events across a spectrum of temporal resolution discharge records, affirming that the extraction algorithm provides a functional tool to identify recession events for further recession-based theoretical analysis.

AB Flow dynamics in a thick vadose zone in an arid region, China was investigated using a field experiment at plots with bare soils and vegetated soils. Detailed pressure head profile along a depth of 8 m, ground-water level, soil moisture content at surface, air temperature, and precipitation were observed over one year's time span. The temporal and spatial variations of pressure heads and hydraulic gradients over the time span elucidate the role of air temperature, precipitation, and soil stratification, the growth of vegetation, on the flow dynamics in the vadose zone. The dynamics includes freezing and thawing of surface soils, infiltration, evapotranspiration, distribution of moisture, and groundwater recharge. Estimated hydraulic gradients based on the observed pressure heads suggest that vegetation affected flow dynamics even at 3 m below land surface during its growth seasons. The pressure head distributions at the vadose zone over the time span were found correlated well with soil stratification or heterogeneity. Afterward, we estimated the land-atmosphere interface flux, water uptake rate by the plants, and we then discussed the relationship between seasonal variation of temperature, precipitation, evaporation, plant growth, soil stratification (heterogeneity) and the flow dynamics in the vadose zone of the region.

AB Delivery of fine sediment to fluvial systems is of considerable concern given the physical and ecological impacts of elevated levels in drainage networks. Although it is possible to measure the transfer of fine sediment at high frequency by using a range of surrogate and automated technologies, the demands for assessing sediment flux and sediment properties at multiple spatially distributed locations across catchments can often not be met using established sampling techniques. The time-integrated mass-flux sampler (TIMS) has the potential to bridge this gap and further our understanding of fine sediment delivery in fluvial systems. However, these devices have undergone limited testing in the field. The aim of this paper was to provide a critical validation of TIMS as a technique for assessing fluvial fine sediment transfer. Fine sediment flux and sediment properties were assessed over 2 years with individual sampling periods of approximately 30 days. Underestimation of sediment flux ranged between 66% and 99% demonstrating that TIMS is unsuitable for assessing absolute sediment loads. However, assessment of relative efficiency showed that six of seven samplers produced statistically strong relationships with the reference sediment load (P < 0.05). Aggregated data from all sites produced a highly significant relationship between reference and TIMS loads (R-2 = 0.80; P < 0.001) demonstrating TIMS may be suitable for characterizing patterns of suspended sediment transfer. Testing also illustrated a consistency in sediment properties between multiple samplers in the same channel cross section. TIMS offers a useful means of assessing spatial and temporal patterns of fine sediment transfer across catchments where expensive monitoring frameworks cannot be commissioned.

AB In seasonally dry environments, critical zone drainage provides base flow that sustains river ecosystems. The extent of wetted channels and magnitude of base flow throughout the network, however, are rarely documented, and no general theory currently exists enabling the prediction of these key ecosystem properties. We conducted channel surveys in early and late summers of 2012, 2014, and 2015 in four headwater drainage networks (2.8-17.0 km(2), in the Franciscan Formation of the Eel River (Northern California)), two of which are underlain by the Coastal Belt (argillite and inter-bedded sandstone) and two of which are underlain by the Central Belt (sheared argillaceous-matrix, meta-sedimentary melange). In all networks, stationary springs controlled the extent of flow. Though surveyed during a period of multiyear drought, the two adjacent Coastal Belt networks remained flowing throughout late-summer months, sustained by drainage from groundwater stored in thick weathered bedrock above fresh, impermeable bedrock. Flow magnitudes, however, decreased and surface flows became increasingly discontinuous, largely due to infiltration into thick gravel deposits on the channel bed. Only 23 km away, in the Central Belt melange, channel flow ceased early in the summer because the thin critical zone (typically <3 m) stored little water. All late-summer flowing water initiated from deep-rooted sandstone blocks and terminated a short distance downslope. Our findings suggest that lithology and critical zone development exert primary controls on wetted channel extent. Given similar annual precipitation, nearby watersheds can have dramatically different summer wetted channel networks that result in fundamentally different aquatic ecosystems.

AB Flood loss modeling is a central component of flood risk analysis. Conventionally, this involves univariable and deterministic stage-damage functions. Recent advancements in the field promote the use of multivariable and probabilistic loss models, which consider variables beyond inundation depth and account for prediction uncertainty. Although companies contribute significantly to total loss figures, novel modeling approaches for companies are lacking. Scarce data and the heterogeneity among companies impede the development of company flood loss models. We present three multivariable flood loss models for companies from the manufacturing, commercial, financial, and service sector that intrinsically quantify prediction uncertainty. Based on object-level loss data (n = 1,306), we comparatively evaluate the predictive capacity of Bayesian networks, Bayesian regression, and random forest in relation to deterministic and probabilistic stage-damage functions, serving as benchmarks. The company loss data stem from four postevent surveys in Germany between 2002 and 2013 and include information on flood intensity, company characteristics, emergency response, private precaution, and resulting loss to building, equipment, and goods and stock. We find that the multivariable probabilistic models successfully identify and reproduce essential relationships of flood damage processes in the data. The assessment of model skill focuses on the precision of the probabilistic predictions and reveals that the candidate models outperform the stage-damage functions, while differences among the proposed models are negligible. Although the combination of multivariable and probabilistic loss estimation improves predictive accuracy over the entire data set, wide predictive distributions stress the necessity for the quantification of uncertainty.

   IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY
AB Evidence suggests that catchment state variables such as groundwater can exhibit multiyear trends. This means that their state may reflect not only recent climatic conditions but also climatic conditions in past years or even decades. Here we demonstrate that five commonly used conceptual "bucket" rainfall-runoff models are unable to replicate multiyear trends exhibited by natural systems during the "Millennium Drought" in south-east Australia. This causes an inability to extrapolate to different climatic conditions, leading to poor performance in split sample tests. Simulations are examined from five models applied in 38 catchments, then compared with groundwater data from 19 bores and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data for two geographic regions. Whereas the groundwater and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data decrease from high to low values gradually over the duration of the 13-year drought, the model storages go from high to low values in a typical seasonal cycle. This is particularly the case in the drier, flatter catchments. Once the drought begins, there is little room for decline in the simulated storage, because the model "buckets" are already "emptying" on a seasonal basis. Since the effects of sustained dry conditions cannot accumulate within these models, we argue that they should not be used for runoff projections in a drying climate. Further research is required to (a) improve conceptual rainfall-runoff models, (b) better understand circumstances in which multiyear trends in state variables occur, and (c) investigate links between these multiyear trends and changes in rainfall-runoff relationships in the context of a changing climate.

AB A critical hydrological process is the interaction between rivers and aquifers. However, accurately determining this interaction from one method alone is difficult. At a point, the water exchange in the riverbed can be determined using temperature variations over depth. Over the river reach, differential gauging can be used to determine averaged losses or gains. This study combines these two methods and applies them to a 34 km reach of a semiarid river in eastern Australia under highly transient conditions. It is found that high and low river flows translate into high and low riverbed Darcy fluxes, and that these are strongly losing during high flows, and only slightly losing or gaining for low flows. The spatial variability in riverbed Darcy fluxes may be explained by riverbed heterogeneity, with higher variability at greater spatial scales. Although the river-aquifer gradient is the main driver of riverbed Darcy flux at high flows, considerable uncertainty in both the flux magnitude and direction estimates were found during low flows. The reach-scale results demonstrate that high-flow events account for 64% of the reach loss (or 43% if overbank events are excluded) despite occurring only 11% of the time. By examining the relationship between total flow volume, river stage and duration for in-channel flows, we find the loss ratio (flow loss/total flow) can be greater for smaller flows than larger flows with similar duration. Implications of the study for the modeling and management of connected water resources are also discussed.

AB Dynamic data for parameter estimation in groundwater hydrology are often strongly sensitive to averages of porosity and permeability over extended regions, but only weakly sensitive to the properties of individual gridblocks. Consequently, updates of gridblock parameters from the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) will be subject to substantial error due to spurious correlations when the size of the ensemble is small. It has been shown that adaptive localization methods can reduce the magnitude of spurious correlations and regularize updates from the EnKF. In this paper we show that when data are sensitive to an average of parameters over extended regions, adaptive localization methods may eliminate true, but weak, correlations. For this type of data, there appears to be a relationship between the spatial scale of the model variables and the sensitivity of observations to the variables. By introducing a multiscale expansion with adaptive localization, we are able to increase the sensitivity to variables corresponding to large spatial scales and more accurately compute their magnitudes, while eliminating updates to variables corresponding to small spatial scales with weak correlations. Three examples with distinct features are used to compare the new method of combining adaptive localization with wavelet parameterization to the case of no localization and adaptive localization with standard gridblock parameterization. We show that the Kalman gain estimated using the wavelet parameterization with adaptive localization is less biased and has smaller root-mean-square error for the problems in which spatial averaging is important and the Kalman gain has large-scale features.

   DYNAMICS; STORAGE; STAND
AB The Budyko curve is often used to estimate the actual evaporation as a function of the aridity index in a catchment. Different empirical equations exist to describe this relationship; however, these equations have very limited physical background. The model concept presented in this paper is physically based and uses only measurable parameters. It makes use of two types of evaporation: interception and transpiration. It assumes that interception can be modeled as a threshold process on a daily time scale. If multiplied with the rainfall distribution function, integrated, and multiplied with the expected number of rain days per month, the monthly interception is obtained. In a similar way, the monthly interception can be upscaled to annual interception. Analogous to the interception process, transpiration can be modeled as a threshold process at a monthly time scale and can be upscaled by integration and multiplication with the expected number of rain months. The expected rain days per month are modeled in two ways: as a fixed proportion of the monthly rainfall and as a power function based on Markov properties of rainfall. The latter is solved numerically. It appears that on an annual basis the analytical model does not differ much from the numerical solution. Hence, the analytical model is used and applied on 10 locations in different climates. This paper shows that the empirical Budyko curve can be constructed on the basis of measurable parameters representing evaporation threshold values and the expected number of rain days and rain months and, in addition, a monthly moisture carryover amount for semiarid zones.

TI A stochastic analysis of steady state two-phase flow in heterogeneous
   media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FRACTURED POROUS-MEDIA; UNSATURATED FLOW; 3-PHASE FLOW; NONSTATIONARY
AB [1] We present a novel approach to modeling stochastic multiphase flow problems, for example, nonaqueous phase liquid flow, in a heterogeneous subsurface medium with random soil properties, in particular, with randomly heterogeneous intrinsic permeability and soil pore size distribution. A stochastic numerical model for steady state water-oil flow in a random soil property field is developed using the Karhunen-Loeve moment equation (KLME) approach and is numerically implemented. An exponential model is adopted to define the constitutive relationship between phase relative permeability and capillary pressure. The log-transformed intrinsic permeability Y(x) and soil pore size distribution beta(x) are assumed to be Gaussian random functions with a separable exponential covariance function. The perturbation part of these two log-transformed soil properties is then decomposed into an infinite series based on a set of orthogonal normal random variables {xi(n)}. The phase pressure, capillary pressure, and phase mobility are decomposed by polynomial expansions and the perturbation method. Combining these expansions of Y(x), beta(x) and dependent pressures, the steady state water-oil flow equations and corresponding boundary conditions are reformulated as a series of differential equations up to second order. These differential equations are solved numerically, and the solutions are directly used to construct moments of phase pressure and capillary pressure. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed KLME model by favorably comparing first- and second-order approximations to Monte Carlo simulations. The significant computational efficiency of the KLME approach over Monte Carlo simulation is also illustrated.

AB Catchment travel time distributions reflect how precipitation from different storms is stored and mixed as it is transported to the stream. Catchment travel time distributions can be described by the mean travel time and the shape of the distribution around the mean. Whereas mean travel times have been quantified in a range of catchment studies, only rarely has the shape of the distribution been estimated. The shape of the distribution affects both the short-term and long-term catchment response to a pulse input of a soluble contaminant. Travel time distributions are usually estimated from conservative tracer concentrations in precipitation and streamflow, which are analyzed using time-domain convolution or spectral methods. Of these two approaches, spectral methods are better suited to determining the shape of the distribution. Previous spectral analyses of both rainfall and streamflow tracer time series from several catchments in Wales showed that rainfall chemistry spectra resemble white noise, whereas the stream tracer spectra in these same catchments exhibit fractal 1/f scaling over three orders of magnitude. Here we test the generality of the observed fractal scaling of streamflow chemistry, using spectral analysis of long-term tracer time series from 22 catchments in North America and Europe. We demonstrate that 1/f fractal scaling of stream chemistry is a common feature of these catchments. These observations imply that catchments typically exhibit an approximate power-law distribution of travel times, and thus retain a long memory of past inputs. The observed fractal scaling places strong constraints on possible models of catchment behavior, because it is inconsistent with the exponential travel time distributions that are predicted by simple mixing models.

AB Compared to hydrograph recession analysis, which is widely applied in engineering hydrology, the quantitative assessment of stream salinity with time (i.e. the salinograph) has received significantly less attention. In particular, while in many previous hydrological studies an inverse relationship between hydrograph and salinograph responses is apparent, the concept of salinity accession (the inversely related salinity counterpart to hydrograph recession) has not been introduced nor quantitatively evaluated in previous literature. In this study, we conduct a mathematical analysis of salinograph accession, and determine new quantitative relationships between salinity accession and hydroaraph recession parameters. An equation is formulated that reproduces the general trend in salinity accession. A salinity accession parameter k(c) is then introduced and is shown to be the ratio of direct runoff to total stream flow recession parameters: k(r)/k. The groundwater recession parameter k(g) was estimated using a simple and rapid method that uses both salinograph and hydrograph data. Salinity accession type-curves illustrate that under certain conditions, the relative steepness of individual salinographs is dependent upon the ratio of groundwater salinity to direct runoff salinity: C-g/C-r. The salinity accession algorithms are applied to two contrasting field settings: Scott Creek, South Australia and Sandy Creek, northern Queensland, Australia. It was found that k(g) > k during periods of obvious stream flow recession, for the events analysed. Salinograph accession behaviour was fairly similar for both sites, despite contrasting environments. Using assumed end-member salinities for groundwater and direct runoff based upon field observations, the behaviour of k(c) from the Scott Creek site was approximately reproduced by varying the initial groundwater to runoff flow ratio: Q(g0)/Q(r0), within reasonable parameter ranges. The use of salinograph information when used in addition to standard hydrograph analyses provided useful information on recession characteristics of stream components.

AB Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services for urban dwellers. However, forest water use for these benefits has become one of the critical concerns in dryland regions where water is limited. Negative forest water use impacts could be reduced by selecting tree species with low rates of transpiration. However, the possible changes of urban tree transpiration and its biophysical controls are still unclear. This study monitored the sap flow of a 58-year-old Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation in a semiarid urban environment of northern China. Soil moisture played an important role in stand transpiration (E-c). E-c had a strong positive relationship with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (R-s) when soil water was sufficient. In addition, the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was not related to leaf and branch water potential. Under soil water stress, E-c was significantly reduced by 63.1% (p < 0.001) and was weakly related to VPD and R-s. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was reduced (p < 0.001) by 74.3% due to leaf stomatal closure, and the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was significantly increased (p < 0.05) with increasing leaf and branch water potential. Wind speed had no significant effects on E-c. P. tabulaeformis tended to be isohydric with a relatively constant midday leaf water potential (i.e. -2.46 to -2.92 MPa) and strong stomatal regulation as a function of soil water stress. However, slopes (0.53-0.56) of the linear relationship between m (dg(c)/dlnVPD) and reference canopy conductance were significantly lower than the widely recognized 0.6 (p < 0.001). Therefore, urban tree transpiration drivers and forest impacts need to be clarified to better understand the proper tradeoff between water consumption and ecological services for urban areas.

AB Storage is a fundamental but elusive component of drainage basin function, influencing synchronization between precipitation input and streamflow output and mediating basin sensitivity to climate and land use/land cover (LULC) change. We compare hydrometric and isotopic approaches to estimate indices of dynamic and total basin storage, respectively, and assess inter-basin differences in these indices across the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) region of southern Ontario, Canada. Dynamic storage indices for the 20 study basins included the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow (baseflow index BFI), Q (99) flow and flow duration curve (FDC) slope. Ratios of the standard deviation of the streamflow stable isotope signal relative to that of precipitation were determined for each basin from a 1 year bi-weekly sampling program and used as indicators of total storage. Smaller ratios imply longer water travel times, smaller young water fractions (F-yw, < similar to 2-3 months in age) in streamflow and greater basin storage. Ratios were inversely related to BFI and Q (99), and positively related to FDC slope, suggesting longer travel times and smaller F (yw) for basins with stable baseflow-dominated streamflow regimes. Inter-basin differences in all indices reflected topographic, hydrogeologic and LULC controls on storage, which was greatest in steep, forest-covered headwaters underlain by permeable deposits with thick and relatively uniform unsaturated zones. Nevertheless, differential sensitivity of indices to controls on storage indicates the value of using several indices to capture more completely how basin characteristics influence storage. Regression relationships between storage indices and basin characteristics provided reasonable predictions of aspects of the streamflow regime of test basins in the ORM region. Such relationships and the underlying knowledge of controls on basin storage in this landscape provide the foundation for initial predictions of relative differences in streamflow response to regional changes in climate and LULC.

AB The uncertainty in hydrological model covariates, if ignored, introduces systematic bias in the parameters estimated. We introduce here a method to determine the true value of parameters given uncertainty in model inputs. This method, known as simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) operates on the basis of an empirical relationship between parameters and the level of input noise (or uncertainty). The method starts by generating a series of alternate model inputs by artificially adding white noise in increasing multiples of the known error variance. The resulting parameter sets allow us to formulate an empirical relationship between their values and the level of noise present. SIMEX is based on theory that the trend in alternate parameters can be extrapolated back to the notional error free zone.
   We illustrate the strength of SIMEX in improving skills of predictive models that use uncertain sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data over the NINO3 region as predictor to the southern oscillation index (SOI), an alternate measure of the strength of the El Nino southern oscillation. Our hypothesis is that the higher magnitude of noise in the pre 1960 data period introduces bias to model parameters where SSTA is the input variable. The relatively error invariant southern oscillation index (SOI) is regressed over SSTA and calibrated using a subset of the series from 1900 to 1960. We validate the resulting models using the less erroneous 1960-2003 data period. Overall the application of SIMEX is found to reduce the residual predictive errors during the validation period.

AB Transit times through hydrologic systems vary in time, but the nature of that variability is not well understood. Transit times variability was investigated in a 1 m(3) sloping lysimeter, representing a simplified model of a hillslope receiving periodic rainfall events for 28 days. Tracer tests were conducted using an experimental protocol that allows time-variable transit time distributions (TTDs) to be calculated from data. Observed TTDs varied with the storage state of the system, and the history of inflows and outflows. We propose that the observed time variability of the TTDs can be decomposed into two parts: internal variability associated with changes in the arrangement of, and partitioning between, flow pathways; and external variability driven by fluctuations in the flow rate along all flow pathways. These concepts can be defined quantitatively in terms of rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) functions, which is a theory describing lumped transport dynamics. Internal variability is associated with temporal variability in the rSAS function, while external is not. The rSAS function variability was characterized by an inverse storage effect, whereby younger water is released in greater proportion under wetter conditions than drier. We hypothesize that this effect is caused by the rapid mobilization of water in the unsaturated zone by the rising water table. Common approximations used to model transport dynamics that neglect internal variability were unable to reproduce the observed breakthrough curves accurately. This suggests that internal variability can play an important role in hydrologic transport dynamics, with implications for field data interpretation and modeling.

AB A one-dimensional numerical model of heat and water transport in freezing soils is developed by assuming that ice-water interfaces are not necessarily in equilibrium. The Clapeyron equation, which is derived from a static ice-water interface using the thermal equilibrium theory, cannot be readily applied to a dynamic system, such as freezing soils. Therefore, we handled the redistribution of liquid water with the Richard's equation. In this application, the sink term is replaced by the freezing rate of pore water, which is proportional to the extent of supercooling and available water content for freezing by a coefficient, . Three short-term laboratory column simulations show reasonable agreement with observations, with standard error of simulation on water content ranging between 0.007 and 0.011 cm(3) cm(-3), showing improved accuracy over other models that assume equilibrium ice-water interfaces. Simulation results suggest that when the freezing front is fixed at a specific depth, deviation of the ice-water interface from equilibrium, at this location, will increase with time. However, this deviation tends to weaken when the freezing front slowly penetrates to a greater depth, accompanied with thinner soils of significant deviation. The coefficient, , plays an important role in the simulation of heat and water transport. A smaller results in a larger deviation in the ice-water interface from equilibrium, and backward estimation of the freezing front. It also leads to an underestimation of water content in soils that were previously frozen by a rapid freezing rate, and an overestimation of water content in the rest of the soils.

AB We revisit the classic upscaling approach for predicting Darcy-scale colloid retention based on pore-scale processes, and explore the implicit assumption that retention is a Markov process. Whereas this assumption holds under favorable attachment conditions, it cannot be assumed to hold under unfavorable conditions due to accumulation of colloids in the near-surface fluid domain. We develop a novel link between two-layer mass transfer parameters and the topologies of the pore and collector domains, starting with an elegant outcome of classic colloid filtration theory: that the likelihood of mass transfer from the bulk- to the near-surface fluid domain depends strongly on colloid proximity to the forward flow stagnation axis of each collector (grain). Applying this concept to colloid mass transfer from the near-surface to the bulk fluid domain yields the conclusion that such mass transfer predominantly occurs at rear-flow stagnation zones on collector surfaces. We support this concept with experimental proof that the alignment of rear and forward flow stagnation zones influences colloid mass transfer to surfaces. Colloid accumulation in the near-surface fluid domain under unfavorable conditions may produce extended tailing of colloids during elution in Darcy-scale studies by: (1) long residence times of colloids in the near-surface fluid domain; (2) direct propagation of near-surface colloids from upstream to downstream collectors. The latter generates correlated motion that violates the assumed independence of colloid retention on history of transport. We suggest an approach to upscaling that accounts for the above-described influences of colloid-surface interactions and pore/collector domain topology.

AB Snow interception is a crucial hydrological process in cold regions needleleaf forests, but is rarely measured directly. Indirect estimates of snow interception can be made by measuring the difference in the increase in snow accumulation between the forest floor and a nearby clearing over the course of a storm. Pairs of automatic weather stations with acoustic snow depth sensors provide an opportunity to estimate this, if snow density can be estimated reliably. Three approaches for estimating fresh snow density were investigated: weighted post-storm density increments from the physically based Snobal model, fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature (Hedstrom, N. R., et al. [1998]. Hydrological Processes, 12, 1611-1625), and fresh snow density estimated empirically from air temperature and wind speed (Jordan, R. E., et al. [1999]. Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, 7785-7806). Automated snow depth observations from adjacent forest and clearing sites and estimated snow densities were used to determine snowstorm snow interception in a subalpine forest in the Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada. Then the estimated snow interception and measured interception information from a weighed, suspended tree and a time-lapse camera were assimilated into a model, which was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM), using Ensemble Kalman Filter or a simple rule-based direct insertion method. Interception determined using density estimates from the Hedstrom-Pomeroy fresh snow density equation agreed best with observations. Assimilating snow interception information from automatic snow depth measurements improved modelled snow interception timing by 7% and magnitude by 13%, compared to an open loop simulation driven by a numerical weather model; its accuracy was close to that simulated using locally observed meteorological data. Assimilation of tree-measured snow interception improved the snow interception simulation timing and magnitude by 18 and 19%, respectively. Time-lapse camera snow interception information assimilation improved the snow interception simulation timing by 32% and magnitude by 7%. The benefits of assimilation were greatly influenced by assimilation frequency and quality of the forcing data.

AB This study developed an alternative boundary element method (BEM) to simulate the transient flow behavior of groundwater induced by well extraction in a confined fractured aquifer containing a network of discrete or connected fractures. The matrix flow, network-fracture flow, and matrix-fracture fluid exchange were considered. The aquifer was treated as a heterogeneous whole that consisted of fracture and matrix blocks with locally homogeneous hydraulic properties. The fractures were explicitly represented to be of true finite volume rather than nonrepresentational line sources. A semianalytical solution was developed based on the theory of a BEM in the Laplace transform domain, but the analytical Green's function was used for the bounded domain rather than the free-space Green's function in a conventional BEM. Case studies were presented in order to investigate the flow exchange behavior between the matrix and fractures and the corresponding transient drawdown response. The results showed that (1) exchange flux distribution calculated with the classical infinitesimal fracture model was consistent with the difference of the normal drawdown derivative values on both sides of the fracture body in our model. (2) When the well was in the matrix, the fractures acted as both highly conductive conduits and leaky faults, and the drawdown derivative behaviors resembled the characteristics of a dual-porosity reservoir model. (3) When the well was in the network fracture and when the volume of fracture was of the same order of magnitude as the matrix, the drawdown derivative might exhibit the look-alike behavior of a dual-porosity model.

AB Previous measurements show mixed-wet behavior of tight siltstone core plugs, initially saturated with air. However, the same plugs show water-wet behavior when saturated with oil or water. This study aims at explaining these observations by investigating the effects of mineral heterogeneity and intermolecular forces acting on solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces. First, we conduct pore-scale visualizations to characterize the minerals surrounding the pores of the tight rock samples. Thin-section and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses show the existence of multimineral pores, which can be responsible for the mixed-wet behavior. Next, we apply the DLVO theory to investigate the intermolecular forces acting on solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces. We use disjoining pressure-distance profiles and contact angles calculated for different minerals to evaluate the stability of the thin film covering the rock grains and to explain the wettability of the core plugs during spontaneous imbibition tests. The disjoining pressure values calculated for the dry core plugs suggest similar wetting affinities toward oil and water. However, the contact angles calculated for the water-saturated core plugs suggest the water-wet behavior, which agrees with the countercurrent imbibition results. Finally, we measure the adhesion forces between the tip of a cantilever and (1) pure quartz slide, (2) pure calcite crystal, and (3) the rock thin section using an atomic force microscope. The values of adhesion forces measured for the thin section composed of multimineral pores are between those measured for pure quartz slide and pure calcite crystal.

AB Bayesian model selection or averaging objectively ranks a number of plausible, competing conceptual models based on Bayes' theorem. It implicitly performs an optimal trade-off between performance in fitting available data and minimum model complexity. The procedure requires determining Bayesian model evidence (BME), which is the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model's parameter space. The computation of this integral is highly challenging because it is as high-dimensional as the number of model parameters. Three classes of techniques to compute BME are available, each with its own challenges and limitations: (1) Exact and fast analytical solutions are limited by strong assumptions. (2) Numerical evaluation quickly becomes unfeasible for expensive models. (3) Approximations known as information criteria (ICs) such as the AIC, BIC, or KIC (Akaike, Bayesian, or Kashyap information criterion, respectively) yield contradicting results with regard to model ranking. Our study features a theory-based intercomparison of these techniques. We further assess their accuracy in a simplistic synthetic example where for some scenarios an exact analytical solution exists. In more challenging scenarios, we use a brute-force Monte Carlo integration method as reference. We continue this analysis with a real-world application of hydrological model selection. This is a first-time benchmarking of the various methods for BME evaluation against true solutions. Results show that BME values from ICs are often heavily biased and that the choice of approximation method substantially influences the accuracy of model ranking. For reliable model selection, bias-free numerical methods should be preferred over ICs whenever computationally feasible.

AB Sediment transport in mountain and gravel-bed-rivers is characterized by bedload transport of a wide range of grain sizes. When the bed is moving, dynamic void openings permit downward infiltration of the smaller particles. This process, termed here 'kinetic sieving', has been studied in industrial contexts, but more rarely in fluvial sediment transport. We present an experimental study of two-size mixtures of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by turbulent and supercritical steady water flows down a steep channel with a mobile bed. The particle diameters were 4 mm and 6 mm, and the channel inclination 10%. The spatial and temporal evolution of the segregating smaller 4 mm diameter particles was studied through the introduction of the smaller particles at a low constant rate into the large particle bedload flow at transport equilibrium. Particle flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Using original particle tracking algorithms, the position and velocity of both small and large particles were determined. Results include the time evolution of the layer of segregating smaller beads, assessment of segregation velocity and particle depth profiles. Segregation resulted in the progressive establishment of a quasi-continuous region of small particles reaching a steady-state penetration depth. The segregation dynamics showed a logarithmic time decreasing trend. This evolution was demonstrated to be dependent on the particle streamwise shear rate which decays downwards exponentially. This result is comparable to theories initially developed for dry granular flows.

   PERCOLATION; FLOW
AB Critical path analysis from percolation theory is used to calculate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K(S), of soils with pore space compatible with a (sometimes complex) fractal description. The fractal descriptions are chosen in accord with particle-size distributions of two soils at the US Department of Energy Hanford Site. One of the two soils exhibits a bimodal particle-size distribution, and is treated as a "dual" fractal. The results are then compared with measured hydraulic properties of these two soils. The analysis yields excellent agreement with experiment over 4-6 orders of magnitude in most investigated properties without use of fitting parameters. It is possible to show that such unusual phenomena as a sudden increase in the spread of K values with reduction of matric potential can be traced to effects of a bimodal distribution of pore sizes. The least certain parameter for calculation of K is the "critical volume fraction", alpha(c), which describes the minimum water content for which an interconnected network of capillary flow exists. The values deduced for alpha(c) however, allow consistent interpretation in both soils investigated (in contrast to fitted values of a "residual moisture content" obtained by application of the van Genuchten function). Further, values of alpha(c) obtained correspond well with threshold moisture contents for solute diffusion reported elsewhere, evidence for the relevance of percolation to dispersion.

AB We estimate a cost function for a water treatment plant in Ohio to assess the avoided-treatment costs resulting from improved source water quality. Regulations and source water concerns motivated the treatment plant to upgrade its treatment process by adding a granular activated carbon building in 2012. The cost function uses daily observations from 2013 to 2016; this allows us to compare the results to a cost function estimated for 2007-2011 for the same plant. Both models focus on understanding the relationship between treatment costs per 1,000 gallons (per 3.79 m(3)) of produced drinking water and predictor variables such as turbidity, pH, total organic carbon, deviations from target pool elevation, final production, and seasonal variables. Different from the 2007-2011 model, the 2013-2016 model includes a harmful algal bloom toxin variable. We find that the new treatment process leads to a different cost model than the one that covers 2007-2011. Both total organic carbon and algal toxin are important drivers for the 2013-2016 treatment costs. This reflects a significant increase in cyanobacteria cell densities capable of producing toxins in the source water between time periods. The 2013-2016 model also reveals that positive and negative shocks to treatment costs affect volatility, the changes in the variance of costs through time, differently. Positive shocks, or increased costs, lead to higher volatility compared to negative shocks, or decreased costs, of similar magnitude. After quantifying the changes in treatment costs due to changes in source water quality, we discuss how the study results inform policy-relevant decisions.

ID NONSORBING SOLUTES; WATER; FLOW; MODEL
AB Hyporheic exchange (HE) is the exchange between surface water, including suspended and dissolved matter, and pore water in the sediment surrounding a stream. It is essential to physicochemical and biological processes in both the stream and the surrounding sediment. This study systematically investigated the effects of the stream characteristics (i.e., stream discharge, bedform amplitude and wavelength, stream bed slope and groundwater flow) on the characteristics of HE (i.e., flowrate, scale, and residence time) in a straight pool-riffle stream with floodplain using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The HE in the stream bank and streambed and its controlling factors were evaluated using numerical models. The results show that the HE flowrate and volume in the stream banks (i.e., in the floodplain) and streambed are significant and comparable at a high discharge. The discharge, bedform amplitude and bed slope directly affect the flow state in the pool, and the flow state determines the patterns of the effects of these three factors on the HE flowrate. The HE flowrate shows a linear relationship with discharge and bed slope when the surface flow in the pool remains subcritical. If the flow state in the pool changes from subcritical to supercritical conditions as discharge or bed slope increase, the HE flowrate becomes non-monotonic with discharge and it first increases and then decreases with increasing bed slope. The flowrate, scale, and flux-weighted mean residence time of HE linearly increase with bedform wavelength and exponentially decrease with both gaining and losing groundwater flow, independent of discharge.

AB Topography is critical information for water resources management in lakes, and remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate topography in ungauged regions. We introduce here a new method that estimates nearshore topography of water bodies based on a flood frequency map and time series of water levels by assuming the equivalence between flood frequency and water level exceedance probability at a given area. Test cases are performed for two lakes and 12 hydropower reservoirs using the proposed Flood2Topo app. This new application generates the bottom level pixel by pixel and level-area-active storage relationship directly from the topography map, without the need to fit functions. Flood extent estimates from the Landsat based Global Surface Water (GSW) data set, the current state-of-the-art, were used to run Flood2Topo, together with water levels from satellite altimetry and in situ gauges. Results show bottom level root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 18.5 and 146 cm for Lake Poopo (Bolivia) and Lake Curuai (Amazon basin), respectively. For reservoir active storage, RMSD normalized values ranged from 2% to 11% for 11 reservoirs (average NRMSD of 6.4%). The method can be applied to any seasonally flooded area using any data set. Considering the surface water occurrence map from the GSW data set, the method is applicable to 35.8% (86%) of the global seasonally flooded areas delimited by flood frequencies between 0 and 95% (99%) over 35 years. The flood frequency-based method is a promising tool for obtaining data for hydrodynamic simulations and monitoring of ungauged water bodies.

TI Repeated Subsurface Thermal Profiling to Reveal Temporal Variability in

ID TEMPERATURE-DEPTH PROFILES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RECHARGE; FLUXES; WATER;
   HEAT
AB Reliably quantifying groundwater fluxes to and from confined aquifers in sedimentary basins is increasingly recognized as a critical challenge that impedes sustainable groundwater management. One approach to quantify such fluxes is through the analysis of deep (e.g., >50 m) borehole thermal profiles penetrating through aquifer-aquitard systems. Recently developed methods to interpret such data exploit the relationship between vertical groundwater flow and the downward propagation of surface temperature disturbances resulting from climate warming. In this note, we advance beyond prior studies that assumed steady-state groundwater flow by demonstrating how hydrogeological regime shifts on decadal time scales can be quantitatively inferred from temperature-depth profiles (TDPs). We use a set of repeated temperature- depth profiles from one site in an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system, recorded in 1980 and 2016/2018 to tentatively infer a minimum of a threefold increase in groundwater downwelling to deeper aquifers (i.e., from 100 to 350 mm/year). The enhanced flux likely results from intensified, deep groundwater abstraction in the vicinity since the mid-1980s. We reach this conclusion through analyzing the occurrence and downward propagation of the minimum temperature in the profiles as well as the temporal trend in deeper groundwater temperatures. We conclude that repeated temperature-depth profiles can be suitable to archive hydrogeological changes. Our results provide the impetus for more systematic collection of present-day TDPs to provide a historical benchmark from which to assess future groundwater flow alterations, especially in areas that lack traditional aquifer monitoring via hydraulic head measurements.

AB Heat as a tracer is frequently used to quantify Darcy fluxes across the groundwater-surface water interface. Often quantified through the analysis of diurnal or annual periodic temperature signals, these temperature time series methods rely on the advective transport of heat by flowing water perturbing the periodic conducted heat signal. Multiple methodologies have been developed that rely on temperature time series data collected from at least two unique depths a set distance apart. However, the lower limits at which these methods can no longer reliably quantify a Darcy flux are not well established. To examine these lower limits, synthetic temperature time series data were generated using a numerical model for various combinations of head gradients, sensor spacing, and thermal properties of the sediment. Darcy fluxes were subsequently quantified using the combined method and directly compared to prescribed Darcy fluxes. The dimensionless Peclet number, representing the ratio of advective to conductive heat flux, was used to establish threshold values at which the combined amplitude ratio and phase shift method was no longer able to reliably quantify a Darcy flux. The lowest recharge Darcy flux that can be quantified ranges from 0.07 to 0.2 m/day, dependent on the resolution of the sensor used to collect data, a narrower range than previously reported. When transitioning to a field setting, where the accuracy of Darcy fluxes is not known, a newly developed relationship between the true and inferred Peclet numbers can be used to evaluate quantified Darcy fluxes for accuracy.

AB It is often assumed that large shallow water bodies are net sediment nondepositional annually and that if they have nutrient loads from multiple sources, those loads are quickly homogenized before exiting the water bodies. Where this is not the case, it impacts understanding and predicting consequences of nutrient load reductions, both for the water body and for those downstream of it. We applied a three-dimensional ecological model to a large shallow lake, Lake St. Clair (US/Canada), to quantify the total and dissolved reactive phosphorus (TP and DRP) transport and retention, and construct tributary-specific relationships between phosphorus load to the lake and the amount of phosphorus that leaves the lake for the three major tributaries. Lake St. Clair is situated between the St. Clair and Detroit rivers, the latter enters Lake Erie. Efforts to reduce Lake Erie's re-eutrophication requires an understanding of nutrient transport and retention in each of its subwatersheds including those that feed indirectly via Lake St. Clair. We found that over the simulation period, the lake retained a significant portion of TP (17%) and DRP (35%) load and that TP and DRP retention was spatially variable and largely controlled by a combination of lake depth, resuspension, and plankton uptake. Compared to the Clinton and Sydenham rivers, the Thames River contributed a larger proportion of its load to the lake's outflow. However, because the lake's load is dominated by the St. Clair River, 40% reductions of nutrients from those subwatersheds will result in less than a 5% reduction in the load to Lake Erie.

AB Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.

DE machine learning; proxy model
ID RESERVOIR; DISTANCES; ROTATION
AB Approximate models (proxies) can be employed to reduce the computational costs of estimating uncertainty. The price to pay is that the approximations introduced by the proxy model can lead to a biased estimation. To avoid this problem and ensure a reliable uncertainty quantification, we propose to combine functional data analysis and machine learning to build error models that allow us to obtain an accurate prediction of the exact response without solving the exact model for all realizations. We build the relationship between proxy and exact model on a learning set of geostatistical realizations for which both exact and approximate solvers are run. Functional principal components analysis (FPCA) is used to investigate the variability in the two sets of curves and reduce the dimensionality of the problem while maximizing the retained information. Once obtained, the error model can be used to predict the exact response of any realization on the basis of the sole proxy response. This methodology is purpose-oriented as the error model is constructed directly for the quantity of interest, rather than for the state of the system. Also, the dimensionality reduction performed by FPCA allows a diagnostic of the quality of the error model to assess the informativeness of the learning set and the fidelity of the proxy to the exact model. The possibility of obtaining a prediction of the exact response for any newly generated realization suggests that the methodology can be effectively used beyond the context of uncertainty quantification, in particular for Bayesian inference and optimization.

AB Noble gases are useful tracers for constraining groundwater recharge temperature and elevation, critical in determining source areas of groundwater recharge in mountainous terrain. A monitoring network in the alpine Brighton Basin in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah, USA, was established to examine the relationship between air temperatures, ground temperatures, and noble gas groundwater recharge temperatures. Maximum noble gas groundwater recharge temperatures computed using the closed-system equilibration model from 25 samples collected over the 2 year period 2007 to 2009 averaged 2.9 +/- 6 1.2 degrees C, within the experimental error of the mean ground temperature of 2.3 degrees C measured within the probable recharge area. Maximum noble gas recharge temperatures vary from 0 to 7 degrees C, also comparable to ground temperature variations in the region. Groundwater ages in the collected samples vary from 0 to 7 years indicating changing flow paths to the collection site during the experiment. Mean ground temperatures in the upper 1 m of soil over the 2 year time period is 2.3 degrees C, which is 1 degrees C cooler than the mean surface air temperature extrapolated from a nearby meteorological station. This comparison contradicts an earlier observation that mean annual ground temperatures in central Utah are generally warmer than air temperatures. The offset in the Brighton Basin is explained by modeling a snow effect on ground temperature. This detailed study suggests that interpretation of groundwater recharge temperatures derived from noble gases should be attentive to the complex local ground temperature effects in the recharge areas.

AB [1] The paper deals with numerical studies of basin-scale dynamics of soil moisture in arbitrarily heterogeneous conditions (i.e., in presence of heterogeneity of climate, soil, vegetation and land use). Its relevance stems from comparative analysis of the probabilistic structure of spatially averaged soil moisture fields with the corresponding exact solutions of the underlying simplified stochastic point processes. The probabilistic structure of coarse-grained soil moisture fields is largely controlled by temporal fluctuations of intermittent rainfall fields. Averaged properties are also affected by heterogeneous soil and vegetation features and by the spatial scale of aggregation. Here, we employ results from extended Montecarlo simulations of a continuous model of the hydrologic response that proved suitable to describe observed events. The comparison of numerically derived soil moisture probability density functions with exact simplified solutions suggests, somewhat unexpectedly, that the analytical model can reasonably describe the large-scale behavior of spatially-averaged hydrologic fluxes through physically meaningful, basin-scale soil and vegetation parameters. The application of a seasonally variable, stochastic climate model shows pronounced daily fluctuations in the relationship between water losses and soil moisture, related to the underlying climatic fluctuations. The resulting spatially averaged soil moisture probability density functions in heterogeneous catchments, however, do not show appreciable differences with respect to the ones obtained assuming constant mean climate conditions. We thus conclude that effective basin-scale states, which average highly heterogeneous (spatial/temporal) properties allowing exact probabilistic descriptions, indeed exist, with implications for large scale estimates of soil-atmosphere interactions.

AB The aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of physically based models using the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the simulation of rain-induced runoff. A key expectation of these models is to be able to reproduce properly both hydrograph at the outlet of the watershed and the associated velocity field within the spatial domain for a given rain event. However, this ability can be very challenging in mountainous environments, which include heterogeneous and high values of bottom slope and transient rain inputs. In this paper, we focused on both the error due to the numerical resolution of the SWE for low water depths runoff on steep slopes and that due to the physical representation of friction on the bottom for various water depth to roughness height ratios. Four test cases have been used, at different scales, to evaluate the model in comparison with experimental data. The first test case (from Kirstetter et al. (2015)) was a rain induced flow in a straight channel. It allows to evaluate the error made for the chosen numerical resolution of the SWE and its impact on the velocity distribution in the domain (metric scale). A criterion defining an acceptable numerical error has been proposed. A second test case (from Cea et al. (2014)), has been chosen for being also metric scaled and in the right range of the numerical error criterion. It allowed to evaluate the ability of a new friction law (adapted from Lawrence (1997)) to represent the measured velocity field in several inundation regimes at the metric scale. The third test case was a 40 m 2 real plot studied by Tatard et al. (2008). On this test case, measured velocities have been compared with the simulated ones. Thanks to an infiltration source term added to the mass conservation equation, hydrographs at the outlet of the plot have been well reproduced, as well as the main part (including the highest values) of the measured velocities. In particular, the velocities are well represented when the criterion given in the first test case is satisfied. Finally, the model is applied to a real watershed with an area of 1 km(2) on which hydrographs at the outlet have been successfully reproduced for two extreme rainy events (Le Bouteiller et al., 2015). It appeared that both physical and numerical error were low in the hydrographic network and that the local velocities are correctly reproduced there, unlike in the hillslopes where the velocities are not well reproduced even if the mass fluxes are correct.

AB A hydrogeological dataset often includes substantial deviations that need to be inspected. In the present study, three outlier identification methods the three sigma rule (3 sigma), inter quantile range (IQR), and median absolute deviation (MAD) that take advantage of the ensemble regression method are proposed by considering non-Gaussian characteristics of groundwater data. For validation purposes, the performance of the methods is compared using simulated and actual groundwater data with a few hypothetical conditions. In the validations using simulated data, all of the proposed methods reasonably identify outliers at a 5% outlier level; whereas, only the IQR method performs well for identifying outliers at a 30% outlier level. When applying the methods to real groundwater data, the outlier identification performance of the IQR method is found to be superior to the other two methods. However, the IQR method shows limitation by identifying excessive false outliers, which may be overcome by its joint application with other methods (for example, the 3 sigma rule and MAD methods). The proposed methods can be also applied as potential tools for the detection of future anomalies by model training based on currently available data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigate the catchment controls on mean concentrations and export patterns (concentration-discharge relationship, C-Q slope) of river chemistry, using a long-term data set of up to 507 sites spanning five climate zones (i.e., arid, Mediterranean, temperate, subtropical, tropical) across the Australian continent. We use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and hierarchical modeling (BHM) approaches to predict the mean concentrations and export patterns and compare the relative importance of 26 catchment characteristics (e.g., topography, climate, land use, land cover, soil properties and hydrology). Our results demonstrate that mean concentrations result from the interaction of catchment indicators and anthropogenic factors (i.e., land use, topography and soil), while export patterns are influenced by topography. We also found that incorporating the effects of climate zones in a BHM framework improved the predictability of both mean concentrations and C-Q slopes, suggesting the importance of climatic controls on hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Our study provides insights into the contrasting effects of catchment controls across different climate zones. Investigating those controls can inform sustainable water quality management strategies that consider the potential changes in river chemistry state and export behavior.

AB Soil depth is an important input parameter in hydrological and ecological modeling. Presently, the soil depth data available in national soil databases (STATSGO and SSURGO) from the Natural Resources Conservation Service are provided as averages within generalized land units ( map units). Spatial uncertainty within these units limits their applicability for distributed modeling in complex terrain. This work reports statistical models for prediction of soil depth in a semiarid mountainous watershed that are based upon the relationship between soil depth and topographic and land cover attributes. Soil depth was surveyed by driving a rod into the ground until refusal at locations selected to represent the topographic and land cover variation in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho. The soil depth survey consisted of a model calibration set, measured at 819 locations over 8 subwatersheds representing topographic and land cover variability and a model testing set, measured at 130 more broadly distributed locations in the watershed. Many model input variables were developed for regression to the field data. Topographic attributes were derived from a digital elevation model. Land cover attributes were derived from Landsat remote sensing images and high-resolution aerial photographs. Generalized additive and random forests models were developed to predict soil depth over the watershed. They were able to explain about 50% of the soil depth spatial variation, which is an important improvement over the soil depth extracted from the SSURGO national soil database.

AB [1] The primary advantage of radar observations of precipitation compared with traditional rain gauge measurements is their high spatial and temporal resolution and large areal coverage. Unfortunately, radar data require vigorous quality control before being converted into precipitation products that can be used as input to hydrologic models. In this study we coupled a physically based atmospheric model of convective rainfall with an active microwave radiative transfer model to simulate radar observation of thunderstorms. We used the atmospheric model to simulate a well-documented tornadic supercell storm that occurred near Del City, Oklahoma, on 20 May 1977. We then generated radar observations of that storm and used them to evaluate the propagation of radar rainfall errors through distributed hydrologic simulations. This physically based methodology allows us to directly examine the impact of radar rainfall estimation errors on land-surface hydrologic predictions and to avoid the limitations imposed by the use of rain gauge data. Results indicate that the geometry of the radar beam and coordinate transformations, due to radar-watershed-storm orientation, have an effect on radar rainfall estimation and runoff prediction errors. In addition to uncertainty in the radar reflectivity versus rainfall intensity relationship, there are significant range-dependent and orientation-related radar rainfall estimation errors that should be quantified in terms of their impact on runoff predictions. Our methodology provides a tool for performing experiments that address some operational issues related to the process of radar rainfall estimation and its uses in hydrologic prediction.

AB Air temperature can be an effective predictor of stream temperature. However, little work has been done in studying urban impacts on air-stream relationships in groundwater-fed headwater streams in mountainous watersheds. We applied wavelet coherence analysis to two 13-month continuous (1hr interval) stream and air temperature datasets collected at Boone Creek, an urban stream, and Winkler Creek, a forest stream, in northwestern North Carolina. The main advantage of a wavelet coherence analysis approach is the ability to analyse non-stationary dynamics for the temporal covariance between air and stream temperature over time and at multiple temporal scales (e.g. hours, days, weeks and months). The coherence is both time and scale-dependent. Our research indicated that air temperature generally co-varied with stream temperature at time scales greater than 0.5day. The correlation was poor during the winter at the scales of 1 to 64days and summer at the scales of 1.5 to 4days, respectively. The empirical models that relate air temperature to stream temperature failed at these scales and during these periods. Finally, urbanization altered the air-stream temperature correlation at intermediate time scales ranging from 2 to 12days. The correlation at the urban creek increased at the 12-day scale, whereas it decreased at scales of 2 to 7days as compared with the forested stream, which is probably due to heated surface runoff during summer thunderstorms or leaking stormwater or wastewater collection systems. Our results provide insights into air-stream temperature relationships over both time and scale domains. Identifying controls over time and scales are needed to predict water temperature to understand the future impacts that interacting climate and land use changes will have on aquatic ecosystem in river networks.

AB The lack of high resolution precipitation data has posed great challenges to the study and management of extreme rainfall events. Satellite-based rainfall products with large areal coverage provide a potential alternative source of data where in situ measurements are not available. However, the mismatch in scale between these products and model requirements has limited their application and demonstrates that satellite data must be downscaled before being used. This study developed a statistical spatial downscaling scheme based on the relationships between precipitation and related environmental factors such as local topography and pre-storm meteorological conditions. The method was applied to disaggregate the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 products, which have a resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees,to 1 x 1 km gridded rainfall fields. The TRMM datasets in accord with six rainstorm events in the Xiao River basin were used to validate the effectiveness of this approach. The downscaled precipitation data were compared with ground observations and exhibited good agreement with r(2) values ranging from 0.612 to 0.838. In addition, the proposed approach provided better results than the conventional spline and kriging interpolation methods, indicating its promise in the management of extreme rainfall events. The uncertainties in the final results and the implications for further study were discussed, and the needs for additional rigorous investigations of the rainfall physical process prior to institutionalizing the use of satellite data were highlighted.

AB In companion paper 1, the SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) satellite data set integration approach was presented. SAWC accounts for (1) the closure of the water budget at the sub-basin scale by (2) using upstream/downstream dependencies. Here, the SAWC database is used to reconstruct a missing water component. The total water storage change (dS) can be reconstructed prior to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) period. In terms of seasonal and interannual variations, SAWC provides long-term dS estimates that are highly consistent with the GRACE estimate (2002-2015). When compared to the extent of inundation, correlation of anomalies reaches 0.6 over sub-basins presenting large floodplain. A strong relationship (correlation of 0.7) exists between the monthly dS and the El Nino index. The river discharge R can also be estimated using the SAWC approach during the GRACE period. A scheme was developed to estimate R continuously along the river through the indirect interpolation of discharge station measurements by using satellite estimates of dS, precipitation P, and evaporation E. These R estimates along the river were evaluated with 80 independent measurements and had a correlation of 0.86 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency index of 0.71. A comprehensive monthly river discharge estimate was proposed for the first time across the Amazon basin over 13 years (2002-2015) at a 0.25 degrees resolution. The SAWC framework is a pure observation tool for integrating a large range of satellite estimates, potentially facilitating the assimilation of such data into land surface models.

AB In this study, the influence of varying temperatures on the transport behavior of conservative solutes in heterogeneous porous media has been investigated. Column flow experiments employing potassium bromide as tracer were conducted at four temperature levels (3 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 30 degrees C) and the measured electrical conductivity (EC) signal was interpreted through inverse modeling. Additional experiments were performed with deuterium-enriched water at 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C. For those experiments, deuterium isotope ratios were analyzed alongside anion and cation concentrations. Obtained EC-based breakthrough curves showed measurable differences in both the observed peak values and tailing intensities that could be clearly attributed to variations in the experimental temperatures. The EC-based results were further corroborated by the measured isotope ratios and corresponding anion/cation concentrations, although measured differences were less pronounced. The model-based interpretation of the results employed the standard advection-dispersion equation as well as three alternative variants that were all based on the single-rate dual-domain mass transfer (DDMT) approach, but embracing varying coupling intensities between the experiments. For all variants transport parameters were determined for EC, bromide, and deuterium, respectively. The estimated ranges of the transport parameters all point toward a direct correlation between the effective DDMT rates and the experimental temperature. The observed correlation directly follows the Arrhenius relationship, but is weaker than the one describing the temperature dependence of the molecular diffusion coefficients, therefore pointing to a contribution of non-diffusive components.

AB \ Adequate description of hydraulic variables based on a sample of field measurements is challenging in coarse-bed streams, a consequence of high spatial heterogeneity in flow properties that arises due to the complexity of channel boundary. By applying a resampling procedure based on bootstrapping to an extensive field data set, we have estimated sampling variability and its relationship with sample size in relation to two common methods of representing flow characteristics, spatially averaged velocity profiles and fitted probability distributions. The coefficient of variation in bed shear stress and roughness length estimated from spatially averaged velocity profiles and in shape and scale parameters of gamma distribution fitted to local values of bed shear stress, velocity, and depth was high, reaching 15-20% of the parameter value even at the sample size of 100 (sampling density 1 m(-2)). We illustrated implications of these findings with two examples. First, sensitivity analysis of a 2-D hydrodynamic model to changes in roughness length parameter showed that the sampling variability range observed in our resampling procedure resulted in substantially different frequency distributions and spatial patterns of modeled hydraulic variables. Second, using a bedload formula, we showed that propagation of uncertainty in the parameters of a gamma distribution used to model bed shear stress led to the coefficient of variation in predicted transport rates exceeding 50%. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of reporting the precision of estimated hydraulic parameters. When such estimates serve as input into models, uncertainty propagation should be explicitly accounted for by running ensemble simulations.

AB Water table depth (WTD), soil texture, and growing season weather conditions all play critical roles in determining agricultural yield; however, the interactions among these three variables have never been explored in a systematic way. Using a combination of field observations and biophysical modeling, we answer two questions: (1) under what conditions can a shallow water table provide a groundwater yield subsidy and/or penalty to corn production?; and (2) how do soil texture and growing season weather conditions influence the relationship between WTD and corn yield?. Subfield-scale yield patterns during a dry (2012) and wet (2013) growing season are used to identify sensitivity to weather. Areas of the field that are negatively impacted by wet growing seasons have the shallowest observed WTD (< 1 m), while areas with consistently strong yield have intermediate WTD (1-3 m). Parts of the field that perform consistently poorly are characterized by deep WTD (> 3 m) and coarse soil textures. Modeling results find that beneficial impacts of shallow groundwater are more common than negative impacts under the conditions studied, and that the optimum WTD is shallower in coarser soils. While groundwater yield subsidies have a higher frequency and magnitude in coarse-grained soils, the optimum WTD responds to growing season weather at a relatively constant rate across soil types. We conclude that soil texture defines a baseline upon which WTD and weather interact to determine overall yield. Our work has implications for water resource management, climate/land use change impacts on agricultural production, and precision agriculture.

AB Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.

TI Wavelet-based multiresolution analysis of Wivenhoe Dam water
   temperatures
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATION
AB Water temperature measurements from Wivenhoe Dam offer a unique opportunity for studying fluctuations of temperatures in a subtropical dam as a function of time and depth. Cursory examination of the data indicate a complicated structure across both time and depth. We propose simplifying the task of describing these data by breaking the time series at each depth into physically meaningful components that individually capture daily, subannual, and annual (DSA) variations. Precise definitions for each component are formulated in terms of a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis. The DSA components are approximately pairwise uncorrelated within a given depth and between different depths. They also satisfy an additive property in that their sum is exactly equal to the original time series. Each component is based upon a set of coefficients that decomposes the sample variance of each time series exactly across time and that can be used to study both time-varying variances of water temperature at each depth and time-varying correlations between temperatures at different depths. Each DSA component is amenable for studying a certain aspect of the relationship between the series at different depths. The daily component in general is weakly correlated between depths, including those that are adjacent to one another. The subannual component quantifies seasonal effects and in particular isolates phenomena associated with the thermocline, thus simplifying its study across time. The annual component can be used for a trend analysis. The descriptive analysis provided by the DSA decomposition is a useful precursor to a more formal statistical analysis.

TI Estimation of the lateral correlation structure of subsurface water
   content from surface-based ground-penetrating radar reflection images
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CRUSTAL HETEROGENEITY; WAVE-FIELDS; PARAMETERS
AB Over the past decade, significant interest has been expressed in relating the spatial statistics of surface-based reflection ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to those of the imaged subsurface volume. A primary motivation for this work is that changes in the radar wave velocity, which largely control the character of the observed data, are expected to be related to corresponding changes in subsurface water content. Although previous work has indeed indicated that the spatial statistics of GPR images are linked to those of the water content distribution of the probed region, a viable method for quantitatively analyzing the GPR data and solving the corresponding inverse problem has not yet been presented. Here we address this issue by first deriving a relationship between the 2-D autocorrelation of a water content distribution and that of the corresponding GPR reflection image. We then show how a Bayesian inversion strategy based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used to estimate the posterior distribution of subsurface correlation model parameters that are consistent with the GPR data. Our results indicate that if the underlying assumptions are valid and we possess adequate prior knowledge regarding the water content distribution, in particular its vertical variability, this methodology allows not only for the reliable recovery of lateral correlation model parameters but also for estimates of parameter uncertainties. In the case where prior knowledge regarding the vertical variability of water content is not available, the results show that the methodology still reliably recovers the aspect ratio of the heterogeneity.

AB Frozen ground influences subsurface hydrology by reducing soil permeability, impeding infiltration, and inducing surface runoff. As the seasonal snowpack strongly controls the evolution of the ground thermal regime, it is necessary to represent the snowpack in models simulating frozen ground and its hydrologic consequences. Conventional understanding of the relationship between snowcover and frozen ground considers the snowpack as an insulator, shielding the ground from cold winter temperatures and thus inhibiting frozen ground. However, observations and modeling at Niwot Ridge, a seasonally snow-covered alpine catchment in the headwaters of the Boulder Creek watershed, illustrate that snowpack cold content can promote and preserve frozen ground beneath the snowpack during the snowmelt season, unlike bare ground patches that thaw relatively rapidly due to exposure to solar radiation and warm spring temperatures. We present results from a coupled snowpack and subsurface thermo-hydrologic model including freeze-thaw processes that captures these contrasts reasonably well. Our results suggest that the cold snowpack at this site acts as a heat sink and promotes frozen ground, in contrast to the conventional understanding of the snowpack as an insulator. In the subalpine zone, infiltration simulations show that shallow freezing beneath snow-covered ground has a much stronger effect on infiltration than shallow freezing beneath bare ground because the soil beneath the snow remained frozen during snowmelt, whereas bare patches thawed by the time they received excess snowmelt run-on.

AB Continental-scale river hydrodynamic modeling helps to understand the global hydrological cycle, and model evaluation is essential for calibration and performance assessment. Although many models have been evaluated using several variables separately, methods for the integrated multivariable assessment have yet to be established. We proposed an integrated multivariable evaluation method and an overall basin skill score (OSK) metric, which integrates the sub-basin skill score, calculated by combining multiple variables' normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values. The sub-basin approach and OSK assess the model performance at the sub-basin and basin scales and overcome the observation-related limitations of different spatial dimensions. Evaluation of the CaMa-Flood global river model for the Amazon Basin considering three variables (discharge, water surface elevation, and flooded area) and two baseline topography data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain (MERIT) digital elevation models (DEMs)), shows that the proposed methodology can overcome the limitation of single-variable evaluation in identifying multiple best parameter sets due to low sensitivity. CaMa-Flood considering MERIT DEM achieves a single optimal parameter set with a maximum OSK of 0.57 compared with 0.52 for the SRTM DEM, and it shows the importance of accuracy of topography data for improvement in the performance of river hydrodynamic modeling. The proposed multivariable integrated evaluation with better topography data proved to help reduce equifinality and estimate the best parameter by maintaining the physical relationships among variables.

AB Ensemble smoother (ES) has been widely used in various research fields to reduce the uncertainty of the system-of-interest. However, the commonly adopted ES method that employs the Kalman formula, that is, ES(K), does not perform well when the probability distributions involved are non-Gaussian. To address this issue, we suggest to use deep learning (DL) to derive an alternative analysis scheme for ES in non-Gaussian data assimilation problems. Here we show that the DL-based ES method, that is, ES(DL), is more general and flexible. In this new scheme, a high volume of training data is generated from a relatively small-sized ensemble of model parameters and simulation outputs, and possible non-Gaussian features can be preserved in the training data and captured by an adequate DL model. This new variant of ES is tested in two subsurface characterization problems with or without the Gaussian assumption. Results indicate that ES(DL) can produce similar (in the Gaussian case) or even better (in the non-Gaussian case) results compared to those from ES(K). The success of ES(DL) comes from the power of DL in extracting complex (including non-Gaussian) features and learning nonlinear relationships from massive amounts of training data. Although in this work we only apply the ES(DL) method in parameter estimation problems, the proposed idea can be conveniently extended to analysis of model structural uncertainty and state estimation in real-time forecasting problems.

AB Land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction has numerous negative consequences, such as loss of groundwater storage and damage to infrastructure. Understanding the magnitude, timing, and locations of land subsidence, as well as the mechanisms driving it, is crucial to implementing mitigation strategies, yet the complex, nonlinear processes causing subsidence are difficult to quantify. Physical models relating groundwater flux to aquifer compaction exist but require substantial hydrological data sets and are time consuming to calibrate. Land deformation can be measured using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and GPS, but the former is computationally expensive to estimate at scale and is subject to tropospheric and ionospheric errors, and the latter leaves many temporal and spatial gaps. In this study, we apply for the first time a machine learning approach that quantifies the relationships of various widely available input data, including evapotranspiration, land use, and sediment thickness, with land subsidence. We apply this method over the Western United States and estimate that from 2015 to 2016, similar to 2.0 km(3)/yr of groundwater storage was lost due to groundwater pumping-induced compaction of sediments. Subsidence is concentrated in the Central Valley of California, and the state of California accounts for 75% of total subsidence in the Western United States. Other significant areas of subsidence occur in cultivated regions of the Basin and Range province. This study demonstrates that widely available ancillary data can be used to estimate subsidence at a larger scale than has been previously possible.

AB The depth-averaged (2D) lubrication theory is often adopted to simulate Newtonian flow in rough fractures. This approach, which is computationally much less expensive than using 3D CFD solvers, allows addressing large ensembles of stochastic fracture realizations. For creeping flow, the degree of approximation introduced is limited as long as the apertures vary relatively smoothly. We propose the first generalization of this approach addressing the flow of fluids whose rheology, described by the Ellis model, is shear-thinning (ST) above a crossover shear stress and Newtonian (of viscosity mu(0)) below. The resulting nonlinear Reynolds equation for pressures is solved for a vast range of realistic rheological parameter values using a novel and specifically designed finite volume-based numerical model. The spatial discretization takes inspiration from the graph p-Laplacian to yield a symmetric Newton Jacobian, allowing for a highly efficient inexact implementation of the preconditioned conjugate gradient-based Newton-Krylov method. This is combined with a parameter continuation strategy to increase code robustness and ensure global convergence for flow indices as low as 0.1 with an excellent efficiency. This original solver is used to investigate realistic synthetic rough fracture geometries, which exhibits both self-affinity and a correlation length. The results show that the ST rheology mitigates the effects of aperture heterogeneities, increasing fracture transmissivity by several orders of magnitudes as compared to the Newtonian flow of viscosity mu(0) if the imposed macroscopic gradient is sufficiently large, and even rendering the rough fracture up to 10 times more permeable than a smooth fracture of identical mean aperture.

AB Agricultural production is accompanied by a large amount of water consumption, nonpoint source pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of associated impacts on regional water, the environment, and the economy caused by variations in agricultural distribution is insufficient. This paper evaluates the evolution of grain production distribution and its effects on water resources, the economy, and the environment in China by using virtual water theory. The results show that the grain production area located in northern China is characterized by scarce water resources and a less developed economy. Due to the imbalance between grain supply and demand, virtual water embedded in grain will transfer among regions. These flows have formed a pattern where virtual water transfers from the water-scarce northern region to the water-rich southern region, increasing from 72.99 Gm(3) in 1997 to 124.64 Gm(3) in 2014. Evolution of grain production distribution changes the spatial pattern of grain production and consumption, and it exacerbates water resource pressure, the gray water footprint, and greenhouse gas emissions in the area that exports grain virtual water. The gray water footprint and carbon emissions in the grain export area increased by 10.66% and 31.06% during the study period, respectively. Meanwhile, the distribution of regional grain production influences the allocation of water resources in agriculture and other industries. Due to the difference between the economic benefits created by industry and agriculture, grain virtual water flow will have effects on the regional economic development.

AB A growing worldwide body of literature is demonstrating the geomorphic and ecological roles played by wood in rivers. After more than a century of removing wood from rivers in many parts of the world, researchers and managers are now interested in returning the load of wood back to a more natural condition. The mechanical placement of wood in rivers is expensive, and so it is useful to know how long it will take for in-stream wood loads to passively recover a target load by recruitment from riparian forests. Of fundamental interest to managers and researchers alike are the questions: (1) can a river passively recover to a preremoval load of wood, and (2) if so, how long will recovery take? We address these questions using the example of the anabranching King River, Northeast Victoria, Australia, which was desnagged twice: once in 1957 and again in 1980. We predict a recovery time of 25523years using a complete census of recovering wood loads to develop and parameterize a mass balance delivery model run in a Monte Carlo simulation. Our results indicate that with a healthy supply of riparian vegetation and minimal interference from managers, rivers are likely to passively recover natural wood loads at least two and a half centuries after desnagging. Using the data and methods described in this paper, we develop a theory of recovery, conceptually describing the recovery process as a sequence of five stages that can be used to monitor and track wood loads through time.

AB The ever increasing pace of computational power, along with continued advances in measurement technologies and improvements in process understanding has stimulated the development of increasingly complex hydrologic models that simulate soil moisture flow, groundwater recharge, surface runoff, root water uptake, and river discharge at different spatial and temporal scales. Reconciling these high-order system models with perpetually larger volumes of field data is becoming more and more difficult, particularly because classical likelihood-based fitting methods lack the power to detect and pinpoint deficiencies in the model structure. Gupta et al. (2008) has recently proposed steps (amongst others) toward the development of a more robust and powerful method of model evaluation. Their diagnostic approach uses signature behaviors and patterns observed in the input-output data to illuminate to what degree a representation of the real world has been adequately achieved and how the model should be improved for the purpose of learning and scientific discovery. In this paper, we introduce approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) as a vehicle for diagnostic model evaluation. This statistical methodology relaxes the need for an explicit likelihood function in favor of one or multiple different summary statistics rooted in hydrologic theory that together have a clearer and more compelling diagnostic power than some average measure of the size of the error residuals. Two illustrative case studies are used to demonstrate that ABC is relatively easy to implement, and readily employs signature based indices to analyze and pinpoint which part of the model is malfunctioning and in need of further improvement.

AB A network of meteorological stations was installed during the Monsoon '90 field campaign in the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed. The study area has a fairly complex surface. The vegetation cover is heterogeneous and sparse, and the terrain is mildly hilly, but dissected by ephemeral channels. Besides measurement of some of the standard weather data such as wind speed, air temperature, and solar radiation, these sites also contained instruments for estimating the local surface energy balance. The approach utilized measurements of net radiation (R(n)), soil heat flux (G) and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory applied to first- and second-order turbulent statistics of wind speed and temperature for determining the sensible heat flux (H). The latent heat flux (LE) was solved as a residual in the surface energy balance equation, namely, LE = -(R(n) + G + H). This procedure (VAR-RESID) for estimating the energy fluxes satisfied monetary constraints and the requirement for low maintenance and continued operation through the harsh environmental conditions experienced in semiarid regions. Comparison of energy fluxes using this approach with more traditional eddy correlation techniques showed differences were within 20% under unstable conditions. Similar variability in flux estimates over the study area was present in the eddy correlation data. Hence, estimates of H and LE using the VAR-RESID approach under unstable conditions were considered satisfactory. Also, with second-order statistics of vertical velocity collected at several sites, the local momentum roughness length was estimated. This is an important parameter used in, modeling the turbulent transfer of momentum and sensible heat fluxes across the surface-atmosphere interface.

AB Predicting variable-density flow and transport in aquifers is critical for the management of many coastal saline aquifers. Accurate characterization of hydrogeological parameters is critical for prediction, and the characterization is often conducted by assimilating data into models. However, few studies have investigated the underlying physics controlling the value-of-information (VOI) of data for aquifer characterization. In this study, we show how a greater understanding of the underlying physics controlling pressure and concentration data coupling can lead to improved characterization. In variable-density flow, the key physics that controls the VOI of pressure and concentration data is the non-linear coupling between flow and transport via fluid density which causes the pressure field to experience transient changes according to the evolution of salinity distribution. We first demonstrate the coupling between pressure and concentration data using information theory, and then systematically investigate how the variable-density flow impacts the VOI of these data in relation to permeability estimation. Using an ensemble Kalman filter, we estimate the permeability field of saline aquifer systems in two scenarios of data usage: pressure data only, and pressure and concentration data jointly. This study demonstrates that, regardless of the data usage scenario, the maximum VOI of data is obtained when free convection and forced convection are balanced. We further show that the advantage of joint inversion of pressure and concentration data decreases as the coupling effect between flow and transport increases. Finally, we study how the level of permeability field heterogeneity affects the coupling, which in turn controls VOI of pressure and concentration data.

AB The Northern Great Plains (NGP) experienced a transition from a long drought cycle to a deluge cycle in the late 1900s. Embedded within this long-term transition were shorter-term decadal-scale dry and wet periods. A recent NGP drought (1999-2004) was followed in 2005 by a wet period that continues to present day. However, how surface hydrology in a northern glaciated landscape responds to increased precipitation is poorly understood and a physically based modeling framework is needed to clarify the underlying processes. This study utilizes a physically based hydrologic model to investigate the impacts of increased precipitation on the water budget by examining its partition into intermediate processes from 2004-2017 in the Mauvais Coulee Basin (MCB). The MCB model evaluations against snow observations (2016-2017) and outlet streamflow observations (2004-2017) imply strong model performance. Simulated snow exhibits high spatiotemporal variation due to variability in precipitation, snow redistribution from stubble fields to wooded areas, and snow accumulation in small depressions. Our modeling results identify two major phases (before and after 2011) exhibiting different hydrologic responses. The period before 2011 is dominated by streamflow and evapotranspiration (ET), while extreme ET dominance is observed after 2011. This switch is due to climatic conditions involving changes in the vapor density difference and depressional and subsurface storage by intermediate processes. A clear contrast in the prewinter soil moisture-streamflow relationship between before and after 2011 is reported. Our findings help illuminate the important influences of increased precipitation upon the intermediate processes in controlling streamflow in a northern glaciated prairie landscape.

AB Water level rises associated with river flow events induce both pressure and solute movement into adjacent aquifers at vastly different rates. We present a simple analytical solution that relates the travel time and travel distance of solutes into an aquifer following river stage rise to aquifer properties. Combination with an existing solution for pressure propagation indicates that the ratio of solute to pressure travel times is proportional to the ratio of the volume of water stored in the aquifer before the river stage rise and the volume added by the stage rise and is independent of hydraulic conductivity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations of an aquifer slice perpendicular to a river demonstrate that the solutions are broadly applicable to variably saturated aquifers and partially penetrating rivers. The solutions remain applicable where river stage rise and fall occur, provided that regional hydraulic gradients are low and the duration of the river stage rise is less than pressure and solute travel times to the observation point in the aquifer. Consequently, the solutions provide new insight into the relationships between aquifer properties and distance and time of solute propagation and, in some cases, may be used to estimate system characteristics. Travel time metrics obtained for a flood event in the Cockburn River in eastern Australia using electrical conductivity measurements enabled estimates of aquifer properties and a lateral extent of river-aquifer mixing of 25 m. A detailed time series of any soluble tracer with distinctly different concentrations in river water and groundwater may be used.

AB We evaluate links between climate and simulated river bank erosion for one of the world's largest rivers, the Mekong. We employ a process-based model to reconstruct multidecadal time series of bank erosion at study sites within the Mekong's two main hydrological response zones, defining a new parameter, accumulated excess runoff (AER), pertinent to bank erosion. We employ a hydrological model to isolate how snowmelt, tropical storms and monsoon precipitation each contribute to AER and thus modeled bank erosion. Our results show that melt (23.9% at the upstream study site, declining to 11.1% downstream) and tropical cyclones (17.5% and 26.4% at the upstream and downstream sites, respectively) both force significant fractions of bank erosion on the Mekong. We also show (i) small, but significant, declines in AER and hence assumed bank erosion during the 20th century, and; (ii) that significant correlations exist between AER and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Of these modes of climate variability, we find that IOD events exert a greater control on simulated bank erosion than ENSO events; but the influences of both ENSO and IOD when averaged over several decades are found to be relatively weak. However, importantly, relationships between ENSO, IOD, and AER and hence inferred river bank erosion are not time invariant. Specifically, we show that there is an intense and prolonged epoch of strong coherence between ENSO and AER from the early 1980s to present, such that in recent decades derived Mekong River bank erosion has been more strongly affected by ENSO.

TI Regional blending of fresh and saline irrigation water: Is it efficient?
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER; MANAGEMENT; TOMATOES; AQUIFER; MODELS
AB Blending fresh and saline irrigation waters is implemented in many countries facing water scarcity. However, when analyzed at the field level, previous economic studies have indicated that blending fresh and saline water is suboptimal. This paper examines the blending issue on a regional scale, where both water sources and land are concurrently allocated to crops. Regional water distribution networks that enable salinity adjustment at the field level are compared to networks that allow controlling water salinity on a regional scale only, such that salt concentrations cannot differ by crop. We characterize the conditions for blending to be an optimal strategy under regional salinity control networks, and show that these conditions can be met by an empirical water production model commonly used in the literature. Empirical analysis of 16 regions in Israel revealed optimal blending in six of them. However, regardless of whether blending is optimal or not, the optimal fresh-water application is higher under regional salinity control networks, implying that blending does not support freshwater conservation. The paper analyzes the relationship between water and land constraints' shadow values, and the properties of the two water distribution networks. We show that although farming revenues are higher under networks that allow assignment of specific water salinities to crops, regional salinity control networks can become more profitable to farmers who face prices set endogenously so as to be the binding factor on the use of constrained water and land. The implications of the network selection on intraregional water supply costs are discussed.

AB Lithologic transitions and glaciations create complex longitudinal profiles that control contemporary erosion and deposition processes. In areas with these characteristics, traditional morphometric approaches for predicting process domains, such as area-slope plots, can be augmented by considering other predictors measured from high resolution lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). Ordinal logistic regression was used to model the distribution of hillslope, swale, colluvial channel, and fluvial channel domains, as identified during field surveys. The study area was a glaciated region of the Rocky Mountain foothills with a complex lithostructural setting. Relationships between domains and a suite of geographic information system-derived descriptors were explored. Predictors included profile anomalies measured at the reach and basin scale using a normalized stream length-gradient (SL/k) index. Drainage area was the dominant factor controlling domains. A model with area as the only predictor was 82% accurate. Reach slope relations were not consistent. A model that also included lithology and basin-scale SL/k index variation was 87% accurate. Domain transitions had larger area thresholds in basins with resistant conglomerate versus sandstone or shale formations and where SL/k index was more variable along a profile. In a restricted model of hillslope, swale, and colluvial channel domains, profile curvature measured over 100 m was also related to domain occurrence. A model for regional-scale mapping applications with six additional predictors was 95% accurate. The results showed that ordinal logistic regression can be used to predict and map process domains in regions with complex physiography using descriptors measured from high resolution DEMs.

AB Understanding subsurface structure and groundwater flow in deltaic aquifers is essential for evaluating the vulnerability of groundwater resources in delta systems. Deltaic aquifers contain coarse-grained paleochannels that preserve a record of former surface river channels as well as fine-grained floodplain deposits. The distribution of these deposits and how they are interconnected control groundwater flow and contaminant transport. In this work, we link depositional environments of deltaic aquifers to stratigraphic (static) and flow and transport (dynamic) connectivity metrics. Numerical models of deltaic stratigraphy were generated using a reduced-complexity numerical model (DeltaRCM) with different input sand fractions (ISF) and rates of sea-level rise (SLR). The groundwater flow and advective transport behavior of these deltas were simulated using MODFLOW and MODPATH. By comparing the static and dynamic metrics calculated from these numerical models, we show that groundwater behavior can be predicted by particular aspects of the subsurface architecture, and that horizontal and vertical connectivity display different characteristics. We also evaluate relationships between connectivity metrics and two environmental controls on delta evolution: ISF and SLR rate. The results show that geologic setting strongly influences both static and dynamic connectivity in different directions. These results provide insights into quantitatively differentiated subsurface hydraulic behavior between deltas formed under different external forcing (ISF and SLR rate) and they are a potential link in using information from delta surface networks and depositional history to predict vulnerability to aquifer contamination.

AB Weather generators are used for spatiotemporal downscaling of climate model outputs (e.g., precipitation and temperature) to investigate the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle. In this study, a multiplicative random cascade model is proposed for the stochastic temporal disaggregation of monthly to daily precipitation fields, which is designed to be applicable to grids of any spatial resolution and extent. The proposed method uses stationary distribution functions that describe the partitioning of precipitation throughout multiple temporal scales (e.g., weekly and biweekly scale). Moreover, it explicitly considers the intensity and spatial covariance of precipitation in the disaggregation procedure, but requires no assumption about the temporal relationship and spatial isotropy of precipitation fields. A split sampling test is conducted on a high-resolution (i.e., 4 x 4 km(2) grid) daily precipitation data set over Germany (approximate to 357,000 km(2)) to assess the performance of the proposed method during future periods. The proposed method has proven to consistently reproduce distinctive location-dependent precipitation distribution functions with biases less than 5% during both a calibration and evaluation period. Furthermore, extreme precipitation amounts and the spatial and temporal covariance of the generated fields are comparable to those of the observations. Consequently, the proposed temporal disaggregation approach satisfies the minimum conditions for a precipitation generator aiming at the assessment of hydrological response to climate change at regional and continental scales or for generating seamless predictions of hydrological variables.

AB Stratified water intake facilities are important pieces of engineering infrastructure that monitor the outflow temperature conditions of hydropower projects. The outflow temperature can significantly impact the down-stream eco-environment and normal functioning of aquatic organisms in streams. However, due to the lack of scientific and effective management tools for stratified water intake and the complexity of the hydrodynamics associated with hydropower generation, both the research community and operation sectors are making great efforts to explore new tools and technology to better monitor, predict and control stratified intake facilities. In this study, surrogate models of the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model based on the theory-guided machine learning (TGML) paradigm are constructed. These models are applied to outflow temperature prediction for the Jinping-I Hydropower Plant in China. The results show that 1) the prediction precision of the high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality EFDC model is successfully emulated by a TGML model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm; and 2) the TGML model accuracy, based on the mean absolute error (MAE) value obtained using the LSTM algorithm, can reach 0.228-0.269 degrees C, the prediction time is less than 2 s, the period of high-precision prediction is 6-13 days, and the model can guide the operation of stratified intake facilities in practice.

AB Fire suppression in western U.S. mountains has caused dense forests with high water demands to grow. Restoring natural wildfire regimes to these forests could affect hydrology by changing vegetation composition and structure, but the specific effects on water balance are unknown. Mountain watersheds supply water to much of the western United States, so understanding the relationship between fire regime and water yield is essential to inform management. We used a distributed hydrological model to quantify hydrologic response to a restored fire regime in the Illilouette Creek Basin (ICB) within Yosemite National Park, California. Over the past 45 years, as successive fires reduced the ICB's forest cover approximately 25%, model results show that annual streamflow, subsurface water storage, and peak snowpack increased relative to a fire-suppressed control, while evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit decreased. A second model experiment compared the water balance in the ICB under two vegetation cover scenarios: 2012 vegetation, representing a frequent-fire landscape, and 1969 vegetation, representing fire suppression. These two model landscapes were run with observed weather data from 1972 to 2017 in order to capture natural variations in precipitation and temperature. This experiment showed that wet years experienced greater fire-related reductions in evapotranspiration and increases in streamflow, while reductions in climatic water deficit were greater in dry years. Spring snowmelt runoff was higher under burned conditions, while summer baseflow was relatively unaffected. Restoring wildfire to the fire-suppressed ICB likely increased downstream water availability, shifted streamfiows slightly earlier, and reduced water stress to forests.

AB Hydrological signatures are now used for a wide range of purposes, including catchment classification, process exploration, and hydrological model calibration. The recent boost in the popularity and number of signatures has however not been accompanied by the development of clear guidance on signature selection. Here we propose that exploring the predictability of signatures in space provides important insights into their drivers and their sensitivity to data uncertainties and is hence useful for signature selection. We use three complementary approaches to compare and rank 15 commonly used signatures, which we evaluate in 600+ U.S. catchments from the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set. First, we employ machine learning (random forests) to explore how attributes characterizing the climatic conditions, topography, land cover, soil, and geology influence (or not) the signatures. Second, we use simulations of the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model to benchmark the random forest predictions. Third, we take advantage of the large sample of CAMELS catchments to characterize the spatial autocorrelation (using Moran's I) of the signature field. These three approaches lead to remarkably similar rankings of the signatures. We show (i) that signatures with the noisiest spatial pattern tend to be poorly captured by hydrological simulations, (ii) that their relationship to catchments attributes are elusive (in particular they are not well explained by climatic indices), and (iii) that they are particularly sensitive to discharge uncertainties. We suggest that a better understanding of the drivers of hydrological signatures and a better characterization of their uncertainties would increase their value in hydrological studies.

AB Conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses affects regional and global climate not only through the release of greenhouse gases but also through altering land surface physical processes such as energy and water balances. Most existing studies on the meteorological impacts of urbanization focus on urban heat island effects with little attention on its impacts of atmospheric humidity, a key variable in hydrometeorology and climate science. We define the influences of urbanization on reducing atmospheric humidity and elevating vapor pressure deficit as urban dry island (UDI) effects. We conduct a case study in the Yangtze River Delta, a typical humid area in southern China that is under rapid urbanization. We examine spatiotemporal characteristics of UDI and identify potential drivers during 2001-2014. Relationships and interactions between variations of air temperature, atmospheric humidity, evapotranspiration, and leaf area index of different land cover were determined using correlation and attribution analyses at both station and regional levels. We show that atmospheric humidity decreased dramatically and vapor pressure deficit increased sharply in the urban core, resulting in enhanced UDI. In addition to global warming and localized urban heat island, UDI is closely related to the loss of vegetation cover (i.e., natural wetlands and paddies). Reduction of evapotranspiration or latent heat is another important factor contributing to UDI effects. We conclude that the role of vegetated land cover and associated ecohydrological processes in moderating UDI and maintaining a stable climate and environment should be considered in massive urban planning and global change impact assessment in southern China.

AB We present an observational analysis examining soil moisture control on surface energy dynamics and planetary boundary layer characteristics. Understanding soil moisture control on land-atmosphere interactions will become increasingly important as climate change continues to alter water availability. In this study, we analyzed 4 years of data from the Santa Rita Creosote Ameriflux site. We categorized our data independently in two ways: (1) wet or dry seasons and (2) one of the four cases within a two-layer soil moisture framework for the root zone based on the presence or absence of moisture in shallow (0-20 cm) and deep (20-60 cm) soil layers. Using these categorizations, we quantified the soil moisture control on surface energy dynamics and planetary boundary layer characteristics using both average responses and linear regression. Our results highlight the importance of deep soil moisture in land-atmosphere interactions. The presence of deep soil moisture decreased albedo by about 10%, and significant differences were observed in evaporative fraction even in the absence of shallow moisture. The planetary boundary layer height (PBLh) was largest when the whole soil profile was dry, decreasing by about 1 km when the whole profile was wet. Even when shallow moisture was absent but deep moisture was present the PBLh was significantly lower than when the entire profile was dry. The importance of deep moisture is likely site-specific and modulated through vegetation. Therefore, understanding these relationships also provides important insights into feedbacks between vegetation and the hydrologic cycle and their consequent influence on the climate system.

AB FO-DTS signal strength varies significantly between different seasons Choice of FO-DTS monitoring-mode substantial impacts on survey results Two-way single-ended averaging provides highest accuracy of signal detection
   Fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) has been frequently applied for analyzing thermal patterns, including the identification of groundwater-surface water exchange fluxes across aquifer-river interfaces. However, the impacts of (a) seasonal variability in signal strength (given by the difference between groundwater and surface water temperatures) and (b) monitoring modes on the accuracy of FO-DTS surveys have not yet been determined. This study uses a well-investigated field site as model system for quantifying the accuracy and uncertainty of FO-DTS surveys in dependency of seasonal signal variation and monitoring mode. The analysis of the relationship between seasonal variability in signal strength and diurnal oscillations in end-member temperatures at the study site revealed that winter conditions, with substantially lower diurnal temperature oscillations, provide the highest temporal stability in signal strength. The choice of monitoring mode proved to have significant impact on the accuracy of FO-DTS surveys. The proposed two-way single-ended averaging of FO-DTS surveys had significant advantages compared to single-ended or double-ended surveys, with a higher accuracy in signal detection, in particular for small-scale temperature variations. Since FO-DTS surveys in two-way single-ended averaging mode were better suited for detecting the full complexity of spatial temperature patterns for the investigated aquifer-river interface, we recommend its wider application in similarly complex systems with small-scale thermal patterns.

AB Multivariate calibration using measurements of multiple water balance components has emerged as a potential solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models. In this study we develop a novel multivariate calibration framework to rigorously test whether incorporation of multiple water balance components into calibration can result in sufficiently accurate (behavioral) solutions for all model responses. Unlike previous studies, we use Bayesian calibration to formally define limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish behavioral solutions for each of the incorporated fluxes. We apply the framework in the Mississippi river basin for the calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model (Noah-MP) with different combinations of model responses - evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture (SM), and streamflow (SF). The results of the study show that incorporation of additional fluxes and soil moisture (a storage variable) is not always valuable due to significant trade-offs in accuracy among the model responses. In our experiments, only ET and SF could be simulated simultaneously to a reasonable degree of accuracy. In addition, we quantify the trade-offs in accuracy between the model responses using the concept of Pareto optimality. We find that combining ET with other fluxes entails higher trade-offs in accuracy compared to either SM or SF. Unlike deterministic calibration, with the developed framework we are able to identify deficiencies in model parameterization that lead to significant trade-offs in accuracy, especially between ET and SM. We find that the parameters which are insensitive to individual model responses can influence the trade-off relationship between them.

AB Deterrmning the hydrological response of urban catchments is of great interest for urban water management. Since most urban catchments are ungauged, this response must be deduced from catchment features, the description of which can be processed more easily today thanks to the availability of urban databases and geographical information systems within many cities. We compare three complementary methods for determining unit hydrographs, with varying degrees of catchment morphology description. The first method, displaying a high degree of description (URBS-UH), is derived from the analysis of urban databases and yields an explicit description of runoff production areas and their downstream flow channels. The second method (H2U), which corresponds to a moderate degree of description, consists of a gamma law whose parameters are based on both the Strahler's catchment order and the average hydraulic length of water paths through the drainage system. The third method, corresponding to a low degree (FDTF), derives the unit hydrograph by means of an iterative deconvolution identification technique using observed rainfall and flow data. The three methods have all been applied to two urban catchments (of 60 and 180 ha), located within the Nantes metropolitan area (western France). Their comparison is discussed and reveals encouraging results: the variability of unit hydrographs due to rainfall intensity is observed with all three of the methods. Deriving unit hydrographs from the morphology of an ungauged catchment would appear beneficial for hydrological purposes, and the degree of information inclusion regarding this morphology can be adapted depending on the availability of geographical data on the catchment studied.

AB We developed a new ordinary differential equation (ODE) to represent subsurface flows from a hillslope with artificial subsurface drainage (tiling) into an adjacent channel. Our ODE is based on a derived storage-discharge relationship from high-resolutions HYDRUS3D simulations that solve 3D partial differential Richards' equations for a hillslope (plot scale) with internal drainage surfaces, variable soil depth, hydraulic conductivity, and varying slope in the direction of flow. The ODE does not capture the hysteresis in the storage-drainage relation that can only be captured using partial differential equations (PDEs), however the simplification does not have major impacts on the modeled flows. The nondimensional representation of the equation is consistent with, and provides an explanation for, the empirical equation used in classical hydrological models such as the ARNO (Arno River) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to simulate subsurface flows, which removes the need for parameter calibration. Our equation captures the features not captured by other ODE simplifications such as DRAINMOD. The ODE can be coupled to the Hillslope Link Model (HLM) flood forecasting system allowing real-time regional simulation of streamflow fluctuations and floods over large domains. We show that (i) the new equation improves the capability to model watershed scale hydrograph recessions and to better capture the timing above flood thresholds for multiple spatial scales from 0.1 to 18,000 km(2); (ii)using realistic values of slope combined with typical values of tile separation and soil depth provides good predictive power at gauged basin outlets; and (iii) parameters can be derived for particular situations using the 3D PDE framework.

AB We present a new hydrologic model based on the frequency distribution of hillslope landscape elements along the stream network as a basis for simulating landscape-scale hydrologic connectivity and catchment runoff. Hydrologic connectivity describes shallow water table continuity between upland and stream elements of the catchment and is important for the movement of water and solutes to streams. This concept has gained traction in physical hydrology but has received less attention in rainfall-runoff modeling. Our model is based on the empirical studies of Jencso et al. (2009, 2010), who found a strong correlation between the duration of shallow groundwater connectivity across hillslope, riparian, and stream zones and upslope accumulated area. We explored the relationship between catchment form and function by testing the extent to which streamflow generation could be predicted by a model based on the topographic form (distribution of landscape elements) of the catchment. We applied the model to the Stringer Creek catchment of the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, located in Montana, USA. Detailed field observations collected by Jencso et al. (2009) were used to inform the underpinnings of the model and to corroborate internal consistency of the model simulations. The model demonstrated good agreement between the observed and predicted streamflow and connectivity duration curves. The ability of this model to simulate internal dynamics without conditioning the parameters on these data suggests that it has the potential to be more confidently extrapolated to other shallow, topographically driven catchments than hydrologic models that fail to consistently reproduce internal variables.

AB Given projected increases in stream temperatures attributable to global change, improved understanding of relationships between stream temperatures and hyporheic exchange would be useful. We conducted two conservative tracer injection experiments in a glacial meltwater stream, to evaluate the effects of hyporheic thermal gradients on exchange processes, including preferential flow paths (PFPs). The experiments were conducted on the same day, the first (a stream injection) during a cool, morning period and the second (dual stream and hyporheic injections) during a warm, afternoon period. In the morning, the hyporheic zone was thermally uniform at 4 degrees C, whereas by the afternoon the upper 10 cm had warmed to 6-12 degrees C and exhibited greater temperature heterogeneity. Solute transport modeling showed that hyporheic cross-sectional areas (A(s)) at two downstream sites were two and seven times lower during the warm experiment. Exchange metrics indicated that the hyporheic zone had less influence on downstream solute transport during the warm, afternoon experiment. Calculated hyporheic depths were less than 5 cm, contrasting with tracer detection at 10 and 25 cm depths. The hyporheic tracer arrival at one downstream site was rapid, comparable to the in-stream tracer arrival, providing evidence for PFPs. We thus propose a conceptual view of the hyporheic zone in this reach as being dominated by discrete PFPs weaving through hydraulically isolated areas. One explanation for the simultaneous increase in temperature heterogeneity and A(s) decrease in a warmer hyporheic zone may be a flow path preferentiality feedback mechanism resulting from a combination of temperature-related viscosity decreases and streambed heterogeneity.

AB River flow synthesizing and downscaling are required for the analysis of risks associated with water resources management plans and for regional impact studies of climate change. This paper presents a probabilistic model that synthesizes and downscales monthly river flow by estimating the joint distribution of flows of two adjacent months conditional on covariates. The covariates may consist of lagged and aggregated flow variables (synthesizing), exogenous climatic variables (downscaling), or combinations of these two types. The joint distribution is constructed by connecting two marginal distributions in terms of copulas. The relationship between covariates and distribution parameters is approximated by an artificial neural network, which is calibrated using the principle of maximum likelihood. Outputs of the neural network yield parameters of the joint distribution. From the estimated joint distribution, a conditional distribution of river flow of current month given the estimation of the previous month can be derived. Depending on the different types of covariate information, this conditional distribution may serve as the "engine" for synthesizing or downscaling river flow sequences. The idea of the proposed model is illustrated using three case studies. The first case deals with synthetic data and shows that the model is capable of fitting a nonstationary joint distribution. Second, the model is utilized to synthesize monthly river flow at four sample stations on the main stream of the Colorado River. Results reveal that the model reproduces essential evaluation statistics fairly well. Third, a simple illustrative example for river flow downscaling is presented. Analysis indicates that the model can be a viable option to downscale monthly river flow as well.

AB Pore-network representations of permeable media provide the framework for explicit simulation of capillary-driven immiscible displacement governed by invasion-percolation theory. The most demanding task of a pore-network flow simulation is the identification of trapped defending phase clusters at every displacement step, i.e. the phase connectivity problem. Instead of employing the conventional adjacency list we represent the connectivity of a phase cluster as a tree accompanied by a set of adjacent non-tree edges. In this graph representation, a decrease in phase connectivity due to a pore displacement event corresponds to deletion of either a tree or a non-tree edge. Deletion of a tree edge invokes a computationally intensive search for a possible reconnection of the resulting subtrees by an adjacent non-tree edge. The tree representation facilitates a highly efficient execution of the reconnection search. Invasion-percolation simulations of secondary water floods under different wetting conditions in pore-networks of different origin and size confirm the efficiency of the proposed phase connectivity algorithm. Moreover, a systematic simulation study of runtime growth with increasing model size on regular lattice networks demonstrates a consistent orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to conventional simulations. Consequently, the proposed algorithm proves to be a powerful tool for invasion-percolation simulations on large multi-scale networks and for extensive stochastic analysis of typical single-scale pore-networks.

AB This work focuses on the application of a Weighted Average Flux (WAF) approximation to the shallow water equations with friction and real bathymetry on unstructured two dimensional grids. The scheme obtained must satisfy severe numerical criteria so it can be implemented in the TELEMAC code, widely used in industry.
   Despite its interesting numerical properties (at least in theory, which includes second order in time and space), WAF approximation is rarely applied to unstructured meshes. Here, we provide a general method for applying the WAF scheme to a homogenous equation. The general and efficient discretization of the topographic source term (through hydrostatic reconstruction) and friction (with a semi-implicit way) is also presented. We applied the approximation using the HLLC Riemann solver within a vertex-centered finite volume framework. The discretization obtained is validated with several theoretical and real benchmarks. The WAF-HLLC scheme proposed is also compared to several other well-known schemes such as HLLC, Roe and Kinetic type schemes. The results obtained show that the behavior of the scheme is encouraging as they demonstrate well-balanceness, strict mass conservation, positivity of water depth, efficient treatment of wetting and drying phenomena, good shock-capturing and low numerical diffusion. Nevertheless, the second order of accuracy in space is not attained with sufficient rigor and remains an open problem requiring more detailed study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flow, sediment transport and bed deformation in alluvial rivers normally exhibit multiple time scales. Enhanced knowledge of the time scales can facilitate better approaches to the understanding of the fluvial processes. Yet prior studies of the time scales are based upon the concept of sediment transport capacity at low concentrations, which however is not generally applicable. This paper presents new formulations of the time scales of fluvial flow, suspended sediment transport and bed deformation, under the framework of shallow water hydrodynamics, non-capacity sediment transport and the theory of characteristics for the hyperbolic governing equations. The time scale of bed deformation in relation to that of flow depth is demonstrated to delimit the applicability region of mathematical river models, and the time scale of suspended sediment transport relative to that of the pertinent flow information is analyzed to address if the concept of sediment transport capacity is applicable. For shallow flows with high sediment concentrations, bed deformation may considerably affect the flow and a fully coupled model is normally required. In contrast, for deep flows at low sediment concentrations, a decoupled model is mostly justified. This pilot study of the time scales delivers a new theoretical basis, on which the interaction between flow, suspended sediment transport and bed deformation can be potentially better characterized.

AB Water resource management requires robust assessment of the consequences of future states of the resource, and, when dependent on prediction models, it requires assessment of the uncertainties associated with those predictions. Ensemble prediction/forecast systems have been extensively used to address such issues and seek to provide a collection of predictions, via a collection of parameters, with intent to bracket future observations. However, such methods do not have well-established finite-sample properties and generally require large samples to additionally determine better performing predictions, for example, in nonlinear probabilistic ensemble methods. We here propose a different paradigm, based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) generalization theory, for robust parameter selection and prediction. It is based on a concept of complexity (that is data-independent) that relates finite sample performance of a model to its performance when a large sample of the same underlying process is available. We employ a nearest neighbor method as the underlying prediction model, introduce a procedure to compute its VC dimension, and test how the two paradigms handle uncertainty in one step ahead daily streamflow prediction for three basins. In both paradigms, the predictions become more efficient and less biased with increasing sample size. However, the complexity-based paradigm has a better bias-variance tradeoff property for small sample sizes. The uncertainty bounds on predictions resulting from ensemble methods behave in an inconsistent manner for smaller basins, suggesting the need for further postprocessing of ensemble members and uncertainty surrounding them before using them in modeling uncertainty estimation. Finally, complexity-based predictions appear to mimic the complexity of the underlying processes via input dimensionality selection of the nearest neighbor model.

AB Urbanization has substantially altered low-order streams, which show systematic degradation in water quality. Studying the spatiotemporal character of catchment scale solute dynamics is a crucial part of understanding the hydrology of urban catchments. The objectives of our study were to characterize spatial and temporal variability of solutes in headwater streams of the Upper South River, Atlanta, GA, and to examine relationships between solute concentrations and stream discharge during storm events across the watershed. Synoptic sampling was performed at 18 nested sites in the watershed during summer and fall 2020. Storm samples were also collected at three of these sites, all collocated with USGS stream gages. Samples were analysed for major ions including Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3-. Synoptic sampling showed an unexpectedly high level of spatial stability over time at all first-order sites, meaning that the relative ranks of concentrations among headwater sites remain consistent over time. This is even more unexpected considering the extremely flashy and dynamic nature of the highly urbanized watershed. Contrary to stormflow studies in other settings, examination of concentration-discharge relationships showed a homogeneous response among storms, sites, and solutes, with most hysteresis loops exhibiting a dilutive response with clockwise rotation. This indicates source-limited behaviour for solutes in this system, where groundwater represents the highest-concentration component of stormflow. Taken together, baseflow and stormflow solute data show that this system retains consistent headwater signals across a highly dynamic flow regime. Furthermore, such stability drives a consistent solute signature at the watershed outlet. This type of information may prove useful for understanding sources and flow paths that drive urban stream geochemistry, particularly where budget constraints limit the number of locations where instrumentation may be installed.

AB A water harvesting system for research purposes has been established in the Lisan Peninsula of the Dead Sea in the middle of the Jordan Rift Valley, where no authorized guideline is available for designing water harvesting systems. Rainfall and runoff, which occurred as flash floods, were observed at the downstream end of a gorge with a 1.12 km(2) barren catchment area from October 2014 through July 2019. Due to the extremely arid environment, runoff from the catchment is ephemeral, and the flash flood events can be clearly distinguishable from each other. Thirteen flash flood events with a total runoff volume of more than 100 m(3) were successfully recorded during the five rainy seasons. Pearson and Spearman correlations between duration, total rainfall depths at two points, total runoff volume, maximum runoff discharge, bulk runoff coefficient, total variation in runoff discharge and maximum variation in runoff discharge of each flash flood event were examined, revealing no straightforward relationship between rainfall and runoff. The performance of the conventional SCS runoff curve number method was also deficient in reproducing any rainfall-runoff relationship. Therefore, probability distribution fitting was performed for each random variable, focusing on the lognormal distribution with three parameters and the generalized extreme value distribution. The maximum goodness-of-fit estimation turns out to be a more rational and efficient method in obtaining the parameter values of those probability distributions rather than the standard maximum likelihood estimation, which has known disadvantages. Results support the design of the water harvesting system and provide quantitative information for designing and operating similar systems in the future.

AB A pragmatic and simple approach for estimating the groundwater recharge of karst aquifers in mountainous regions by extrapolation of the hydrological regimes of gauged and well-documented systems is presented. Specific discharge rates are derived using annual precipitation and spring measurements by taking into account catchment size and elevation, which are assumed to be the dominant factors. Reference sites with high data reliability are used for calibration and regional extrapolation. This is performed with normalized values employing spatial precipitation deviations and correlation with the elevation of the catchment areas. A tiered step procedure provides minimum and maximum normalized gradients for the relationship between recharge quantity and elevation for karst regions. The normalized recharge can therefore be obtained and extrapolated for any location using the spatial precipitation variability to provide an estimate of annual groundwater recharge. The approach was applied to Switzerland (approximately 7500km(2) of karst terrain situated between 200 and over 4000ma.s.l.) using annual precipitation data from meteorological stations for the years 2000 to 2011. Results show that the average recharge rates of different Swiss karst domains range from 20 to 46L/km(2)s, which corresponds to an infiltration ratio between 0.6 and 0.9 of total precipitation. Despite uncertainties inherent in the approach, these results provide a benchmark for renewable karst groundwater resources in Switzerland of about 8.4km(3)/year. The approach can be applied to any other mountainous karst region, that is, where a clear relationship between elevation, precipitation and recharge can be assumed.

AB Stream mesoscale habitats have systematic topographic relationships to hyporheic flow patterns, which may create predictable temperature variation between mesoscale habitat types. We investigated whether systematic differences in temperature metrics occurred between mesoscale habitats within reaches of small streams tributary to the upper Little Tennessee River, southern Appalachians. Surface water temperature was recorded over three or four mid-summer days in four mesoscale habitat types: riffle, main riffle, pool and alcove in 44 stream segments (sites). Temperature metrics were calculated for each mesoscale habitat relative to the mean value of the metric over the stream: maximum temperature, average maximum temperature and maximum daily variation and also for each site: standard deviation of the maximum temperature and average diurnal variation (ADV). Sites were categorized as fully or partially forested. Pool tailouts had statistically significantly lower maximum temperature and average maximum temperature than riffle tailouts in partially forested sites, although differences were small. This was the opposite of what was expected in the presence of hyporheic exchange, indicating hyporheic exchange is not a dominant driver of mesoscale habitat temperatures at these sites. Temperature differences between mesoscale habitat units were small and unlikely to have ecological significance. We also evaluated relationships between stream temperature and riparian condition, watershed % impervious surfaces, watershed % non-forested and elevation. ADV and standard deviation of the maximum temperature were significantly higher in partially forested sites, indicating that partially forested sites have greater temperature ranges and spatial variation of maximum temperatures. ADV decreased with elevation and increased with % impervious surfaces. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The present work examines the possible use of major ion chemistry and multivariate statistical techniques as a rapid and relatively cost-effective method of identifying the extent of groundwater and surface water (GW-SW) interaction in an urban setting. The original hydrogeochemical dataset consists of groundwater (n = 114), stream water (n = 42) and drain water (it = 24) samples, collected twice in a year for the pre- and post-monsoon seasons, for three successive years along an 8 km reach of the Delhi segment of River Yamuna, India. The dynamic and similar seasonal changes of hydro-geochemical facies and major ion trends of river, drain and groundwater samples indicate the existence of an empirical relationship between GW and SW. Results of both R- and Q-mode factor and cluster analyses highlight multi-scale control of the fluid exchange distributions, with distinct seasonal alteration in mode and extent of GW-SW interaction, namely, the influence of the mixing zones between urban river and groundwater and the pattern of groundwater flow through the river bed. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of sampling locations efficiently illustrates different groups that comprise samples severely influenced by contaminated surface water downstream and the upstream fresh water samples. These results substantiate the strong exchange processes between GW and SW all along the stretch. The study shows that the combination of an empirical and statistical relationship between different ionic species and sampling locations can provide greater confidence in identifying the extent of GW-SW interaction/exchange processes.

AB The Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) model has been rapidly adopted to interpret in-stream nutrient spiraling metrics over a range of concentrations from breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained during pulse solute injection experiments. TASCC analyses often identify hysteresis in the relationship between spiraling metrics and concentration as nutrient concentration in BTCs rises and falls. The mechanisms behind these hysteresis patterns have yet to be determined. We hypothesized that differences in the time a solute is exposed to bioactive environments (i.e., biophysical opportunity) between the rising and falling limbs of BTCs causes hysteresis in TASCCs. We tested this hypothesis using nitrate data from Elkhorn Creek (CO, USA) combined with a process-based particle-tracking model representing travel times and transformations along each flow path in the water column and hyporheic zone, from which the bioactive zone comprised only a thin superficial layer. In-stream nitrate uptake was controlled by hyporheic exchange and the cumulative time nitrate spend in the bioactive layer. This bioactive residence time generally increased from the rising to the falling limb of the BTC, systematically generating hysteresis in the TASCC curves. Hysteresis decreased when nutrient uptake primarily occurred in the water column compared to the hyporheic zone, and with increasing the distance between the injection and sampling points. Hysteresis increased with the depth of the hyporheic bioactive layer. Our results emphasize that good characterization of spatial heterogeneity of surface-subsurface flow paths and bioactive hot spots within streams is essential to understanding the mechanisms of in-stream nutrient uptake.

AB The nonhomogeneous spatial activation of raincells (NSAR) model is presented which provides a continuous spatial-temporal stochastic simulation of rainfall exhibiting spatial nonstationarity in both amounts and occurrence. Spatial nonstationarity of simulated rainfall is important for hydrological modeling of mountainous catchments where orographic effects on precipitation are strong. Such simulated rainfall fields support the current trend toward distributed hydrological modeling. The NSAR model extends the Spatial Temporal Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulses (STNSRP) model, which has a homogeneous occurrence process, by generating raincells with a spatially nonhomogeneous Poisson process. An algorithm to simulate nonhomogeneous raincell occurrence is devised. This utilizes a new efficient and accurate algorithm to simulate raincells from an infinite 2-D Poisson process, in which only raincells relevant to the application are simulated. A 4009 km(2) Pyrenean catchment exhibiting extreme orographic effects provides a suitable case study comprising seven daily rain gauge records with hourly properties estimated using regional downscaling relationships. Both the NSAR and the STNSRP models are fitted to five calibration rain gauges. Simulated hourly fields are validated using the remaining two rain gauges providing the first validation of time series sampled from STNSRP or NSAR processes at locations not used in model fitting. The NSAR model exhibits considerable improvement over the STNSRP model particularly with respect to nonhomogeneous rainfall occurrence at both daily and hourly resolutions. Further, the NSAR simulation provides an excellent match to the spatially nonhomogeneous observed daily mean, proportion dry, variance, coefficient of variation, autocorrelation, skewness coefficient, cross correlation and extremes, and to the hourly proportion dry and variance properties.

AB Salt deposition has been encountered in near-wellbore regions of saline reservoirs during field-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. To explain this phenomenon, pore-scale studies, mostly in the form of micromodel visualizations, have been previously implemented. However, there is limited knowledge about salt deposition and inherent dynamics in reservoir rocks. This study investigates and characterizes the pore-scale evolution of salt precipitation in natural sandstone and carbonate rocks at conditions prevalent in deep saline aquifers. Using x-ray micro-tomography imaging techniques, three evolution stages - advection-dominated, transition, and diffusion-dominated evaporative drying - are delineated. We provide direct evidence for a new mechanism that occurs during the transition from advection to diffusion-limited flow called reverse solute diffusion. This is typified by upward solute diffusion from regions of lower concentrations within the aqueous phase to the highly concentrated evaporating front. Salt deposits eventually form due to solute accumulation at the brine/supercritical CO2 interface. The time and extent of precipitation are influenced by CO2 injection rate and morphological heterogeneity. Specifically, a higher injection rate increases the rapidity of precipitation but causes lower salt deposition. Furthermore, less precipitates form as systems become more homogeneous for the same injection rate. These relationships directly correlate with porosity reduction, leading to a gradual but higher degree of pore plugging in heterogeneous systems.

AB Infiltration processes in fractured-porous media remain a crucial, yet not very well understood component of recharge and vulnerability assessment. Under partially saturated condition flows in fractures, percolating fracture networks and fault zones contribute to the fastest spectrum of infiltration velocities via preferential pathways. Specifically, the partitioning dynamics at fracture intersections determine the magnitude of flow fragmentation into vertical and horizontal components, hence the bulk flow velocity and dispersion of fracture networks. Here we derive an approximate analytical solution for the partitioning process and validate it using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. The transfer function is conceptually based on simulation results and laboratory experiments carried out in previous works. It allows efficient flow simulation through fracture networks with simple cubic structures and an arbitrary number of fractures and aperture sizes via linear response theory and convolution of a given input signal. We derive a nondimensional bulk flow velocity ((v) over tilde) and dispersion coefficient ((D) over tilde) to characterize fracture networks in terms of dimensionless horizontal and vertical time scales tau(m) and tau(0). The dispersion coefficient strongly depends on the horizontal time scale and converges toward a constant value of 0.08 within reasonable fluid and geometrical parameter ranges, while the nondimensional velocity exhibits a characteristic (v) over tilde similar to tau(-1/2)(m) scaling. Given that hydraulic information is often only available at limited places within (fractured-porous) aquifer systems (boreholes or springs), our study intends to provide an analytical concept to potentially reconstruct internal fracture network geometries from external boundary information, such as the dispersive properties of discharge (groundwater level fluctuations).

AB Hydrological predictions at a watershed scale are commonly based on extrapolation and upscaling of hydrological behavior at plot and hillslope scales. Yet, dominant hydrological drivers at a hillslope may not be as dominant at the watershed scale because of the heterogeneity of watershed characteristics. With the availability of quantifiable watershed data (watershed descriptors and streamflow indices), variable selection can provide insight into the dominant watershed descriptors that drive different streamflow regimes. Stepwise regression and principal components analysis have long been used to select descriptive variables for relating runoff to climate and watershed descriptors. Questions have remained regarding the robustness of the selected descriptors. This paper evaluates five new approaches: Grow-Shrink, GS; a variant of Incremental Association Markov Boundary, interIAMBnPC; Local Causal Discovery, LCD2; HITON Markov Blanket, HITON-MB: and First-Order Utility, FOU. We demonstrate their performance by quantifying their accuracy, consistency and predictive potential compared to stepwise regression and principal component analysis on two known functional relationships. The results show that the variables selected by HITON-MB and the first-order utility are the most accurate while variables selected by Stepwise regression, although not accurate have a high predictive potential. Therefore, a model with high predictive power may not necessary represent the underlying hydrological processes of a watershed system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrologic equilibrium theory has been used to describe both short-term regulation of gas exchange and long-term adjustment of forest canopy density. However, by focusing on water and atmospheric conditions alone a hydrologic equilibrium may impose an oversimplification of the growth of forests adjusted to hydrology. In this study nitrogen is incorporated as a third regulation of catchment level forest dynamics and gas exchange. This was examined with an integrated distributed hydrology and forest growth model in a central Sierra Nevada watershed covered primarily by old-growth coniferous forest. Water and atmospheric conditions reasonably reproduced daily latent heat flux, and predicted the expected catenary trend of leaf area index (LAI). However, it was not until the model was provided a spatially detailed description of initial soil carbon and nitrogen pools that spatial patterns of LAI were generated. This latter problem was attributed to a lack of soil history or memory in the initialization of the simulations. Finally, by reducing stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) the canopy density increased when water and nitrogen limitations were not present. The results support a three-control hydrologic equilibrium in the Sierra Nevada watershed. This has implications for modeling catchment level soil-vegetation-atmospheric interactions over interannual, decade, and century time-scales. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The understanding of nonlinear flow in rough-walled rock fractures is critical for underground engineering and geological sciences. The macroscopic behavior and microfluidic field of flow in rough-walled artificial fracture models was investigated through microscopic visualization of hydraulic experiment. The results indicate that there are three states of flow regime in fracture, namely linear, weak inertial and strong inertial. In linear flow regime, the relationship between pressure drops and flow rate is linear, and all the streamlines in the microfluidic field are parallel. In weak inertial flow regime, pressure drop and flow become nonlinear, and the inertial pressure loss is less than the viscous pressure loss. Moreover, backflow occurs near the tortuous wall in the microfluidic field. In strong inertial flow regime, the inertial pressure loss is greater than viscous pressure loss, and the backflow begins to detach from the wall and eventually develop into a significantly large eddy far away from the wall. However, the flow in the mainstream remains laminar rather than turbulent in this experiment. This result indicates that the main cause of the nonlinearity of flow in fracture is eddies due to the increase of the inertia term and the variation of aperture. The shrinking of effective channel and losing of kinetic energy caused by eddies make fluid flow nonlinear. Moreover, the area and number of eddies depend on the fracture roughness and the Reynolds number.

AB Understanding transit times (TT) and residence times (RT) distributions of water in catchments has recently received a great deal of attention in hydrologic research since it can inform about important processes relevant to the quality of water delivered by streams and landscape resilience to anthropogenic inputs. The theory of transit time distributions (TTD) is a practical framework for understanding TT of water in natural landscapes but, due to its lumped nature, it can only hint at the possible internal processes taking place in the subsurface. While allowing for the direct observation of water movement, Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) can be leveraged to better understand the internal variability of water ages within the subsurface, thus enabling the investigation of the physical processes controlling the time-variability of TTD. In this study, we estimated time-variable TTD of a bench-scale bare-soil sloping soil lysimeter through the StorAge Selection (SAS) framework, a traditional lumped-systems method, based on sampling of output tracer concentrations, as well as through an ERI SAS one, based on spatially distributed images of water ages. We compared the ERI-based SAS results with the output-based estimates to discuss the viability of ERI at laboratory experiments for understanding TTD. The ERI-derived images of the internal evolution of water ages were able to elucidate the internal mechanisms driving the time-variability of ages of water being discharged by the system, which was characterized by a delayed discharge of younger water starting at the highest storage level and continuing throughout the water table recession.

AB The models for colloidal mobilization in porous media are often based on Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek interaction energy profiles. Despite abundant evidence on mobilization of particle clusters, the models to date have been limited to single colloid-surface Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek calculations. We show through visualization tests, qualitative and quantitative modeling, and data evaluation, that the widely accepted single colloid-single surface isolation does not always adequately describe colloid behavior. The experiments were performed with kaolinite and latex particles mobilized from sand grains and glass beads in a transparent visualization cell. The particles were mobilized under increasing velocity and pH and decreasing salinity. The detachment conditions were determined by a torque balance of electrostatic, drag, lifting, and gravity forces, combined with a theory of a contact area between a single soft particle and a plane surface. The tests show that the calculations based on the mechanical equilibrium of a single particle on a plane surface significantly underestimate the critical detachment velocity. A better prediction is obtained using a cluster approximation. High-resolution images taken during mobilization tests show 2-12 particle clusters on media surface and in its proximity. The mechanical-equilibrium calculations show that the attaching torque for clusters with assumed size and cylindrical shape is significantly higher than that for single particles. The critical detachment velocity of clusters, derived from the mechanical-equilibrium force and torque balances, is higher than for single particles and provides a better fit to the experimental data. Our study suggests that a cluster approximation can accurately predict the mobilization of colloids in porous media.

AB Accounting for small-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture (theta) is required to enhance the predictive skill of land surface models. In this paper, we present the results of the development, calibration, and performance evaluation of a downscaling model based on multifractal theory using aircraft-based (800 m) theta estimates collected during the southern Great Plains experiment in 1997 (SGP97). We first demonstrate the presence of scale invariance and multifractality in theta fields of nine square domains of size 25.6 x 25.6 km(2), approximately a satellite footprint. Then, we estimate the downscaling model parameters and evaluate the model performance using a set of different calibration approaches. Results reveal that small-scale theta distributions are adequately reproduced across the entire region when coarse predictors include a dynamic component (i.e., the spatial mean soil moisture <theta >) and a stationary contribution accounting for static features (i.e., topography, soil texture, vegetation). For wet conditions, we found similar multifractal properties of soil moisture across all domains, which we ascribe to the signature of rainfall spatial variability. For drier states, the theta fields in the northern domains are more intermittent than in southern domains, likely because of differences in the distribution of vegetation coverage. Through our analyses, we propose a regional downscaling relation for coarse, satellite-based soil moisture estimates, based on ancillary information (static and dynamic landscape features), which can be used in the study area to characterize statistical properties of small-scale theta distribution required by land surface models and data assimilation systems.

AB [1] Precise measurement of soil hydraulic properties at field scales is one of the prerequisites to simulate subsurface flow and transport processes, which is crucial in many research and engineering areas. In our study, we numerically analyze uniqueness and stability for integrated hydrogeophysical inversion of time-lapse, off-ground ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data in estimating the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. In the inversion, hydrodynamic modeling based on the one-dimensional (1-D) Richards equation is used to physically constrain a full-waveform radar electromagnetic model. Synthetic GPR data, in terms of 3-D multilayered media Green's functions, were generated for three different textured soils (coarse, medium, and fine) and assuming different infiltration events. Inversion was performed iteratively to estimate three key soil hydraulic parameters (alpha,n, and K-s) of the Mualem-van Genuchten model using the global multilevel coordinate search optimization algorithm. For the coarse- and medium-textured soils, inversions converged to the actual solution for all scenarios. For the fine soil, estimation errors occurred, mainly because of the higher attenuation of the electromagnetic waves in such a soil (high electric conductivity). The procedure appeared to be generally stable with respect to possible errors in the hydrodynamic and petrophysical model parameterization. However, we found that particular attention should be given to an accurate estimation of the saturated water content and infiltration flux for real field applications. The results from our numerical experiments suggest that, in theory, the proposed method is promising for the noninvasive identification of the shallow soil hydraulic properties at the field scale with a high spatial resolution.

AB Cryogenic vacuum extraction (CVE) has been considered as the standard technique for the analysis of plant water stable isotopes in ecohydrological research. Recent studies reported that CVE can introduce significant bias in stable isotope analyses, yet the causes and influencing factors of the CVE-induced deuterium offsets remain poorly understood. Here, we performed rehydration experiments on plant samples from two species and three organs with two distinct-isotopic spiking waters. Centrifugation and high-pressure mechanical squeezing were used to separate sap water and tissue water for stable isotope analyses. Plant waters extracted by CVE differed significantly from reference waters in delta H-2, but not in delta O-18. The delta H-2 bias was linearly correlated to the xylem water content, and this relationship is affected significantly by plant organs/species and the isotopic signature of the spiking water. Moreover, the delta H-2 bias induced by CVE (-8.52 +/- 0.90 parts per thousand) was significantly greater than the delta H-2 difference between the tissue and sap waters (-3.33 +/- 0.76 parts per thousand) for apple stems possessing similar water contents. Thus, hydrogen-exchange between plant organics and water, and isotopic heterogeneity within plants both contribute to the negative delta H-2 bias, but the former is the dominant cause. The multiple factors governing the CVE-induced delta H-2 bias, make it difficult to establish a unified bias correction equation. Our results question the usefulness of cryogenic extraction as a standard for plant water extraction.

AB Spatial parameter fields are required to model hydrological processes across diverse landscapes. Transfer functions are often used to relate parameters to spatial catchment attributes, introducing large uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties remains a key challenge for large-scale modeling. This paper extends the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique to consider parameter uncertainties. We evaluate this method of producing nationally consistent parameter fields, which maintain a constant relationship between model parameters and catchment attributes, across 437 catchments in Great Britain (GB). By sampling multiple transfer function parameters, we produce thousands of possible model parameter fields which are constrained within an uncertainty framework. This is compared to spatially homogeneous parameter sets constrained for individual catchments. The nationally consistent MPR parameter fields perform well (KGE* > 0.75) across 60% of catchments. Performance is similar or better than catchment-constrained parameters (KGE* drop < 0.1) across 82% of catchments. Advantages of our national parameter fields include (a) improved representation of flows within catchments, (b) more robust performance between calibration and evaluation periods, and (c) spatial parameter fields reflecting hydrologically meaningful variation in catchment characteristics. By including uncertainties, we show that hydrographs produced using MPR have smaller uncertainty bounds which are better able to encompass flows. As the first application of MPR to both the DECIPHeR modeling framework and GB, we developed transfer functions and identified key catchment attributes to constrain model parameters, which are transferrable to other models alongside the addition of uncertainty. Methodologies presented here are informative for future regionalization efforts in GB and elsewhere.

AB A decrease in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) is a commonly seen effect of climate change. However, in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (Italy), a deep mountain lake, annual mean DO (% saturation) has increased from near anoxia to >20% in the bottom layer (35-39 m). We analyzed long-term patterns of DO (1937-2019) using different methods (correlation and trend analysis, identification of extreme events) to link DO to drivers and indices of mixing. While spring mixing remained temporally limited, later ice-in (5.1 days decade(-1)) and the positive relationship between ice-in and DO the following year evidenced autumn mixing as the main driver for hypolimnetic DO increase. Extreme meteorological events also replenished hypolimnetic DO. Using DO and conductivity (1995-2019), we identified 14 deep mixing events with hypolimnetic DO > 40%. Density-based indices (Schmidt stability, relative thermal resistance, Lake Number, and Wedderburn Number) only partially captured these events that were related to snowmelt, flooding, and cold spells during spring and autumn, with a carryover effect sometimes lasting >1 year. Recently, annual mean DO in the upper layer decreased beyond temperature-dependent solubility. This decrease was not comprehensively confirmed by statistical tests but was possibly linked to atmospheric stilling. We suggest that Lake Tovel's shift from meromixis to dimixis was driven by climate warming (i.e., increasing air temperature 0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) that delayed ice-in and increased autumn mixing. Our work underlines the vulnerability of mountain lakes and their different response to climate change with respect to more studied lowland lakes.

AB Streamflow forecasting is essential in many applications, including the management of hydropower reservoirs and of flood risks. To increase the performance of these hydrologic forecasts, a hydrological model is typically updated with optimal initial model states. These states are usually selected a priori and adjusted to obtain the optimal initial setup. The model states to adjust are generally selected by experts with deep knowledge of the model's behavior. These relationships are rarely documented and formalized, leading to difficulties in reproducibility and transferability to other models. The method here provides a fully automatized system to find the model states based on the parameter-free sensitivity method of efficient elementary effects (EEE), which identifies the most informative variables of the hydrologic model CEQUEAU. The analysis is applied to 1,826 model setups for four Canadian basins. The identified states are formalized using clustering techniques to obtain adjustment "recipes" conditioned on given meteorological conditions. Several recipes are tested and compared to expert-based recipes. The recipes are tested according to their ability to (a) obtain optimal initial states and (b) their forecast performance. The results show that (1) the EEE-based recipes perform similarly or better than the expert-based recipes in both objectives; (2) the recipes are similar across the four basins, highlighting their potential of spatial transferability; and (3) the adjustment of hydrologic model inputs significantly decreases forecast performance. The proposed approach to use EEE-based recipes to obtain optimal initial states for forecasting is reproducible, objective, and suitable to be applied to other models and basins.

Although remote sensing is an important mean of monitoring river discharge, previous methods are most suitable for large rivers, and the ability to monitor small rivers (with widths less than 100 m) is limited. To resolve this issue, a multiple pixel ratio (MPR) method is presented for monitoring the discharge of small rivers based on the relationship between river discharge and the near-infrared reflectivity. Utilizing 281 Landsat images (1990-2015), we monitored river discharges in two subbasins in the upstream region of the Heihe River located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that the performance of the MPR method is more stable than the previous calibration/measurement method. The monitoring accuracy was correlated with the length and location of the selected inundated river channel. Using selected inundated river channel lengths between 300 and 600m can provide better monitoring accuracy. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of monitoring results (2013-2014) of Qilian station was 0.82; the Zhamashike station (2015) was 0.45; the two stations multiyears (1990-2013) monitoring results were 0.32 and 0.41; the ungauged basin was 0.45. Our results suggest that the MPR method can expand the ability of remote sensing to monitor discharge in small rivers with widths greater than 30 m on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the new method also has the potential to monitor the discharge of ungauged small rivers (with widths greater than 30 m).

AB This paper presents the results of a data-based comparative study of several hundred catchments across continental United States belonging to the MOPEX data set to systematically explore the connection between the flood frequency curve and mean annual water balance. Mean annual water balance is expressed in terms of two similarity measures: (i) the climatic aridity index, AI, which is a measure of the competition between energy and water availability and (ii) the base flow index, BFI, which is a measure of total runoff partitioning into surface and subsurface components at the annual time scale. The data analyses showed that the aridity index, AI, has a first-order control on the shape of the flood frequency curve (also known as the growth curve), as expressed in terms of both the mean and coefficient of variation (C-v) of the annual maximum floods, once normalized by catchment size (i.e., specific flood discharge) While the mean annual (specific) flood discharge decreases with increasing aridity, C-v increases with increasing aridity. On the other hand, the BFI was found to be a second-order control on the flood frequency curve. Higher BFI, meaning higher contributions of subsurface flow to total streamflow, leads to a decrease of the mean annual (specific) flood discharge, and vice versa. The statistically significant relationship between AI and the flood frequency curve and the consistent shift of the growth curves with AI support the use of AI as a similarity measure for regionalization of flood frequency.

AB Drainage density has long been observed to vary among climates, a relationship often attributable to differences in the erosivity of runoff and resistivity of vegetation. There is also evidence, though much less, that relief and channel concavity also vary with climate. The biophysical chain of events that connect climate to these topographic expressions, however, deserves greater attention. Using a numerical landscape evolution model, we examine how a gradient of mean annual precipitation is expressed in the topography of low-to medium-relief, sediment-mantled, water-limited ecosystems. We find equilibrium landscapes have the lowest drainage density, greatest relief, and lowest concavity at intermediate levels of rainfall. This climatic threshold represents the transition from vegetation-dominated sediment flux in drier climates to runoff-dominated flux with more precipitation. In drier climates, marginal increases in precipitation manifest themselves primarily as increases in vegetation while runoff is relatively constant; this acts to suppress sediment transport and decreases the drainage density. In wetter environments, marginal increases in precipitation lead to increases primarily in runoff while vegetation cover remains relatively constant; this results in increased sediment transport and increases the drainage density. The location of the transition depends at least in part on plant community structure and composition. The modeling study illustrates the complexities inherent in biogeomorphic systems but also that a simplified conceptual model of landscape evolution may indeed be sufficient to understand the large-scale patterns. The study also illustrates the opportunities offered by approaching questions of landform development from an ecohydrological perspective.

AB For a regional assessment of water needs and consumption in semiarid agricultural zones, one needs robust and simple tools that provide space-time estimates of evaporation losses. Most operational evaporation estimates rely on semiempirical relationships that are not generally applicable. Several authors have proposed physically based simple expressions to model the "energy-limited'' (stage-one) and the "supply-limited'' (stage-two) evaporation rates during a dry down. They use the time compression approximation (TCA) to relate stage-one and stage-two drying. Two asymptotic approximations of the TCA corresponding to the diffusion-dominated and the drainage-dominated flows have been proposed in the literature. In this study a full analytical solution of the TCA is presented. The derived "supply-limited'' evaporation rate is evaluated for a wide range of soil conditions and vegetation cover against a physically based complex soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model, the Simple Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Transfer scheme (SiSPAT). SiSPAT solves the differential equations of water flow in a vertical soil column and computes estimates of soil evaporation and transpiration. SiSPAT is used to evaluate the performance of the full solution as well as the two existing asymptotic approximations for the case of sparse to dense vegetation in a semiarid environment. The full analytical solution gives accurate predictions of first- to second-stage evaporation time series for the bare soil and vegetated cover conditions with a leaf area index of 3 or higher. The results of the full solution are closer to the evaporation rate time series simulated by SISPAT than the asymptotic approximations.

TI EFFECT OF CATCHMENT-SCALE SUBSURFACE MIXING ON STREAM ISOTOPIC RESPONSE
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID HUMID HEADWATER CATCHMENTS; STORM RUNOFF GENERATION; WATER
AB A 3.8-ha watershed on the west coast of New Zealand was instrumented with suction lysimeters and automatic water samplers to determine the relationship between subsurface isotopic and chemical concentrations to those of rainfall and resulting streamflow. A t test showed that +/- 2 parts per thousand represented a significant difference between successive sample deuterium values. Eleven rainfall episodes were subdivided into two categories: (1) two events where stream isotopic composition did not deflect > 2 parts per thousand from prestorm values, and (2) four events which demonstrated new water flushing. Detailed analysis of one 47-mm rainfall (9.8-mm runoff) event showed that old water dominated streamwater exiting the watershed by 90% using a standard two-component hydrograph separation for deuterium (corroborated by Cl and electrical conductivity). Three-component hydrograph separation indicated that 12-16% was in the form of soil water, with < 5% as on-channel precipitation and 80% groundwater. Analysis of over 1000 water samples revealed systematic trends in soil water and groundwater isotopic composition both in a downslope and downprofile direction. Between-storm suction lysimeter deuterium data showed a systematic dampened response to temporally variable rainfall deuterium concentrations. Multivariate cluster analysis revealed three distinct soil water/groundwater groupings, with respect to soil depth and geographic position within the watershed. Within-storm suction lysimeter sampling preserved similar groupings, indicating that the subsurface reservoir is poorly mixed on short time scales. Understanding subsurface mixing response to rainfall should greatly improve models of episodic stream response and partitioning of storm flow into waters of different age.

AB Little attention has been given to the role of groundwater in the hydrological cycle of lowland watersheds. Our objective in this study was to estimate total recharge to groundwater by analysing water table response to storm events and the rate at which water was transferred into the shallow aquifer. This was conducted at three sites in a rural watershed in the lower Atlantic coastal plain near Charleston, South Carolina, USA. A novel version of the water table fluctuation method was used to estimate total recharge to the shallow aquifer by comparing hourly data of water table position following storm events and measuring water table recession behavior, rather than subjective graphical analysis methods. Also, shallow aquifer recharge rates (vertical fluxes) were estimated using Darcy's Law by comparing static water levels in a water table well and in a shallow piezometer during dry periods. The total annual recharge estimated ranged from 107 +/- 39?mm.yr1 (510% of annual precipitation) at a poorly drained topographic low area to 1140 +/- 230?mm.yr1 (6294% of annual precipitation) for a moderately well-drained upland site. The average aquifer recharge rate was 114 +/- 60?mm.yr1, which is similar to previous estimations of base flow for the ephemeral third-order streams in this watershed. The difference in the two methods may have been caused by processes not accounted for in the Darcy flux method, soil moisture deficits, and average evapotranspiration demand, which is about 1100?mm.yr1 for this region. Although other factors also can affect partitioning of recharge, an integrated approach to inspecting easily gathered groundwater data can provide information on an often neglected aspect of water budget estimation. We also discuss the effects of land use change on recharge reduction, given a typical development scenario for the region. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Seasonal low flows are important for sustaining ecosystems and for supplying human needs during the dry season. In California's Sierra Nevada mountains, low flows are primarily sustained by groundwater that is recharged during snowmelt. As the climate warms over the next century, the volume of the annual Sierra Nevada snowpack is expected to decrease by similar to 40-90%. In eight snow-dominated catchments in the Sierra Nevada, we analysed records of snow water equivalent (SWE) and unimpaired streamflow records spanning 10-33 years. Linear extrapolations of historical SWE/streamflow relationships suggest that annual minimum flows in some catchments could decrease to zero if peak SWE is reduced to roughly half of its historical average. For every 10% decrease in peak SWE, annual minimum flows decrease 9-22% and occur 3-7 days earlier in the year. In two of the study catchments, Sagehen and Pitman Creeks, seasonal low flows are significantly correlated with the previous year's snowpack as well as the current year's snowpack. We explore how future warming could affect the relationship between winter snowpacks and summer low flows, using a distributed hydrologic model Regional Hydro-ecologic Ecosystem Simulation System (RHESSys) to simulate the response of two study catchments. Model results suggest that a 10% decrease in peak SWE will lead to a 1-8% decrease in low flows. The modelled streams do not dry up completely, because the effects of reduced SWE are partly offset by increased fall or winter net gains in storage, and by shifts in the timing of peak evapotranspiration. We consider how groundwater storage, snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates, and precipitation phase (snow vs rain) influence catchment response to warming. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Estimating the probabilities of rare floods in mountainous watersheds is challenging due to the hydrometeorological complexity of seasonally varying snowmelt and soil moisture dynamics, as well as spatiotemporal variability in extreme precipitation. Design storm methods and statistical flood frequency analyses often overlook these complexities and how they shape the probabilities of rare floods. This study presents a process-based approach that combines gridded precipitation, stochastic storm transposition (SST), and physics-based distributed rainfall-runoff modeling to simulate flood peak and volume distributions up to the 10,000-year recurrence interval and to provide insights into the hydrometeorological drivers of those events. The approach is applied to a small mountainous watershed in the Colorado Front Range in the United States. We show that storm transposition in the Front Range can be justified under existing definitions of regional precipitation homogeneity. The process-based results show close agreement with a statistically based mixture distribution that considers underlying flood drivers. We further demonstrate that antecedent conditions and snowmelt drive frequent peak discharges and rarer flood volumes, while the upper tail of the flood peak distribution appears to be controlled by heavy rainfall and rain-on-snow. In particular, we highlight the important role of early fall extreme rainfall in controlling rare flood peaks (but not volumes), despite only one such event having been observed in recent decades. Notwithstanding issues related to the accuracy of gridded precipitation datasets, these findings highlight the potential of SST and process-based modeling to help understand the relationships between flood drivers and flood frequencies.

AB Mechanisms of runoff generation in the humid tropics are poorly understood, particularly in the context of land-use/land cover change. This study analyzed the results of 124 storm hydrographs from three humid tropical catchments of markedly different vegetation cover and land-use history in central Panama during the 2017 wet season: actively grazed pasture, young secondary succession, and near-mature forest. We used electrical conductivity to separate baseflow (old water) from storm-event water (new-water). In all three land covers, new-water dominated storm runoff generation in 44% of the sampled storm events, indicating the dominance of fast shallow flow paths in the landscape. Activation of these flow paths was found to depend on a combination of maximum rainfall intensity and total storm rainfall, which, in turn, relates to markedly contrasting hydrograph separation results among land covers. Relationships between these rainfall characteristics and storm runoff generation were nonlinear, producing a threshold response with the exceedance of specific rainfall volumes and/or intensities. The pastoral catchment delivered order of magnitude more new-water during storm events than the two forested catchments. Although new-water contributed minimally (<10%) to total wet season runoff in the forested catchments, 43% of runoff generation in the pasture came from five large rainfall events where a threshold response produced substantial increases in total runoff and new-runoff efficiency. Based on our results, we propose a conceptual model of hydrologic flow paths in humid tropical systems that can explain previously observed disparities in seasonal storage and runoff with respect to land use/land cover.

TI Does the Hook Structure Constrain Future Flood Intensification Under
   Anthropogenic Climate Warming?

AB Atmospheric moisture holding capacity increases with temperature by about 7% per degrees C according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Thermodynamically then, precipitation intensity should exponentially intensify and thus worsen flood conditions as the climate warms. However, regional and global analyses often report a nonmonotonic (hook) scaling of precipitation and runoff, in which extremes strengthen with rising temperature up to a maximum or peak point (T-pp) and decline thereafter. The underlying cause of this hook structure is not yet well-understood, and whether it may shift and/or regulate storm runoff extremes under anthropogenic climate warming remains unknown. Here, we examine temperature scaling of precipitation and storm runoff extremes under different climate conditions using observations and large ensemble hydroclimatic simulations over mainland China. In situ observations suggest a spatially homogeneous, negative response of relative humidity to warming climates over 34.6% of the land area, and the remaining hook-dominated regions usually show a colder T-pp than that of precipitation or storm runoff extremes. The precipitation and streamflow series over mainland China's catchments throughout the 21st century are projected by a model cascade chain under a high-end emission scenario (RCP 8.5), which involves 31 CMIP5 climate models, 11 CMIP6 climate members, a daily bias correction method, and four lumped conceptual hydrological models. The CMIP5 ensemble projects that the hook structures shift toward warmer temperature bins, resulting in 10%-30% increases in storm runoff extremes over mainland China, while the CMIP6 ensemble projects more severe flood conditions in future warming climates.

AB The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) performed two acquisitions over two mountainous basins in California on 29 January and 3 March 2017, encompassing two atmospheric river events that brought heavy snowfall to the area. These surveys produced high-resolution (50 m) maps of snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) that were used to estimate monthly areal snowfall accumulation. Comparison of ASO snow accumulation with point measurements showed that the ASO estimates ranged from -10 to +16% relative bias across three sites, which is likely inflated by the disagreement in areal representation of the quantities from the actual errors in these products. The aggregated SWE accumulations from ASO are then used to evaluate a suite of in situ based and remote sensing precipitation products. During the study period, Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and Mountain Mapper estimates had relative bias <10% compared with ASO-based estimates of snow accumulation, but satellite and radar products largely underestimate snowfall accumulation compared to ASO (up to 50%). Despite their underestimation, satellite and radar products show correlation coefficients >0.8 with ASO snow accumulation over the selected grids at the monthly scale. Finally, we leveraged the fine-scale sampling of the spatially complete ASO products to show that by moving from 100 m to 2 km spatial scales, the perceived bias errors SWE at point locations increased by an order of magnitude, displaying a nonlinear relationship. The study demonstrates that ASO acquisitions in cold months can bring a new and effective approach to spatial evaluation of precipitation products.

AB The perennial shrub Larrea tridentata is widely successful in North American warm deserts but is also susceptible to climatic perturbations. Understanding its response to rainfall variability requires consideration of multiple time scales. We examine intra-annual to multiyear relationships using model simulations of soil moisture and vegetation growth over 50 years in the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California (USA). Ecohydrological model parameters are conditioned on field and remote sensing data using an ensemble Kalman filter. Although no specific periodicities were detected in the rainfall record, simulated leaf-area-index exhibits multiyear dynamics that are driven by multiyear (approximate to 3 years) rains, but with up to a 1 year delay in peak response. Within a multiyear period, Larrea tridentata is more sensitive to winter rains than summer. In the most active part of the root zone (above approximate to 80 cm), >1 year average soil moisture drives vegetation growth, but monthly average soil moisture is controlled by root uptake. Moisture inputs reach the lower part of the root zone (below approximate to 80 cm) infrequently, but once there they can persist over a year to help sustain plant growth. Parameter estimates highlight efficient plant physiological properties facilitating persistent growth and high soil hydraulic conductivity allowing deep soil moisture stores. We show that soil moisture as an ecological indicator is complicated by bidirectional interactions with vegetation that depend on time scale and depth. Under changing climate, Larrea tridentata will likely be relatively resilient to shorter-term moisture variability but will exhibit higher sensitivity to shifts in seasonal to multiyear moisture inputs.

AB Remote sensing could enable high-resolution mapping of long river segments, but realizing this potential will require new methods for inferring channel bathymetry from passive optical image data without using field measurements for calibration. As an alternative to regression-based approaches, this study introduces a novel framework for Flow REsistance Equation-Based Imaging of River Depths (FREEBIRD). This technique allows for depth retrieval in the absence of field data by linking a linear relation between an image-derived quantity X and depth d to basic equations of open channel flow: continuity and flow resistance. One FREEBIRD algorithm takes as input an estimate of the channel aspect (width/depth) ratio A and a series of cross-sections extracted from the image and returns the coefficients of the X versus d relation. A second algorithm calibrates this relation so as to match a known discharge Q. As an initial test of FREEBIRD, these procedures were applied to panchromatic satellite imagery and publicly available aerial photography of a clear-flowing gravel-bed river. Accuracy assessment based on independent field surveys indicated that depth retrieval performance was comparable to that achieved by direct, field-based calibration methods. Sensitivity analyses suggested that FREEBIRD output was not heavily influenced by misspecification of A or Q, or by selection of other input parameters. By eliminating the need for simultaneous field data collection, these methods create new possibilities for large-scale river monitoring and analysis of channel change, subject to the important caveat that the underlying relationship between X and d must be reasonably strong.

AB The hydraulic properties of the layer at the vicinity of the soil surface have significant impact on evaporation and could be harnessed to reduce water losses. The effect of the properties of the upper layer on the evolution of phase distribution during the evaporation process is first illustrated from three-dimensional pore network simulations. This effect is then studied from experiments carried out on soil columns under laboratory conditions. Comparisons between homogeneous columns packed with coarse (sand) and fine (sandy loam) materials and heterogeneous columns packed with layers of fine overlying coarse material and coarse overlying fine material of different thicknesses are performed to assess the impact of upper layer properties on evaporation. Experiments are analyzed using the classical approach based on the numerical solution of Richards equation and semianalytical theoretical predictions. The theoretical analysis is based on the clear distinction between two drying regimes, namely, the capillary regime and the gravity-capillary regime, which are the prevailing regimes in our experiments. Simple relationships enabling to estimate the duration of stage 1 evaporation (S1) for both regimes are proposed. In particular, this led to defining the characteristic length for the gravity-capillary regime from the consideration of viscous effects at low water content differently from available expressions. The duration of S1, during which most of the water losses occur, for both the homogeneous and two-layer columns is presented and discussed. Finally, the impact of liquid films and its consequences on the soil hydraulic conductivity function are briefly discussed.

AB Understanding the hydrological functioning of tidally influenced floodplain forests is essential for advancing ecosystem protection and restoration goals in impacted systems. However, finding direct relationships between basic hydrological inputs and floodplain hydrology is hindered by complex interactions between surface water, groundwater, and atmospheric fluxes in a variably saturated matrix with heterogeneous soils, vegetation, and topography. Thus, an explanatory method for identifying common trends and causal factors is required. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA), a time series dimension reduction technique, models temporal variation in observed data as linear combinations of common trends, which represent unidentified common factors, and explanatory variables. In this work, DFA was applied to model water table elevation (WTE) in the floodplain of the Loxahatchee River (Florida, USA), where altered watershed hydrology has led to changing hydroperiod and salinity regimes and undesired vegetative changes in the floodplain forest. The technique proved to be a powerful tool for the study of interactions among 29 long-term, nonstationary hydrological time series (12 WTE series and 17 candidate explanatory variables). Regional groundwater circulation, surface water elevations, and spatially variable net local recharge (cumulative rainfall - cumulative evapotranspiration) were found to be the main factors explaining groundwater profiles. The relative importance of these factors was spatially related to floodplain elevation, distance from the river channel, and distance upstream from the river mouth. The resulting dynamic factor model (DFM) simulated the WTE time series well (overall coefficient of efficiency, C-eff = 0.91) and is useful for assessing management scenarios for ecosystem restoration and predicted sea level rise.

AB Transient storage of stream water and associated solutes is expected to vary along stream networks in response to related changes in stream hydraulic conditions and morphologic gradients. These spatial changes are relevant to a wide variety of processes (e. g., biogeochemical cycling), yet data regarding these dynamics are limited and almost exclusively confined to the general storage terms of transient storage models with a single-storage zone (1-SZ). We used a transient storage model with two-storage zones (2-SZ) to simulate field data from conservative solute injections conducted in a coastal stream network in Massachusetts to separately quantify surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS). Solute tracer additions were performed at basin-wide, low-flow conditions, and results were compared with respect to stream size. Strong positive relationships with reach contributing area indicated that the size of the main channel and the size and residence time in surface and hyporheic storage zones all increased from small to large streams. Conversely, longitudinal dispersion and the storage zone exchange coefficients had no consistent trends downstream. The influence of storage exchange on median transport time (F-MED(200)) was consistently large for STS and negligible for HTS. When compared to 1-SZ model estimates, we found that the general 1-SZ model storage terms did not consistently describe either STS or HTS exchange. Overall our results indicated that many zone-specific (STS and HTS) storage dynamics were sensitive to the combination of hydraulic and morphologic gradients along the stream network and followed positive trends with stream size.

AB Theoretical and conceptual models for predicting the subsurface flow in a sloping aquifer are presented. One category of models is of the lumped conceptual type that is based on combining the continuity equation with discharge-storage relationships derived from the steady state solutions of the linearized Boussinesq equation. The second categories of models are derived from the linearized unsteady Boussinesq equation using the method of Green's function. The Green's function solution determines the water table profile and the aquifer outflow for nonuniform and nonsteady recharge distribution, arbitrary initial water table profile, and time-varying stream level at the downstream end. The latter theoretical models pertain to a finite domain and to a semi-infinite domain and are of two types depending on the linearization approach. The conceptual and theoretical models are used to derive the outflow and the cumulative outflow expressions for a particular set of conditions, and a comparative analysis is carried out. Semi-infinite aquifer models generate almost the same results as the more complicated finite aquifer models and the quasi-steady state models perform as well as the nonsteady ones for long recharge events. The kinematic wave model is also shown to provide a good approximation of Boussinesq models for steep slopes and high hydraulic conductivity. The application of the various models is also illustrated for three published experimental data. The present models can be easily incorporated in catchments models and can provide a suitable framework for aquifer parameter estimation, base flow separation and recession analysis, and analysis of drainage in landfills.

TI Extreme rainfall in West Africa: A regional modeling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID PRECIPITATION; SAHEL; FLOOD; VARIABILITY
AB In a world of increasing exposure of populations to natural hazards, the mapping of extreme rainfall remains a key subject of study. Such maps are required for both flood risk management and civil engineering structure design, the challenge being to take into account the local information provided by point rainfall series as well as the necessity of some regional coherency. Two approaches based on the extreme value theory are compared here, with an application to extreme rainfall mapping in West Africa. The first approach is a local fit and interpolation (LFI) consisting of a spatial interpolation of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters estimated independently at each station. The second approach is a spatial maximum likelihood estimation (SMLE); it directly estimates the GEV distribution over the entire region by a single maximum likelihood fit using jointly all measurements combined with spatial covariates. Five LFI and three SMLE methods are considered, using the information provided by 126 daily rainfall series covering the period 1950-1990. The methods are first evaluated in calibration. Then the predictive skills and the robustness are assessed through a cross validation and an independent network validation process. The SMLE approach, especially when using the mean annual rainfall as covariate, appears to perform better for most of the scores computed. Using the Niamey 104 year time series, it is also shown that the SMLE approach has the capacity to deal more efficiently with the effect of local outliers by using the spatial information provided by nearby stations.

AB We have derived a rapidly computed analytical solution for drawdown caused by a partially or fully penetrating directional wellbore (vertical, horizontal, or slant) via Green's function method. The mathematical model assumes an anisotropic, homogeneous, confined, box-shaped aquifer. Any dimension of the box can have one of six possible boundary conditions: 1) both sides no-flux; 2) one side no-flux one side constant-head; 3) both sides constant-head; 4) one side no-flux; 5) one side constant-head; 6) free boundary conditions. The solution has been optimized for rapid computation via Poisson Resummation, derivation of convergence rates, and numerical optimization of integration techniques. Upon application of the Poisson Resummation method, we were able to derive two sets of solutions with inverse convergence rates, namely an early-time rapidly convergent series (solution-A) and a late-time rapidly convergent series (solution-B). From this work we were able to link Green's function method (solution-B) back to image well theory (solution-A). We then derived an equation defining when the convergence rate between solution-A and solution-B is the same, which we termed the switch time. Utilizing the more rapidly convergent solution at the appropriate time, we obtained rapid convergence at all times. We have also shown that one may simplify each of the three infinite series for the three-dimensional solution to 11 terms and still maintain a maximum relative error of less than 10(-14).

AB During the last decade, a number of models have been developed to consider the conflict in dynamic reservoir operation. Most of these models are discrete dynamic models which are developed based on game theory. In this study, a continuous model of dynamic game and its corresponding solutions are developed for reservoir operation. Two solution methods are used to solve the model of continuous dynamic game, namely the Ricatti equations and collocation methods. The Ricatti equations method is a closed form solution, requiring less computational efforts compared with discrete models. The collocation solution method applies Newton's method or a quasi-Newton method to find the problem solution. These approaches are able to generate operating policies for dynamic reservoir operation. The Zayandeh-Rud river basin in central Iran is used as a case study and the results are compared with alternative water allocation models. The results show that the proposed solution methods are quite capable of providing appropriate reservoir operating policies, while requiring rather short computational times due to continuous formulation of state and decision variables. Reliability indices are used to compare the overall performance of the proposed models. Based on the results from this study, the collocation method leads to improved values of the reliability indices for total reservoir system and utility satisfaction of water users, compared to the Ricatti equations method. This is attributed to the flexible structure of the collocation model. When compared to alternative water allocation models, lower values of reliability indices are achieved by the collocation method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing en route to sensitive coastal environments. Whilst our understanding of these systems has improved over the years, we still have limited knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of critical biogeochemical drivers within salt marshes. Sea-level rise will continue to force change on salt marsh functioning, highlighting the urgency of filling this knowledge gap. Our study was conducted in a central California estuary experiencing extensive marsh drowning and relative sea-level rise, making it a model system for such an investigation. Here we instrumented three marsh positions subjected to different degrees of tidal inundation (6.7%, 8.9%, and 11.2% of the time for the upper, middle, and lower marsh positions, respectively), providing locations with varied biogeochemical characteristics and hydrological interactions at the site. We continuously monitored redox potential (Eh) at depths of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m, subsurface water levels (WL), and temperature at 0.7 m depth at each marsh position. To understand how drivers of subsurface biogeochemical processes fluctuate across tidal cycles, we used wavelet analyses to explain the interactions between Eh and WL. We found that tidal forcing significantly affects key drivers of biogeochemical processes by imparting controls on Eh variability, likely driving subsurface hydro-biogeochemistry of the salt marsh. Wavelet coherence showed that the Eh-WL relationship is nonlinear, and their lead-lag relationship is variable. We found that precipitation events perturb Eh at depth over timescales of hours, even though WL shows relatively minimal change during events. This work highlights the importance of high frequency in situ measurements, such as Eh, to help explain factors that govern subsurface biogeochemistry and hydrological processes in salt marshes.

AB Hydrological events transport large proportions of annual or seasonal dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads from catchments to streams. The timing, magnitude and intensity of these events are very sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, particularly across the boreal region where snowpacks are declining and summer droughts are increasing. It is important to understand how landscape characteristics modulate event-scale DOC dynamics in order to scale up predictions from sites across regions, and to understand how climatic changes will influence DOC dynamics across the boreal forest. The goal of this study was to assess variability in DOC concentrations in boreal headwater streams across catchments with varying physiographic characteristics (e.g., size, proportion of wetland) during a range of hydrological events (e.g., spring snowmelt, summer/fall storm events). From 2016 to 2017, continuous discharge and sub-daily chemistry grab samples were collected from three adjacent study catchments located at the International Institute for Sustainable Development-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Catchment differences were more apparent in summer and fall events and less apparent during early spring melt events. Hysteresis analysis suggested that DOC sources were proximal to the stream for all events at a catchment dominated by a large wetland near the outlet, but distal from the stream at the catchments that lacked significant wetland coverage during the summer and fall. Wetland coverage also influenced responses of DOC export to antecedent moisture; at the wetland-dominated catchment, there were consistent negative relationships between DOC concentrations and antecedent moisture, while at the catchments without large wetlands, the relationships were positive or not significant. These results emphasize the utility of sub-daily sampling for inferring catchment DOC transport processes, and the importance of considering catchment-specific factors when predicting event-scale DOC behaviour.

AB The Budyko framework consists of a curvilinear relationship between the evaporative ratio (i.e., actual evaporation over precipitation) and the aridity index (i.e., potential evaporation over precipitation) and defines evaporation's water and energy limits. A basin's movement within the Budyko space illustrates its hydroclimatic change and helps identify the main drivers of change. On the one hand, long-term aridity changes drive evaporative ratio changes, moving basins along their Budyko curves. On the other hand, historical human development can cause river basins to deviate from their curves. The question is if basins will deviate or follow their Budyko curves under the future effects of global warming and related human developments. To answer this, we quantify the movement in the Budyko space of 405 river basins from 1901-1950 to 2051-2100 based on the outputs of seven models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 6 (CMIP6). We account for the implications of using different potential evaporation models and study low- and high-emissions scenarios. We find considerable differences of movement in Budyko space regarding direction and intensity when using the two estimates of potential evaporation. However, regardless of the potential evaporation estimate and the scenario used, most river basins will not follow their reference Budyko curves (>72%). Furthermore, the number of basins not following their curves increases under high greenhouse gas emissions and fossil-fueled development SP585 and across dry and wet basin groups. We elaborate on the possible explanations for a large number of basins not following their Budyko curves.

TI Informing Seasonal Proxy-Based Flow Reconstructions Using Baseflow
   Separation: An Example From the Potomac River, United States
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE baseflow; reconstruction tree rings; streamflow
AB Paleoclimatic perspectives on hydrological variability can offer valuable information on the frequency and magnitude of extreme events. Tree-ring records are a common proxy used to reconstruct past streamflow due to their interannual resolution and often strong correlation with hydroclimate variability. The separation of streamflow into theoretical baseflow and stormflow constituents is regularly utilized to differentiate between flow-generating processes; however, it has yet to see use in paleoclimate reconstructions. We compare three approaches which use log-linear, gamma-distributed, and baseflow-separated regression, respectively, to reconstructing flow at a well-studied gage-the Potomac River at Point of Rock, Maryland. Preinstrumental baseflow and streamflow for summer were estimated for the past 350 years using a regional network of tree-ring chronologies. Additionally, estimates of winter flow were produced for the same period using a nonoverlapping set of tree-ring data. Tree growth appears to have a stronger relationship with baseflow than with streamflow for both seasons, supporting the use of baseflow as predictand. The number of chronologies subsequently chosen as predictors for streamflow was also lower than for baseflow and represents an additional source of reconstruction bias/uncertainty when total streamflow is the predictand. Historical records support the validity of both summer and winter reconstructions. The winter reconstruction indicates that several years of consecutive below-mean flows, on par with the 1960s drought, occurred with higher frequency prior to the instrumental era. Our results suggest that baseflow separation can improve reconstruction skill and provide additional information to water resource management on the long-term variability of hydrological extremes.

AB Drought impacts on the society and environment are influenced by how droughts propagate through the hydrologic cycle; however, the physical processes involved in drought propagation are not well understood. In this study, a physically based hydrologic model is used to understand the drought propagation mechanisms and their controlling factors in multiple watersheds selected from different regions of the contiguous United States (CONUS). The characteristics of hydrologic droughts are found to be significantly different in three regions of the CONUS: (1) western U.S. watersheds have long and intense streamflow droughts, (2) Great Plains and southwest U.S. watersheds have low intensity and duration of streamflow droughts, and (3) eastern U.S. watersheds have short but intense streamflow droughts. This spatial pattern of hydrologic drought characteristics is found to coincide with the pattern of climate properties. Highly seasonal recharge driven by winter precipitation or snowmelt leads to longer streamflow droughts in the western United States; whereas humid climate with low seasonality in the eastern United States leads to shorter streamflow droughts. Furthermore, the storage-discharge relationship is identified as a key watershed property which controls the intensity of hydrologic droughts. Higher sensitivity of baseflow to watershed storage in the western and the eastern U.S. watersheds leads to more intense streamflow droughts in these regions. In the Great Plains and southwest United States, watersheds have a lower sensitivity of baseflow to catchment storage which, combined with the highly arid climate, leads to low variability in baseflow, and in turn results in low intensity of streamflow droughts in the region.

AB Catchment storage controls most ecohydrological processes by modulating, among other things, the hydrological connectivity between landscape units. However, little is known about the internal dynamics of storage and its feedback with hydraulic connectivity. Here we evaluate the capability of a combined lumped approach (i.e., combining catchment water balance and recession analysis) to partition total dynamic storage (from the water balance) into hydraulically connected (the part feeding stream estimated from recession analysis) and hydraulically disconnected components (i.e., the remaining storage driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration). Results from our combined approach were compared to a point measurement-based estimation (using wells and soil moisture data) from the experimental Weierbach catchment in Luxembourg (0.45km(2)). We found good agreement for the hydraulically connected storage but contrasted results for the hydraulically disconnected storage. During wet periods, the latter were characterized by opposite dynamics and our lumped approach showed step-by-step deviations. Overall, these results indicated a good capability of our approach to partition storage, as well as its sensitivity to systematic and random deviations. Considering these possible deviations, this new conceptualization of storage provides relevant and quantifiable information about catchment state (i.e., storage dominated or release dominated). This is further highlighted when represented in a dual-storage plot (hydraulically disconnected vs. connected storage). Compared to classic storage-discharge relationships, it allows catchment efficiency (capacity of the catchment to convert storage into streamflow) to be assessed without the need for additional data. We expect that this mechanistic conceptualization of the storage function will provide new opportunities for assessing catchment functioning and catchment classification.

AB Many pharmaceuticals inevitably end up in surface waters, exerting unwanted biological activity in nontarget organisms. This effect is confined by the compound's environmental persistence. Regulatory laboratory simulation tests are used in persistence assessment and exposure modeling. While doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of laboratory-derived persistence indicators under field conditions, these remain the only inputs for chemical fate models due to difficulties of measuring persistence in situ, especially at large scales. To improve understanding about relationships between laboratory experiments and the environmental fate in streams, we developed a mathematical model of biodegradation in stream networks and combined it with in-stream monitoring data to (i) test if persistence could be evaluated from field data, (ii) check if persistence extracted from laboratory tests applied in the field, and (iii) locate hot spots of biodegradation in a large river basin. The model describes partitioning, and particle settling and resuspension, and is structurally compatible with those applied for evaluating laboratory simulation tests. Application to the Rhine river basin suggests that biotransformation rate constants extracted from laboratory tests underestimate those in the field, yet the percentage of biotransformation in the Rhine basin is less than in the laboratory tests due effective biotransformation being limited to small- and medium-sized streams. In conclusion, our data show that biotransformation rates can accurately be predicted if (i) monitoring is performed across a wide range in stream order and (ii) precise estimates for consumption and removal rates at wastewater treatment plants are known.

AB The recent California drought has highlighted the potential vulnerability of the state's water management infrastructure to multiyear dry intervals. Due to the high complexity of the network, dynamic storage changes in California reservoirs on a state-wide scale have previously been difficult to model using either traditional statistical or physical approaches. Indeed, although there is a significant line of research on exploring models for single (or a small number of) reservoirs, these approaches are not amenable to a system-wide modeling of the California reservoir network due to the spatial and hydrological heterogeneities of the system. In this work, we develop a state-wide statistical graphical model to characterize the dependencies among a collection of 55 major California reservoirs across the state; this model is defined with respect to a graph in which the nodes index reservoirs and the edges specify the relationships or dependencies between reservoirs. We obtain and validate this model in a data-driven manner based on reservoir volumes over the period 2003-2016. A key feature of our framework is a quantification of the effects of external phenomena that influence the entire reservoir network. We further characterize the degree to which physical factors (e.g., state-wide Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), average temperature, snow pack) and economic factors (e.g., consumer price index, number of agricultural workers) explain these external influences. As a consequence of this analysis, we obtain a system-wide health diagnosis of the reservoir network as a function of PDSI.

AB Geophysics provides a multidimensional suite of investigative methods that are transforming our ability to see into the very fabric of the subsurface environment, and monitor the dynamics of its fluids and the biogeochemical reactions that occur within it. Here we document how geophysical methods have emerged as valuable tools for investigating shallow subsurface processes over the past two decades and offer a vision for future developments relevant to hydrology and also ecosystem science. The field of hydrogeophysics arose in the late 1990s, prompted, in part, by the wealth of studies on stochastic subsurface hydrology that argued for better field-based investigative techniques. These new hydrogeophysical approaches benefited from the emergence of practical and robust data inversion techniques, in many cases with a view to quantify shallow subsurface heterogeneity and the associated dynamics of subsurface fluids. Furthermore, the need for quantitative characterization stimulated a wealth of new investigations into petrophysical relationships that link hydrologically relevant properties to measurable geophysical parameters. Development of time-lapse approaches provided a new suite of tools for hydrological investigation, enhanced further with the realization that some geophysical properties may be sensitive to biogeochemical transformations in the subsurface environment, thus opening up the new field of biogeophysics. Early hydrogeophysical studies often concentrated on relatively small plot-scale experiments. More recently, however, the translation to larger-scale characterization has been the focus of a number of studies. Geophysical technologies continue to develop, driven, in part, by the increasing need to understand and quantify key processes controlling sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.

AB As drought involves diverse natural and human-made processes in hydrologic cycles, it is necessary to track a process-specific variable for efficient drought risk management. In this study, we employed a state-of-the-art formulation of the generalized complementary relationship (GCR) to estimate terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET). The GCR ET estimates were used to assess historical droughts over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in relation to long-term natural fluctuations. Results showed that the GCR provided strong performance in reproducing water balance ET estimates and correlations to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, when compared to observation-driven estimates and land surface models. For 1982-2011, the GCR yielded better performance than land surface models even with estimated radiation inputs and no wind speed variations. The Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) based on the GCR provided a consistent drought assessment with precipitation-based drought identification and remotely sensed vegetation conditions. The SEDI seems to capture the heat wave-driven flash drought together with water deficit-driven droughts. In the CONUS, the La Nina-like conditions were likely to trigger extensive vegetation droughts with extreme severity. This study found the three long-term environmental factors that affect the general trend of ET deficits over the CONUS, which are the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the mean air temperature, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Especially, the Atlantic Oscillation seems to be the most significant predictor that could explain the long-term variation of vegetation droughts over the CONUS. This study highlights that the GCR-based SEDI could be useful for monitoring and assessment of drought risks at a continental scale.

AB Trends in monthly evapotranspiration (ET) rates across three watersheds covering the Central Valley in California were calculated by the latest calibration-free version of the complementary relationship of evaporation for 1979-2015. While a recent study concluded that ET rates of the irrigated fields in the Central Valley were declining in 1981-2007, here an ET trend of about 2.6 +/- 12 mm per decade was found over the same period in spite of a drop in precipitation (-22 +/- 30 mm per decade) and ET rates (-9.5 +/- 10 mm per decade) for the rest of the watersheds, none of them statistically significant. After 2007, the precipitation decline accelerated causing a sharp drop in both irrigated and nonirrigated ET rates across the watersheds. Observations from the California Irrigation Management Information System support the present findings: Under increasing air temperatures, both dew point temperature and relative humidity values increased (at a statistically significant rate) during 1983-2007, while they reversed afterwards, in agreement with the estimated sharp irrigation ET trend decline for the remainder of the study period. Actual (in this case over irrigated fields) and reference ET rates complement each other, that is, they express opposite tendencies, as was demonstrated with California Irrigation Management Information System data, yielding a statistically significant plot-scale irrigation ET rate increase of 31 to 41 (+/- 17) millimeters per decade for 1983-2007 in accordance with a similar drop in reference ET rates of -28 to -50 (+/- 16) millimeters per decade, depending on whether published monthly or daily values (aggregated to monthly ones after leaving out spurious measurements) were employed.

AB A major difficulty in modeling multiphase flow in porous media is the emergence of trapped phases. Our experiments demonstrate that gas can be trapped in either single-pores, multipores, or in large connected networks. These large connected clusters can comprise up to eight grain volumes and can contain up to 50% of the whole trapped gas volume. About 85% of the gas volume is trapped by multipore gas clusters. This variety of possible trapped gas clusters of different shape and volume will lead to a better process understanding of bubble-mediated mass transfer. Since multipore gas bubbles are in contact with the solid surface through ultrathin adsorbed water films the interfacial area between trapped gas clusters and intergranular capillary water is only about 80% of the total gas surface. We could derive a significant (R-2=0.98) linear relationship between the gas-water-interface and gas saturation. We found no systematic dependency of the front velocity of the invading water phase in the velocity range from 0.1 to 0.6 cm/min corresponding to capillary numbers from 2 x 10(-7) to 10(-6). Our experimental results indicate that the capillary trapping mechanism is controlled by the local pore structure and local connectivity and not by thermodynamics, i.e., by the minimum of the Free Energy, at least in the considered velocity range. Consistent with this physical picture is our finding that the trapping frequency (5 bubble-size distribution) reflects the pore size distribution for the whole range of pore radii, i.e., the capillary trapping process is determined by statistics and not by thermodynamics.

AB Developing a predictive understanding of subsurface contaminant plume evolution and natural attenuation capacity is hindered by the inability to tractably characterize controlling reactive transport properties over field-relevant scales. Here we explore a concept of reactive facies, which is based on the hypothesis that subsurface units exist that have unique distributions of properties that influence reactive transport. We further hypothesize that geophysical methods can be used to identify and spatially distribute reactive facies and their associated parameters. We test the reactive facies concept at a U. S. Department of Energy uranium-contaminated groundwater site, where we have analyzed the relationships between laboratory and field (including radar and seismic tomographic) data sets. Our analysis suggests that there are two reactive facies that have unique distributions of mineralogy, texture, hydraulic conductivity, and geophysical attributes. We use these correlations within a Bayesian framework to integrate the dense geophysical data sets with the sparse core-based measurements. This yields high-resolution (0.25 m x 0.25 m) estimates of reactive facies and their associated properties and uncertainties along the 2-D tomographic transects. Comparison with colocated samples shows that the estimated properties fall within 95% uncertainty bounds. To illustrate the value of reactive facies characterization approach, we used the geophysically estimated properties to parameterize reactive transport models, which were then used to simulate migration of an acidic-U plume through the domain. Modeling results suggest that each identified reactive facies exerts a unique control on plume evolution, highlighting the usefulness of the reactive facies concept for spatially distributing properties that control reactive transport over field-relevant scales.

The data set used in this paper is the first comprehensive collection of isotopic composition of NO3- in rivers of a large-scale basin in Asia. While the NO3- spatial concentration pattern showed significant seasonal variation, the spatial pattern of the delta N-15 of dissolved NO3- (delta(1)5N(NO3)) was more consistent throughout the year. The delta N-15(NO3) was significantly positively correlated with the population density of each catchment. A mass balance model assuming the delta N-15(NO3) and the flow rate of sewage effluent was developed. The model simulated the relationship between the population density and the delta N-15(NO3) reasonably well, suggesting that the dominant source contributing to the increase in delta N-15(NO3) was the sewage effluent. The spatiotemporal distribution of delta O-18(NO3) suggested the possibility of the addition of atmospherically derived NO3- through precipitation and was indicated by the hydrological pathways for NO3- exports in different land uses. In forest-dominated catchments with natural drainage systems, a slightly elevated delta O-18(NO3) signal remained in the stream water even during base flow conditions. This study demonstrated that multiscale, multi-isotopic investigation is a promising strategy for describing the spatial distribution of NO3- sources synoptically and is useful for evaluating the influences of land use change.

AB In this paper, a computational framework based on the material point method (MPM) is developed to study the coupled seepage-erosion-deformation process within unsaturated soils. Based on the mixture theory, the unsaturated erodible soil is conceptualized as a three-phase multi-species porous medium, which is represented as a set of Lagrangian material points in a three-phase multi-species single point MPM framework. Governing equations as well as constitutive models for describing the coupled seepage-erosion-deformation behaviour within unsaturated erodible soils are presented: the solid skeleton is modelled as an elasto-plastic material; the pore water is treated as a weakly compressible fluid; while the fine particles in the solid matrix can be eroded and transferred into liquidised fine particles, and transported with the flowing liquid. This governing system is discretised with the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method and solved explicitly. The proposed coupled seepage-erosion-deformation GIMP is validated via three numerical examples and then employed for simulating the rainfall-induced slope failure process involving internal erosion. Thanks to the capability of the MPM in capturing large deformations, the evolution of the coupled seepage-erosion-deformation behaviour during the whole slope failure process can be obtained. This suggests that the proposed coupled GIMP framework is a promising approach for future studies of internal erosion problems in unsaturated soils involving complex multi-couplings of seepage flow, phase change and large deformations, which are difficult to be modelled by traditional mesh-based methods.

AB We study the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional morphodynamic model governed by the shallow water and Exner equations to simulate reach-scale two-dimensional morphodynamics of bedload-dominated alluvial rivers. The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique.
   The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed.
   The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected "benchmarks'' include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.

AB In arid regions, groundwater is recharged laterally from rivers; this recharge is the primary source of water for vegetation. The rise or decline of the water table results in salinization or desertification respectively, and damages vegetation growth. Therefore, prediction of the water table with consideration of the stream-aquifer interactions is very important for understanding the hyporheic processes under human intervention, and to assess the ecological effects and water resource management of arid regions. This paper used a statistical-dynamical approach to predict the water table elevation near a river channel in an arid region from river discharge, which was achieved by a numerical model, a fitted stage-discharge function, and an automatic parameter calibration method. The model was established by reducing the problem of water table prediction under stream-aquifer interactions to an initial value problem of the differential equations with prescribed river discharge based on Darcy's law; the model parameters were automatically calibrated by the Shuffled Complex Evolution method. Synthetic experiments were used to test the sensitivities of the water table prediction to model parameters, and showed the robustness of the proposed scheme under different conditions. The proposed scheme was also calibrated and validated using data collected at the Yingsu section in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The systematic biases, mean absolute errors, root mean squared errors, and correlation coefficients for the validation had ranges of -0.22 similar to 0.16 m, 0.14 similar to 0.33 m, 0.18 similar to 0.44 m and 0.94 similar to 0.99 m respectively.

AB Long-term changes and variability in river flows in the tropical Upper Suriname River Basin in Suriname (2-6 degrees N, 54-58 degrees W) are analysed, including the relation to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. To analyse variability, lag correlation and statistical properties of the data series are used. Long-term changes are analysed using parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques. The analyses are performed for the period 1952-1985. The results show that both river discharge series at Semoisie and Pokigron are non-stationary and have a negative trend. The negative rainfall trend in the centre of Suriname may be responsible for the negative trend in the annual river discharges in the basin. The highest correlation (Pearson's coefficient c) is obtained when the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) SSTs lags the monthly discharges at Pokigron by 3-4 months (c = 0.7) and when the Tropical South Atlantic (TSA) SSTs lags the discharges by 4 months (c = -0.7). It also follows that the high (low) monthly flows, from April-August (September-March) are associated with increasing (decreasing) SSTs in the TNA and with decreasing (increasing) SSTs in the TSA. The results also reveal that years with low (high) discharges are more related to warmer (colder) SSTs during the year in the TNA region and a southward displacement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). However, the Pacific El Nino (La Nina) events may also be responsible for low (high) flow years in this basin. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB All computer models are simplified and imperfect simulators of complex natural systems. The discrepancy arising from simplification induces bias in model predictions, which may be amplified by the process of model calibration. This paper presents a new method to identify and quantify the predictive consequences of calibrating a simplified computer model. The method is based on linear theory, and it scales efficiently to the large numbers of parameters and observations characteristic of groundwater and petroleum reservoir models. The method is applied to a range of predictions made with a synthetic integrated surface-water/groundwater model with thousands of parameters. Several different observation processing strategies and parameterization/regularization approaches are examined in detail, including use of the Karhunen-Loeve parameter transformation. Predictive bias arising from model error is shown to be prediction specific and often invisible to the modeler. The amount of calibration-induced bias is influenced by several factors, including how expert knowledge is applied in the design of parameterization schemes, the number of parameters adjusted during calibration, how observations and model-generated counterparts are processed, and the level of fit with observations achieved through calibration. Failure to properly implement any of these factors in a prediction-specific manner may increase the potential for predictive bias in ways that are not visible to the calibration and uncertainty analysis process.

AB The mountain snow cover is an important source of water but also leads to natural hazards, such as avalanches and floods. We use data collected during winters 1999/2000 to 2007/2008 by 239 automatic and manual measurement stations in Switzerland to highlight spatial characteristics of extreme snowfall. With the help of extreme value theory based on a "peaks-over-threshold'' approach and a Poisson point process representation, we analyze spatial patterns and correlation characteristics. Our analyses show that a significant number of stations do not follow the Gumbel distribution. In particular, low altitude stations in the Swiss Plateau are heavy tailed because of rare extraordinary snowfall events. Spatial characteristics of extreme snowfall are compared to those of the mean snowfall. Altitudinal dependence and spatial distribution of mean and extreme snowfall are similar. Both mean snowfall and extreme snowfall show an increase of magnitude between 400 and 2200 m a.s.l. and a constant or slightly decreasing magnitude at higher altitudes. Below 1200 m a.s.l., the increase with altitude is stronger because of the rain-snow transition. Another finding is that the spatial correlation pattern of extreme snowfall is similar to that of mean snowfall, both of which are determined by the main climatological regions of Switzerland. An analysis based on those stations with a long record shows that extreme snowfall was 10% lower in the nine winters investigated than in the long-term period, but the main spatial characteristics of the two periods show no change.

AB Numerical models of permafrost evolution in porous media typically rely upon a smooth continuous relation between pore ice saturation and sub-freezing temperature, rather than the abrupt phase change that occurs in pure media. Soil scientists have known for decades that this function, known as the soil freezing curve (SFC), is related to the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) for unfrozen soils due to the analogous capillary and sorptive effects experienced during both soil freezing and drying. Herein we demonstrate that other factors beyond the SFC-SWCC relationship can influence the potential range over which pore water phase change occurs. In particular, we provide a theoretical extension for the functional form of the SFC based upon the presence of spatial heterogeneity in both soil thermal conductivity and the freezing point depression of water. We infer the functional form of the SFC from many abrupt-interface 1-D numerical simulations of heterogeneous systems with prescribed statistical distributions of water and soil properties. The proposed SFC paradigm extension has the appealing features that it (1) is determinable from measurable soil and water properties, (2) collapses into an abrupt phase transition for homogeneous media, (3) describes a wide range of heterogeneity within a single functional expression, and (4) replicates the observed hysteretic behavior of freeze-thaw cycles in soils.

AB Various experimental and theoretical studies have shown that Fick's law, based on the assumption of a linear relation between solute dispersive mass flux and concentration gradient, is not valid when high-concentration gradients are encountered in a porous medium. The Value of the macrodispersivity is found to decrease as the magnitude of the concentration gradient increases. The classical linear theory does not provide an explanation for this phenomenon. A recently developed theory suggests a nonlinear relation between the concentration gradient and dispersive mass flux, introducing a new parameter in addition to the longitudinal and transversal dispersivities. Once a unique set of relevant parameters has been determined (experimentally), the nonlinear theory provides satisfactory results, matching experimental data of column tests, over a wide range of density differences between resident and invading fluids. The lower limit of the nonlinear theory, i.e. very low (tracer) density differences, recovers the linear formulation of Fick's law.
   The equations describing high-concentration brine transport are a fluid mass balance, a salt mass balance in combination with a nonlinear dispersive mass flux equation, Darcy's law and an equation of state. We study the resulting set of nonlinear partial differential equations and derive explicit (exact) and semi-explicit solutions, under various assumptions. A comparison is made between mathematical solutions, numerical solutions and experimental data. The results indicate that the simple explicit solution can be used to simulate experiments in a wide range of density differences, given a unique set of experimentally determined parameters. The analysis shows that enhanced flow due to the compressibility effect, which is caused by local fluid density variations, can be disregarded in all cases considered. The linear formulation of Fick's law appears to give an upperbound for magnitude of the compressibility effect due to local volume changes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and sediment load are essential factors in water resource management, hydraulic engineering, soil and water conservation, sedimentation, and environmental ecology. A novel real-time SSC monitoring approach involving time domain reflectometry (TDR) was proposed. The previous results obtained indicated that the soil particle size does not affect the TDR SSC method and that this method is applicable at high suspended sediment concentrations (>= 600,000 ppm). To further improve the measurement stability and accuracy of this method for long-term monitoring of rivers and reservoirs, several practical problems were solved in this study, including noise interference, probe fouling, and the effect of ambient temperature on the TDR device used. With the proposed improvements in the analysis of the modified frequency domain phase velocity, the new method was examined in a laboratory setting, and a measurement standard deviation of 1,000 ppm was found. In addition, a novel carbon fiber rod with a novel detachable probe was proposed to decrease the nonlinear SSC variations resulting from the coating effect as part of the electromagnetic sensing field. As observed during the experiment, the use of a fully digital TDR device decreased the ambient temperature effect. Several TDR SSC measurements were performed at the Shihgang Reservoir, revealing long-term SSC and sediment load typhoon events from 2013 to 2021. Subsequently, real-time TDR SSC monitoring with sediment load quantification was performed to establish the relationship between sediment load and outflow discharge, and the results obtained indicated that this method helped characterize suspended sediment load.

AB Artemisia ordosica is considered as an excellent sand-fixing plant in revegetated desert areas, which plays a pertinent role in stabilizing the mobile dunes and sustaining the desert ecosystems. Stem sap flows of about 10-year-old Artemisia ordosica plants were monitored continuously with heat balance method for the entire growing season in order to understand the water requirement and the effects of environmental factors on its transpiration and growth. Environment factors such as solar radiation, air temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation were measured by the eddy covariance. Diurnal and seasonal variations of sap flow rate with different stem diameters and their correlation with meteorological factors and reference evapotranspiration were analysed. At the daily time scale, there was a significantly linear relationship between sap flow rate and reference evapotranspiration with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.6368. But at the hourly time scale, the relationship of measured sap flow rate and calculated reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was affected by the precipitation. A small precipitation would increase the sap flow and the ET0; however, when the precipitation is large, the sap flow and ET0 decrease. Leaf area index had a coincident variation with soil water content; both were determined by the precipitation, and meteorological factors were the most significant factors that affected the sap flow of Artemisia ordosica in the following order: solar radiation > vapour pressure deficit > relative humidity > air temperature > wind speed. The close correlation between daily sap flow rate and meteorological factors in the whole growing season would provide us an accurate estimation of the transpiration of Artemisia ordosica and rational water-carrying capacity of sand dunes in the revegetated desert areas.

AB Better understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the ecological integrity of river systems. In this study, we proposed a regime-switch modelling (RSM) framework, which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression, to detect and date change points in linear regression, and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances. The approach was applied to the long-term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river-floodplain relation in Dongting Lake in the last five decades, during which the Yangtze River system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations. Our results suggested that 1) there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly. The detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the Yangtze; 2) although the importance of inflows from the Yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes, the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5. The weakening of hydrological forcing from the Yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream; 3) the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows; and 4) since the operation of The Three Gorges Dam in 2006, the river-floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude. The results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in Dongting Lake. The identified change points, some of which have not been previously reported, will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood/drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity.

AB Taylor's hypothesis (TH) for rainfall fields states that the spatial correlation of rainfall intensity at two points at the same instant of time can be equated with the temporal correlation at two instants of time at some fixed location. The validity of TH is tested in a set of 12 storms developed in Rondonia, southwestern Amazonia, Brazil, during the January-February 1999 Wet Season Atmospheric Meso-scale Campaign. The time Eulerian and Lagrangian Autocorrelation Functions (ACF) are estimated, as well as the time-averaged space ACF, using radar rainfall rates of storms spanning between 3.2 and 23 h, measured at 7-10-min time resolution, over a circle of 100 km radius, at 2 km spatial resolution. TH does not hold in 9 out of the 12 studied storms, due to their erratic trajectories and very low values of zonal wind velocity at 700 hPa, independently from underlying atmospheric stability conditions. TH was shown to hold for 3 storms, up to a cutoff time scale of 10-15 min, which is closely related to observed features of the life cycle of convective cells in the region. Such cutoff time scale in Amazonian storms is much shorter than the 40 min identified in mid-latitude convective storms, due to much higher values of CAPE and smaller values of storm speed in Amazonian storms as compared to mid-latitude ones, which in turn contribute to a faster destruction of the rainfall field isotropy. Storms satisfying TH undergo smooth linear trajectories over space, and exhibit the highest negative values of maximum, mean and minimum zonal wind velocity at 700 hPa, within narrow ranges of atmospheric stability conditions. Non-dimensional parameters involving CAPE (maximum, mean and minimum) and CINE (mean) are identified during the storms life cycle, for which TH holds: CAPE mean/CINE mean = [30-35], CAPE max/CINE mean = [32-40], and CAPE min/CINE mean = [22-28]. These findings are independent upon the timing of storms within the diurnal cycle. Also, the estimated Eulerian time ACF's decay faster than the time-averaged space and the Lagrangian time ACF's, irrespectively of TH validity. The Eulerian ACF's exhibit shorter e-folding times, reflecting smaller correlations over short time scales, but also shorter scale of fluctuation, reflecting less persistence in time than over space. No significant associations (linear, exponential or power law) were found between estimated e-folding times and scale of fluctuation, with all estimates of CAPE and CINE. Secondary correlation maxima appear between 50 and 70 min in the Lagrangian time ACF's for storms satisfying TH. No differences were found in the behavior of each of the three ACF's for storms developed during either the Easterly or Westerly zonal wind regimes which characterize the development of meso-scale convective systems over the region. These results have important implications for modelling and downscaling rainfall fields over tropical land areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydraulic properties such as stage and residence time are important controls on riverine N removal. In most rivers, these hydraulic properties vary with stochastic precipitation forcing, but in tidal rivers, hydraulics variation occurs on a predictable cycle. In Manatee Springs, a highly productive, tidally influenced spring-fed river in Florida, we observed significant reach-scale N removal that varied in response to tidally driven variation in hydraulic properties as well as sunlight-driven variation in assimilatory uptake. After accounting for channel residence time and stage variation, we partitioned the total removal signal into assimilatory (i.e., plant uptake) and dissimilatory (principally denitrification) pathways. Assimilatory uptake was strongly correlated with primary production and ecosystem C:N was concordant with tissue stoichiometry of the dominant autotrophs. The magnitude of N removal was broadly consistent in magnitude with predictions from models (SPARROW and RivR-N). However, contrary to model predictions, the highest removal occurred at the lowest values of /d (residence time divided by depth), which occurred at low tide. Removal efficiency also exhibited significant counterclockwise hysteresis with incoming versus outgoing tides. This behavior is best explained by the sequential filling and draining of transient storage zones such that water that has spent the longest time in the storage zone, and thus had the most time for N removal, drains back into the channel at the end of an outgoing tide, concurrent with shortest channel residence times. Capturing this inversion of the expected relationship between channel residence time and N removal highlights the need for nonsteady state reactive transport models.

AB How to define a system? This is a problem faced routinely in science and engineering, with solutions developed from our understanding of the processes inherent, to assessing the underlying structure based on observational evidence alone. In general, system specification involves identifying a few meaningful predictors (from a large enough set that is plausibly related to the response) and formulating a relation between them and the system response being modeled. For systems where physical relationships are less apparent, and sufficient observational records exist, a range of statistical alternatives have been investigated as a possible way of specifying the underlying form. Here we introduce partial information (PI) as a new means for specifying the system, its key advantage being the relative lack of major assumptions about the processes being modeled in order to characterize the complete system. In addition to PI which offers a means of identifying the system predictors of interest, we also introduce the concept of partial weights (PWs) which uses the identified predictors to formulate a predictive model that acknowledges the relative contributions, predictor variables make to the prediction of the response. We assess the utility of the PI-PW framework using synthetically generated data sets from known linear, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamic yet chaotic systems and demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure in ascertaining the underlying true system with varying extents of observational evidence available. We highlight how this framework can be invaluable in formulating prediction models for natural systems which are modeled using empirical or semiempirical alternatives and discuss current limitations that still need to be overcome.

AB Leakage from geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) sites is inherently challenging to study because CO2, driven by buoyant forces, travels over long distances, undergoing phase changes and encountering numerous connate brine and formation chemistries as it rises to the surface. This work explores the effect that CO2 has on the rheological properties of brine solutions over a range of GCS-relevant temperature, pressure, ionic strength, and shear conditions. Under the fluid-liquid equilibrium conditions that prevail in the deep subsurface, viscosity of CO2-brine mixtures was found to be a function of temperature and pressure alone. Once leakage conditions ensue, discrete CO2 bubbles form in brine, resulting in the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE), and these mixtures exhibit complex linear viscoelastic, time dependent, and thixotropic behavior. The presence of CO2(g) bubbles on the flow of the bulk fluid could have important impacts on impeding (via shear drag force) leakage depending on the geometrical, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of a storage site. Under VLE conditions, the effective viscosity of CO2-brine mixtures was found to be up to five times higher than brine alone but the microstructure was easily destroyed, and not readily regained, under high shear conditions. At higher temperatures and higher ionic strength, the effect is less pronounced. These results were considered in the context of flow through porous media, and the effect on buoyancy-driven flow is significant. Understanding this effect is important for developing an accurate constitutive relationship for leaking CO2, which will lead to better capacity to select and monitor GCS sites.

AB Chlorine-36 along with oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and selected major ions were used to investigate the factors controlling groundwater quality in the eastern part of the United Arab Emirates. Two main aquifers occupy the study area: the Eastern Gravel Plain aquifer that occurs near the coastal area, and the inland Ophiolite aquifer. Previous studies suggest that groundwater, particularly in the Eastern Gravel Plain aquifer, is affected by seawater intrusion and evaporation. Samples of groundwater from the Eastern Gravel Plain aquifer (Cl > 1000 mg/l) have R Cl-36, values in the range of 13.3-17.4 x 10(-15) while those from the Ophiolite aquifer (Cl < 517 mg/l) have R Cl-36, values in the range of 20-118 x 10(-15). These values indicate the presence of bomb-produced Cl-36 and are consistent with recent (post 1950) recharge of most of the samples. deltaD-delta(18)O relationship plots on atypical evaporation line, which suggests potential evaporation of the recharging waters prior to infiltration. The (RCl)-Cl-36 values of the coastally bound Eastern Gravel Plain aquifer are lower than the Ophiolite aquifer which suggests an additional input of chloride to this aquifer. Moreover, in most cases the chloride concentration is not balanced by the concentrations of other cations such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium. Seawater intrusion is thus ruled out. Measurements of bromide concentrations support the contention that organically bound Cl is being released into this environment. Agricultural practices, which are extensive in this region, are a possible source. Also, sodium and silica concentrations provide evidence for the release of these elements by the weathering of host rocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a new approach to defining drought by establishing an empirical relationship between historical droughts (and wet spells) documented in impact reports, and a broad range of observed climate features using Random Forest (RF) models. The new drought indicator quantifies the conditional probability of drought, considering multiple drought-related climate features and their interactive effects, and can be used for forecasting with up to 3-month lead time. The approach was tested out-of-sample across several random selections of training and testing datasets, and demonstrated better predictive capabilities than commonly used drought indicators (e.g., Standardised Precipitation Index and Evaporative Demand Drought Index) in a range of performance metrics. Furthermore, it showed comparable performance to the (expert elicitation-based) US Drought Monitor (USDM), the current state-of-the-art record of historical drought in the USA. As well as providing an alternative historical drought indicator to USDM, the RF approach offers additional advantages by being automated, by providing drought information at the grid-scale, and by having forecasting capacity. While traditional drought metrics define drought as extreme anomalies in drought-related variables, the approach presented here reveals the full suite of circumstances that lead to impactful droughts. We highlight several combinations of climate features-such as precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture and change in water storage-that led to drought events not detected by commonly used drought metrics. The new RF drought indicator combines meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic drought, providing drought information for all impacted sectors. As a proof-of-concept, the RF drought indicator was trained on Texan climate data and droughts.

AB Foams have been used for decades as displacing fluids for enhanced oil recovery and aquifer remediation, and more recently, for remediation of the vadose zone, in which case foams carry chemical amendments. Foams are better injection fluids than aqueous solutions due to their low sensitivity to gravity and because they are less sensitive to permeability heterogeneities, thus allowing a more uniform sweep. The latter aspect results from their peculiar rheology, whose understanding motivates the present study. We investigate foam flow through a two-dimensional porous medium consisting of circular obstacles positioned randomly in a horizontal transparent Hele-Shaw cell. The local foam structure is recorded in situ, which provides a measure of the spatial distribution of bubble velocities and sizes at regular time intervals. The flow exhibits a rich phenomenology including preferential flow paths and local flow nonstationarity (intermittency) despite the imposed permanent global flow rate. Moreover, the medium selects the bubble size distribution through lamella division-triggered bubble fragmentation. Varying the mean bubble size of the injected foam, its water content, and mean velocity, we characterize those processes systematically. In particular, we measure the spatial evolution of the distribution of bubble areas, and infer the efficiency of bubble fragmentation depending on the various control parameters. We furthermore show that the distributions of bubble sizes and velocities are correlated. This study sheds new light on the local rheology of foams in porous media and opens the way toward quantitative characterization of the relationship between medium geometry and foam flow properties. It also suggests that large-scale models of foam flows in the subsurface should account for the correlation between bubble sizes and velocities.

AB Identifying the relationship between large-scale climate signals and seasonal streamflow may provide a valuable tool for long-range seasonal forecasting in regions under water stress, such as the Iberian Peninsula (IP). The skill of the main teleconnection indices as predictors of seasonal streamflow in the IP was evaluated. The streamflow database used was composed of 382 stations, covering the period 1975-2008. Predictions were made using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach based on multiple linear regression, combining Variance Inflation Factor and Stepwise Backward selection to avoid multicollinearity and select the best subset of predictors. Predictions were made for four forecasting scenarios, from one to four seasons in advance. The correlation coefficient (RHO), Root Mean Square Error Skill Score (RMSESS), and the Gerrity Skill Score (GSS) were used to evaluate the forecasting skill. For autumn streamflow, good forecasting skill (RHO> 0.5, RMSESS> 20%, GSS> 0.4) was found for a third of the stations located in the Mediterranean Andalusian Basin, the North Atlantic Oscillation of the previous winter being the main predictor. Also, fair forecasting skill (RHO> 0.44, RMSESS> 10%, GSS> 0.2) was found in stations in the northwestern IP (16 of these located in the Douro and Tagus Basins) with two seasons in advance. For winter streamflow, fair forecasting skill was found for one season in advance in 168 stations, with the Snow Advance Index as the main predictor. Finally, forecasting was poorer for spring streamflow than for autumn and winter, since only 16 stations showed fair forecasting skill in with one season in advance, particularly in north-western of IP.

AB The quantitative evaluation of the effects of bedrock groundwater discharge on spatial variability of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIP) concentrations has still been insufficient. We examined the relationships between stream DOC, DIN and DIP concentrations and bedrock groundwater contribution to stream water in forest headwater catchments in warm-humid climate zones. We sampled stream water and bedrock springs at multiple points in September and December 2013 in a 5 km(2) forest headwater catchment in Japan and sampled groundwater in soil layer in small hillslopes. We assumed that stream water consisted of four end members, groundwater in soil layer and three types of bedrock groundwater, and calculated the contributions of each end member to stream water from mineral-derived solute concentrations. DOC, DIN and DIP concentrations in stream water were compared with the calculated bedrock groundwater contribution. The bedrock groundwater contribution had significant negative linear correlation with stream DOC concentration, no significant correlation with stream DIN concentration, and significant positive linear correlation with stream DIP concentration. These results highlighted the importance of bedrock groundwater discharge in establishing stream DOC and DIP concentrations. In addition, stream DOC and DIP concentrations were higher and lower, respectively, than those expected from end member mixing of groundwater in soil layer and bedrock springs. Spatial heterogeneity of DOC and DIP concentrations in groundwater and/or in-stream DOC production and DIP uptake were the probable reasons for these discrepancies. Our results indicate that the relationships between spatial variability of stream DOC, DIN and DIP concentrations and bedrock groundwater contribution are useful for comparing the processes that affect stream DOC, DIN and DIP concentrations among catchments beyond the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological and biogeochemical processes within a catchment.

AB Daily streamflow dynamics can be accurately simulated by conceptual models as simple as a single bucket in some catchments, while they require more complex configurations in other catchments. However, without resorting to calibration, anticipating where and why a given model structure may be appropriate remains difficult. In this work, we explored the feasibility of relating suitable model structures to the climate and streamflow characteristics of 508 catchments in Brazil. Specifically, we tested four model structures using up to three reservoirs, where each reservoir is intended to represent a catchment function: the rainfall-runoff threshold, the fast, and the slow hydrograph response. We hypothesized a relationship between suitable model structures and hydrological signatures of aridity (I-A) and baseflow index (I-B). Our results show that different classes of signatures resulted in distinct patterns of model performance. Wet catchments (I-A < 0.9) with low baseflow (I-B < 0.4) were the easiest to model, with a single-reservoir model presenting a relatively good performance. In the case of low baseflow, adding a rainfall-runoff threshold reservoir resulted in better performance than adding a slow response reservoir, whereas in the case of high baseflow (I-B < 0.6) the opposite occurred. In the case of low baseflow, the inclusion of a slow response reservoir helped the simulation of dry catchments (I-A < 1.1), but not of wet ones, which we attributed to the impact of permeability in dry catchments. These results indicate a path toward model structure identification from streamflow signatures and potentially from landscape features.

AB The choice of hydrological model structure, that is, a model's selection of states and fluxes and the equations used to describe them, strongly controls model performance and realism. This work investigates differences in performance of 36 lumped conceptual model structures calibrated to and evaluated on daily streamflow data in 559 catchments across the United States. Model performance is compared against a benchmark that accounts for the seasonality of flows in each catchment. We find that our model ensemble struggles to beat the benchmark in snow-dominated catchments. In most other catchments model structure equifinality (i.e., cases where different models achieve similar high efficiency scores) can be very high. We find no relation between the number of model parameters and performance during either calibration or evaluation periods nor evidence of increased risk of overfitting for models with more parameters. Instead, the choice of model parametrization (i.e., which equations are used and how parameters are used within them) dictates the model's strengths and weaknesses. Results suggest that certain model structures are inherently better suited for certain objective functions and thus for certain study purposes. We find no clear relationships between the catchments where any model performs well and descriptors of those catchments' geology, topography, soil, and vegetation characteristics. Instead, model suitability seems to relate strongest to the streamflow regime each catchment generates, and we have formulated several tentative hypotheses that relate commonalities in model structure to similarities in model performance. Modeling results are made publicly available for further investigation.

AB We investigated the high variability of suspended sediment transport in 16 watersheds of Walnut Gulch, southeastern Arizona, USA that were distinguished at three spatial scales: the plot (ca. 0.001-0.01 km(2)), unit-source (ca. 0.01-0.1 km(2)), and large (ca. 1-150 km(2)) scales. Event-based data of water discharge and suspended sediment concentration were compiled in variable periods between the 1960s and 2010s. By subjectively distinguishing five different intraevent transport patterns that may be ascribed to a combination of various hydrological and sediment-transport processes, we showed that no single sediment rating curve could be developed for these data. However, at the event temporal scale, event specific sediment yield (SSYe, t/km(2)) was significantly correlated to event runoff depth (h, mm) for all transport patterns of the watersheds, suggesting that the complexity of suspended sediment transport at the intraevent scale is effectively reduced at the event scale regardless of watershed sizes. Further regression analysis indicated that the SSYe-h relationship can be generally characterized by a proportional model, SSYe=nh where n, is conceptually equivalent to the volume-weighted event mean sediment concentration and is mainly determined by large events. For watersheds dominated by shrub cover, the change of the n value with watershed area was limited and thus may be reasonably regarded as a constant, implying that despite the highly variable suspended sediment concentrations during individual storm events in variable-sized watersheds, the synoptic effect of suspended sediment transport was similar and may be determined by a single value.

AB Effective sampling of hydrogeological systems is essential in guiding groundwater management practices. Optimal sampling of groundwater systems has previously been formulated based on the assumption that heterogeneous subsurface properties can be modeled using a geostatistical approach. K and the hydraulic head H, and the uncertainty in the geostatistical model of system parameters using a single objective function that aggregates all objectives. However, it has been shown that the aggregation of possibly conflicting objective functions is sensitive to the adopted aggregation scheme and may lead to distorted results. In addition, the uncertainties in geostatistical parameters affect the uncertainty in the spatial prediction of K and H according to a complex nonlinear relationship, which has often been ineffectively evaluated using a first-order approximation. In this study, we propose a multiobjective optimization framework to assist the design of monitoring networks of K and H with the goal of optimizing their spatial predictions and estimating the geostatistical parameters of the K field. K, H, and the geostatistical parameters of K obtained by collecting new measurements. Multiple MOEA experiments are used to investigate the trade-off among design objectives and identify the corresponding monitoring schemes. K and by 90% of the prior uncertainty in H) by sampling evenly distributed measurements with a spatial measurement density of more than 1 observation per 60 m x 60 m grid block. In addition, exploration of the interaction of objective functions indicates that the ability of head measurements to reduce the uncertainty associated with the correlation scale is comparable to the effect of hydraulic conductivity measurements.

AB This paper examines the non-perturbed deposition and re-entrainment dynamics of biological and non-biological colloids in porous media in the presence of an energy barrier to deposition at the grain surface. Deposition and re-entrainment rate coefficients were determined from numerical simulation of breakthrough-elution behavior and the profiles of retained colloids. We present composite trends from original and previously published data for biological and non-biological colloids which demonstrate that hydrodynamic drag mitigates deposition and drives re-entrainment of both biological and non-biological colloids in the presence of an energy barrier under nonperturbed conditions. Original data is presented for two sizes of colloids (1.1 and 5.7 mu m microspheres) under a variety of ionic strength and fluid velocity conditions to examine the torque balance governing re-entrainment of colloids attached to the grain surfaces. The analysis indicates that in the presence of an energy barrier to deposition, hydrodynamic drag may influence deposition and re-entrainment of colloids associated directly with the grain surface via primary energy minima. However, the hydrodynamic field would also be expected to influence deposition and re-entrainment of colloids associated with the surface via secondary energy minima. Hence, the observed influences of fluid velocity are consistent with colloid association via either mechanism. These results call for the development of colloid transport theories that explicitly account for the influence of the hydrodynamic field at the grain surface. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Excessive nitrate threatens a wide range of water resources, aquatic habitats, and sensitive infrastructure. Despite this problem, tracing a nutrient from its eventual fate back to its origin remains an elusive challenge due to heterogeneity in how nutrient sources and hydrologic pathways are connected. Typically, this problem is underdetermined (i.e., too many unknowns, not enough equations) and cannot be solved with existing methodologies. The theory of optimal transport allows for the solution of underdetermined systems, and here we construct a novel formulation for its use in water quality modeling. Our objective was to develop an optimal transport modeling framework-coupled to Bayesian source unmixing, loadograph pathway separation, and geospatial connectivity analysis-to apportion nitrate loading from three sources (soil, fertilizer, and manure) across three pathways (quick, intermediate, and slow), resulting in nine possible source-pathway couplings (soil-quick, soil-intermediate, horizontal ellipsis , manure-slow). We apply this model to a 30 month elemental (NO3-) and isotopic (delta N-15 and delta O-18) nitrate data set from a karst watershed in Kentucky, USA. Modeling results indicate that-of the nine possible source-pathway couplings-nearly 60% of nitrate export is facilitated by just three: fertilizer-quick (16.4%), manure-intermediate (15.4%), and soil-slow (27.2%). Further, we reinforce the need to explicitly consider heterogeneity in source-pathway connectivity as homogeneous assumptions lead to erroneous inferences. The applicability of the model, its input requirements, and transferability to other sites is discussed. Lastly, we simulated two land management scenarios (field buffers and septic repair) and demonstrate how optimal transport can be used to test nutrient reduction strategies.

AB Supplemental irrigation represents one of the main strategies to mitigate the effects of climatic variability on agroecosystems, stabilizing yields and profits. Because of the significant investments and water requirements associated with irrigation, strategic choices are needed to preserve productivity and profitability while ensuring a sustainable water management, a nontrivial task given rainfall unpredictability. Decision-making under uncertainty requires the knowledge of the probability density function (pdf) of the outcome variable (yield and economic return) for the different management alternatives to be considered (here, irrigation strategies). A stochastic framework is proposed, linking probabilistically the occurrence of rainfall events and irrigation applications to crop development during the growing season. Based on these linkages, the pdf of yields and the corresponding irrigation requirements are obtained analytically as a function of climate, soil, and crop parameters, for different irrigation strategies and both unlimited and limited water availability. Approximate expressions are also presented to facilitate their application. Our results employ relatively few parameters and are thus broadly applicable to different crops and sites, under current-and future-climate scenarios, offering a quantitative tool to quantify the impact of irrigation strategies and water allocation on yields. As a tool for decision-making under uncertainty (e. g., via expected utility theory), our framework will be useful for the assessment of the feasibility of different irrigation strategies and water allocations, toward a sustainable management of water resources for human and environmental needs.

To evaluate the peak flow of the observed events the following information is available: (a) a long record of daily stage measurements up to the XVIII century; (b) several records of daily rainfall depth measurement at two rain gauges in the Tiber catchment, extending at least up to the middle of the XIX century; (c) detailed surveys executed immediately after the great flood of 1870, including the elevation plan of the town, a survey of the riverbed and the flood hydrograph of the 1870 flood; (d) a less detailed survey of the riverbed executed in 1744; (e) a rich iconography, showing the conditions of the Tiber banks from the XVI century onward; (f) contemporary descriptions of several extreme floodings; and (g) a rich series of flow measurements and bed surveys after the great flood of 1870 to present days. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the flooding of the old town in order to determine the flow-discharge relationship, thus allowing reconstruction of a record of the past extreme floods. A statistical analysis was developed for evaluating the risk hazard, using the censored sample of all the extreme floods from the XV century and the sample of all the maximum annual floods from the end of the XVIII century.

AB Constructed treatment wetlands intercept nutrients in surface runoff to protect downstream ecosystems. Conventionally, nutrient removal is considered from a chemical kinetics perspective that assumes outlet concentrations tend toward equilibrium. We propose a broader view that includes management intervention as part of the system, and we explore the possibility that complex concentration dynamics emerge endogenously from nonlinear interactions. In particular, through application of a novel nonlinear time series diagnostic framework, we empirically test whether phosphorus removal at two Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) in South Florida might be enhanced through improved management of hydraulic and phosphorus loads. We isolated low-dimensional, deterministic signals in STA input/output dynamics (flows and total phosphorus concentrations); mapped causal interactions among covariates; and developed parsimonious data-driven dynamic models to simulate and characterize key interactions. At STA-3/4, inflow dynamics systematically drove outlet concentrations, suggesting that outlet concentration variability might be reduced through enhanced hydraulic load management. We also detected management feedback in the reverse direction-STA-3/4 outlet concentrations driving inflows-and identified a possible inefficiency in this management response. At STA-2, neither flows nor inlet concentrations systematically drove outlet concentrations, suggesting that the wetland effectively removed incoming load signals. However, STA-2 inflows were evidently influenced by inlet concentrations (management feedback). The differing management feedback structures between STAs suggest that STA-3/4 performance might be improved by managing hydraulic loads more strongly in response to inlet concentrations. More broadly, this work demonstrates that management-relevant insights into dynamic cause-and-effect relationships can be gleaned from observed treatment dynamics.

AB Streams provide a physical linkage between land and downstream river networks, delivering solutes derived from multiple catchment sources. We analyzed high-frequency time series of stream solutes to characterize the timing and magnitude of major ion, nutrient, and organic matter transport over event, seasonal, and annual timescales as well as to assess whether nitrate (NO2-) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport are coupled in catchments, which would be expected if they are subject to similar biogeochemical controls throughout the watershed. Our data set includes in situ observations of NO2-, fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOC proxy), and specific conductance spanning 2-4 years in 10 streams and rivers across New Hampshire, including observations of nearly 700 individual hydrologic events. We found a positive response of NO2- and DOC to flow in forested streams, but watershed development led to a negative relationship between NO2- and discharge, and thus a decoupling of the overall NO2- and DOC responses to flow. On event and seasonal timescales, NO2- and DOC consistently displayed different behaviors. For example, in several streams, FDOM yield was greatest during summer storms while NO2- yield was greatest during winter storms. Most streams had generalizable storm NO2- and DOC responses, but differences in the timing of NO2- and DOC transport suggest different catchment sources. Further, certain events, including rain-on-snow and summer storms following dry antecedent conditions, yielded disproportionate NO2- responses. High-frequency data allow for increased understanding of the processes controlling solute variability and will help reveal their responses to changing climatic regimes.

AB The drainage systems of polythermal glaciers play an important role in high-latitude hydrology, and are determinants of ice flow rate. Flow-recession analysis and linear-reservoir simulation of runoff time series are here used to evaluate seasonal and inter-annual variability in the drainage system of the polythermal Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard, in 1999 and 2000. Linear-flow recessions are pervasive, with mean coefficients of a fast reservoir varying from 16 (1999) to 41 h (2000), and mean coefficients of an intermittent, slow reservoir varying from 54 (1999) to 114 h (2000). Drainage-system efficiency is greater overall in the first of the two seasons, the simplest explanation of which is more rapid depletion of the snow cover. Reservoir coefficients generally decline during each season (at 0.22 h d(-1) in 1999 and 0.52 h d(-1) in 2000), denoting an increase in drainage efficiency. However, coefficients do not exhibit a consistent relationship with discharge. Finsterwalderbreen therefore appears to behave as an intermediate case between temperate glaciers and other polythermal glaciers with smaller proportions of temperate ice. Linear-reservoir runoff simulations exhibit limited sensitivity to a relatively wide range of reservoir coefficients, although the use of fixed coefficients in a spatially lumped model can generate significant subseasonal error. At Finsterwalderbreen, an ice-marginal channel with the characteristics of a fast reservoir, and a subglacial upwelling with the characteristics of a slow reservoir, both route meltwater to the terminus. This suggests that drainage-system components of significantly contrasting efficiencies can coexist spatially and temporally at polythermal glaciers.

TI Asymmetry of Western US River Basin Sensitivity to Seasonally Varying
   Climate Warming

ID SNOW; IMPACTS; WATER
AB Future climate warming over the Western U.S. (WUS) is projected to be greater in summer than winter. Previous model-based studies of large river basins in the WUS showed much different annual streamflow responses to warming in warm versus cool seasons. However, it remains unclear how the relative responses annual streamflow relative responses to seasonal warming (asymmetry) and drivers of the response asymmetry vary across the entire WUS at the catchment-scale, and how the simulated results compare with observations. Here, we investigate the asymmetry of annual streamflow responses to warm versus cool season warming at the HUC-8 level across the entire WUS using model simulations and observations. We also examine the asymmetries' relationship with land surface and hydroclimate characteristics, and the primary contributor to the response asymmetry for each HUC-8 basin. The HUC-8 level results reveal more complexity than do earlier analyses of much larger river basins. Over 25% of WUS area has annual streamflow increases in response to warming in at least one season (mostly cool season). Annual streamflow is most sensitive to warm season warming in cool, inland basins, especially the northern Columbia River basin and most of the Upper Colorado River Basin, and most sensitive to cool season warming in warm, coastal basins. This bi-directional pattern is enhanced by vegetation coverage but weakened by long-term snowpack decline. In coldest basins with short snow-free seasons, net radiation changes dominate the streamflow response asymmetry. For basins with cold-to-intermediate temperatures, vapor pressure deficit changes dominate. For warmest basins, surface resistance changes dominate.

AB Recent studies have highlighted an increase of chloride in many lakes worldwide, with negative effects on chemical and physical properties of inland waters and freshwater biota. In this study, we assessed the long-term trend (1993-2017) of chloride in Lake Iseo, located in the midlatitudes, and analyzed its relationship with discharge data of the inflows and hydrological and hydroclimatic changes. Additionally, we performed a specific annual survey, collecting water samples at a biweekly frequency in tributaries, calculating chloride load, and comparing the result with the chloride increase observed in lacustrine water. The combined use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and multivariate analyses allowed identification of possible sources of chloride and their seasonal dynamic within the mixed-land-use watershed: impervious surface and deicing salt, population and sewage effluents, livestock, and rainwater. Their potential contribution to total mass balance was assessed, cross-checking the results between chloride source evaluation and load estimation. Chloride load from wastewater treatment plants played an important role, albeit we highlighted that the main source was the road deicing salt, with a primarily winter contribution. The increased anthropization in the watershed was likely the main cause of the chloride enhancement. This study demonstrates that the problem of salinization can also affect lakes located in the midlatitude areas and provides a reproducible method for the identification and quantification of the different sources. Our results will help to better understand the potential sources of salinity in rivers that may reveal processes controlling the salinization of freshwater systems, with implications for future management practices.

AB Accurate quantification of riverine water-quality concentration and flux is challenging because monitoring programs typically collect concentration data at lower frequencies than discharge data. Statistical methods are often used to estimate concentration and flux on days without observations. One recently developed approach is the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS), which has been shown to provide among the most accurate estimates compared to other common methods. The main objective of this work was to improve WRTDS estimation by accounting for the autocorrelation structure of model residuals using the first-order autoregressive model (AR1). This modified approach, called WRTDS-Kalman Filter (WRTDS-K), was compared with WRTDS for six constituents including nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, suspended sediment, and chloride. Near-daily concentration records at nine sites were used to generate subsets through Monte Carlo sampling for five different sampling scenarios. Results show that WRTDS-K provided generally better daily estimates of concentration and flux than WRTDS under these sampling scenarios for all constituents, especially NOx. The degree of improvement is strongly affected by the underlying sampling scenario, with WRTDS-K gaining more advantage when more samples are available, and hence more residuals can be exploited. The performance of WRTDS-K depends on the AR1 coefficient (rho) and that relationship varies with constituents and sampling scenarios. These results provided recommendations on the optimal rho for each constituent and sampling scenario. Overall, WRTDS-K has the potential for broad applications to monitoring records elsewhere, as demonstrated by a pilot application to Chesapeake Bay tributaries.

AB We investigated the influence of hillslope scale topographic characteristics and the relative position of hillslopes along streams (i.e., internal catchment structure) on the isotopic composition of base flow in first-order, forested headwater streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. The study focused on two adjacent forested catchments with different topographic characteristics. We used stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) of water together with stream gauging and geospatial analysis to evaluate relationships between internal catchment structure and the spatiotemporal variability of base flow O-18. Base flow O-18 was variable in space and time along streams, and the temporal variability of base flow O-18 declined with increasing drainage area. Base flow became enriched in O-18 moving along streams from channel heads to catchment outlets but the frequency of enrichment varied between catchments. The spatiotemporal variability in base flow O-18 was high adjacent to large hillslopes with short flow paths, and it was positively correlated with the relative arrangement of hillslopes within the catchment. These results point to influence of unique arrangement of hillslopes on the patterns of downstream enrichment. Spatial variability in base flow O-18 within the streams was relatively low during dry and wet conditions, but it was higher during the transition period between dry and wet conditions. These results suggest that the strength of topographic control on the isotopic composition of base flow can vary with catchment wetness. This study highlights that topographic control on base flow generation and isotopic composition is important even at fine spatial scales.

TI Determining long-term effective groundwater recharge by analyzing
   vertical soil temperature profiles at meteorological stations
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW
AB Vertical water seepage in soils results in convective heat transport that modifies the temperature profiles and their variations with time; consequently, there is a relationship between temperature profile variations with time and the vertical Darcy velocity associated with the seepage. Considering the annual sinusoidal time variation of the temperature at the soil surface, it can be shown that convective heat transport has a significant effect on the amplitude damping with depth and a negligible effect on the phase lag with depth of the temperature time signal. Standard meteorological stations constitute a relatively dense network, and we show that their routinely collected data can be used to determine an average value of the vertical Darcy velocity, u(z), representing the effective annual recharge over long time periods (several years). A new procedure for determining uz from these temperature records is presented. First, the layering of the medium is determined by an electrical sounding. Then the thermal properties of each layer are inferred from the phase lag with depth. Finally, uz is calculated from the amplitude damping. After having tested this approach with synthetic data, we used the 1984-2001 Abbeville (Somme, France) data to determine the average recharge over six 3-year periods. The results are in good agreement with classical meteorological recharge estimates and show a significant increase in the recharge during the last 3-year period, consistent with the observed phreatic 2001 flood event. Specific temperature measurements at appropriate depths and time steps could drastically improve the sensitivity of the method.

AB Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is a well-known statistical post-processing approach for probabilistically merging individual forecasts. In BMA, the posterior distribution of the predictand variable is determined by implementing the law of total probability. Therefore, possessing an ensemble of independent members (mutually exclusive) with the highest information content about observation variability (collectively exhaustive) is the main inherent assumption of the original BMA method. Mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive are two contradictory criteria. Although constructing an ensemble of members that fully satisfied these two properties is practically impossible, providing a balance between them is a key requirement for enhancing the BMA performance. Through coupling BMA with Shannon entropy of information theory, this study proposes an entropy-based selection procedure to construct an ensemble of streamflow forecasts by better addressing the aforementioned contradictory criteria prior to performing the BMA. We investigate the effects of using ensembles with the aforementioned properties by comparing the results of original BMA with the proposed entropy-based BMA (En-BMA) for short- to medium-range daily streamflow forecasts in two different watersheds. The results indicate that the En-BMA leads to better results particularly for high flow predictions. Both probabilistic and deterministic high flow forecasts are more accurate and reliable when using the En-BMA approach. However, for the average flow forecasts, there are no clear differences in the general performance of both methods. The improvements observed are more pronounced for shorter lead-times and less pronounced, but still present, for longer lead times.

AB Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) enable noninvasive determination of field-scale soil moisture content by exploiting the dependence of the intensity of aboveground epithermal neutrons on the hydrogen contained in soil moisture. However, there are other hydrogen pools besides soil moisture (e.g., biomass). Therefore, these hydrogen pools should be considered for accurate soil moisture content measurements, especially when they are changing dynamically (e.g., arable crops, deforestation, and reforestation). In this study, we test four approaches for the correction of biomass effects on soil moisture content measurements with CRNS using experiments with three crops (sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize) based on high-quality reference soil moisture: (a) site-specific functions based on in-situ measured biomass, (b) a generic approach, (c) the thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio (N-r), and (d) the thermal neutron intensity. Bare soil calibration of the CRNS resulted in high root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.097, 0.041, and 0.019 m(3)/m(3) between estimated and reference soil moisture content for sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize, respectively. Considering in-situ measured biomass for correction reduced the RMSE to 0.015, 0.018, and 0.009 m(3)/m(3). The consideration of thermal neutron intensity for correction was similarly accurate. We also explored the use of CRNS for biomass estimation and found that N-r only provided accurate biomass estimates for sugar beet. In contrast, we found significant site-specific relationships between biomass and thermal neutron intensity for all three crops, suggesting that thermal neutron intensity can be used both to improve CRNS-based soil moisture content measurements and to quantify crop biomass.

AB Large-scale models often use a single grid to represent an entire catchment assuming homogeneity; the impacts of such an assumption on simulating evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow remain poorly understood. Here, we compare hydrological dynamics at Shale Hills (PA, USA) using a complex model (spatially explicit, >500 grids) and a simple model (spatially implicit, two grids using "effective" parameters). We asked two questions: What hydrological dynamics can a simple model reproduce at the catchment scale? What processes does it miss by ignoring spatial details? Results show the simple model can reproduce annual runoff ratios and ET, daily discharge peaks (e.g., storms, floods) but not discharge minima (e.g., droughts) under dry conditions. Neither can it reproduce different streamflow from the two sides of the catchment with distinct land surface characteristics. The similar annual runoff ratios between the two models indicate spatial details are not as important as climate in reproducing annual scale ET and discharge partitioning. Most of the calibrated parameters in the simple model are within the ranges in the complex model, except that effective porosity has to be reduced to 40% of the average porosity from the complex model. The form of the storage-discharge relationship is similar. The effective porosity in the simple model however represents the dynamic and mobile water storage in the effective drainage area of the complex model that connects to the stream and contributes to high streamflow; it does not represent the passive, immobile water storage in the often disconnected uphill areas. This indicates that an additional uphill functioning unit is needed in the simple model to simulate the full spectrum of high-low streamflow dynamics in natural catchments.

AB Understanding how spatial variability in stream discharge and water chemistry decrease with increasing catchment area is required to improve our ability to predict hydrological and biogeochemical processes in ungauged basins. We investigated differences in this decrease of variability with increasing catchment area among catchments and among specific discharge (Q(s)) and water chemistry parameters. We defined the slope of the decrease in the variability with increasing catchment area as the rate of decrease in the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (delta(SD) and delta(CV), respectively), both of which are -0.5 for the simple mixing of random variables (random mixing). All delta(SD) and delta(CV) values of Q(s) were less than -0.5, while those of most water chemistry values were greater than -0.5, indicating that with increased catchment area the spatial variability of Q(s) decreased more steeply than for random mixing, while for water chemistry they decreased less steeply. delta(SD) and delta(CV) had linear relationships with both the spatial dissimilarity index and relative changes in parameters' mean values with increasing catchment area. It suggested that differences in delta(SD) or delta(CV) for Q(s) and water chemistry can be explained by the different spatial structures, where dissimilar values of Q(s) and similar values of water chemistry, respectively, are located close together in space. Differences in delta(SD) and delta(CV) according to Q(s) and water chemistry should significantly affect the determination of representative elementary area and therefore need to be considered when predicting representative elementary area from spatial variability of low-order streams.

AB Linearity of basin runoff and peak response as a function of watershed scale was examined for a set of 29 nested semiarid watersheds within the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, located in southeastern Arizona. Watershed drainage areas range from 1.83 x 10(3) to 1.48 x 10(8) m(2) (0.183-14800 ha), and all stream channels are ephemeral. Observations of mean annual runoff, database-derived 2- and 100-year peak runoff rates, ephemeral channel area, and areal rainfall characteristics derived from 304 events were examined to assess the nature of runoff response behavior over this range of watershed scales. Two types of distributed rainfall-runoff models of differing complexity were applied to a subset of the watersheds to further investigate the scale-dependent nature of the collected data. Contrary to the conclusions of numerous studies in more humid regions, it was found that watershed runoff response becomes more nonlinear with increasing watershed scale, with a critical transition threshold area occurring roughly around the range of 3.7 x 10(5) to 6.0 x 10(5) m(2) (37-60 ha). The primary causes of increasingly nonlinear response are the increasing importance of ephemeral channel losses and partial storm area coverage. The modeling results indicate that significant error will result in model estimates of peak runoff rates when rainfall inputs from depth area-frequency relationships are applied beyond the area of typical storm coverage. For runoff modeling in Walnut Gulch and similar semiarid environments, explicit treatment of channel routing and transmission losses from channel infiltration will be required for watersheds larger than the critical drainage area.

AB Laboratory and field studies investigating the mutual interaction between riparian vegetation dynamics and river morphodynamics have revealed that riparian vegetation may play an important role in the evolution of channel beds and river banks. In order to disentangle this still debated question, field and modeling techniques have helped to explore and better understand the time and spatial scales of such processes. Simple morphodynamic models for river evolution have typically used a constant discharge to describe in-channel processes and basic relationships for river bank dynamics. In order to overcome these limits we propose a longitudinally integrated dynamical model that describes the bank pull - bar push mechanisms in channels with symmetric cross section. Different hydrographs (constant, periodic and stochastic discharge) are applied to investigate channel width and vegetation biomass evolution trajectories and equilibrium values. Results show the interplay of riparian vegetation and water flow in controlling channel width evolution and the trajectories of channel adjustment to flow perturbations. These results also highlight the limit of adopting a constant discharge when describing mutual flow and vegetation processes affecting channel evolution. In addition, under stochastic forcing, the model shows the existence of a range of flood frequencies for which the cooperation between the hydrologic time scales and that characterizing vegetation colonization induces a regular pattern in channel width time variations (coherence resonance). Finally, model application to real case studies confirm the possibility to use the model to interpret long-term river evolutionary trajectories in realistic applications.

AB Connectivity between different landscape units and flow paths to the stream has gained much attention in hydrological science. Recent work has focused on the threshold sequencing of spatial sources in upland forested watersheds, connectivity and its spatial patterns in the hillslope-riparian-stream continuum. Fast flow path connectivity in the HRS continuum is still difficult to decipher because of the scale-limitations of hydrometric and tracer methods. Such connectivity may be strongly non-linear and controls streamflow response and chemistry. Recently, diatoms, one of the most common and diverse algal groups, were used to detect the onset and cessation of surface runoff to small headwater streams and constrain hydrograph separation methods. In this work, we investigate the potential for diatoms to determine fast flow path connectivity between their habitat and the stream over various scaled catchments. We used seven nested sub-catchments (0.45 to 247 km(2)) with uniform and mixed geologies and land use types within the Attert River catchment (Luxembourg) for testing our hypothesis. We categorized the prevailing diatom communities based on their habitat in the hillslope-riparian-stream continuum of one headwater catchment and sampled a storm event for diatom communities in every catchment. We present the diatom dynamics during the event hydrograph. We also outline different occurring species of diatoms and present that combinations of species or individual species can be used as a tracer for source area connectivity. Further, we show that the occurrence of aerial diatom species decreases by a power law with scale, potentially limiting the scale of application. Finally, we discuss how diatoms could indicate temporal variability of contributions from different physiographic units. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Over small-scale topography in windy areas, precipitation tends to be redistributed by wind through the modification of precipitation inclination. The latter is often derived from wind speed and conventional rain gauge records by application of relations-derived mainly for convective rainfall conditions-between (1) precipitation intensity and drop diameter, and (2) drop diameter and terminal fall velocity. However, it remains to be seen whether such relationships give valid results for the typically low precipitation intensities prevailing in tropical montane cloud forests. On the basis of the assumption that the total amount of near-surface atmospheric liquid water, defined hereafter as the 'potential precipitation', is most likely to be identical over small distances, this paper introduces a device to measure amounts of potential precipitation. The gauge captures both the vertical and horizontal component of precipitation, and this allows derivation of precipitation inclination using simple trigonometry. Results on precipitation inclinations obtained with the 'potential precipitation gauge' on a wet and windy site in northern Costa Rica suggest the droplets to be smaller than those predicted by the commonly used relationships referred to above. The current gauge is also shown to be more effective in catching inclined precipitation than two different types of spherical gauges. In addition, 'effective' fall velocities were determined for each precipitation event using derivated precipitation inclination and wind speed. The assumption of spatially similar potential precipitation amounts and effective fall velocities throughout a small catchment allows the catchment-wide determination of precipitation inclination and therefore of hydrologically effective precipitation from a single-point measurement of potential precipitation and wind speed in combination with modelled spatial wind speed pattern. This approach is believed to yield appreciably better estimates of spatial precipitation inputs compared to reliance on conventional rain gauges and derivation of terminal fall velocities from precipitation intensity records.

AB This paper studies how streamflow predictability varies with basin characteristics. We introduce an index of basin complexity that is based on a model of least statistical complexity that is needed to reliably predict daily streamflow of the basin. We then relate it with climate, vegetation and soil characteristics of the basin. Daily streamflow is modeled using k nearest neighbor model of lagged streamflow that predicts next time step streamflow based on the occurrences of similar streamflow events from the past. In order to calculate basin complexity, we identify difficult streamflow events of the basin and then use Vapnik-Chervonenkis generalization theory, which trades off model performance with Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (i.e., a measure of model complexity), to find a k nearest neighbor model of appropriate complexity for predicting a difficult streamflow event of the basin. The average of selected model complexities corresponding to difficult events is then defined as the basin's complexity. Basin complexity of 412 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment basins from continental United States are then related with its six basin characteristics. All the characteristics have been derived from the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment database to represent climate, vegetation and soil characteristics of the basins in a concise manner. Results find that more complex basins that are drier have less seasonal rainfall, vegetation with more storage capacity (i.e., smaller 5-week Normalized Difference Vegetation Index gradient), and faster responsive soils. The results reaffirm prior observations that minimum complexity that is required to model a basin depends on its climate and landscape characteristics (e.g., complex models do not perform well in dry basins).

AB The White method, routinely used to estimate phreatophyte transpiration from diel groundwater variation, also provides measures of total evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater fluxes in surface waters. Such applications remain rare, however, and critically require accurate representation of stage-dependent variation in specific yield (S-y). High-resolution stage data from three Florida swamps were used to evaluate different relationships between S-y and stage (ecosystem specific yield, ESY). A discretized form, ESYD, assumes constant S-y near unity for inundated conditions, applying soil S-y for belowground stage and open water S-y (S-y,S-OW approximate to 1.0) for aboveground stage. A mixture approach, ESYM, applies a stage-dependent interpolation between S-y,S-Soil and S-y,S-OW using stage-area relationships and assumes rapid lateral equilibration between inundated and non-inundated wetland areas. Finally, an empirical formulation, ESYRR, uses measured ratios of rain to rise to estimate stage-specific S-y. All formulations yielded reasonable ET rates (ET approximate to PET) at high stage; ESYD markedly overestimated ET (ET/PET>3) at intermediate stage, whereas ESYM and ESYRR maintained ET/PET near 1.0. Estimated groundwater fluxes using ESYM and ESYRR correlated well with Darcy-estimated flows, but were larger, likely due to uncertainties in Darcy parameters. Well transects across wetlands documented equal water elevation and diel variation across inundated and non-inundated areas, verifying rapid equilibration that reduces S-y and explaining overestimation by ESYD. However, equilibration area varied within and among wetlands, explaining observed differences between ESYM and ESYRR, and suggesting ESYRR may be preferred. Stage histograms followed the shape of ESYRR, highlighting reciprocal influences of ESY on stage stability. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In northern climates, accurate simulation of thermal and hydrological budgets for farmlands overwinter is crucial for both an accurate prediction of spring flooding and the successful management of nutrient losses. As snow cover influences soil freezing dynamics, it has been hypothesized that reduced snow cover due to warmer winters might intensify soil freezing. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis. Drawing upon observed snow depth and soil temperature data collected from six research farms across Southern Canada over various time spans from 1989 to 2020, the root zone water quality model, integrated with the simultaneous heat and water model (RZ-SHAW), was calibrated and validated. The potential influence of warmer winter on shifts in soil frost dynamics was evaluated by estimating soil freezing dynamics for each farmland site under various air temperature scenarios using the RZ-SHAW model. Soil frozen depth in the eastern Canada sites increased with increasing air temperature in some years but decreased under the highest air temperature increases of 3.5 degrees C. The monthly relationship between snow depth and soil frozen depth was determined through partial correlation analysis. Snow was most effective in alleviating soil freezing in the months of January and February, a period when snow cover depth was least affected by warming air temperatures. This study suggests that the hypothesis of increasing soil frozen depth under global warming-induced snow cover reduction holds true in conditions where soil energy lost through reduced snow cover outweighed the soil energy gained through warmer air temperature.

AB In the mountains of Norway, snow depth (SD) is highly variable due to strong winds and open terrain. To investigate snow conditions on one of Europe's largest mountain plateaus, Hardangervidda, we conducted snow measurement campaigns in spring 2008 and 2009 using airborne lidar scanning at the approximate time of annual snow maximum (mid-April). From 658 empirical distributions of SD at Hardangervidda, each comprised about 4,000 SD values sampled from a grid cell of 0.5 km(2), quantitative tests have shown that the gamma distribution is a better fit for SD than the normal and log-normal distributions. When aggregating snow and terrain data from 10 x 10 m to 0.5 km(2), we find that the standard deviation of the terrain parameter squared slope, land cover, and the mean SD are highly correlated (0.7, 0.52, and 0.89) to the standard deviation of SD. A model for SD variance is proposed that, in addition to addressing the dependencies between the variability of SD and the terrain characteristics, also takes into account the observed nonlinear relationship between the mean and the standard deviation of SD. When validated against observed SD variance retrieved from the same area, the model explains 81-83% of the observed variance for spatial scales of 0.5 and 5.1 km(2), which compares favorably to previous models. The model parameters can be determined from a GIS analysis of a detailed digital terrain and land cover model and will hence not increase the number of calibration parameters when implemented in environmental models.

The ultimate objective is to present a methodology for stochastically generating continuous subdaily rainfall sequences at any location such that the statistics at a range of aggregation scales are preserved. This first paper presents a regionalized nonparametric daily disaggregation model in which, conditional on a daily rainfall amount and previous- and next-day wetness states at the location of interest, subdaily fragments are resampled using continuous records at nearby locations. The second paper then focuses on a regionalized daily rainfall generation model. To enable the substitution of subdaily rainfall at nearby locations for subdaily rainfall at the location of interest, it is necessary to identify locations with "similar'' daily to subdaily scaling characteristics. We use a two-sample, two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to identify whether the daily to subdaily scaling relationships are statistically similar between all possible station pairs sampled from 232 gages located throughout Australia. This step is followed by a logistic regression to determine the influence of the covariates of latitude, longitude, elevation, and distance to the coast on the probability that the scaling at any two locations will be similar. The model is tested at five locations, where recorded subdaily data was available for comparison, and results indicate good model performance, particularly in preserving the probability distribution of extremes and the antecedent rainfall prior to the storm event.

AB [ 1] Variations in the degree of anisotropy in soil hydraulic conductivity with changes in water saturation (S-e) may adversely impact predictability of flow and transport processes. The conceptual "layered cake'' model was extended to consider effects of bulk density variations within a particular soil type. The anisotropy factor as function of matric potential A(psi) exhibits different behavior for different soil textures. For example, A(psi) for sand shows complex behavior with a local maximum just before A( y) drops to a minimum where sand becomes isotropic (A(psi) = 1) near psi = - 1.0 bar. Experimentally determined relationships between soil bulk density and hydraulic properties show existence of strong correlation between A(S-e) and the ratio of extreme hydraulic conductivity values K(S-e)(max)/K(S-e)(min) for each soil for the entire saturation range and across several soil types. The strong dependency of anisotropy factor on extreme values K-max and K-min was investigated for four simple and continuous probability density functions of bulk density. Additionally, simple analytical expressions for a binary system of alternating layers with K-max and K-min only were derived. An upper bound for A(S-e) is obtained with equal weight for K-max and K-min ( w = 0.5). The experimental data and model predictions agreed for certain values of weight assigned to either K-max or K-min (similar to w = 0.02). Other approximations based on Kmax and K-min provide simple estimates for anisotropy factor that could be related to shape of statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity.

AB Injecting carbon dioxide into geological formations for long-term storage is considered integral to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Residual trapping of CO2 is a primary storage mechanism, whereby CO2 ganglia are trapped in the pore space by capillary forces. Experimental knowledge of residual trapping processes in rocks is critical to the development of safe storage strategies. Here we present a quantitative low field H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) core flooding study of CO2 residual trapping in three different sandstones. It was found that transverse relaxation (T-2) measurements were sensitive to the dissolution of paramagnetic ions from rock matrix minerals after exposure to carbonic acid; this response was observed on time scales relevant to core flooding experiments (i.e., minutes to hours). Subsequently, a brine aging protocol was designed and implemented to minimize this chemical effect, and hence, by applying the well-known T-2-pore size relationship, changes in T-2 time distributions during core flooding could be related to displacement of brine from pores of different sizes. Comparison of T-2 distributions for partially CO2/brine-saturated cores to previously published data for N-2/H2O systems shows an increased displacement of brine from small pores by CO2. Furthermore, results from cyclical brine/CO2 injections showed an increase in the total volume of residually trapped CO2 and an increase in trapping efficiency; compared to the results observed for N-2/H2O, however, the improvement in trapping efficiency with cyclic injection was less pronounced. Potential causes for the observed differences are discussed in the context of effective N-2 and CO2 wetting.

TI Aquifer response to surface water transience in disconnected streams
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID STREAM/AQUIFER INTERACTION; ZONE FLOW; GROUNDWATER; RECHARGE; RETENTION;
   MODFLOW; MODEL
AB Existing analytical solutions to determine aquifer response to a change in stream stage are inappropriate where an unsaturated zone exists beneath the stream, as in the case of disconnected stream-aquifer systems. A better understanding of the relationship between aquifer response and transient stream stage in disconnected systems is therefore required, as this would also aid in the field determination of the status of connection between the stream and aquifer. We use a numerical model to examine transient stream stage and the corresponding water table response. Beneath disconnected streams, the magnitude of head change in the water table level is a balance between the cumulative infiltration during a flow event and the rate at which the water can disperse laterally. Increases in wave duration, stream width, and streambed permeability result in greater infiltrated water volume and therefore a higher peak response at the water table. Conversely, higher aquifer transmissivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity allow the water to move laterally away from the stream faster, resulting in a smaller head change below the stream. Lower unsaturated storage results in a greater and faster aquifer response because the unsaturated zone can fill more quickly. Under some combinations of parameters, the magnitude of the disconnected head response is more than seven times greater than the change in stream stage driving streambed infiltration; an effect which can never occur beneath a connected stream. The results of this sensitivity analysis are compared to field data from a river in eastern Australia to determine periods of disconnection. Where the change in aquifer head is greater than the change in stream stage, disconnection between the stream and aquifer can be determined.

AB The redistribution of hillslope soil water during and after rainstorms is affected by soil properties and topography. Therefore, understanding how soil-terrain attributes affect the soil volumetric water content (VWC) distribution under various catchment storages is a prerequisite for accurate hydrological modeling. Herein, the relationships between soil-terrain attributes and soil VWC were examined in a steep (average slope = 60%), forested, zero-order catchment. Detailed topography, soil properties, and runoff, and high frequency (6-min) soil moisture data observed from July 2016 to November 2017 were employed along with resampled VWC data in three time-steps (daily, hourly, and 6-min intervals) for correlation analysis between soil-terrain attributes and measured VWC. The results showed that daily aggregated data overlooked the highly heterogeneous flow conditions under dry-wet transitions, leading to a constantly high correlation between VWC and the topographic wetness index (TWI). In comparison, the 6-min data captured short-lived flow processes, highlighting that, in reality, VWC-TWI correlations fluctuated frequently as a function of catchment storages and precipitation characteristics, with four wetting patterns identified. Under wet-dry transitions, the VWC-TWI correlations increased significantly (from 0.3 to 0.6) as the hillslope gradually drained of lateral subsurface water. Soil water behavior consists of diurnal oscillations superimposed on a declining trend, which demonstrates the existence of unsaturated flow and which contributed to the increase in the strength of the correlations. Finally, through correlation analysis of all drying (n = 4) and wetting (n = 45) periods, we found that soil-terrain attributes and VWC correlations can be used to identify the dominant soil water processes in various catchment storages.

AB Land loss in the Mississippi River delta caused by subsidence and erosion has resulted in habitat loss and increased exposure of settled areas to storm surge risks. There is debate over the most cost-efficient and geomorphologically feasible projects to build land by river diversions, namely, whether a larger number of small, or a lesser number of large, engineered diversions provide the most efficient outcomes. This study uses an optimization framework to identify portfolios of diversions that are efficient for three general restoration objectives: maximize land built, minimize cost, and minimize water diverted. The framework links the following models: (1) a hydraulic water and sediment diversion model that, for a given structural design for a diversion, estimates the volume of water and sediment diverted; (2) a geomorphological land-building model that estimates the amount of land built over a time period, given the volume of water and sediment; and (3) a statistical model of investment cost as a function of diversion depth and width. An efficient portfolio is found by optimizing one objective subject to constraints on achievement of the other two; then by permuting those constraints, we find distinct portfolios that represent trade-offs among the objectives. Although the analysis explores generic relationships among size, cost, and land building (and thus does not consider specific project proposals or locations), the results demonstrate that large-scale land building (>200 km(2)) programs that operate over a time span of 50 years require deep diversions because of the enhanced efficiency of sand extraction per unit water. This conclusion applies whether or not there are significant scale economies or diseconomies associated with wider and deeper diversions.

AB Dynamics of drainage is analyzed for packings of spheres, using numerical experiments. For this purpose, a dynamic pore-scale model was developed to simulate water flow during drainage. The pore space inside a packing of spheres was extracted using regular triangulation, resulting in an assembly of grain-based tetrahedra. Then, pore units were constructed by identifying and merging tetrahedra that belong to the same pore, resulting in an assembly of pore units. Each pore unit was approximated by a volume-equivalent regular shape (e.g., cube and octahedron), for which a local capillary pressure-saturation relationship was obtained. To simulate unsaturated flow, a pore-scale version of IMPES (implicit pressure solver and explicit saturation update) was employed in order to calculate pressure and saturation distributions as a function of time for the assembly of pore units. To test the dynamic model, it was used on a packing of spheres to reproduce the corresponding measured quasi-static capillary pressure-saturation curve for a sand packing. Calculations were done for a packing of spheres with the same grain size distribution and porosity as the sand. We obtained good agreement, which confirmed the ability of the dynamic code to accurately describe drainage under low flow rates. Simulations of dynamic drainage revealed that drainage occurred in the form of finger-like infiltration of air into the pore space, caused by heterogeneities in the pore structure. During the finger-like infiltration, the pressure difference between air and water was found to be significantly higher than the capillary pressure. Furthermore, we tested the effects of the averaging, boundary conditions, domain size, and viscosity on the dynamic flow behavior. Finally, the dynamic coefficient was determined and compared to experimental data.

AB The shallow aquifer on the Gnangara Mound, north of Perth, Western Australia, is recharged by winter rainfall. Water infiltrates through a sandy Podosol where cemented accumulation (B-) horizons are common. They are water retentive and may impede recharge. To observe wetting fronts and the influence of soil horizons on unsaturated flow, we deployed time-lapse borehole radar techniques sensitive to soil moisture variations during an annual recharge cycle. Zero-offset crosswell profiling (ZOP) and vertical radar profiling (VRP) measurements were performed at six sites on a monthly basis before, during, and after annual rainfall in 2011. Water content profiles are derived from ZOP logs acquired in closely spaced wells. Sites with small separation between wells present potential repeatability and accuracy difficulties. Such problems could be lessened by (i) ZOP saturated zone velocity matching of time-lapse curves, and (ii) matching of ZOP and VRP results. The moisture contents for the baseline condition and subsequent observations are computed using the Topp relationship. Time-lapse moisture curves reveal characteristic vadose zone infiltration regimes. Examples are (I) full recharge potential after 200 mm rainfall, (II) delayed wetting and impeded recharge, and (III) no recharge below 7 m depth. Seasonal infiltration trends derived from long-term time-lapse neutron logging at several sites are shown to be comparable with infiltration trends recovered from time-lapse crosswell radar measurements. However, radar measurements sample a larger volume of earth while being safer to deploy than the neutron method which employs a radioactive source. For the regime (III) site, where time-lapse radar indicates no net recharge or zero flux to the water table, a simple water balance provides an evapotranspiration value of 620 mm for the study period. This value compares favorably to previous studies at similar test sites in the region. Our six field examples demonstrate application of time-lapse borehole radar for characterizing rainfall infiltration.

TI Electrical burst signature of pore-scale displacements
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID POROUS-MEDIA; WATER; HYSTERESIS
AB Electric field bursts were passively observed when a nonwetting fluid displaced a wetting fluid in a porous material (drainage) as well as during imbibition experiments. A sandbox experiment was conducted to study these electrical disturbances using a network of very sensitive nonpolarizing electrodes located at the top surface of the tank. Drainage exhibited many more electrical bursts, with a higher magnitude, than imbibition. These events were only observed during drainage or imbibition, not prior to or after the water flowed inside the porous sandbox. We point out the possible relationship between the formation of Haines jumps and the occurrence of these electrical bursts. These bursts show a power law distribution during drainage with a power law exponent of about -1.7, in agreement with a previous published study using acoustic and hydroacoustic events. Imbibition does not display such a power law relationship.

AB It is now standard practice for water supply agencies to use stochastic models to generate synthetic hydroclimate sequences that preserve the key statistics contained in the observed/instrumental hydroclimate data (usually rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow) for use as inputs when determining water security. However, this approach is only adequate for determining current and future water supply risks if nonstationarity in past and future climate is accounted for. In this study, we develop an approach for stochastically generating future seasonal (monthly to annual) hydroclimatic conditions at multiple sites for water supply security assessment that capitalizes on an Australia-wide relationship between annual average daily maximum temperature and annual rain (and flow). This approach is practical as it (i) avoids the extra time and additional uncertainties introduced by downscaling and bias correction of climate model produced rainfall information and (ii) takes advantage of the fact that climate model projections for temperature change are more realistic than climate model projections for rainfall. The approach is applied to a case study for catchments supplying Sydney, Australia's largest city. Two future scenarios were evaluated, 1 and 2 degrees C warming over the next 50 years. Large reductions in streamflow were simulated, particularly for the 2 degrees C scenario, resulting in major impacts on water security in the absence of any intervention. This is consistent with recent warming since 1990 being associated with more than a 40% decrease in average annual streamflow when compared with the average annual streamflow over the similar to 110 years historical record.

AB We propose a method to describe the impact of dams on design floods for ungauged areas and validate the method over the conterminous US (CONUS). A Random Forest (RF) model was chosen to capture the relationship between the change in 100-year return period flow up- and downstream of different dams and dam parameters available in the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database. The results showed that: (1) the RF model showed a greater accuracy in terms of Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (0.92 in training and 0.88 in testing) than a benchmark Multiple Linear Regression model (0.68 in training and 0.61 in testing); (2) Dam inflow, upstream catchment area, and long-term average discharge at reservoir location were the three most important factors for dam outflow; (3) flood attenuation effect indices (FAI) for >1400 dams over the CONUS were derived with the proposed method. To further validate the accuracy of the FAI, a new module considering flood attenuation effects was developed for the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model and two dams in the CONUS were selected to compare simulated flooded area against Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps. The result showed that the overestimation in flood hazard maps caused by not taking dams into account can be significantly corrected using the FAI and the enhanced LISFLOOD-FP model. We conclude that the proposed methodology is a valid approach to describe the impact of dams on design floods, thereby improving the accuracy of flood hazardmaps, especially in ungauged areas.

AB The lag time between rainfall input and discharge output-that is, the response speed of a catchment-is a key parameter for flood prediction but is difficult to quantify. Here we propose a new method to quantify catchment-wide average peak propagation speed in hillslopes based on measurements conducted in a steep 4.5-km(2) catchment. The peak lag time of the catchment was partitioned into lag times in the hillslope and channel. Peak propagation speed was calculated from flow path length divided by lag time. We verified the results and evaluated the applicability and uncertainty of this method. This method can be applied during intense storms with identifiable peak relationships between rainfall and discharge. The effect of spatial variation in precipitation was insignificant in the study catchment. The increase in rainfall intensity and the rainfall accumulated prior to peak rainfall increased peak propagation speed. The method used to characterize flow path length from distributed values introduced some uncertainty. We calculated modal lengths using linear and logarithmic scales and various bin widths. These calculations resulted in small differences in modal channel length but led to more than tenfold differences in modal hillslope length. Thus, uncertainties for peak propagation speed across all hillslopes varied by one order of magnitude. Hillslope lag times were less than 2 min and peak propagation speed in the hillslopes ranged from 0.04 to 4.3 m/s for floods with recurrence intervals of one to several years. The proposed method and calculated data should improve prediction accuracy for extreme floods.

AB The design storm approach with event-based rainfall-runoff models is a standard method for design flood estimation in ungauged catchments. The approach is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, but the underlying assumptions can lead to flawed design flood estimations. In particular, the implied average recurrence interval (ARI) neutrality between rainfall and runoff neglects uncertainty in other important parameters, leading to an underestimation of design floods. The selection of a single representative critical rainfall duration in the analysis leads to an additional underestimation of design floods. One way to overcome these nonconservative approximations is the use of a continuous rainfall-runoff model, which is associated with significant computational cost and requires rainfall input data that are often not readily available. As an alternative, we propose a novel Probabilistic Design Storm method that combines eventbased flood modeling with basic probabilistic models and concepts from reliability analysis, in particular the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). The proposed methodology overcomes the limitations of the standard design storm approach, while utilizing the same input information and models without excessive computational effort. Additionally, the Probabilistic Design Storm method allows deriving so-called design charts, which summarize representative design storm events (combinations of rainfall intensity and other relevant parameters) for floods with different return periods. These can be used to study the relationship between rainfall and runoff return periods. We demonstrate, investigate, and validate the method by means of an example catchment located in the Bavarian Pre-Alps, in combination with a simple hydrological model commonly used in practice.

AB Large wood (LW) exerts an important influence on the geomorphology and ecology of streams and rivers. The magnitudes of flow forces on LW are needed to support stream management activities and are typically computed using time mean lift and drag coefficients determined in laboratory flumes using small, smooth cylinders. Herein we report measurements of forces on LW of varying complexity (simple cylinder, branching, and complex root wad) and surface (bark) roughness made in an outdoor grassed channel under steady and unsteady flows. LW orientation relative to the primary flow direction and LW relative submergence were varied. Drag and lift coefficients for cylindrical (unbranched) LW followed patterns reported by others for metal cylinders in wind tunnels. Drag coefficients for cylindrical (unbranched) LW, corrected for blockage effects, ranged from -0.05 to 1.29, and lift coefficients ranged from -0.88 to 0.52, varying systematically with LW position relative to the channel bed and incident flow direction. Measured drag coefficients for the noncylindrical LW, corrected for blockage effects, ranged from 0.22 to 6.27, while lift coefficients varied from -3.65 to 30.84. Systematic relationships between the relative submergence and orientation of branching LW and the drag and lift coefficients were not observed, but coefficients were greatest for LW with few branches and converged on smaller values typical of blunt bodies as LW complexity increased. For both simple and complex LW, maximum lift and drag forces during the rising limb of unsteady flows were about 2-3 times greater than steady flow temporal mean values.

AB Subsurface flow from hillslopes is widely recognized as an important contributor to streamflow generation; however, processes that control how and when hillslopes connect to streams remain unclear. We investigated stream and hillslope runoff dynamics through a wet-up period in watershed 10 of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascades of Oregon where the riparian zone has been removed by debris flows. We examined the controls on hillslope-stream connectivity on the basis of observations of hydrometric, stable isotope, and applied tracer responses and computed transit times for multiple runoff components for a series of storms during the wet-up phase of the 2002-2003 winter rainy season. Hillslope discharge was distinctly threshold-like with a near linear response and average quick flow ratio of 0.58 when antecedent rainfall was greater than 20 mm. Hillslope and stream stormflow varied temporally and showed strong hysteretic relationships. Event water mean transit times (8-34 h) and rapid breakthrough from applied hillslope tracer additions demonstrated that subsurface contributing areas extend far upslope during events. Despite rapid hillslope transport processes during events, soil water and runoff mean transit times during nonstorm conditions were greater than the time scale of storm events. Soil water mean transit times ranged between 10 and 25 days. Hillslope seepage and catchment base flow mean transit times were between 1 and 2 years. We describe a conceptual model that captures variable physical flow pathways, their synchronicity, threshold activation, hysteresis, and transit times through changing antecedent wetness conditions that illustrate the different stages of hillslope and stream connectivity.

TI Solving nonlinear water management models using a combined genetic
   algorithm and linear programming approach
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English

DE water resources management; nonlinear models; genetic algorithm; linear
   programming
AB Gradient-based nonlinear programming (NLP) methods can solve problems with smooth nonlinear objectives and constraints. However, in large and highly nonlinear models, these algorithms can fail to find feasible solutions, or converge to local solutions which are not global. Evolutionary search procedures in general, and genetic algorithms (GAs) specifically, are less susceptible to the presence of local solutions. However, they often exhibit slow convergence, especially when there are many variables, and have problems finding feasible solutions in constrained problems with "narrow" feasible regions. In this paper, we describe strategies for solving large nonlinear water resources models management, which combine GAs with linear programming. The key idea is to identify a set of complicating variables in the model which, when fixed, render the problem linear in the remaining variables. The complicating variables are then varied by a GA. This GA&LP approach is applied to two nonlinear models: a reservoir operation model with nonlinear hydropower generation equations and nonlinear reservoir topologic equations, and a long-term dynamic river basin planning model with a large number of nonlinear relationships. For smaller instances of the reservoir model, the CONOPT2 nonlinear solver is more accurate and faster, but for larger instances, the GA&LP approach finds solutions with significantly better objective values. The multiperiod river basin model is much too large to be solved in its entirety. The complicating variables are chosen here so that, when they are fixed, each period's model is linear, and these models can be solved sequentially. This approach allows sufficient model detail to be retained so that long-term sustainability issues can be explored. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quantification of the predictive uncertainty of subsurface models has long been investigated. The traditional workflow is to calibrate prior models to match observed data, and then use the posterior models to simulate future system performance. Not only are these procedures computationally expensive, but they also have issues in maintaining geological model constraints during the calibration step. Data space inversion (DSI) was introduced recently to predict future system performance without the iterative history matching or model calibration step. In general, DSI approaches seek to establish a statistical relationship between the observed and forecast variables, as well as to quantify the predictive uncertainty of the forecast variables, by using an ensemble of uncalibrated prior models. Existing DSI approaches all require a number of complex transformation and mapping operations, which may deter their widespread use. In this study, we introduce a new and simpler DSI approach, the learning-based, data-driven forecast approach (LDFA), by combining dimension reduction and machine learning techniques to quickly provide accurate forecast results and reliably quantify corresponding uncertainty in the results. Our LDFA framework is demonstrated using two supervised learning algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), on two representative examples from reservoir engineering and geological carbon storage. Results suggest that our approach provides accurate forecast results (e.g., future oil production rate or cumulative injected CO2) and reasonable predictive uncertainty intervals. Our framework is generic and may be applied to other surface and subsurface problems.

AB Permeable pavement functions as a porous infrastructure interface allowing the infiltration and evaporation of rainfall-runoff while functioning as a relatively smooth load-bearing surface for vehicular transport. Hydraulic conductivity (k) of permeable pavement is an important hydraulic property and is a function of the pore structure. This study examines k for a cementitious permeable pavement (CPP) through a series of pore-structure models. Measurements utilized include hydraulic head as well as total porosity, (phi(t)), effective porosity (phi(e)), tortuosity (L-e/L) and pore size distribution (PSD) indices generated through X-ray tomography (XRT). XRT results indicate that the permeable pavement pore matrix is hetero-disperse, with high tortuosity and phi(t) not equal phi(e). Power law models of k-phi(t), and k-phi(e) relationships are developed for a CPP mix design. Results indicate that the Kruger, Fair-Hatch, Hazen, Slichter, Beyer and Terzaghi models based on simple pore-structure indices do not reproduce measured k values. The conventional Kozeny-Carman model (KCM), a more parameterized pore-structure model, did not reproduce measured k values. This study proposes a modified KCM utilizing phi(e), specific surface area (SSA)(pe) and weighted tortuosity (L-e/L)(w). Results demonstrate that such permeable pavement pore-structure parameters with the modified KCM can predict k. The k results are combined with continuous simulation modeling using historical rainfall to provide nomographs examining permeable pavement as a low impact development (LID) infrastructure component.

AB The single-source bulk transfer formulation (based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, MOST) has been used to estimate the sensible heat flux, H, in the framework of remote sensing over homogeneous surfaces (H-MOST). The latter involves the canopy parameter, kB-1, which is difficult to parameterize. Over short and dense grass at a site influenced by regional advection of sensible heat flux, H-MOST with kB-1=2 (i.e., the value recommended) correlated strongly with the H measured using the Eddy Covariance, EC, method, H-EC. However, it overestimated H-EC by 50% under stable conditions for samples showing a local air temperature gradient larger than the measurement error, 0.4 km(-1). Combining MOST and Surface Renewal analysis, three methods of estimating H that avoid kB-1 dependency have been derived. These new expressions explain the variability of H versus u*(Tc-T(z)), where u* is the friction velocity, Tc is the radiometric surface temperature, and T(z) is the air temperature at height, z. At two measurement heights, the three methods performed excellently. One of the methods developed required the same readily/commonly available inputs as H-MOST due to the fact that the ratio between (Tc-T(z)) and the ramp amplitude was found fairly constant under stable and unstable cases. Over homogeneous canopies, at a site influenced by regional advection of sensible heat flux, the methods proposed are an alternative to the traditional bulk transfer method because they are reliable, exempt of calibration against the EC method, and are comparable or identical in cost of application. It is suggested that the methodology may be useful over bare soil and sparse vegetation.

AB The traveling wave responses in an unsaturated medium induced by a solid force and fluid mass sources are derived in 3D Green's functions using the Dirac Delta function decompositions. The wave behaviors are described in pore fluid pressures and solid frame displacement along with fluctuations of capillary pressure in response to time variant fluid injections and solid force loadings. These solutions are numerically calculated and analyzed for unconsolidated sands as a function of water saturation as representative examples. Our results reveal and validate four wave modes, a fast compressional wave (P1), two slow compressional waves (P2 and P3), and a shear wave. The PI wave and shear wave can be effectively observed. The slow waves with diffusive characters bear low amplitudes and low velocities. The traveling waves in the pore fluid pressures and solid displacement are sensitive to the different sources and the water saturation. The solid force induces the total stress perturbation while the fluid mass sources directly make the volume strains in the fluid phases. This fluid-solid coupling difference causes the distinct traveling wave signature contrasts in the pore-fluid and solid-frame response amplitudes and tendencies with water retention. For the variation of water saturation, the traveling wave shows a nonmonotonic feature. The fluctuation of capillary pressure exhibits a concave upward relationship, which can further interpret the changes of wave amplitude with water saturation. A solid force may enhance the fluctuation. However, for high water saturation, the interactive fluid-solid effect by the solid force may break the fluid contact due to the extremely compressible air.

AB Outdoor water use represents over 50% of total water demand in semiarid and arid cities and presents both challenges to and opportunities for improved efficiency and water resilience. The current work adapts a remote sensing-based methodology to estimate growing season irrigation rates at the census block group scale in Denver, Colorado. Results show that city-wide outdoor water use does not change significantly from 1995 to 2018, while per capita water use and total water use significantly decrease from 2000 to 2018. Because total water use, but not outdoor use, is decreasing, the percent of water used outdoors significantly increases across the city from 2000 to 2018. Climate variables account for one-quarter of interannual variation in mean irrigation rates due primarily to changes in temperature, not precipitation. Percent impervious land cover exhibits a significant inverse nonlinear relationship with irrigation rates at the census block group scale. Finally, 38% of Denver census block groups show significantly increasing irrigation rates between 1995 and 2018 driven primarily by increasing temperatures. The increasing proportion of water used for irrigation highlights the importance of outdoor demand management for urban water systems as indoor efficiencies improve. We advocate that resilient water systems necessitate integrated land use, infrastructure, and water planning in the face of urban growth and climate change. While minimizing irrigated urban areas may reduce demand, remaining green spaces should be designed to maximize multiple benefits including reductions in water demand and urban heat islands, stormwater management, and recreation to improve the sustainability of growing cities.

AB Although the long-term geomorphic evolution of an estuarine tidal flat consequent to flow alteration and erosion has been widely documented, the short-term ecological responses of such ecosystems to multiple stressors remain poorly understood. We combined a mechanism-based ecomorphodynamic model with a hydrodynamic and sediment numerical model to examine the ecological response of an estuarine tidal flat ecosystem to different magnitudes of flow discharge and erosion conditions in the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) of China. The ecological benefits of flow discharge and erosion are reported in terms of the state of the tidal flat system: (1) a patterned state with high primary production and strong sediment stabilization; and (2) a homogeneous state with low primary production and severe erosion. We focused on the nonlinear flow-ecology relationship and identified the minimum threshold of flow discharge at which a patterned state occurs. Both flow discharge and erosion rates were shown to be important determinants of the state of the estuarine tidal flat ecosystem. We showed that a change in flow discharge altered the sediment deposition rate S-in and induced a state transition of the tidal flat ecosystem. Erosion increased the minimum threshold value of flow discharge at which a patterned state occurred. Our model framework provides an insightful method with a strong mechanistic basis to determine thresholds of flow discharge at which ecological benefits change dramatically, thereby providing a tool to make decisions regarding flow allocation in estuarine tidal flat ecosystems that are suffering from degradation caused by restricted flow and sediment load.

AB Trees exert a fundamental control on the hydrologic cycle, yet previous research is unclear about the nuanced relationship between forest cover and riverine flood frequency. In the Northeastern United States, warming air temperatures have resulted in a decline of Eastern Hemlock (EH), and subsequent increases in observed catchment water yield. We evaluated the possibility of EH loss leading to a changed flooding regime. We first investigated plant hydraulic regulation by root water uptake in EH and American Beech (AB; a candidate successional species) through stable isotope analysis of stream, soil water, and plant xylem water. EH xylem water showed evidence of deeper soil water uptake than AB during both wet and dry seasons, suggesting species succession may be an important mechanism for altering catchment "plant accessible water." Next, we estimated catchment flood frequency with mechanistic hydrologic simulations for present conditions, and two hypothetical cases where all EH is succeeded by AB. The largest change to catchment extreme discharge after AB succession coincided with fall season tropical moisture export-derived precipitation. We observed reduced sensitivity under future climatic forcing with an ensemble simulation of five localized constructed analogs downscaled general circulation models. Thus, the influence of forest composition on the flood regime may be most related to the temporal alignment of the synoptic-scale processes that generate Atlantic Basin tropical cyclones and regional plant phenology of the Northeast United States. Our results provide a justification for using physically based hydrologic models incorporating plant hydraulic regulation when evaluating future flooding frequency.

AB We propose a novel approach to link solute transport behavior to the physical heterogeneity of the aquifer, which we fully characterize with two measurable parameters: the variance of the log K values (sigma(2)(Y)), and a new indicator (H-R) that integrates multiple properties of the K field into a global measure of spatial disorder or geological entropy. From the results of a detailed numerical experiment considering solute transport in K fields representing realistic distributions of hydrofacies in alluvial aquifers, we identify empirical relationship between the two parameters and the first three central moments of the distributions of arrival times of solute particles at a selected control plane. The analysis of experimental data indicates that the mean and the variance of the solutes arrival times tend to increase with spatial disorder (i.e., H-R increasing), while highly skewed distributions are observed in more orderly structures (i.e., H-R decreasing) or at higher sigma(2)(Y). We found that simple closed-form empirical expressions of the bivariate dependency of skewness on H-R and sigma(2)(Y) can be used to predict the emergence of non-Fickian transport in K fields considering a range of structures and heterogeneity levels, some of which based on documented real aquifers. The accuracy of these predictions and in general the results from this study indicate that a description of the global variability and structure of the K field in terms of variance and geological entropy offers a valid and broadly applicable approach for the interpretation and prediction of transport in heterogeneous porous media.

AB Understanding the role of external controls on the morphology of braided rivers is currently limited by the dearth of robust metrics to quantify and distinguish the diversity of channel form. Most existing measures are strongly dependent on river stage and unable to account for the three-dimensional complexity that is apparent in digital terrain models of braided rivers. In this paper, we introduce a simple, stage-independent morphological indicator that enables the analysis of reach-scale regime morphology as a function of slope, discharge, sediment size, and degree of confinement. The index is derived from the bed elevation frequency distribution and characterizes a statistical width-depth curve averaged longitudinally over multiple channel widths. In this way, we define a synthetic channel described by a simple parameter that embeds information about the river morphological complexity. Under the assumption of uniform flow, this approach can be extended to provide estimates of the reach-averaged shear stress distribution, bed load flux, and at-a-station-variability of wetted width. We test this approach using data from a wide range of labile channels including 58 flume experiments and three gravel bed braided rivers. Results demonstrate a strong relationship between the unit discharge and the shape of the elevation distribution, which varies between a U shape for typical single-thread confined channels and a Y shape for multithread reaches. Finally, we discuss the use of the metric as a diagnostic index of river condition that may be used to support inferences about the river morphological trajectory.

AB Water resources in the western United States are contingent on interannual variations in snowpack. Interannual snowpack variability has been attributed to large-scale climate patterns including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), however, the contribution of snowfall frequency and extreme snowfall events to this variability are less well quantified. Long-term records from Snowpack Telemetry and Cooperative Observer Program stations in the 11 western states were used to investigate these relationships by considering the number of snowfall days and snowfall water equivalent (SFE) of extreme snowfall events. The top decile of snowfall events contributed 20-38% of annual SFE, depending on the region. An average of 65% and 69% of the interannual variability in annual SFE was explained by snowfall days and SFE of top decile snowfall events, respectively, with extreme events being a more significant predictor at most stations. The latitudinal dipole in SFE during ENSO phases results from changes in snowfall frequency and extreme events. In the Pacific Northwest, above normal SFE during La Nina winters was a product of both larger contributions from extremes and more snowfall days, while below normal SFE during El Nino winters was primarily associated with a substantial reduction in extremes. Conversely, annual SFE during ENSO phases in the mountains of Arizona was more closely linked to fluctuations in snowfall days than extremes. Results indicate the importance of extreme snowfall events in shaping interannual variability in water resources and suggest that improved predictive ability may inform better water resource management now and in the coming decades.

TI Identifying effective forecast horizon for real-time reservoir operation
   under a limited inflow forecast

ID FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS; FOLSOM LAKE RESPONSE; SHORT-TERM; STORAGE;
   PREDICTABILITY; MANAGEMENT; SINGLE
AB The use of a streamflow forecast for real-time reservoir operation is constrained by forecast uncertainty (FU) and limited forecast horizon (FH). The effects of the two factors are complicating since increasing the FH usually provides more information for decision making in a longer time framework but with increasing uncertainty, which offsets the information gain from a longer FH. This paper illustrates the existence of an effective FH (EFH) with a given forecast, which balances the effects of the FH and FU and provides the maximum information for reservoir operation decision making. With the assumption of a concave objective function, a monotonic relationship between current operation decision and ending storage is derived. Metrics representing the error resulting from a limited forecast relative to a perfect forecast are defined to evaluate reservoir performance. Procedures to analyze the complicating effect of FU and FH and to identify EFH are proposed. Results show that: (1) when FH is short, FH is the dominating factor for determining reservoir operation, and reservoir performance exhibits a quick improvement as FH increases; (2) when FH is long, the inflow information may be too uncertain to guide reservoir operation decisions and FU becomes the dominating factor; and (3) at a medium FH, reservoir performance depends on the complicating effects of FU and FH and EFH locates with a certain balanced level of FU and FH. The statistical characteristics of EFH are illustrated with case studies with deterministic forecast and ensemble forecast. Moreover, the impacts of temporal correlation of FU, inflow variability, evaporation loss, and reservoir capacity on EFH are explored.

A property of these phenomena is the relationship between unfrozen water content and sub-freezing temperature, known as the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFC). It is documented that this relationship exhibits hysteretic behaviour when frozen soil thaws, leading to the definition of the soil thawing characteristic curve (STC). Although explanations have been given for SFC/STC hysteresis, the effect that 'scale' - particularly 'measurement scale' - may have on these curves has received little attention. The most commonly used measurement scale metric is the 'support', which is the spatial (or temporal) unit within which the measured variable is integrated or soil volume sampled. We show (a) measurement support can influence the range and shape of the SFC and (b) hysteresis can be attributed, in part, to the support and location of the measurements comprising the SFC/STC. We simulated lab measured temperature, volumetric water content (VWC), and permittivity from soil samples undergoing freeze-thaw transitions using Hydrus-1D and a modified Dobson permittivity model. To assess the effect of measurement support and location on SFC/STC, we masked the simulated temperature and VWC/permittivity extent to match the instrument's support and location. By creating a detailed simulation of the intra- and inter-support variability associated with the penetration of a freezing front, we demonstrate how measurement support and location can influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured. We show it is possible to simulate hysteresis in homogenous media with purely geometric considerations, suggesting that SFC/STC hysteresis may be more of an apparent phenomenon than mechanistically real. Lastly, we develop an understanding of how the location and support of soil temperature and VWC/permittivity measurements influence the temperature range over which water freezing events are captured.

AB A topological representation of a rural catchment is proposed here in addition to the generally used topographic drainage network. This is an object-oriented representation based on the identification of the inlets and outlets for surface water flow on each farmer's field (or plot) and their respective contributing areas and relationships. It represents the catchment as a set of independent plot outlet trees reaching the stream, while a given plot outlet tree represents the pattern of surface flow relationships between individual plots. In the present study, we propose to implement functions related to linear and surface elements of the landscape, such as hedges or road networks, or land use, to obtain what we call a landscape drainage network which delineates the effective contributing area to the stream, thus characterizing its topological structure. Landscape elements modify flow pathways and/or favour water infiltration, thus reducing the area contributing to the surface yield and modifying the structure of the plot outlet trees. This method is applied to a 4D4-km(2) catchment area comprising 43 955 pixels and 312 plots. While the full set of 164 plot outlet trees, with an average of 7 plots per tree, covers 100% of the total surface area of the catchment, the landscape drainage network comprises no more than 37 plot outlet trees with an average of 2 plots per tree, accounting for 52 and 7% of the catchment surface area, when taking account of linear elements and land use, respectively. This topological representation can be easily adapted to changes in land use and land infrastructure, and provides a simple and functional display for intercomparison of catchments and decision support regarding landscape and water management.

AB Sediment infiltration can clog salmon nests and reduce egg survival. As a countermeasure, environmental managers often deploy infiltration traps to monitor sediment infiltration. Traps provide a repeatable means of measuring infiltration and enable comparisons to be made between sites. Results from infiltration rates measured with traps have also been used to estimate infilling rates into salmon nests. Application of these data is questionable, as the composition of the bed and the amount of fine sediment within the bed is known to affect infiltration rates. Thus, infiltration rates measured with infiltration traps may differ from the infiltration rates occurring in redd and riffle gravels.
   To examine how relationships between sediment infiltration rates varied between four watersheds, we continuously monitored suspended sediment transport, shear stress and infiltration rates at four sites over 5 months. We also compared infiltration rates measured with infiltration traps with changes in the hydraulic conductivity and subsurface grain size distribution of adjacent artificially constructed salmon nests and natural riffle gravels.
   Among the four watersheds, clear differences in sediment infiltration rates were observed. The differences correlated with the subsurface silt content but no strong relationship existed between land-use or basin physiography/geology. Despite observing an average of 30 kg m(-2) of sediment finer than 2 mm being deposited in the infiltration traps during the study, no change in redd or riffle substrate was observed. If the deposition rates measured with the traps reflect the processes in redds, enough sediment would have been deposited to inhibit egg emergence. However, no reduction in egg survival to the eyed stage was observed. In summary, our results show that infiltration traps with clean gravels can be used to detect intersite differences in sediment transport regimes. Extrapolations of sediment infiltration rates measured with such collectors to estimate infiltration rates in redds or riffles is, however, flawed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil and nutrient loss play a vital role in eutrophication of water bodies. Several simulated rainfall experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of a single controlling factor on soil and nutrient loss. However, the role of precipitation and vegetation coverage in quantifying soil and nutrient loss is still unclear. We monitored runoff, soil loss, and soil nutrient loss under natural rainfall conditions from 2004 to 2015 for 50-100 m(2) runoff plots around Beijing. Results showed that soil erosion was significantly reduced when vegetation coverage reached 20% and 60%. At levels below 30%, nutrient loss did not differ among different vegetation cover levels. Minimum soil N and P losses were observed at cover levels above 60%. Irrespective of the management measure, soil nutrient losses were higher at high-intensity rainfall (Imax30>15 mm/h) events compared to low-intensity events (p < 0.05). We applied structural equation modelling (SEM) to systematically analyze the relative effects of rainfall characteristics and environmental factors on runoff, soil loss, and soil nutrient loss. At high-intensity rainfall events, neither vegetation cover nor antecedent soil moisture content (ASMC) affected runoff and soil loss. After log-transformation, soil nutrient loss was significantly linearly correlated with runoff and soil loss (p < 0.01). In addition, we identified the direct and indirect relationships among the influencing factors of soil nutrient loss on runoff plots and constructed a structural diagram of these relationships. The factors positively impacting soil nutrient loss were runoff (44%-48%), maximum rainfall intensity over a 30-min period (18%-29%), rainfall depth (20%-27%), and soil loss (10%-14%). Studying the effects of rainfall and vegetation coverage factors on runoff, soil loss, and nutrient loss can improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism of slope non-point source pollution.

AB Baseflow is an integral component of environmental flow prescriptions to mitigate the impacts of flow regime alteration on the ecological condition of rivers and often the most contentious issue in project planning, particularly for waterpower development. Baseflow prescriptions to meet ecological objectives are increasingly derived from a natural reference condition, often a simulated streamflow time series for an ungauged basin. Accuracy of baseflow estimates is important for identifying ecological water requirements and possible ecosystem and economic tradeoffs with confidence. Estimating baseflow time series in ungauged basins to accurately quantify a natural reference condition in all regions of Ontario is particularly difficult given the heterogeneity in landscape, climate, and size of the basins where simulated time series are required. To identify the optimal hydrologic model for baseflow simulation in all regions of Ontario, five variants of McMaster University-Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (MAC-HBV) were tested using a combination of possible model parameters, linear and nonlinear storage-discharge relationship in deep soil layers, and different criteria for optimizing model parameter sets. It was found that the hydrologic model which used a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship, a larger range of model parameters and included low flow criteria in the optimization procedure showed the best performance for baseflow estimates. The optimal model was then combined with a coupled regionalization method to improve baseflow estimates in ungauged basins compared with the original MAC-HBV model. This included a similar to 20% increase in the median of Nash Sutcliffe efficiencies and a 50% reduction in the volume errors for the tested basins. The resulting model provides a tool that can be used reliably throughout Ontario to simulate streamflow and baseflow time series in ungauged basins and to calculate baseflow indicators and criteria for aquatic ecosystem assessments of planned flow regime alterations.

AB The Euphrates and Tigris rivers serve as the most important water resources in the Middle East. Precipitation in this region falls mostly in the form of snow over the higher elevations of the Euphrates Basin and remains on the ground for nearly half of the year. This snow-covered area (SCA) is a key element of the hydrological cycle, and monitoring the SCA is crucial for making accurate forecasts of snowmelt discharge, especially for energy production, flood control, irrigation, and reservoir-operation optimization in the Upper Euphrates (Karasu) Basin. Remote sensing allows the detection of the spatio-temporal patterns of snow cover across large areas in inaccessible terrain, such as the eastern part of Turkey, which is highly mountainous. In this study, a seasonal evaluation of the snow cover from 2000 to 2009 was performed using 8-day snow-cover products (MOD10C2) and the daily snow-water equivalent (SWE) product. The values of SWE products were obtained using an assimilation process based on the Helsinki University of Technology model using equal area Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Earth-gridded advanced microwave scanning radiometer-EOS daily brightness-temperature values. In the Karasu Basin, the SCA percentage for the winter period is 80-90%. The relationship between the SCA and the runoff during the spring period is analysed for the period from 2004 to 2009. An inverse linear relationship between the normalized SCA and the normalized runoff values was obtained (r = 0.74). On the basis of the monthly mean temperature, total precipitation and snow depth observed at meteorological stations in the basin, the decrease in the peak discharges, and early occurrences of the peak discharges in 2008 and 2009 are due to the increase in the mean temperature and the decrease in the precipitation in April (C) Copyright. 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Uruguay has stimulated the development of its forest sector since the promulgation of Forest Law N degrees 15 939 in December of 1987. Nevertheless, the substitution of natural grasslands with forest plantations for industrial use has raised concerns regarding hydrological processes of groundwater recharge and water consumption involving evapotranspiration. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of this substitution approach on water resources. Input data were collected from two small experimental watersheds of roughly 100-200 hectares located in western Uruguay. The watersheds are characterized by Eucalyptus Globulus ssp. Maidenni and natural grasslands for cattle use. Total rainfall, stream discharge, rainfall redistribution, soil water content and groundwater level data were collected. Groundwater recharge was estimated from water table fluctuations and from groundwater contributions to base flows. Seasonal and annual water budgets were computed from October of 2006 to September of 2014 to evaluate changes in the hydrological processes. The data show a decrease in annual specific discharge of roughly 17% for mean hydrological years and no conclusive effects on annual groundwater recharge in the forested watershed relative to the reference pasture watershed. Reduced annual specific discharge is equivalent to the mean annual interception. The computed actual annual evapotranspiration is consistent with international catchment measurements. Reduction rates vary seasonally and according to accumulated rainfall and its temporary distribution. The degree of specific discharge decline is particularly high for drier autumns and winters (32 to 28%) when the corresponding rainfall varies from 275 to 400mm. These results are of relevance for water resources management efforts, as water uses downstream can be affected. These findings, based on a study period dominated by anomalous wet springs and summers and by dry autumns and winters, oppose earlier results based on 34years of rainfall and discharge data drawn from Uruguayan large basins.

AB In most ecosystems, plants face periods with limited water availability, during which stomatal conductance is reduced to maintain hydration. However, prolonged dry spells might require more drastic strategies to conserve water, such as drought-deciduousness. If drought-related changes in leaf area are adaptive, it can be hypothesized that leaf area is optimized to maximize the growing-season carbon (C) gain. Different phenological strategies during drought have been proposed: (i) leaf area index (L) declines when net photosynthetic rates (A(net)) reach zero to maintain a non-negative A(net); (ii) L adjusts to avoid water potentials with negative impacts on A(net); (iii) a constant leaf water potential is maintained (isohydric behavior); and (iv) leaf area remains unaltered (i.e., summer-evergreen leaf habit). However, whether these strategies are optimal in terms of growing season C gains has not been assessed. Here we consider these theories in a unified framework using the same set of equations to describe gas exchanges and water transport in the soil plant atmosphere continuum, and quantify the effect of the leaf phenological strategy on plant C gain over the entire growing season in different climates. Longer dry periods tend to favor drought-deciduous rather than summer-evergreen habit. Deciduous plants that allow leaf water potential to fluctuate (anisohydric) while preventing negative A(net) assimilate more carbon than deciduous plants with fixed leaf water potentials (isohydric). Increased rooting depth allows evergreens to more effectively compete with drought-deciduous species. Moreover, increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations and thus photosynthetic capacity can be an effective acclimation strategy when dry periods are relatively short. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A year of measurements by Doppler Current Profilers, a chain of temperature sensors and a suite of meteorological instruments has been analyzed to elucidate the seasonal cycle of the dynamical response of a temperate lake (Windermere) to surface forcing. The efficiency of energy input to the lake (Eff) was determined by comparing the rate of working by the surface wind-stress RWy with the downward flux of momentum in the atmosphere. Eff was found to increase from values of similar to 0.3% in winter mixed conditions, up to similar to 1.2% during summer stratification, when internal seiches were present. Water column kinetic energy was similarly enhanced during stratification. Spectral analysis of the axial velocity showed that the first vertical mode was dominant during most of the stratified period with a less prominent second mode appearing in the early part of the summer. The observed periods and vertical structure of these modes generally accorded with estimates from internal wave theory based on density profiles. During stratification, pycnocline dissipation exhibited high variability linked to the surface forcing with an average, depth-integrated, pycnocline dissipation rate of 2.5 x 10(-5) W m(-2) corresponding to similar to 3%-4% of RWy. Over the same period, the dissipation rate in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) exhibited a marked diurnal variation unrelated to physical forcing. Acoustic backscatter indicated the presence of vertically migrating organisms with peak aggregation in the BBL around midday coinciding with maximum dissipation. During stratification, biogenic dissipation contributed an average of similar to 36% of the total BBL dissipation rate of similar to 5.7 x 10(-5) W m(-2).

   Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis

   IDENTIFICATION; STRATEGIES; OUTPUT
AB Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) provides essential insights into the behavior of Earth and environmental systems models and identifies dominant controls of output uncertainty. Previous work on GSA, however, has typically been under the assumption that the controlling factors such as model inputs and parameters are independent, whereas, in many cases, they are correlated and their joint distribution follows a variety of forms. Although this assumption can limit the credibility of GSA and its results, very few studies in the field of water and environmental modeling address this issue. In this paper, we first discuss the significance of correlation effects in GSA and then propose a new GSA framework for properly accounting for correlations in input/parameter spaces. To this end, we extend the "variogram-based" theory of GSA, called variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS), and develop a new generalized star sampling technique (called gSTAR) to accommodate correlated multivariate distributions. We test the new gSTAR-VARS method on two test functions, against a state-of-the-art GSA method that handles correlation effects. We then apply gSTAR-VARS to the HBV-SASK model, calibrated via a Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, for design flood estimation in the Oldman River Basin in Canada. Results demonstrate that accounting for correlation effects can be critically important in GSA, especially in the presence of nonlinearity and interaction effects in the underlying response surfaces. The proposed method can efficiently handle correlations and different distribution types and simultaneously generate a range of sensitivity indices, such as total-variogram effects, variance-based total-order effects, and derivative-based elementary effects.

AB Our manuscript analyses the surface runoff variability, and its controlling factors in a small basin with gentle slopes, at the headwaters of a flat catchment, to improve the knowledge of the hydrology of plain areas under agriculture. We study runoff, rainfall and antecedent conditions in the argentine Pampas region. We use correlations, regressions and quantitative and qualitative descriptive information of the system: erosion signs, ground cover by crops, groundwater depth data and temporal changes in the drainage network, to discuss and understand the complexity of the runoff process by frameworks to study (dis)connectivity. The analysis of 56 events evidenced a nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationship. In contrast with other works, we identified clear upper limit events, under which hydrological responses emerge, as a result of combinations of antecedent wetness, rainfall erosivity, ground cover and preferential drainage paths. We separated the nonlinear rainfall-runoff response in three linear relationships according to differences in antecedent wetness conditions. We found differences in runoff responses under wet and dry antecedent conditions, but complex responses under medium antecedent conditions. The analyses of the inputs, the structural and the functional elements of the (dis)connectivity frameworks, were key in the understanding of the temporal changes of runoff, and its complex responses. Temporal coincidences of connectivity components and their feedbacks appear to be strongly associated with the runoff dynamics. High-magnitude hydrological responses occur with complete coincidences, while partial coincidences between the components reduce connectivity and low magnitude and/or heterogeneous responses prevail. Thus, these analyses suggest that runoff is controlled by (dis)connectivity in this basin with gentle slopes. Our work contributes to the understanding of the process of surface runoff in the context of humid flatlands under agricultural land use, by the identification of the complex combinations of factors which regulate/control the (dis)connectivity that helps to interpret the nonlinearities of runoff.

AB The partitioning of gross rainfall into throughfall, stemflow, and interception loss and their relationships with forest structure was studied for a period of four years (October 2002-September 2006) and two years (October 2005-September 2007) in seven experimental catchments of temperate rainforest ecosystems located in the Andes of south-central Chile (39 degrees 37'S, 600-925 m a.s.l.). The amount of throughfall, stemflow, and interception loss was correlated with forest structure characteristics such as basal area, canopy cover, mean quadratic diameter (MQD), and tree species characteristics in evergreen and deciduous forests. Annual rainfall ranged from 4061 to 5308 mm at 815 m a.s.l. and from 3453 to 4660 mm at 714 m a.s.l. Throughfall ranged from 64 to 89% of gross rainfall. Stemflow contributed 0.3-3.4% of net precipitation. Interception losses ranged from 11 to 36% of gross rainfall and depended on the amount of rainfall and characteristics as well as on forest structure, particularly the MQD. For evergreen forests, strong correlations were found between stemflow per tree and tree characteristics such as diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.92, P < 0.01) and crown projection area (R-2 = 0.65, P < 0.01). Stemflow per tree was also significantly correlated with epiphyte cover of trunks in the old-growth evergreen forests (R-2 = 0.29, P < 0.05). The difference in the proportion of throughfall and interception loss among stands was significant only during winter. The reported relationships between rainfall partitioning and forest structure and composition provide valuable information for management practices, which aimed at producing other ecosystem services in addition to timber in native rainforests of southern Chile.

AB Climate variability and change shift environmental conditions on global land surfaces, creating uncertainties in predicting hydrologic flows, crop yields, and land carbon uptake. Land surfaces can present varying degrees of inertia to atmospheric forcing variability (e.g., precipitation). This study asks: are regions with the most variable environmental forcing necessarily the regions with the largest land surface variability? Specifically, it seeks to determine why land surfaces show varying responsiveness to environmental forcing. The degree to which and the mechanisms for how landscapes modulate the forcing are evaluated using a decade-long satellite observation record of Africa's diverse climates. Surface responsiveness is quantified using intra-seasonal energy flux variability, based on the observed diurnal temperature amplitude. We map the responsiveness and analyze the underlying mechanisms over intra-seasonal timescales (especially interstorms). We show that, at a location, land surface responsiveness is dependent on the soil moisture distribution and the nonlinear relationship between energy fluxes and soil moisture. Land surfaces with greater responsiveness to climate are those with soil moisture distributions that span the threshold between evaporation regimes and spend most of their time in the water-limited regime. Consequently, surface responsiveness mechanisms drive land surface variability beyond high climatic variability. Since we find these results to hold from intra-seasonal to interannual timescales, we expect that these responsive regions will be most vulnerable to long-term shifts in climate forcing. The quantification of these phenomena and determination of their geographic distributions based on observations can help assess land surface models used to evaluate hydrologic consequences of climate change.

AB Mountains are a source of water for downstream areas; thus, it is important to understand the storage and discharge characteristics of steep mountain catchments. Nested catchment studies have indicated that the relation between catchment area and specific discharge during baseflow can represent mesoscale storage and discharge characteristics, but this is poorly understood. We found that baseflow-specific discharge increased with catchment size in the headwater of the Arakawa River and identified the processes responsible for this spatial pattern. Synoptic discharge measurements obtained in catchment areas of 0.05 to 93.58 km(2)showed that specific discharge increased more than threefold with increasing drainage area. Analyses of the spatial variation in precipitation, hydrographs from three continuous gauging stations, and isotopic tracers implied that in this catchment, considerable amounts of water infiltrated in bedrock on hillslopes and did not discharge into small streams, but instead fed surface flow into a larger downstream catchment. A review of previous nested studies demonstrated three spatial patterns for specific discharge: Specific discharge may increase or decrease with catchment area, or it may be independent of area. An increase in specific discharge with area was observed only in catchments with permeable bedrock, which implies that such an increase is a useful indicator of the importance of the bedrock flow path to mountain watershed storage. The pattern of relationships between catchment area and specific discharge can be used to assess the storage and discharge properties of mesoscale catchments when the processes driving each pattern have been clarified.

AB Many applications in urban areas require high-resolution rainfall measurements. Typical operational weather radars can provide rainfall intensities at 1-km(2) grid cells every 5min. Opportunistic sensing with commercial microwave links yields path-averaged rainfall intensities (typically 0.1-10km) within urban areas. Additionally, large amounts of urban in situ rainfall measurements from amateur weather observers are obtainable in real-time. The accuracy of these three techniques is evaluated for an urban study area of 20x20km, taking into account their respective network layouts and sampling characteristics. We use two simulated rainfall events described in terms of drop size distributions on a 100-m grid and with a temporal resolution of 30s. Accurate radar rainfall estimation with the Z-R relationship relies heavily on an appropriate choice of parameters, and a dual-polarization strategy is more suitable for higher intensities. Under ideal measurement conditions, the weather station network is the most promising, with a Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.86 and a relative bias below 4% for 100-m rainfall estimates at 5-min resolution. Microwave link rainfall observations contain the largest error, shown by a consistently larger coefficient of variation. The accuracy of all techniques improves when considering rainfall at larger scales, especially by increasing time intervals, with the strongest improvements found for microwave links for which errors are largely caused by their temporal sampling. Sparser networks are examined, showing that the decline in measurement accuracy only becomes significant when the link and station network density are reduced to less than half their levels in Amsterdam.

AB The response of hillslope processes to changes in precipitation may drive the observed changes in the solute geochemistry of rivers with discharge. This conjecture is most robust when variations in the key environmental factors that affect hillslope processes (e.g., lithology, erosion rate, and climate) are minimal across a river's catchment area. For rivers with heterogenous catchments, temporal variations in the relative contributions of different tributary subcatchments may modulate variations in solute geochemistry with runoff. In the absence of a dense network of hydrologic gauging stations, alternative approaches are required to distinguish between the different drivers of temporal variability in river solute concentrations. In this contribution, we apportion the water and solute fluxes of a reach of the Madre de Dios River (Peru) between its four major tributary subcatchments during two sampling campaigns (wet and dry seasons) using spatial variations in conservative tracers. Guided by the results of a mixing model, we identify temporal variations in solute concentrations of the main stem Madre de Dios that are due to changes in the relative contributions of each tributary. Our results suggest that variations in tributary mixing are, in part, responsible for the observed concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships. The implications of these results are further explored by reanalyzing previously published C-Q data from this region, developing a theoretical model of tributary mixing, and, in a companion paper, comparing the C-Q behavior of a suite of major and trace elements in the Madre de Dios River system.

AB Seasonal variability is a significant source of uncertainty in projected changes to precipitation across southeastern Australia (SEA). While existing instrumental records provide seasonal data for recent decades, most proxy records (e.g., tree rings, corals, speleothems) offer only annual reconstructions of hydroclimate. We present the first cool-season (July-August) reconstruction of dam inflow (Lake Burbury) for western Tasmania in SEA based on tree-ring width (Athrotaxis selaginoides) and mean latewood cell wall thickness (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius) chronologies. The reconstruction, produced using principal component regression, verifies back to 1731 and is moderately skillful, explaining around 23% of the variance. According to the reconstruction, relatively low inflow periods occurred around 1860, the early 1900s and 1970, while relatively high inflows occurred in the 1770s and 1810s. Highest reconstructed inflows occurred in 1816, and lowest in 1909. Comparison with available documentary and instrumental records indicates that the reconstruction better captures high rather than low flow events. There is virtually no correlation between our reconstruction and another for December-January inflow for the same catchment, a result consistent with the relationship between seasonal instrumental data. This suggests that conditions in one season have not generally reflected conditions in the other season over the instrumental record, or for the past 277 years. This illustrates the value of obtaining reconstructions of regional hydroclimatic variability for multiple individual seasons in regions where dry and wet seasons are not strongly defined. The results also indicate that the hydroclimate of the southeastern Australian region cannot be adequately represented by a single regional reconstruction.

AB Forests cover almost 40% of the seasonally snow-covered regions in North America. However, operational snow networks are located primarily in forest clearings, and optical remote sensing cannot see through tree canopies to detect forest snowpack. Due to the complex influence of the forest on snowpack duration, ground observations in forests are essential. We therefore consider the effectiveness of different strategies to observe snow-covered area under forests. At our study location in the Pacific Northwest, we simultaneously deployed fiber-optic cable, stand-alone ground temperature sensors, and time-lapse digital cameras in three diverse forest treatments: control second-growth forest, thinned forest, and forest gaps (one tree height in diameter). We derived fractional snow-covered area and snow duration metrics from the colocated instruments to assess optimal spatial resolution and sampling configuration, and snow duration differences between forest treatments. The fiber-optic cable and the cameras indicated that mean snow duration was 8 days longer in the gap plots than in the control plots (p<0.001). We conducted Monte Carlo experiments for observing mean snow duration in a 40 m forest plot, and found the 95% confidence interval was 5 days for 10 m spacing between instruments and 3 days for 6 m spacing. We further tested the representativeness of sampling one plot per treatment group by observing snow duration across replicated forest plots at the same elevation, and at a set of forest plots 250 m higher. Relative relationships between snow duration in the forest treatments are consistent between replicated plots, elevation, and two winters of data.

TI Participatory development of a Bayesian network model for
   catchment-based water resource management
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION-SUPPORT; DESIGN
AB A participatory approach was used to develop a Bayesian network model for assisting integration of water resource management in the Kongulai catchment in the Solomon Islands. This catchment provides 40-60% of the water for Honiara, the capital, and management is complex, with sparse data and many competing uses including drinking, domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses for both water and land in the catchment, as well as a range of threats from pollution, increasing population, changing land use, and variable hydrogeology. There are socioeconomic considerations including customary landownership and overlapping institutional responsibilities. A participatory process involving representative stakeholders of three main groups, the customary landowners, the government, and nongovernmental organizations, was central to analyzing the system and building trust in the model development process and model outcomes, and additionally facilitated relationship building between the different groups affecting, and affected by, the catchment. A conceptual model of the Kongulai system with respect to water was developed with all stakeholders. Further elicitation of quantitative aspects took place with a subset of water management professionals for development into a working Bayesian network model. Stakeholder representatives were then presented with the model, some analysis, and scenarios for discussion and feedback. The model provided a number of recommendations that support local management decision making, which were accepted by the wider stakeholder group. The process demonstrates the worth of a well-designed participatory approach to enhance stakeholder contributions and confirms the appropriateness of Bayesian networks for use in developing country contexts where capacity and data may be scarce.

AB It has long been assumed that over a sufficiently long period of time, changes in catchment water storage (Delta S) are a relatively minor term compared to other fluxes and can be neglected in the catchment water balance equation. However, the validity of this fundamental assumption has rarely been tested, and the associated uncertainties in water balance calculations remain unknown. Here, we use long-term (1982-2011) observations of monthly streamflow (Q) and precipitation (P) for 1,057 global unimpaired catchments, combined with four independent evapotranspiration (E) estimates to infer Delta S and to provide a global assessment of the steady-state assumption in catchment water balance calculations. Results show that when the threshold for steady state is set to 5% of the mean monthly P, similar to 70% of the catchments attain steady state within 10 years while similar to 6% of the catchments fail to reach a steady state even after 30 years. The time needed for a catchment to reach steady state (tau(s)) shows a close relationship with climatic aridity and vegetation coverage, with arid/semiarid and sparsely vegetated catchments generally having a longer tau(s). Additionally, increasing snowfall fraction also increases tau(s). The imbalance (e(wb)) caused by ignoring Delta Sdecreases as averaging period for water balance calculations increases as expected. For a typical 10-year averaging period,e(wb)accounts for similar to 7% of P in arid, but that decreases to similar to 3% ofPin humid catchments. These results suggest that catchment properties should be considered when applying the steady-state assumption and call for caution when ignoring Delta Sin arid/semiarid regions.

AB Using gridded daily rainfall observations, and monthly satellite land surface data sets, the connection between land use change and monsoonal rainfall climatology is analyzed. A combination of statistical analysis involving genetic algorithm (GA), empirical orthogonal function (EOF), and causal discovery algorithms (CDA) are used. Study objectives are (1) to identify regional trends in the observed precipitation data over the Indian summer monsoon region, (2) to investigate the relation between land use change/agriculture intensification and changes in rainfall, and (3) to explore whether land use change and agricultural intensification have caused change in the rainfall climatology. The satellite-based vegetation data set shows significant agricultural intensification over northern India. For the period just before start of the summer monsoon season (April and May), the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) shows an increase only over Peninsular India. The EOF- and GA-based analysis identified the strongest climatic signal for monsoon rainfall with an increasing trend over the east central regions of India and a decreasing trend in monsoon seasonal precipitation over north/northwest India. The areas of decreasing rainfall coincided with regions of agricultural intensive land use and are analyzed further. The correlation and the causal data analysis suggest that premonsoon (March-April) vegetation affects July month precipitation over peninsular India. In particular, a negative relationship exists between them. The results are more robust over peninsular and northern India indicating that an increase in NDVI has possibly weakened the early monsoon rainfall in this region. The results of this study suggest that land use change associated with agricultural intensification could be reducing the summer monsoon rainfall over certain regions of India.

AB [1] We describe the upscaled groundwater flow and solute transport characteristics of two-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields with three fundamentally different spatial textures and consider the conditions under which physical mobile-immobile domain mass transfer occurs in these fields. All three fields have near-identical lognormal univariate conductivity distributions, as well as near-identical isotropic spatial covariance functions. They differ in the pattern by which high- or low-conductivity regions are connected: the first field has connected high- conductivity structures; the second is multivariate log-Gaussian and, hence, has connected structures of intermediate value; and the third has connected regions of low conductivity. We find substantially different flow and transport behaviors in the three different fields. Flow and transport in the multivariate log-Gaussian field are consistent with stochastic theory. The field with connected high- conductivity paths has an effective conductivity greater than the geometric mean and large variations in fluid velocity. It produces significant mass transfer behavior (i.e., tailing) when the conductivity variance is large and, depending on the system parameters, this mass transfer is driven by either diffusion or advection. In the field with connected low-conductivity regions, the effective conductivity is below the geometric mean and transport is well characterized by the advection-dispersion model with a dispersivity smaller than that in the multivariate log-Gaussian field. Thus, physical mobile-immobile domain mass transfer may occur in smooth hydraulic conductivity fields with univariate log-Gaussian density functions if the variability in conductivity is sufficient and the high values are more connected than modeled by the multivariate log-Gaussian distribution.

ID HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; 2-EQUATION MODEL;
   DIFFUSION; EQUILIBRIUM; EQUATIONS
AB Two-region mass transfer models have been widely considered for describing flow and transport in highly heterogeneous porous media. Previous studies have indicated that in two-region systems the effective mass transfer coefficient is not a constant but depends upon a time convolution of the concentration history. Although such a representation does capture the mass transfer dynamics correctly, it can be difficult to apply because the convolution operation couples the effective mass transfer rate to the average concentration. In this work, we present the upscaling of a two-region system complete with a method for predicting the time-varying effective mass transfer coefficient that arises. We consider in detail the particular case that occurs when the convective flux in the low conductivity region can be neglected and the inclusions are spherical. This puts the problem in a classical context, and we develop explicit closed-form expressions for the time-varying effective mass transfer coefficient within the context of volume averaging. Our goals in this work are to (1) determine the general (convolution) form of the macroscale two-equation model for transport in such a medium using volume averaging, (2) assess the influence of several simplifications to the convolution form of the two-equation model, and (3) compare this result with existing classical results for the simplified geometry of spherical inclusions. A comparison of the results predicted by theory and experimental data from two macroscale, two-region systems is made. Additional discussion about how the method can be extended to other geometries and to cases where the convective flux is not negligible is also presented.

AB Estimating transpiration of the trees in agroforestry system is important in water management of the site. Sap flow of intercropped fast-growing young poplar trees and microclimate factors in semiarid northeastern China was measured in two growing seasons (2008 and 2009). Sapwood growth and water storage of wood and leaf increment during the growing season were involved in the calculation of sap flow. The results showed that diurnal variation of sap flow followed to that of short wave solar radiation. Sap flows both in 10?min mean and daily gross values mainly depended on solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit, and the relations well fit hyperbolic function. The regression coefficients of monthly window data indicated that the seasonal variation of sap flow capacities decreased gradually from June to September. Moderate soil water stress of upper soil layer (050?cm) did not constrain the sap flow because the trees could use the water at deeper soil layer. The daily sap flow per tree ranged 0.8 to 18.1 and 3.7 to 23.8?kg?d-1 tree-1, with averages of 8.7 and 14.3?kg?d-1 tree-1 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. An empirical model was established to estimate the sap flow of the poplar trees by solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, leaf area index and Julian days. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Most methods developed to represent water flow phenomena in an unconfined aquifer with a fully penetrated pumping well are either numerical, such as the well-known FEMWTER model, or experimental; analytical models of a partially penetrated pumping well are rare. This study employs the linearized Richards equation as the governing equation, with the aid of Fourier Integral Transformation, to obtain an analytical solution of the water content distribution in an unconfined aquifer with a partially penetrated pumping well. The results from this study could serve to substantiate in some sense results from numerical models. In addition, the theory developed herein can be modified to simulate a vacuum-pressured pumping well since it is derived by considering, among others, the location and length of a well screen with fluxes.

AB In mountains with seasonal snow cover, the effects of climate change on snowpack will be constrained by landscape-vegetation interactions with the atmosphere. Airborne lidar surveys used to estimate snow depth, topography, and vegetation were coupled with reanalysis climate products to quantify these interactions and to highlight potential snowpack sensitivities to climate and vegetation change across the western U.S. at Rocky Mountain (RM), Northern Basin and Range (NBR), and Sierra Nevada (SNV) sites. In forest and shrub areas, elevation captured the greatest amount of variability in snow depth (16-79%) but aspect explained more variability (11-40%) in alpine areas. Aspect was most important at RM sites where incoming shortwave to incoming net radiation (SW:NetR down arrow) was highest (similar to 0.5), capturing 17-37% of snow depth variability in forests and 32-37% in shrub areas. Forest vegetation height exhibited negative relationships with snow depth and explained 3-6% of its variability at sites with greater longwave inputs (NBR and SNV). Variability in the importance of physiography suggests differential sensitivities of snowpack to climate and vegetation change. The high SW:NetR down arrow and importance of aspect suggests RM sites may be more responsive to decreases in SW:NetR down arrow driven by warming or increases in humidity or cloud cover. Reduced canopy-cover could increase snow depths at SNV sites, and NBR and SNV sites are currently more sensitive to shifts from snow to rain. The consistent importance of aspect and elevation indicates that changes in SW:NetR down arrow and the elevation of the rain/snow transition zone could have widespread and varied effects on western U.S. snowpacks.

AB Observations indicate that groundwater levels are declining in many regions around the world. Simulating such depletion of groundwater at the global scale still remains a challenge because most global Land Surface Models (LSMs) lack the physical representation of groundwater dynamics in general and well pumping in particular. Here we present an integrated hydrologic model, which explicitly simulates groundwater dynamics and pumping within a global LSM that also accounts for human activities such as irrigation and reservoir operation. The model is used to simulate global water fluxes and storages with a particular focus on groundwater withdrawal and depletion in the High Plains Aquifer (HPA) and Central Valley Aquifer (CVA). Simulated global groundwater withdrawal and depletion for the year 2000 are 570 and 330 km(3) yr(-1), respectively; the depletion agrees better with observations than our previous model result without groundwater representation, but may still contain certain uncertainties and is on the higher side of other estimates. Groundwater withdrawals from the HPA and CVA are approximate to 22 and approximate to 9 km(3) yr(-1), respectively, which are also consistent with the observations of approximate to 24 and approximate to 13 km(3) yr(-1). The model simulates a significant decline in total terrestrial water storage in both regions as caused mainly by groundwater storage depletion. Groundwater table declined by approximate to 14 cm yr(-1) in the HPA during 2003-2010; the rate is even higher (approximate to 71 cm yr(-1)) in the CVA. These results demonstrate the potential of the developed model to study the dynamic relationship between human water use, groundwater storage, and the entire hydrologic cycle.

AB Work over the last decade has documented methods for estimating fluxes between streams and streambeds from time series of temperature at two depths in the streambed. We present substantial extension to the existing theory and practice of using temperature time series to estimate streambed water fluxes and thermal properties, including (1) a new explicit analytical solution to predict one-dimensional fluid velocity from amplitude and phase information; (2) an inverse function, also with explicit formulation; (3) methods to estimate fluid velocity from temperature measurements with unknown depths; (4) methods to estimate thermal diffusivity from the temperature time series when measurement depths are known; (5) methods to track streambed elevation between two sensors, given knowledge of the thermal diffusivity from (4) above; (6) methods to directly calculate the potential error in velocity estimates based on the measurement error characteristics; and (7) methods for validation of parameter estimates. We also provide discussion and theoretical insights developed from the solutions to better understand the physics and scaling of the propagation of the diurnal temperature variation through the streambed. In particular, we note that the equations developed do not replace existing equations applied to the analysis, rather they are new equations representing new aspects of the process, and, as a consequence, they increase the amount of information that can be derived from a particular set of thermal measurements.

AB We study the influence exerted by space-time rainfall patterns on the hydrologic response to determine the scales for which the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall may play a significant role in shaping the hydrographs generated in basins of varying characteristics. We perform numerical experiments using models based on the geomorphological theory of the hydrologic response, in which the spatial resolution of the input rainfall fields is coarse grained from 100 m to 50 km. The variation in the resulting hydrographs shows that rainfall spatial variability does not significantly influence the flood response for basin areas up to about 3500 km(2) in the cases considered, provided that the rainfall volume at each time interval is preserved. We then search for the physical interpretation of these results using the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to characterize differences in travel time distributions sampled by real and idealized disk-shaped rainfall patterns of different size. Because the total residence time of a water parcel is often controlled by the travel time within hillslopes, we find that when typical hillslope size is smaller than the characteristic size of rainfall structures (say, a correlation length of rainfall intensity), the rainfall pattern effectively samples all possible residence times and the response of the catchment does not depend on the specific rainfall pattern. In larger basins (say, typically larger than 10(3) km(2)) the travel time in the channels is expected to be an important part of the total residence time. In this case the response of a catchment will also be controlled by the specifics of the spatial distribution of rainfall.

AB The key to formulating a multi-objective reservoir operation scheme is coordinating the high/low priorities and achieving balance among various targets accordingly in the decision-making process. However, the traditional decision-making methods are either completely subjective or neglect the decision-maker's preferences, making it essential to optimize these methods to address such unsatisfactory aspects. Therefore, through drawing on some universally acknowledged economic theories and studying the geometric relationships among the Pareto solutions to such multi-objective decision-making problems, the concepts of "replacement rate", "profit-loss sensitivity ratio", and "preference equilibrium degree" are introduced, deduced, and elaborated on in this paper. On the basis of them, the preference decision method (PDM), entrusted with strict mathematical and physical connotations, is constructed and derived in detail, especially for addressing the bi-objective and tri-objective scenarios. The PDM can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among various targets, providing objective support for decision-makers in the subjective trade-offs of the interests of multiple subjects and achieving the unity of subjective and objective. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to the Wujiang cascade reservoirs in China, through which the benefits of power generation, water supply and ecological protection are enabled to be considered simultaneously. The application shows that the PDM can effectively shrink the Pareto set, which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision-making, and the obtained results prove feasible and satisfactory. In addition, the PDM is based entirely on the Pareto set itself, making it simple to utilize, and can be extended into solving other multi-objective decision-making problems.

AB Coastal aquifers are vulnerable to seawater intrusion due to excessive groundwater pumping. Most research on salinization vulnerability considers homogeneous aquifers, forming the basis of management guidance. However, geologic structure can be highly heterogeneous, with preferential flow paths and low-permeability barriers that complicate flow and salt transport processes under pumping conditions. Here we use a series of variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport models with geostatistical representations of heterogeneity to illustrate characteristics of vulnerability in heterogeneous and homogeneous aquifers. Simulations showed that in homogeneous aquifers, salinization patterns were simple and related only to the hydraulic properties. In heterogeneous aquifers, salinization rates and patterns were much more complicated, and related to pumping location and depth, aquifer geometry, and geologic connections between pumping location, landward boundaries, and saline groundwater. An intrusion configuration typology approach was developed for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers. The configuration approach was applied to heterogeneous aquifers of low, medium, and high geologic continuity, and vulnerability was assessed. The probability-based assessment was able to characterize the impact of pumping locations and rates in heterogeneous aquifers, considering different types of intrusion. The results showed that groundwater vulnerability to salinization was sensitive to pumping distance to the coastline for low-continuity aquifers and to pumping depth for high-continuity aquifers. The analysis provides new insights into the relationship between land-sea geologic connections and seawater intrusion vulnerability. The configuration approach plus probability-based assessment can be a starting point for large-scale aquifer characterization and more sophisticated groundwater management, including vulnerability assessment and optimization of pumping location, depth, and rate.

AB Recent progress in the understanding of soil microbial processes at micrometric scales has created a need for models that accurately predict the microscale distribution of water, and the location of air water interfaces in pores. Various models have been developed and used for these purposes, but how well they fare against real data has yet largely to be determined. In this context, for the first time, this article compares the prediction of two of these models to experimental data obtained on soil material. The distribution of water and air in soil samples constituted of repacked aggregates, equilibrated at three matric potentials (-0.5 kPa, -1 kPa and -2 kPa), was measured via synchrotron X-ray computed tomography at a resolution of 4.6 pm. Water distribution was simulated by a two-phase lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) and a morphological model (MOSAIC). Results indicate that, when one lifts the assumption, motivated by capillary theory, that a pore can drain only if a connecting pore is already full of air, MOSAIC gives an acceptable approximation of the observed air water interfaces. However, discretization of pores as geometrical primitives causes interfaces predicted by MOSAIC to have nonphysical shapes. By contrast, LBM is able to predict remarkably well the location of air water interfaces. Nevertheless, given the huge difference in computing time (minutes versus tens of hours) required to run these two models, it is recommended that further research be carried out on the development of both, in parallel.

AB Recent studies suggest that there is a strong linkage between the moisture uptake over the equatorial area of the Somali low level jet (SLLJ) and the rainfall variability over most of continental India. Additionally, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) strongly modulates the intraseasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, since the northward propagation of the boreal summer MJO is closely associated with the active and break phases of monsoon rainfall. But a question remains open: is there a relationship between the moisture transported by the SLLJ and the MJO evolution? In this paper, a Lagrangian approach is used to track the evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) evolution along trajectories of particles initially situated over the equatorial region of SLLJ. The impact of the MJO on the water budget transport of the SLLJ is examined by making composites of the obtained (E-P) fields for the different MJO phases. The spatial structures of the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation are revealed in our results, which strongly suggest that the main responsible for the rainfall variability associated to the MJO in these regions are the changes in the moisture advected by the SLLJ. In order to assess the MJO-SLLJ interaction, an analysis of the total-column mass and the total-column specific humidity transported by the SLLJ during the MJO life cycle is performed. While a systematic difference between air mass advected to India during active and break phases of MJO is not detected, changes in the moisture of particles are found, with wet (dry) anomalies over enhanced (suppressed) convection region. This result implicitly leads to assume air-sea interaction processes.

AB Two-phase flow in porous media is characterized by fluid fluid interfaces that separate fluid phases at the pore scale. These interfaces support pressure differences between phases, and their dynamics lead to changes in phase saturation within the porous medium. Dynamic pore-scale network models mathematically track the dynamic position of each fluid fluid interface through a pore network, based on imposed boundary conditions, fluid and solid properties, and geometric characteristics of the network. Because these models produce a detailed description of both phase and interface dynamics, results from these models can be volume-averaged to provide values for many upscaled variables. These include traditional variables such as saturation and macroscopic capillary pressure, as well as non-traditional variables such as amount of interfacial area in the averaging volume. With appropriate geometric definitions in the dynamic pore-scale model, a new algorithm may be included in the pore-scale network model to calculate a new variable: average interfacial velocity. This algorithm uses local information in any pore that contains a fluid fluid interface to estimate the velocity of that interface over a time step. Summation over all interfaces in the network provides a measure of average velocity. Computations for dynamic drainage experiments indicate that this average interfacial velocity is well defined and exhibits distinct behavior for stable and unstable displacements. Comparison of calculated interfacial velocities to a theoretical conjecture on the functional dependence of this macroscopic variable demonstrates another important use of pore-scale model, namely testing of new theories involving non-traditional variables.

AB Severe floods in August 2005 in Switzerland were associated with enormous morphologic changes along the stream channels and with large sediment transport, including many debris flows in the headwater catchments and fluvial bedload transport along the mountain rivers. We compiled data on transported sediment volumes and estimated surface runoff volumes in the streams determined from radar-based rainfall data and stream gauge measurements lower in the catchments. A quantitative analysis of the data shows that the transported bedload volumes are related to the flood runoff volume and the relevant channel gradient. For channel gradients flatter than about 5%, our data agree with a simplified version of the Meyer-Peter and Muller equation but two other equations tested tend to under predict bedload volumes. For channel gradients steeper than about 5%, the observed sediment volumes transported by fluvial processes are over predicted by all bedload transport equations tested, though two of them were specifically developed for this slope range, which likely results from non-accounted energy losses and supply limitation. For events with debris flows as the dominant sediment transfer mechanism, sediment volumes show a large variability for given flood runoff volume and channel gradient. The sediment volumes of the torrent catchments show a similar functional dependence on catchment parameters as for two empirical power law equations for the estimation of a 'design' event magnitude of debris flows based on data from Northern Italy but our events are associated with a much smaller coefficient. Finally, the majority of our debris-flow data is in line with the trend defined by our fluvial transport events, indicating a continuous transition to debris-flood and debris-flow conditions.

AB Few studies have reported runoff from small agricultural watersheds over sufficiently long period so that the effect of different cover types on runoff can be examined. We analyzed 45-yrs of monthly and annual rainfall-runoff characteristics of a small (7.8 ha) zero-order typical Southern Piedmont watershed in southeastern United States. Agricultural land use varied as follows: 1. Row cropping (5-yrs); 2. Kudzu (Pueraria lobata; 5-yrs); 3. Grazed kudzu and rescuegrass (Bromus catharticus; 7-yrs); and 4. Grazed bermudagrass and winter annuals (Cynodon dactylon; 28-yrs). Land use and rainfall variability influenced runoff characteristics. Row cropping produced the largest runoff amount, percentage of the rainfall partitioned into runoff, and peak flow rates. Kudzu reduced spring runoff and almost eliminated summer runoff, as did a mixture of kudzu and rescuegrass (KR) compared to row cropping. Peak flow rates were also reduced during the kudzu and KR. Peak flow rates increased under bermudagrass but were lower than during row cropping. A simple process-based 'tanh' model modified to take the previous month's rainfall into account produced monthly rainfall and runoff correlations with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.74. The model was tested on independent data collected during drought. Mean monthly runoff was 1.65 times the observed runoff. Sustained hydrologic monitoring is essential to understanding long-term rainfall-runoff relationships in agricultural watersheds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many hyporheic papers state that the hyporheic zone is a critical component of stream ecosystems, and many of these papers focus on the biogeochemical effects of the hyporheic zone on stream solute loads. However, efforts to show such relationships have proven elusive, prompting several questions: Are the effects of the hyporheic zone on stream ecosystems so highly variable in place and time (or among streams) that a consistent relationship should not be expected? Or, is the hyporheic zone less important in stream ecosystems than is commonly expected? These questions were examined using data from existing groundwater modelling studies of hyporheic exchange flow at five sites in a fifth-order, mountainous stream network. The size of exchange flows, relative to stream discharge (Q(HEF) : Q), was large only in very small streams at low discharge (area approximate to 100 ha; Q < 10 l/s). At higher flows (flow exceedance probability > 0.7) and in all larger streams, QHEF : Q was small. These data show that biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone of small streams can substantially influence the stream's solute load, but these processes become hydrologically constrained at high discharge or in larger streams and rivers. The hyporheic zone may influence stream ecosystems in many ways, however, not just through biogeochemical processes that alter stream solute loads. For example, the hyporheic zone represents a unique habitat for some organisms, with patterns and amounts of upwelling and downwelling water determining the underlying physiochemical environment of the hyporheic zone. Similarly, hyporheic exchange creates distinct patches of downwelling and upwelling. Upwelling environments are of special interest, because upwelling water has the potential to be thermally or chemically distinct from stream water. Consequently, micro-environmental patches created by hyporheic exchange flows are likely to be important to biological and ecosystem processes, even if their impact on stream solute loads is small.

AB Bedload is notoriously challenging to measure and model; its dynamics, therefore, remains largely unknown in most fluvial systems worldwide. We present results from a global scale bedload flux model as part of the WBMsed modeling framework that well predict the distribution of water discharge, suspended sediment and bedload. The sensitivity of bedload predictions to river slope, particle size, discharge, river width, and suspended sediment were analyzed, showing the model to be most responsive to spatial dynamics in river discharge and slope. The relationship between bedload and total sediment flux is analyzed globally, and for representative longitudinal river profiles (Amazon, Mississippi, and Lena Rivers). The results show that while the proportion of bedload decreases from headwaters to the coasts, there is considerable variability between basins and along river corridors. The topographic and hydrological longitudinal profiles of rivers are shown to be the key drivers of bedload trends, with fluctuations in slope controlling its more local dynamics. Estimates of water and sediment fluxes to global oceans from 2,067 largest river outlets (draining 67% of the global continental area) are provided. Estimated water discharge at 30,579 km(3)/y corresponds well to past estimates; however, sediment flux is higher. Total global particulate load of 17.8 Gt/y is delivered to global oceans, 14.8 Gt/y as washload, 1.1 Gt/y as bedload, and 2.6 Gt/y as suspended bed material. The largest 25 rivers are predicted to transport more than half of the total sediment flux to global oceans.

AB Elevated nutrient inputs challenge the health and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. To improve riverine water quality management, it is necessary to understand the underlying biogeochemical and physical processes, anthropogenic drivers and their interactions at catchment scale. We hypothesize that the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient sources dominantly controls the variability of in-stream concentration dynamics among catchments. We investigated controls of mean nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43-), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in 787 German catchments of a newly assembled data base, covering a wide range of physiographic and anthropogenic settings. We linked water quality metrics to catchment characteristics using partial least squares regressions and random forests. We found archetypal C-Q patterns with enrichment dominating NO3- and TOC, and dilution dominating PO43- export. Both the mean NO3- concentrations and their variance among sites increased with agricultural land use. We argue that subsurface denitrification can buffer high nitrogen inputs and cause a decline in concentration with depth, resulting in chemodynamic, strongly positive C-Q patterns. Mean PO43- concentrations were related to point sources, though the low predictive power suggests effects of unaccounted in-stream processes. In contrast, high diffuse agricultural inputs explained observed positive PO43- C-Q patterns. TOC levels were positively linked to the abundance of riparian wetlands, while hydrological descriptors were important for explaining TOC dynamics. Our study shows a strong modulation of anthropogenic inputs by natural controls for NO3- and PO43- concentrations and dynamics, while for TOC only natural controls dominate observed patterns across Germany.

AB The direct flow simulation using high-resolution micro-computed tomographic (mu-CT) images of porous rock can be used to help understand the flow characteristics at the pore-scale and to estimate fluid properties; however, segmentation of pore space in grayscale 3-D mu-CT images, a necessary step in this process, is challenging because of issues related to the image resolution and pore-filling matrix in the gray-level images. We present a novel process for determining the voxel porosity and permeability of the gray-level regime and evaluating the bulk permeability using the Brinkman force lattice Boltzmann method. In this study, mu-CT images of Berea sandstone are acquired with two spatial resolutions. After the pore size distribution curve is experimentally obtained, the apparent pore voxels and gray pore voxels are determined based on the designated gray-level values in the gray-level (CT number) histogram, the cumulative and fractional pore volumes, and the linear relationship between CT number and individual voxel porosity. The results show that the boundary between apparent and gray pores in terms of size determines the volumetric fraction and specific surface area. Additionally, the permeability computed by considering the gray pore regime based on the proposed method is more similar to the experimentally measured value than the results of other segmentation methods because the gray pore domain is fully incorporated into the flow domain while preserving the pore connectivity. The proposed sequence of pore segmentation presents a method for handling gray-level pore space without compromising pore connectivity.

AB To investigate the relationship between hydraulics and channel morphology in step-pool channels, we combined three-dimensional velocity measurements with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter and topographic surveys in a steep step-pool channel, the Rio Cordon, Italy. Measurements were organized around step, pool, and tread units and occurred within a range of 36%-57% of bankfull discharges. As flow moved from steps to their downstream pools in our study reach, an average of approximately two thirds of the total energy was dissipated, as measured by relative head loss through step-pool sequences. Much of this head loss was achieved by elevation (potential energy) loss rather than velocity reductions. Although an overall, expected pattern of flow acceleration toward step crests and deceleration in pools was present, pool velocities were high, especially where upstream step crests were irregular and where residual pool depths were low. Many steps were porous or "leaky," with irregular cross-channel bed and water surface topography, producing high-velocity jets and less flow resistance than channel-spanning dammed steps. Longitudinal variations in hydraulics are thus often overshadowed by lateral variations arising from morphologic complexities. Velocity and turbulence characteristics in the Rio Cordon show marked differences from data we have collected in a more stable and wood-rich channel in the Colorado Rockies, in which "ponded" steps are more prevalent and pools are slower and more turbulent. Comparison of these channels illustrates that step-pool structure and hydraulics are strongly influenced by flow regime, sediment supply, lithology, time since the last step-forming flood, and availability of in-stream wood.

ID CONDUCTIVITY; INVERSION; SMOOTH
AB We explored the use of continuous waterborne electrical imaging (CWEI), in conjunction with fiber-optic distributed temperature sensor (FO-DTS) monitoring, to improve the conceptual model for uranium transport within the Columbia River corridor at the Hanford 300 Area, Washington. We first inverted resistivity and induced polarization CWEI data sets for distributions of electrical resistivity and polarizability, from which the spatial complexity of the primary hydrogeologic units was reconstructed. Variations in the depth to the interface between the overlying coarse-grained, high-permeability Hanford Formation and the underlying finer-grained, less permeable Ringold Formation, an important contact that limits vertical migration of contaminants, were resolved along similar to 3 km of the river corridor centered on the 300 Area. Polarizability images were translated into lithologic images using established relationships between polarizability and surface area normalized to pore volume (S-por). The FO-DTS data recorded along 1.5 km of cable with a 1 m spatial resolution and 5 min sampling interval revealed subreaches showing (1) temperature anomalies (relatively warm in winter and cool in summer) and (2) a strong correlation between temperature and river stage (negative in winter and positive in summer), both indicative of reaches of enhanced surface water-groundwater exchange. The FO-DTS data sets confirm the hydrologic significance of the variability identified in the CWEI and reveal a pattern of highly focused exchange, concentrated at springs where the Hanford Formation is thickest. Our findings illustrate how the combination of CWEI and FO-DTS technologies can characterize surface water-groundwater exchange in a complex, coupled river-aquifer system.

DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; SITE; MODELS
AB The integration of geophysical data into the subsurface characterization problem has been shown in many cases to significantly improve hydrological knowledge by providing information at spatial scales and locations that is unattainable using conventional hydrological measurement techniques. The investigation of exactly how much benefit can be brought by geophysical data in terms of its effect on hydrological predictions, however, has received considerably less attention in the literature. Here, we examine the potential hydrological benefits brought by a recently introduced simulated annealing (SA) conditional stochastic simulation method designed for the assimilation of diverse hydrogeophysical data sets. We consider the specific case of integrating crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and borehole porosity log data to characterize the porosity distribution in saturated heterogeneous aquifers. In many cases, porosity is linked to hydraulic conductivity and thus to flow and transport behavior. To perform our evaluation, we first generate a number of synthetic porosity fields exhibiting varying degrees of spatial continuity and structural complexity. Next, we simulate the collection of crosshole GPR data between several boreholes in these fields, and the collection of porosity log data at the borehole locations. The inverted GPR data, together with the porosity logs, are then used to reconstruct the porosity field using the SA-based method, along with a number of other more elementary approaches. Assuming that the grid-cell-scale relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity is unique and known, the porosity realizations are then used in groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations to assess the benefits and limitations of the different approaches.

   FLOW; EQUIVALENT PERMEABILITY; 1ST-ORDER APPROXIMATION; SIMULATION;
   SOILS
AB In this paper we propose an analytical form for the upscaled coefficient applicable to the nonlinear Richards' equation. Block inclusions are symmetrically centered in a grid cell, and flow is dominated by capillary forces on the small scale. The nonlinear boundary value problems can be defined in a three-dimensional bounded domain, with a periodic and rapidly oscillating saturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient. The new result is derived by applying a corrector to an analytical approximation of the well-known cell problem obtained by the two-scale asymptotic expansion to the original heterogeneous nonlinear problem. The previously known analytical results for the upscaled coefficient, including the geometric average for the checkerboard geometry, can be regarded as particular cases of this new form. We perform numerical simulations to obtain the error between the fine-scale solution and the upscaled solution, respectively, as well as convergence properties of the approximation, corroborating results in the literature. There is no limitation regarding either the ratio of permeability between the matrix and inclusion or its shape for both computing the upscaled coefficient and obtaining the upscaled equation. This is illustrated by the comparison with known results and by numerically demonstrating convergence properties with a medium having square and circular inclusions in a main matrix with heterogeneity ratio of 1:100 and 1:10. Even though the derivation and applications are presented for single phase and steady state, the results are valid for multiphase and transient flow conditions. We also show that the approximation is independent of the relative saturated hydraulic relationship.

AB A data assimilation framework was implemented with the objective of obtaining high-resolution retrospective snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates over several Andean study basins. The framework integrates Landsat fractional snow covered area (fSCA) images, a land surface and snow depletion model, and the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis as a forcing data set. The outputs are SWE and fSCA fields (1985-2015) at a resolution of 90 m that are consistent with the observed depletion record. Verification using in-situ snow surveys showed significant improvements in the accuracy of the SWE estimates relative to forward model estimates, with increases in correlation (0.49-0.87) and reductions in root mean square error (0.316 m to 0.129 m) and mean error (20.221 m to 0.009 m). A sensitivity analysis showed that the framework is robust to variations in physiography, fSCA data availability and a priori precipitation biases. Results from the application to the headwater basin of the Aconcagua River showed how the forward model versus the fSCA-conditioned estimate resulted in different quantifications of the relationship between runoff and SWE, and different correlation patterns between pixel-wise SWE and ENSO. The illustrative results confirm the influence that ENSO has on snow accumulation for Andean basins draining into the Pacific, with ENSO explaining approximately 25% of the variability in near-peak (1 September) SWE values. Our results show how the assimilation of fSCA data results in a significant improvement upon MERRA-forced modeled SWE estimates, further increasing the utility of the MERRA data for high-resolution snow modeling applications.

TI An exact solution for a constant-strength line-sink satisfying the

AB We obtained an exact solution in terms of the discharge potential for a constant-strength line-sink that satisfies the modified Helmholtz equation for groundwater flow, for example for semi-confined flow and transient flow. The solution is obtained by integrating the potential for a point sink (well) along a straight line element. The potential for the point-sink is the modified Bessel function of the second kind and zero order K-0. Since K-0 cannot be integrated directly (in closed form) along a line-element, earlier solutions for a line-sink have been obtained by integrating polynomial approximations to K-0. These approximations, however, are only valid up to a certain distance from the well and consequently impose a limit on the length of the line-sink. In this paper we integrate an exact series representation for K-0 that is valid at any distance from the well, thus allowing integration along line-elements of any length, at least in theory. Numerical difficulties arise when evaluating our expressions at large distances from the line-sink, but these are shown to be of little consequence in practice. We made use of Wirtinger calculus to facilitate integration and also to allow us to arrive at exact expressions for the integrated flux over a poly-line and the total leakage over a domain. These properties are essential when using the solution in the context of the Analytic Element Method (AEM). We demonstrate our solution for the case of semi-confined flow (with leakage) and for the case of transient flow in the context of the Laplace Transform Analytic Element Method (LT-AEM).

AB Saline water evaporation from porous media is important in many processes such as soil salinization, CO2 sequestration, crop production and water management. This process is influenced by the transport properties of porous media, properties of the evaporating solution and external conditions. In this work, we investigated the effects of external conditions and type of salt on the drying behaviour of sandy media and on the dynamics of surface salt precipitation. To do so, a comprehensive series of evaporation experiments were conducted using 33 columns packed with sand saturated with salt solutions. The evaporation experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber to investigate the effects of relative humidity, ambient temperature and type of salt on the evaporation process. Sodium Chloride, Calcium Chloride and Potassium Iodide with a wide range of concentration were used to saturate the sand columns mounted on digital balances. A digital camera was fixed at the surface of the sand packs to record the dynamics of salt precipitation at the surface. The results provide further confirmation that ambient conditions are the controlling factors during stage-1 evaporation of pure water. Additionally, the minor impact of the presence of precipitated salt at the surface on the saline water evaporation during the early stages of the process is discussed. Strong correlations between the cumulative water losses and the precipitation at the surface were found under different ambient conditions. The results obtained from different types of salt highlight the significant influence of the relationship between the saturated vapour pressure and salt concentration on the general dynamics of the process.

AB A new set of constitutive equations describing the transport of the ions and water through charged porous media and considering the effect of ion filtration is applied to the problem of reverse osmosis and diffusion of a salt. Starting with the constitutive equations derived in Paper 1, I first determine specific formula for the osmotic coefficient and effective diffusion coefficient of a binary symmetric 1:1 salt (such as KCI or NaCI) as a function of a dimensionless number 8 corresponding to the ratio between the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the salinity. The modeling is first carried with the Donnan model used to describe the concentrations of the charge carriers in the pore water phase. Then a new model is developed in the thin double layer approximation to determine these concentrations. These models provide explicit relationships between the concentration of the ionic species in the pore space and those in a neutral reservoir in local equilibrium with the pore space and the CEC. The case of reverse osmosis and diffusion coefficient are analyzed in details for the case of saturated and partially saturated porous materials. Comparisons are done with experimental data from the literature obtained on bentonite. The model predicts correctly the influence of salinity (including membrane behavior at high salinities), porosity, cation type (K+ versus Na+), and water saturation on the osmotic coefficient. It also correctly predicts the dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the salt with the salinity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISTRIBUTIONS; RESOURCES; SCARCITY; MODELS
AB Simple analytical storage-reliability-yield relationships have traditionally only considered a single reliability for a single yield, yet many reservoirs supply water of different priorities. Simulation models may be used to handle such multiple-priority water rights but these models are complex and usually system specific. Here we propose a simple analytical method based on Gould-Dincer to estimate yields in dual and triple priority allocation systems from a carryover storage. This allows rapid assessment of changes in water resource availability for different water priorities, potentially over large spatial scales. We use a dam simulation model to assess this method at 15 sites across six continents and find that the "dual-priority " and "triple-priority " G-D methods can reproduce the results of the dam simulation model. Thus, the method could be generalized for multiple priority allocation systems use. We demonstrate the potential utility of the "dual-priority " G-D method through an evaluation of the optimum yield between high and low-priority water rights (HPWR and LPWR) from hypothetical (but realistic) carryover systems. It confirms the possibility that "dual-priority " water allocation may be beneficial overall compared to a single-priority water right. By balancing the yield of HPWR and LPWR, the optimum marginal value of available water (i.e., sum of high- and low-priority water) can be achieved. Overall, the method provides a simple way for rapid assessment across multiple sites allowing insights into optimal allocation practices and the interacting driving factors that affect them at a regional-to-global scale.

AB Understanding and predicting bedload transport is an important element of watershed management. Yet, predictions of bedload remain uncertain by up to several order(s) of magnitude. In this contribution, we use a 5-year continuous time series of streamflow and bedload transport monitoring in a 13.4-km(2) snow-dominated Alpine watershed in the Western Swiss Alps to investigate hydrological drivers of bedload transport. Following a calibration of the bedload sensors, and a quantification of the hydraulic forcing of streamflow upon bedload, a hydrological analysis is performed to identify daily flow hydrographs influenced by different hydrological drivers: rainfall, snowmelt, and combined rain and snowmelt events. We then quantify their respective contribution to bedload transport. Results emphasize the importance of combined rain and snowmelt events, for both annual bedload volumes (77% on average) and peaks in bedload transport rate. A non-negligible, but smaller, amount of bedload transport may occur during late summer and autumn storms, once the snowmelt contribution and baseflow have significantly decreased (9% of the annual volume on average). Although rainfall-driven changes in flow hydrographs are responsible for a large majority of the annual bedload volumes (86% on average), the identified melt-only events also represent a substantial contribution (14% on average). The results of this study help to improve current predictions of bedload transport through a better understanding of the bedload magnitude-frequency relationship under different hydrological conditions. We further discuss how bedload transport could evolve under a changing climate through its effects on Alpine watershed hydrology.

AB This paper is motivated to understand the multi-temporal scale characteristics of Horton Index (HI), an indicator of catchment-scale plant water use defined as the ratio of catchment vaporization (total evapotranspiration) to catchment wetting (precipitation minus surface runoff). Based on the generalized proportionality hypothesis, we first develop an analytical framework of HI applicable at multi-temporal scales as a single function of ecological aridity index (EAI), defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to catchment wetting. We successfully validate this framework at the long-term, annual, and monthly scales at 343 natural catchments over the conterminous United States under varying climate and vegetation regimes. We show that vegetation plays an important role in regulating not only the partitioning of catchment wetting into vertical vaporization and horizontal baseflow, but also further partitioning of vaporization into initial and continuing components. Aided by this framework, we reveal emergent space-time similarity patterns between HI's spatial (inter-catchment, regional) and temporal (within-catchment, inter and intra-annual) variability. On the one hand, HI increases with EAI, both spatially and temporally, following similar trends predicted by the analytical framework. On the other hand, the slopes of HI similar to EAI relationships, denoted as d (HI)/d (EAI), decreased with EAI both spatially and temporally and, again, following similar trends suggested by the analytical framework. These findings suggest the promising potential of Horton Index as a conceptual yet quantitative framework for improving understanding and modeling of multi-scale ecological and hydrological processes and their interactions.

AB There is an increasing demand for reliable methods to measure soil loss in order to get a better understanding of sediment movement and to develop process-based sediment transport models. This study described the design, calibration, and practical application of an instrumented technique that automatically characterized surface flow in situ fields. The instrument consisted of a sampling assembly, a measuring assembly, and a management platform. The special design combined with a volume-mass conversion relationship was used to determine the exact volume and mass of the sediment-laden water, thereby allowing the implementation of real-time measurement and synchronous calculation of runoff rate and sediment concentration. Calibration results showed that normal distributions and an average error of -3.67% were obtained for the target sediment concentrations of 2-1,000 g/L. Compared with the gravimetric method, the average error of the new technique for sediment concentration was 4.82%, and the highest precision was 98.50%. The high repeatability and accuracy of the technique suggest that it can be used with confidence to give satisfactory results in fields. A field experiment under natural rainfall showed that a grass-covered plot had 18.94% less runoff rate and 42.92% lower sediment concentration than a bare soil plot, illustrating the impact of vegetation cover on reducing soil loss. This uniquely designed instrument provides a new approach to real-time sediment detection in surface flow. It will be beneficial for rigorously evaluating runoff and sedimentation and for in-depth research regarding water and soil loss processes.

AB Most field-based approaches that address runoff generation questions have been conducted in steep landscapes with shallow soils. Runoff generation processes in low relief landscapes with deep soils remain less understood. We addressed this by characterizing dominant runoff generating flow paths by monitoring the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, shallow soil moisture, and shallow and deep groundwater dynamics in a 3.3 ha ephemeral-to-intermittent drainage network in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA. This Piedmont region is gently sloped with highly weathered soils characterized by shallow impeding layers due to decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth. Our results indicated two dominant catchment storage states driven by seasonal evapotranspiration. Within these states, distinct flow paths were activated, resulting in divergent hydrograph recessions. Groundwater dynamics during precipitation events with different input characteristics and contrasting storage states showed distinct shallow and deep groundwater flow path behavior could produce similar runoff magnitudes. During an event with low antecedent storage, activation of a shallow, perched, transient water table dominated runoff production. During an event with high antecedent storage, the deeper water table activated shallow flow paths by rising into the shallow transmissive soil horizons. Despite these differing processes, the relationship between active surface drainage length (ASDL) and runoff was consistent. Hysteretic behavior between ASDL and runoff suggested that while seasonal ASDLs can be predicted based on runoff, the mechanisms and source areas producing flow can be highly variable and not easily estimated from runoff alone. These processes and flow paths have significant implications for stream chemistry across seasons and storage states.

AB Uneven distribution of rainfall and freshwater scarcity in populated areas in the Island of Maui, Hawaii, renders water resources management a challenge in this complex and ill-defined hydrological system. A previous study in the Galapagos Islands suggests that noble gas temperatures (NGTs) record seasonality in that fractured, rapid infiltration groundwater system rather than the commonly observed mean annual air temperature (MAAT) in sedimentary systems where infiltration is slower thus, providing information on recharge sources and potential flow paths. Here we report noble gas results from the basal aquifer, springs, and rainwater in Maui to explore the potential for noble gases in characterizing this type of complex fractured hydrologic systems. Most samples display a mass-dependent depletion pattern with respect to surface conditions consistent with previous observations both in the Galapagos Islands and Michigan rainwater. Basal aquifer and rainwater noble gas patterns are similar and suggest direct, fast recharge from precipitation to the basal aquifer. In contrast, multiple springs, representative of perched aquifers, display highly variable noble gas concentrations suggesting recharge from a variety of sources. The distinct noble gas patterns for the basal aquifer and springs suggest that basal and perched aquifers are separate entities. Maui rainwater displays high apparent NGTs, incompatible with surface conditions, pointing either to an origin at high altitudes with the presence of ice or an ice-like source of undetermined origin. Overall, noble gas signatures in Maui reflect the source of recharge rather than the expected altitude/temperature relationship commonly observed in sedimentary systems.

AB Relating watershed structure to streamflow generation is a primary focus of hydrology. However, comparisons of longitudinal variability in stream discharge with adjacent valley structure have been rare, resulting in poor understanding of the distribution of the hydrologic mechanisms that cause variability in streamflow generation along valleys. This study explores detailed surveys of stream base flow across a gauged, 23 km(2) mountain watershed. Research objectives were (1) to relate spatial variability in base flow to fundamental elements of watershed structure, primarily topographic contributing area, and (2) to assess temporal changes in the spatial patterns of those relationships during a seasonal base flow recession. We analyzed spatiotemporal variability in base flow using (1) summer hydrographs at the study watershed outlet and 5 subwatershed outlets and (2) longitudinal series of discharge measurements every similar to 100 m along the streams of the 3 largest subwatersheds (1200 to 2600 m in valley length), repeated 2 to 3 times during base flow recession. Reaches within valley segments of 300 to 1200 m in length tended to demonstrate similar streamflow generation characteristics. Locations of transitions between these segments were consistent throughout the recession, and tended to be collocated with abrupt longitudinal transitions in valley slope or hillslope-riparian characteristics. Both within and among subwatersheds, correlation between the spatial distributions of streamflow and topographic contributing area decreased during the recession, suggesting a general decrease in the influence of topography on stream base flow contributions. As topographic controls on base flow evidently decreased, multiple aspects of subsurface structure were likely to have gained influence.

AB We examined the relationships between large wood (LW) export and precipitation patterns and intensity by analyzing the data on the annual volume of LW removed from 42 reservoirs and the daily precipitation at or near the reservoir sites. We also calculated the effective precipitation by considering the antecedent precipitation. Both daily and effective precipitation data were used as explanatory variables to explain LW export. The model selection revealed that the precipitation pattern and intensity controlling LW export varied with latitude in the Japanese archipelago. In small watersheds with narrow channel widths and low discharges, mass movements, such as landslides and debris flows, are major factors in the production and transport of LW. In this case, the effective precipitation required to initiate mass movements regulated the LW export and did not vary with the latitude. In intermediate and large watersheds with wide channel widths and high stream discharges, heavy rainfall and subsequent floods regulated buoyant depth, influencing the initiation of LW movement. In southern and central Japan, intense rainfall accompanied by typhoons or localized torrential downpours causes geomorphic disturbances, which introduce abundant pieces of LW into the channels. However, these pieces continue to be removed by repeated rainfall events. Therefore, LW export is supply-limited and potentially produces less LW accumulation. Conversely, in northern Japan, where typhoons and torrential downpours are rare, LW export is transport-limited because LW pieces recruited by bank erosion, tree mortality, and windthrow accumulate and persist on valley floors. These pieces may be easily exported by infrequent flooding.

AB [1] Unit hydrograph theory as derived by Nash (1957), Dooge (1959), and Wooding (1965) provides a foundation for evaluating the function controlling catchment runoff. Past literature has often investigated this function converting catchment storage to runoff with probabilistic or statistical approaches. A geophysically based framework is missing. The objective of the research reported here is to evaluate this function explicitly, using empirical nested measurements of surface storage and runoff in a Canadian Prairie catchment during the 2006 spring snowmelt. Variation in the value of this function, K at the basin scale, or k at the sub-basin scale, was found to embody the hydrological processes acting upon a catchment. It is the relative difference between the runoff rate and the change in storage that indicates the hydrological function of a sub-basin, and k is indicative of the efficiency of this functioning. Field results show that previous assumptions of instantaneously responding reservoirs within catchments are not applicable in this landscape. Storage thresholds control the value of the transfer function by influencing when runoff production occurs. In doing so, storage thresholds play a crucial role in the efficiency with which a catchment can transfer water to its outlet. The transfer function and storage threshold, by dictating runoff, can be considered hydrological signatures. Applying these signatures within a geophysically based framework has proven to be successful in predicting the efficiency of runoff production in this particular catchment and is proposed as an approach to evaluate the interrelationships between catchment stores and runoff production. Furthermore, if hydrological processes or physioclimatic predictors can be related to these hydrological signatures in a dimensionally consistent framework, this framework could be tested as a bridging mechanism between hydrological processes at the sub-basin scale and prediction of runoff at the basin scale.

ID SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Compound rating curves are often encountered in hydrology. The purpose of today's standard hydrometric practice is primarily to find the segmentation limits through subjective analysis. It is difficult to control the quality of rating curves whose design is based on personal judgment. This paper presents a method for objective segmentation in two-segmental situations based on the Heaviside function and a non-linear regression where the intersection between segments is a constraint. Variable projection methods are applied in order to simplify the modelling process. Besides finding the most likely phase-shift, the model also estimates all rating curve parameters while factoring in additional approximated uncertainty. The Likelihood Ratio test, the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are applied in order to select the appropriate model. The proposed model is applied on real measurement data from a Norwegian gauging station. The practical case study and complementary studies using other datasets from Norway and Canada reveal that implementing the proposed model leads to numerical challenges and inferential difficulties regarding the point of cut-off/intersection. These are caused by non-regularity and multimodality in the log-likelihood function. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climatic variability and forest disturbance are commonly recognized as two major drivers influencing streamflow change in large-scale forested watersheds. The greatest challenge in evaluating quantitative hydrological effects of forest disturbance is the removal of climatic effect on hydrology. In this paper, a method was designed to quantify respective contributions of large-scale forest disturbance and climatic variability on streamflow using the Willow River watershed (2860 km(2)) located in the central part of British Columbia, Canada. Long-term (>50 years) data on hydrology, climate, and timber harvesting history represented by equivalent clear-cutting area (ECA) were available to discern climatic and forestry influences on streamflow by three steps. First, effective precipitation, an integrated climatic index, was generated by subtracting evapotranspiration from precipitation. Second, modified double mass curves were developed by plotting accumulated annual streamflow against annual effective precipitation, which presented a much clearer picture of the cumulative effects of forest disturbance on streamflow following removal of climatic influence. The average annual streamflow changes that were attributed to forest disturbances and climatic variability were then estimated to be +58.7 and -72.4 mm, respectively. The positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing) values in streamflow change indicated opposite change directions, which suggest an offsetting effect between forest disturbance and climatic variability in the study watershed. Finally, a multivariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was generated to establish quantitative relationships between accumulated annual streamflow deviation attributed to forest disturbances and annual ECA. The model was then used to project streamflow change under various timber harvesting scenarios. The methodology can be effectively applied to any large-scale single watershed where long-term data (>50 years) are available.

AB This study investigated the effect of cumulative overland flow on rill erodibility and critical shear stress on native surface roads in central Idaho. Rill erodibility decreased exponentially with increasing cumulative overland flow depth; however, critical shear stress did not change. The study demonstrated that road erodibility on the studied road changes over the course of one or more consecutive overland flow events. Therefore, model simulations that fail to take into consideration this change will probably over-estimate sediment yields. An exponential function describing the relationship between rill erodibility and cumulative overland flow depth is presented as a basis for future model development for simulating erosion on native surface roads.

AB Regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) is widely used to quantify flood risk at ungauged and sparsely gauged locations. There are minimal attempts to use partial duration series (PDS) for RFFA, though the use of PDS instead of widely used annual maximum series (AMS) can offer some advantages. This article contributes two novel random/regression forests (RFs)-based methodologies, namely generalized pareto distribution (GPD)-based distributional RFs (DRFs) and multivariate RFs (MVRFs), for RFFA with PDS. The RFs facilitate modeling interactions between predictors and their complex relationships with the predictands without explicitly specifying them. The DRFs and MVRFs comprise an ensemble of corresponding regression trees, each constructed by recursive binary partitioning of the feature space into meaningful segments. The proposed DRFs account for the sampling uncertainty of PDS in the partitioning and parameter estimation. In DRFs (MVRFs), quantile estimates for an ungauged site are obtained using maximum likelihood estimates (expected values) of GPD parameters corresponding to the segments to which the site belongs. The potential of DRFs and MVRFs relative to two recently proposed techniques (univariate RFs-based quantile regression, generalized additive model based on GPD) is demonstrated through Monte-Carlo simulation experiments and a study on 1,031 watersheds in the United States. The key features influencing scale and shape parameters of GPD fitted to PDS of the watersheds are identified as drainage area and 24-hr rainfall intensity corresponding to 2-year return period, respectively. Those identified for shape parameter differ from key features known based on analysis with AMS and generalized extreme value distribution.

AB Mountain block systems are critical to water resources and have been heavily studied and modeled in recent decades. However, due to lack of field data, there is little consistency in how models represent the mountain block subsurface. While there is a large body of research on subsurface heterogeneity, few studies have evaluated the effect that common conceptual choices modelers make in mountainous systems have on simulated hydrology. Here we simulate the hydrology of a semi-idealized headwater catchment using six common conceptual models of the mountain block subsurface. These scenarios include multiple representations of hydraulic conductivity decaying with depth, changes in soil depth with topography, and anisotropy. We evaluate flow paths, discharge, and water tables to quantify the impact of subsurface conceptualization on hydrologic behavior in three dimensions. Our results show that adding higher conductivity layers in the shallow subsurface concentrates flow paths near the surface and increases average saturated flow path velocities. Increasing heterogeneity by adding additional layers or introducing anisotropy increases the variance in the relationship between the age and length of saturated flow paths. Discharge behavior is most sensitive to heterogeneity in the shallow subsurface layers. Water tables are less sensitive to layering than they are to the overall conductivity in the domain. Anisotropy restricts flow path depths and controls discharge from storage but has little effect on governing runoff. Differences in the response of discharge, water table depth, and residence time distribution to subsurface representation highlight the need to consider model applications when determining the level of complexity that is needed.

AB Water resource management is of critical importance due to its close relationship with nearly every industry, field, and lifeform on this planet. The success of future water management will rely upon having detailed data of current and historic water dynamics. This research leverages Google Earth Engine and uses Landsat 5 imagery in conjunction with bathymetry and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model data to analyze long-term lake dynamics (water surface elevation, surface area, volume, volume change, and frequency) for Lake McConaughy in Nebraska, USA. Water surface elevation was estimated by extracting elevation values from underlying bathymetry and digital elevations models using 5,994 different combinations of water indices, water boundaries, and statistics for 100 time periods spanning 1985-2009. Surface elevation calculations were as accurate as 0.768 m root mean square error (CI95% [0.657, 0.885]). Water volume change calculations found a maximum change of 1.568 km(3) and a minimum total volume of only 23.97% of the maximum reservoir volume. Seasonal and long-term trends were identified, which have major affects regarding regional agriculture, local recreation, and lake water quality. This research fills an existing gap in optical remote sensing-based monitoring of lakes and reservoirs, is more robust and outperforms other commonly used monitoring techniques, increases the number of water bodies available for long-term studies, introduces a scalable framework deployable within Google Earth Engine, and enables data collection of both gauged and ungauged water bodies, which will substantially increase our knowledge and understanding of these critical ecosystems.

AB Water use practices and conservation are the result of complex sociotechnical interactions of political, economic, hydroclimatic, and social factors. While the drivers of water demand have been extensively studied, they have traditionally been applied to models that assume stationary relationships between these various factors, and usually do not account for potential societal changes in response to increased scarcity awareness. For example, following a period of sustained low demand such as during a drought, communities often increase water use during a hydrologically wet period, a phenomenon known as "rebounding'' water use. Previous experiences show the extent of this rebound is not a straightforward function of policy and efficiency improvements, but may also reflect short-term or long-lasting change in community behavior, which are not easily captured by models that assume stationarity. In this work, we develop a system dynamics model to represent water demand as a function of both structural and social factors. We apply this model to the analysis of three diverse water utilities in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1980 and 2017, identifying drought response trends and drivers over time. Our model is consistent with empirical patterns and historical context of water use in California, and provides important insights on the rebound phenomenon that can be extended to other locations. This comparative assessment indicates that policies, public outreach, and better data availability have played a key role in raising public awareness of water scarcity, especially with the raise of the internet era in recent years.

AB Ebullition can transport methane (CH4) at a much faster rate than other pathways, albeit over limited time and area, in wetland soils and sediments. However, field observations present large uncertainties in ebullition occurrences and statistic models are needed to describe the function relationship between probability of ebullition occurrence and water level changes. A flow-through chamber was designed and installed in a mudflat of an estuarine temperate marsh. Episodic increases in CH4 concentration signaling ebullition events were observed during ebbing tides (15 events over 456 ebbing tides) and occasionally during flooding tides (4 events over 455 flooding tides). Ebullition occurrence functions were defined using logistic regression as the relative initial and end water levels, as well as tidal amplitudes were found to be the key functional variables related to ebullition events. Ebullition of methane was restricted by a surface frozen layer during winter; melting of this layer during spring thaw caused increases in CH4 concentration, with ebullition fluxes similar to those associated with large fluctuations in water level around spring tides. Our findings suggest that initial and end relative water levels, in addition to tidal amplitude, partly regulate ebullition events in tidal wetlands, modulated by the lunar cycle, storage of gas bubbles at different depths and seasonal changes in the surface frozen layer. Maximum tidal strength over a few days, rather than hourly water level, may be more closely associated with the possibility of ebullition occurrence as it represents a trade-off time scale in between hourly and lunar periods.

AB Climatic teleconnections are often used to interpret and sometimes to predict precipitation temporal variability at various time scales. However, the teleconnections are intertwined between the effects of multiple large-scale climate signals which are often interdependent. Each climate signal is composed of multitemporal components, which may result in different teleconnection patterns. The time lags of precipitation response may vary with climate signals and their multitemporal components. In order to effectively address these problems, a multiresolution analysis (MRA) with a discrete wavelet transform is utilized, and a stepwise linear regression model based on MRA and cross correlation analysis is developed in this study. The method is applied to examine monthly precipitation teleconnections in South Australia (SA) with five large-scale climate signals. The MRA first decomposes each of original monthly precipitation anomaly and climate signals into several component series at different temporal scales. Then the hierarchical lag relationships between them are determined for regression modeling using cross-correlation analysis. The results indicate that the MRA-based method is able to reveal at which time scale(s) and with what time lag(s) the teleconnections occur, and their spatial patterns. The method is also useful to examine the time-scale patterns of the interdependence between climate signals. These altogether make the MRA-based method a promising tool to address the difficulties in the climate teleconnection studies. The multiple linear regression based on MRA-decomposed climate signals is expected to better interpret monthly precipitation temporal variability than that based on the original climate signals.

AB Ice flood control is an important objective for reservoir operation in cold regions. Maintaining the reservoir outflow in a certain range is considered an effective way to remediate ice flood damage. However, this strategy may decrease the socio-economic benefit of reservoirs, for example, reduction of hydropower production. These conflicting objectives cause a dilemma for water managers when defining reservoir operation policy. This study considers seven cascade reservoirs in the upstream Yellow River, and ice flood control storage is introduced to balance the hydropower generation and ice flood control. The relation between the ice flood control storage volume of the Liujiaxia reservoir and cascade power output is analyzed. An optimization model to explore the trade-offs between hydropower generation and ice flood control requirements is developed. The model takes into account ice flood control requirements. The optimization model compared to simulation model based on the reservoir operation rule curves. The results show that the optimal operation rules are far more efficient in balancing the benefits within the power generation and ice flood control. The cascade reservoirs operation strategies proposed in this study can be effectively and suitably used in reservoir operation systems with similar conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The integration of spatially and temporally varying observation data is an important step to formulate and generalize the large-scale relationships and feedback between the atmosphere and hydrological processes. In this contribution, we present a moderate resolution surface hydrometeorological data set for Peninsular Malaysia. The data set is gridded from daily observation data at a grid size of 0.05 degrees resolution for 1975-2004. The variables include rainfall, temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed. An overview of the integration and processing of the variety of data sources and the methodology used in the development of the data set is given. Furthermore, an evaluation of the data set is presented in terms of the general characteristics of the individual variables. Copyright. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Many studies have empirically confirmed the relationship between urbanization and changes to the hydrologic cycle and degraded aquatic habitats. While much of the literature focuses on extent and configuration of impervious area as a causal determinant of degradation, in this article, I do not attribute causes of decreased watershed storage on impervious area a priori. Rather, adapting the concept of variable source area (VSA) and its relationship to incremental storage to the particular conditions of urbanized catchments, I develop a statistically robust linear regression-based methodology to detect evidence of VSA-dominant response. Using the physical and meteorological characteristics of the catchments as explanatory variables, I then use logistic regression to statistically analyze significant predictors of the VSA classification. I find that the strongest predictor of VSA-type response is the percent of undeveloped area in the catchment. Characteristics of developed areas, including total impervious area, percent-developed open space and the type of drainage infrastructure, do not add to the explanatory power of undeveloped land in predicting VSA-type response. Within only developed areas, I find that total impervious area and percent-developed open space both decrease the odds of a catchment exhibiting evidence of VSA-type response and the effect of developed open space is more similar to that of total impervious area than undeveloped land in predicting VSA response. Different types of stormwater management infrastructure, including combined sewer systems and infiltration, retention and detention infrastructure are not found to have strong statistically significant effects on probability of VSA-type response. VSA-type response is also found to be stronger during the growing season than the dormant season. These findings are consistent across a national cross-section of urbanized watersheds, a higher resolution dataset of Baltimore Metropolitan Area watersheds and a subsample of watersheds confirmed not to be served by (combined sewer systems).

AB Meandering rivers are among the most dynamic Earth surface systems, exhibiting progressive change in channel location as they migrate across their floodplains over time. Theoretical models of meandering have defined the influence of planform curvature on meandering in the form of a spatial convolution function that expresses migration at any point along the channel as a weighted aggregate of local, upstream, and, most recently, downstream curvature. This study evaluates empirically the spatial planform curvature-migration relation of meandering rivers using data obtained from natural meandering rivers with varying degrees of planform complexity and compares the empirical results with the assumed relationships embodied in the theoretical meander migration models. The study is based on a framework that views a meandering river as a dynamical input-output system where the migration process is characterized by a spatial filter through which planform curvature produces migration. Discrete signal processing is used to derive the spatial planform curvature-migration relation for each study reach and to analyze the characteristics of this relation via transfer function models. The results demonstrate that the spatial structure of the planform curvature effect on migration rates depends on the complexity of the planform geometry. A first-order difference equation, in which the planform curvature effect is characterized as an exponential decay, can satisfactorily describe the migration process of a planform containing simple bends, but a high-order difference equation, which includes oscillatory terms superimposed on exponential decay, is necessary to capture the development of complex meander forms. The findings support recent theoretical studies that suggest that high-order terms are required in spatial convolution models to generate complex bend geometries.

AB The transport of reactive iron (i.e. colloidal and dissolved) by a glacier-fed stream system draining a high relief periglacial landscape in the high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is described. A negative, non-linear relationship between discharge and iron concentration is found, indicative of increased iron acquisition along baseflow pathways. Because the glaciers are cold-based and there are no intra- or sub-permafrost groundwater springs, baseflow is principally supplied by the active layer and the colluvial and alluvial sediments in the lower valley. Collectively, these environments increase the flux of iron in the stream by 40% over a floodplain length of just 8km, resulting in 6kg Fe km(-2)a(-1) of reactive iron export for a 20% glacierized watershed. We show that pyrite oxidation in shallow-groundwater flowpaths of the floodplain is the most important source of reactive iron, although it is far less influential in the upper parts of the catchment where other sources are significant (including ironstone and secondary oxide coatings). Microbial catalysis of the pyrite oxidation occurs in the floodplain, enabling rapid, hyporheic water exchange to enhance the iron fluxes at high discharge and cause the non-linear relationship between discharge and reactive iron concentrations. Furthermore, because the pyrite oxidation is tightly coupled to carbonate and silicate mineral weathering, other nutrients such as base cations and silica are also released to the stream system. Our work therefore shows that high Arctic floodplains should be regarded as critically important regulators of terrestrial nutrient fluxes to coastal ecosystems from glacial and periglacial sources.

AB This study examined suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during the ablation seasons of 2000 and 2001 in Place Creek, Canada. a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream. Comparison of stream flow in Place Creek with that in an adjacent, almost unglacierized catchment provided a rational basis for separating the ablation seasons into nival, nival-glacial, glacial and autumn recession subseasons. Distinct groupings of points in plots of electrical conductivity against discharge supported the validity of the subseasonal divisions in terms of varying hydrological conditions. Relationships between SSC and discharge (Q) varied between the two study seasons, and between subseasons. Hysteresis in the SSC-Q relationship was evident at both event and weekly time-scales. Some suspended sediment released from proalacial Place Lake (the source of Place Creek) appeared to be lost to channel storage at low flows, especially early in the ablation season, with re-entrainment at higher flows. Multiple regression models were derived for the subseasons using predictor vaniables including Q, Q(2), the change in Q over the previous 3 h, cumulative discharge over the ablation season, total precipitation over the previous 24 h and SSC measured at 1500 hours as an index value for each day. The models produced adjusted R-2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.91, and provided tentative insights into the differences in SSC dynamics amongst subseasons. Introduction of the index value of SSC significantly improved the model fit during the nival-glacial and glacial subseasons for both years, as it adjusts the model to the current condition of sediment supply.

AB The influence of emergent and submerged macrophytes on flow velocity and turbulence production is demonstrated in a 140 m reach of the River Blackwater in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK. Macrophyte growth occurs in patches and is dominated by Sparganium erectum and Sparganium emersum. In May 2001, patches of S. erectum were already established and occupied 18% of the channel area. The flow adjusted to these (predominantly lateral) patches by being channelled through a narrower cross-section. The measured velocity profiles showed a logarithmic form, with deviations attributable to topographic control. The channel bed was the main source of turbulence. In September 2001, in-stream macrophytes occupied 27% of the channel, and overhanging bank vegetation affected 32% of the area. Overall flow resistance, described by Manning's it, showed a threefold increase that could be attributed to the growth of S. emersum in the middle of the channel. Velocity profiles showed different characteristic forms depending on their position relative to plant stems and leaves. The overall velocity field had a three-dimensional structure. Turbulence intensities were generally higher and turbulence profiles tended to mirror the velocity profiles. Evidence for the generation of coherent eddies was provided by ratios of the root mean square velocities. Spectral analysis identified deviations from the Kolmogorov -5/3 power law and provided statistical evidence for a spectral short-cut, indicative of additional turbulence production. This was most marked for the submerged vegetation and, in some instances, the overhanging bank vegetation. The long strap-like leaves of S. emersum being aligned approximately parallel to the flow and the highly variable velocity field created by the patch arrangement of macrophytes suggest that the dominant mechanism for turbulence production is vortex shedding along shear zones. Wake production around individual stems of S. emersum close to the bed may also be important locally. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Lake water storage change (Delta S-w) is an important indicator of the hydrologic cycle and greatly influences lake expansion/shrinkage over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Accurate estimation of Delta S-w will contribute to improved understanding of lake variations in the TP. Based on a water balance, this study explored the variations of Delta S-w for the Lake Selin Co (the largest closed lake on the TP) during 2003-2012 using the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model (WEB-DHM) together with two different evapotranspiration (ET) algorithms (the Penman-Monteith method and a simple sublimation estimation approach for water area in unfrozen and frozen period). The contributions of basin discharge and climate causes to the Delta S-w are also quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that WEB-DHM could well reproduce daily discharge, the spatial pattern, and basin-averaged values of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) during nighttime and daytime. Compared with the ET reference values estimated from the basin-wide water balance, our ET estimates showed better performance than three global ET products in reproducing basin-averaged ET. The modeled ET at point scale matches well with short-term in situ daily measurements (RMSE = 0.82 mm/d). Lake inflows and precipitation over the water area had stronger relationships with Delta S-w in the warm season and monthly scale, whereas evaporation from the water area had remarkable effects on Delta S-w in the cold season. The total contribution of the three factors to Delta S-w was about 90%, and accounting for 49.5%, 22.1%, and 18.3%, respectively.

AB Understanding the relation between the effective dielectric constant (relative permittivity) of soils and their volumetric water content is important because measurements of the dielectric constant of soils by capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes, and remote-sensing radar devices are used to determine their moisture content. In the present study a physical model is proposed which relates the effective dielectric constant of unsaturated mineral soils at TDR frequencies to their volumetric water content, porosity, and specific surface area. It is assumed that the solid, water, and air components form a mixture of composite spheres and that the radial order of the single-phase concentric shells depends on the saturation degree of the medium. The dielectric constant of the aqueous phase is smaller than that of free water, because of interfacial solid-liquid forces, and the dependence of this reduction on the moisture content and on the specific surface area is represented here via a general approximated relationship. The model prediction is based on readily available soil properties (porosity, specific surface area, or texture), and it does not require any calibration. Tests of the model predictions against measurements made here on 3 porous media and against published data for an additional 19 media resulted in a promising agreement, with the proposed model's predictions being better than those given by the commonly used empirical relations for mineral soils. It is believed that the model performance could be further improved by better representation of the saturation degree-dependent, three-phase configuration by considering nonspherical soil particles and by a more realistic incorporation of interfacial relaxation processes.

AB A constant head permeameter system has been developed for use in small diameter boreholes with any orientation, It is based upon the original Guelph permeameter concept of using a Mariotte siphon reservoir to control the applied head. The new tool, called a Restricted Interval Guelph (RIG) permeameter uses either a single pneumatic packer or straddle packer to restrict the area through which water is allowed to flow so that the borehole wetted area is independent of the applied head. The RIG permeameter has been used at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, in the nonwelded rhyolitic Paintbrush Tuff. Analysis of the acquired data is based upon saturated-unsaturated flow theory that relies upon the quasi-linear approximation to estimate field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) and the alpha parameter (sorptive number) of the exponential relative hydraulic conductivity-pressure head relationship. These results are compared with a numerical model based upon the solution of the Richards equation using a van Genuchten capillary pressure-saturation formulation. The numerical model incorporates laboratory capillary pressure versus saturation functions measured from cores taken from nearby boreholes. Comparison between the analytical and numerical approaches shows that the simple analytic model is valid for analyzing the data collected. Sensitivity analysis performed with the numerical model shows that the RIG permeameter is an effective tool for estimating permeability and sorptive number for the nonwelded Paintbrush Tuff.

AB In this paper, a recently theoretically deduced rill flow resistance equation, based on a power-velocity profile, was tested using the Water Erosion Prediction Project database. This database includes measurements of flow velocity, water depth, cross section area, wetted perimeter, and bed slope that were made in rills shaped on experimental sites distributed across the continental United States. In particular, three different experimental conditions (only rainfall, only flow, and rain with flow) were examined, and for each condition, the theoretically based relationship for estimating the function of the power velocity profile was calibrated. The results established that (a) the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor can be accurately estimated using the proposed theoretical approach, and (b) the flow resistance increases with the effect of rainfall impact.

AB The traditional direct method (i.e. metric ruler and rillmeter) of monitoring rill erosion at plot scale is time consuming and invasive because it modifies the surface of the rilled area. Measuring rill features using a drone-based technology is considered a non-invasive method allowing a fast field relief. In the experimental Sparacia area a survey by a quadricopter Microdrones md4-200 was carried out, and this relief allowed the generation of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), with a mesh size of 1cm and a resolution elevation equal to 2mm, for three plots (L, G and C) affected by rill erosion. At first for the experimental L plot, which is 44m long, the rill features were surveyed by a manual' method which was carried out by drawing on the PC screen the rill paths obtained by a visual orthophoto interpretation. This manual method was not applicable for the plots in which rills of limited depth occurred and were not detectable. Then, for both L plot and the other experimental plots having a length ranging from 22 to 44m, an automatic' extraction method of rills from DEM was applied. Using an appropriate calculation routine, a vector coverage of transects orthogonal to the main flow direction (i.e. the maximum slope steepness path) was generated. The intersection of each plot DEM with the transect coverage allowed to obtain both the cross sections and the main rill morphological features. For the L plot the comparison between the rill morphological features obtained by the two different methods (manual, automatic) was carried out. Finally, the length-volume relationship and a dimensionless relationship proposed in literature were tested for all studied experimental plots. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Summarizing observed dry-canopy evaporation (hereafter, evaporation) data from earlier papers, we developed a scheme for forest categorization according to evaporation rates in the growing season. Evaporation rates were represented by the Priestley-Taylor coefficient alpha calculated for daytime. We examined relationships between forest properties (e.g. climatic regions, leaf types) and alpha values. We obtained alpha data for 67 forest sites from earlier papers. Based on these data, we found (i) a clear difference in a values between broad-leaved and coniferous forests, (ii) a greater variation in alpha values between individual coniferous forests than between individual broad-leaved forests, and (iii) a clear relationship between canopy height and alpha values for coniferous forests. These three results were supported by surface conductance data summarized from earlier papers. We concluded that forests should be primarily classified into broad-leaved and coniferous forests, and that coniferous forests should be further classified according to canopy height. This classification scheme is applicable only to forests with projected leaf area index (LAI) >= 3.0. Regardless of this LAI limitation, this classification will be useful because many forests satisfy this LAI limitation.
   This paper shows valuable results in the following two respects. First, this paper explicitly shows the difference in evaporation rates between broad-leaved and coniferous forests. Although this difference would have been implicitly recognized, this difference has not been shown based on adequate amounts of observed data. Second, it is shown that classifying coniferous forests according to canopy height is as important as classifying forests according to leaf type (broad-leaved or coniferous). Although studies have recognized the effect of canopy height on evaporation rates, the significant effect of canopy height on evaporation rates, compared with the effects of other factors on evaporation rates, has not previously been shown.

AB Growing demand for biomass-derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate how forest-based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale. Specifically, this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow-dominated watershed in northern Wisconsin, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles, is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios. The biofuel scenarios follow physically-based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay, pasture, and forested lands; along with a suite of alternative management practices, including rotation time, planting density, fertilizer application and irrigation. Trade-offs between biomass production, fertilizer use, and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system. The highest density (1111 trees/100 m(2)) and shortest rotation (5-year) treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass. The high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index, biomass production, and N uptake. At annual or greater time scales, the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on ET and streamflows. However, in summer months, the ET from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use, so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50%. Irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production, but only by 4% on average, which is not surprising for a temperate, humid watershed.

AB Linked hydrologic, hydraulic, and ecological models can facilitate planning and implementing water releases from reservoirs to achieve ecological objectives along rivers. We applied a flow-ecology model, the Ecosystem Functions Model (HEC-EFM), to the Bill Williams River in southwestern USA to estimate areas suitable for recruitment of riparian tree seedlings in the context of managing flow releases from a large dam for riparian restoration. Ecological variables in the model included timing of seed dispersal, tolerable rates of flow recession, and tolerable duration of inundation following germination and early seedling establishment for native Fremont cottonwood and Goodding's willow, and non-native tamarisk. Hydrological variables included peak flow timing, rate of flow recession following the peak, and duration of inundation. A one-dimensional hydraulic model was applied to estimate stage-discharge relationships along similar to 58 river kilometres. We then used HEC-EFM to apply relationships between seedling ecology and streamflow to link hydrological dynamics with ecological response. We developed and validated HEC-EFM based on an examination of seedling recruitment following an experimental flow release from Alamo Dam in spring 2006. The model predicted the largest area of potential recruitment for cottonwood (280-481 ha), with smaller areas predicted for willow (174-188 ha) and tamarisk (59-60 ha). Correlations between observed and predicted patches with successful seedling recruitment for areas within 40 m of the main channel ranged from 0.66 to 0.94. Finally, we examined arrays of hydrographs to identify which are most conducive to seedling recruitment along the river, given different combinations of peak flow, recession rate, and water volume released. Similar application of this model could be useful for informing reservoir management in the context of riparian restoration along other rivers facing similar challenges.

AB Streamwater quality can be affected by climate-related variability in hydrologic state, which controls flow paths and affects biogeochemical processes. Thirty-one years of input/output solute fluxes at Panola Mountain Research Watershed, a small, forested, seasonally water-limited watershed near Atlanta, Georgia, were used to quantify the effects of climatic-related variability in storage on streamwater solute concentrations and fluxes. Streamwater fluxes were estimated for ten solutes from weekly and event sample concentrations using regression-based methods. The most pertinent storage attribute (current or antecedent watershed, shallow, and deep storage) for each solute was determined by fitting separate concentration relationships. The concentration-discharge relationships varied more for reactive solutes such as potassium, sulfate, and DOC and less for weathering products (base cations and dissolved silica) and conservative chloride. Many solutes exhibited higher concentrations when storage levels were lower or wetting up, which was likely the result of the concentrating effects of evapotranspiration and/or the buildup and flushing of weathering products associated with longer residence times. The impacts of storage modeling on annual fluxes varied by solute, ranging from about 5% (magnesium) to 52% (nitrate) as relative standard deviations, and sufficiently removed climate-related patterns observed in streamwater concentrations. Sulfate was particularly mobilized following growing season droughts but only if deep storage was sufficiently recharged, possibly indicating that sulfides in the deep storage pool were oxidized to sulfate during droughts and mobilized when re-wetted. The lack of streamwater sulfate response to 61% declines in atmospheric deposition indicates the importance of watershed biogeochemical processes on controls of streamwater export of sulfate. The approach of explicitly incorporating storage in the streamwater concentration modeling elucidated the effects of climate on streamwater water-quality and may provide insight into the effects of climatic change on future fluxes.

AB Water age and flow pathways should be related; however, it is still generally unclear how integrated catchment runoff generation mechanisms result in streamflow age distributions at the outlet. Here, we combine field observations of runoff generation at the Dry Creek catchment with StorAge Selection (SAS) age models to explore the relationship between stream water age and runoff pathways. Dry Creek is a 3.5 km(2) catchment in the Northern California Coast Ranges with a Mediterranean climate, and, despite an average rainfall of approximate to 1,800 mm/yr, is an oak savannah due to the limited hillslope water storage capacity. Runoff lag to peak-after initial seasonal wet-up-is rapid (similar to 1-2 hr), and total annual streamflow consists predominantly of saturation overland flow, based on field mapping of saturated extents and an inferred runoff threshold for the expansion of saturation extent beyond the geomorphic channel. SAS modeling based on daily isotope sampling reveals that streamflow is typically older than 1 day. Since streamflow primarily consists of overland flow, a significant portion of overland flow must not be event-rain but instead derive from older, nonevent groundwater returning to the surface, consistent with field observations of exfiltrating head gradients, return flow through macropores, and extensive saturation days after storm events. We conclude that even in a watershed fed primarily by overland flow, runoff is primarily not composed of event water. Our findings have implications for the interpretation of stream chemistry and the assumptions built into widely used hydrograph separation inferences, namely, the assumption that overland flow consists of new (event) water.

AB This paper introduces the concept of the HydroGrid as a framework to describe connected water systems. We draw upon the knowledge and engineering experience employed in electrical grid operations to outline mirroring concepts in the HydroGrid, with a particular focus on monitoring, analysis, and control. The electrical grid is well monitored in real time. Monitoring data are used for dynamic analysis, and based on analytical projections, the grid is controlled to reduce the chance of cascading failures. We discuss analogous developments for the HydroGrid, using the example of microbial surface water contamination for illustration. Emerging technologies in advanced materials, signal transduction and wireless communications enable development of autonomous mobile devices for dynamic microbial water quality monitoring. As this technology matures, the devices will have the capability to stream real-time or near-real-time data for analysis with stochastic models of contaminant fate and transport. Modeling results, combined with controllability analysis of water systems, can then be used to determine system-wide prevention and mitigation strategies. Progress is measured with probability-based metrics of HydroGrid sustainability such as reliability, vulnerability, and resilience. We highlight challenges in data requirements and processing, and finally, we broadly discuss interdependent functions of the HydroGrid such as human and animal health services, food safety, and aquatic ecosystems health.
   Plain Language Summary This paper introduces the HydroGrid as an interconnected system of water. Through analogies with the electrical grid, we describe emerging technologies in monitoring, analysis, and control of the HydroGrid. We broadly discuss interdependent functions of the HydroGrid such as human and animal health services, food safety, and aquatic ecosystems health. The state of the HydroGrid is assessed using sustainability measures such as reliability, vulnerability, and resilience that originated in engineering reliability theory.

AB Air-water interfaces play an important role in unsaturated porous media, giving rise to phenomena like capillarity. Less recognized and understood are interactions of colloids with the air-water interface in porous media and the implications of these interactions for fate and transport of colloids. In this review, we discuss how colloids, both suspended in the aqueous phase and attached at pore walls, interact with air-water interfaces in porous media. We discuss the theory of colloid/air-water interface interactions, based on the different forces acting between colloids and the air-water interface (DLVO, hydrophobic, capillary forces) and based on thermodynamic considerations (Gibbs free energy). Subsurface colloids are usually electrostatically repelled from the air-water interface because most subsurface colloids and the air-water are negatively charged. However, hydrophobic interactions can lead to attraction to the air-water interface. When colloids are at the air-water interface, capillary forces are usually dominant over other forces. Moving air-water interfaces are effective in mobilizing and transporting colloids from surfaces. Thermodynamic considerations show that, for a colloid, the air-water interface is the favored state as compared with the suspension phase, except for hydrophilic colloids in the nanometer size range. Experimental evidence indicates that colloid mobilization in soils often occurs through macropores, although matrix transport is also prevalent in absence of macropores. Moving air-water interfaces, e.g., occurring during infiltration, imbibition, or drainage, have been shown to scour colloids from surfaces and translocate colloids. Colloids can also be pinned to surfaces by thin water films and capillary menisci at the air-water-solid interface line, causing colloid retention and immobilization. Air-water interfaces thus can both mobilize or immobilize colloids in porous media, depending on hydrodynamics and colloid and surface chemistry.

AB To characterize the coupled hydromechanical behavior of rock fractures, the step-rate injection method for fracture in-situ properties (SIMFIP) was conducted with a specialized downhole probe developed by Guglielmi et al. (2014, ). In June 2019, a field campaign was carried out near angstrom re, Sweden, where the SIMFIP probe was applied in the Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides-1 scientific borehole to understand the dynamics of injection-induced fracture initiation, fracture opening, and shearing due to water injection-withdrawal in a borehole interval isolated by two packers. Three intervals were investigated at similar to 500 m depth: (a) an unfractured section (intact rock), (b) a section with non-conductive fractures, and (c) a section with hydraulically conductive fractures. Pressure, injection flow rate, and borehole wall displacement were simultaneously measured during the tests. In the present study, the geometry of the induced fracture and deformation of existing fractures at different time stages of the tests are determined based on a hydrologic model by using the measured pressure and flow data during each time stage of the experiment. A numerical model for the fluid flow within the fracture and the packed-off borehole interval is implemented within COMSOL Multiphysics. By matching model simulations with observed data for all three sections, estimates of the induced and propagated fractures' radius and aperture at successive time stages have been obtained in each case. We could also determine the non-linear relationship between fracture aperture and pressure for values above fracture opening pressures. The model results provide insights for the understanding of pressure-induced fracture initiation and propagation in crystalline rock.

AB Remote sensing models that measure evapotranspiration directly from the Penman-Monteith or Priestley-Taylor equations typically estimate the soil evaporation component over large areas using coarse spatial resolution relative humidity (RH) from geospatial climate datasets. As a result, the models tend to underperform in dry areas at local scales where moisture status is not well represented by surrounding areas. Earth observation sensors that monitor large-scale global dynamics (e.g., MODIS) afford comparable spatial coverage and temporal frequency, but at a higher spatial resolution than geospatial climate datasets. In this study, we compared soil evaporation parameterized with optical and thermal indices derived from MODIS to RH-based soil evaporation as implemented in the Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. We evaluated the parameterizations by subtracting PT-JPL transpiration from observation-based flux tower evapotranspiration in agricultural fields across the contiguous United States. We compared the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) index, land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and a new index derived from red and shortwave infrared bands (soil moisture divergence index [SMDI]). Relationships were significant at the 95% confidence band. LSWI and SMDI explained 18-33% of variance in 8-day soil evaporation. This led to a 3-11% increase in explained ET variance. LSWI and SMDI tended to perform better at the irrigated sites than RH. LSWI and SMDI led to markedly better performance over other indices at a seasonal time step. L-band microwave backscatter can penetrate clouds and can distinguish soil from canopy moisture content. We are presently fusing red-SWIR-RADAR to improve soil evaporation estimation.

AB Riparian shrubs and trees present a complex, seasonally variable morphology, with flexible stems and leaves efficiently adapting to the flow forcing (reconfiguration). The aim of this paper is to investigate how foliage and reconfiguration affect the flow and mixing in a partly vegetated channel. Specific attention was placed on the velocity statistics, onset and coherence of turbulent structures, and lateral momentum transport at the horizontal interface between vegetation and open water. The experimental flume arrangement was novel in that it allowed investigating the lateral shear layer induced by flexible riparian plants. The natural-like vegetation consisted of emergent woody plants and a grassy understory, with density, morphology and reconfiguration behavior comparable to those found in real riparian areas. Investigations were conducted under foliated and leafless conditions to determine the seasonality effects. The mean and turbulent flow structure was determined with acoustic Doppler velocimetry, and dynamic plant motions were investigated from video footage. The presence of foliage enhanced the drag discontinuity at the interface, resulting in more pronounced velocity gradients between the vegetated and open areas compared to the leafless conditions. Foliation induced stronger shear layer-scale mixing, whereas, under leafless conditions, the local mixing induced by stems was more important. The reconfiguration decreased the coherence of the two-dimensional large-scale vortices at the interface while their characteristic frequency was consistent with the canonical mixing layer theory. Our results indicated that shear layer dynamics in partly vegetated channels was influenced strongly by morphology and reconfiguration of complex plants, with more efficient lateral momentum transport at the interface in the foliated conditions than previously reported for shear layers induced by simpler vegetation.

AB Pore-scale forces have a significant effect on the macroscopic behaviour of multiphase flow through porous media. This paper studies the effect of these forces using a new volume-of-fluid based finite volume method developed for simulating two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media. An analytical analysis of the relationship between the pore-scale forces and the Darcy-scale pressure drops is presented. We use this analysis to propose unambiguous definitions of Darcy-scale viscous pressure drops as the rate of energy dissipation per unit flow rate of each phase, and then use them to obtain the relative permeability curves. We show that this definition is consistent with conventional laboratory/field measurements by comparing our predictions with experimental relative permeability. We present single and two-phase flow simulations for primary oil injection followed by water injection on a sandpack and a Berea sandstone. The two-phase flow simulations are presented at different capillary numbers which cover the transition from capillary fingering at low capillary numbers to a more viscous fingering displacement pattern at higher capillary numbers, and the effect of capillary number on the relative permeability curves is investigated. Overall, this paper presents a new finite volume-based methodology for the detailed analysis of two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media and upscaling of the results to the Darcy scale.

AB Morphodynamic models of coastal evolution require relatively simple parameterizations of sediment transport for application over larger scales. Calantoni and Thaxton (2008) [6] presented a transport parameterization for bimodal distributions of coarse quartz grains derived from detailed boundary layer simulations for sheet flow and near sheet flow conditions. The simulation results, valid over a range of wave forcing conditions and large-to small-grain diameter ratios, were successfully parameterized with a simple power law that allows for the prediction of the transport rates of each size fraction. Here, we have applied the simple power law to a two-dimensional cellular automaton to simulate sheet flow transport. Model results are validated with experiments performed in the small oscillating flow tunnel (S-OFT) at the Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center, MS, in which sheet flow transport was generated with a bed composed of a bimodal distribution of non-cohesive grains. The work presented suggests that, under the conditions specified, algorithms that incorporate the power law may correctly reproduce laboratory bed surface measurements of bimodal sheet flow transport while inherently incorporating vertical mixing by size.

AB In this paper, a permeability calculation workflow is presented that couples pore network modeling (PNM) with a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to benefit from the strengths of both approaches. Pore network extraction is implemented using a watershed segmentation algorithm on 12 three-dimensional porous rock images. The permeabilities of all throats are calculated using the LBM and substituted in the pore network model instead of using the cylindrical formulation for throat's permeability based on the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Solving the LBM for every throat results in an accurate representation of flow but the algorithm is computationally expensive. In order to minimize the computational costs, LBM is used to model the steady-state incompressible fluid flow through 9333 different throat images and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to mimic the trend of throat's permeabilities based on the cross-sectional images. To this end, we extract several morphological features of the throats cross-sectional images and search for the best describing feature. It is found that the averaged distance map of the throat images is highly correlated with the LBM-based permeability of throats to the extent that even a simple empirical correlation can reasonably describe the relationship between these two parameters. Finally, we compare the absolute permeability of samples obtained by full LBM with the presented hybrid method. Results show that the proposed method provides an accurate estimation of permeability with a considerable reduction in the computational CPU time.

AB Key Points
   The intertidal saline cell is not a permanent feature of a coastal aquifer The intertidal saline cell cycle is linked to the lunar cycle of tides The cell cycle modulates the fresh and salt groundwater fluxes to the ocean
   Detailed field measurements are combined with a numerical modeling to characterize the groundwater dynamics beneath the discharge zone at Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. Groundwater salinity values revealed a saline circulation cell that overlaid the discharging freshwater and grew and disappeared with the lunar cycle. The cell was initiated by a greater bay water infiltration during the new moon when high tides overtopped the mean high-tide mark, flooding the flatter beach berm and inundating a larger area of the beach. The dynamics of this cell were further characterized by a tracer test and by constructing a density-dependent flow model constrained to salinity and head data. The numerical model captured the growing and diminishing behavior of the circulation cell and provided the estimates of freshwater and saline water fluxes and travel times. Furthermore, the model enabled quantification of the relationship between the characteristics of the observed tidal cycle (maximum, minimum, and mean tidal elevations) and the different components of the groundwater circulation (freshwater discharge, intertidal saline cycling, and deep saline cycling). We found that (1) recharge to the intertidal saline cell is largely controlled by the high-tide elevation; (2) freshwater discharge is positively correlated to the low-tide elevation, whereas deep saline discharge from below the discharging freshwater is negatively correlated to the low-tide elevation. So, when the low-tide elevation is relatively high, more freshwater discharges and less deep saltwater discharges. In contrast when low tides are very low, less freshwater discharges and more deep salt water discharges; (3) offshore inflow of saline water is largely insensitive to tides and the lunar cycle.

AB Release of colloids and their subsequent transport into the subsurface environments takes place during a wide range of applications such as industrial, energy storage, and agricultural activities. Therefore, processes contributing to transport, attachment, and re-mobilization of colloids in porous media are attracting attention. A fraction of the released colloids may cross the soil vadose zone to reach the saturated groundwater. In this study, we explored colloid transport in a micromodel with high repulsion energy barrier where colloid retention is assumed to be low. Three major shortcomings were improved: pore space domain size, imaging resolution, and speed of imaging. The flow path of 1357 colloids with a size of 4 mu m were tracked and these enabled precise determination of individual colloid transport mechanism as well as the integrated behavior of the system.
   Our direct observations have shown that even under unfavorable attachment conditions (defined based on the DLVO theory) colloids deposition occurred which was mainly due to the local flow velocity fluctuations and grain surface heterogeneity. Using the information from collective trajectories, we have quantified the contribution of differently behaved colloids in the observed breakthrough curve which show an integrated, macroscopic, behavior of the system and is often the only available information when performing column or field scale experiments to explore colloid transport in porous media. Furthermore, we have shown that attachment and remobilization of colloids increased the dispersion coefficient, and consequently the dispersivity value of the media.

AB Quantitative descriptions of the temporal and spatial variations of volumetric water content and total water potential in unsaturated soils have for more than nine decades focused on diffusive mechanisms as represented by the Richards equation (Richards, 1931). However, recent laboratory studies (Lo et al., 2017) have revealed short-time transient behavior of water in non-deforming unsaturated soils that is distinctly oscillatory, not diffusive. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework to generalize the Richards equation in a systematic way to account for non-diffusive mechanisms giving rise to oscillatory behavior in the water content and total water potential. A partial differential equation is developed, with the total water potential as the dependent variable, based on the coupling of mass and linear momentum balance within the continuum theory of mixtures. This new differential equation becomes equivalent to the Richards equation when non-diffusive mechanisms can be neglected, but when this condition is not met, the governing equation describes damped propagating wave behavior of the total water potential. This dynamic wave differs from a poroelastic wave in respect to solid framework motions and wave speed, as well as time and length scales. For a rigid, homogeneous unsaturated soil, the governing equation reduces to the telegraph equation, which can be solved analytically. An inherent feature of our approach is the appearance of natural time and length scales characteristic of total water potential waves. Consideration of these natural scales for three representative soils of differing texture helps to prescribe more precisely the domain of applicability of the Richards equation.

AB The transport of pore water in a rock during drying-infiltration processes was characterized by water-expulsion porosimetry. In this method, pore water is expelled by increasing gas pressure in a stepwise fashion, and the amounts of water in each pore size class are determined. Fontainebleau sandstone, having an open porosity of 6% and main pore radii of 1-20 mu m, was used. The change in size distribution of pore water was determined as a function of the degree of drying. As the drying proceeded, the amount of water decreased first in the larger pores followed by the smaller pores. Next, water was infiltrated into the sample preliminarily adjusted to various water saturations (Spre-flow), and the entrapped air saturation, hydraulic conductivity (K), and size distribution of pore water were measured. As Spre-flow decreased, the entrapped air saturation increased and K decreased as approximated by K proportional to S-flow (4.5), where S-flow is the water saturation after the infiltration. A comparison of the size distributions of pore water before and after the infiltration revealed that the ease of water infiltration (air entrapment) depends on pore size. If pores of >8 mu m radii were emptied by drying, they were readily refilled with water, whereas smaller pores were only partially refilled because air was trapped in them. The experimentally measured K-S-flow relationship generally agreed with those predicted by the Mualem-van Genuchten model and its modified version accounting for air entrapment, but some differences in the size distribution of pore water were observed between the experiment and the models.

TI Development and application of a hydroclimatological stream temperature

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID AIR TEMPERATURES; RIVER; SENSITIVITY
AB We develop a stream temperature model within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) that reflects the combined influence of meteorological (air temperature) and hydrological conditions (streamflow, snowmelt, groundwater, surface runoff, and lateral soil flow) on water temperature within a watershed. SWAT currently uses a linear air-stream temperature relationship to determine stream temperature, without consideration of watershed hydrology. As SWAT uses stream temperature to model various in-stream biological and water quality processes, an improvement of the stream temperature model will result in improved accuracy in modeling these processes. The new stream temperature model is tested on seven coastal and mountainous streams throughout the western United States for which high quality flow and water temperature data were available. The new routine does not require input data beyond that already supplied to the model, can be calibrated with a limited number of calibration parameters, and achieves improved representation of observed daily stream temperature. For the watersheds modeled, the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient and mean error (ME) for the new stream temperature model averaged 0.81 and -0.69 degrees C, respectively, for the calibration period and 0.82 and -0.63 degrees C for the validation period. The original SWAT stream temperature model averaged a NS of -0.27 and ME of 3.21 degrees C for the calibration period and a NS of -0.26 and ME of 3.02 degrees C for the validation period. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the new stream temperature model calibration parameters are physically reasonable and the model is better able to capture stream temperature changes resulting from changes in hydroclimatological conditions.

AB The wetlands of the James Bay Lowland comprise one of largest wetland complexes in the world, in part due to the properties (thickness and hydraulic conductivity) of the marine sediment (MS) that underlay them. Dewatering of an open-pit diamond mine is depressurizing the surrounding Silurian bedrock below the MS. Prior to mining, it was assumed that these MS would largely isolate the overlying peatlands from the depressurized regional bedrock aquifer. To assess this isolation, we instrumented a 1.5km long transect of wells and piezometers located within the zone of the mine's influence that crossed a sequence of bogs, fens, and bedrock outcrops (bioherms). Results were differentiated between those areas with no MS (near bioherms) and those underlain by MS (non-bioherm) along the transect. Between 2007 and 2010 at near-bioherm and non-bioherm locations, average peat water tables declined 71 and 31cm, and hydraulic head declined 66 and 32cm, in bioherm and non-bioherm locations, respectively. Gradients varied from near zero (-0.001) at the start of dewatering to -0.03 (after 5years) in non-bioherm areas and from -0.20 to -0.45 in near-bioherm areas. These gradients corresponded to fluxes (groundwater recharge) of approximately -0.26mm/day and -2.1mm/day, in non- and near-bioherm areas, respectively. Specific discharge (recharge) determined using the known mine dewatering rate and drawdown cone heads and areas corresponded well with measured recharge determined in the non-bioherm transect locations. A simple rearrangement of Darcy's Law used to calculate the specific discharge highlighted how the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to the thickness of the MS can be used to assess vulnerable areas. Therefore, given the increasing development in Ontario's Far North, considerable attention must be given to both the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of MS.

AB The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is an important part of the cultural heritage and economy of Southeastern Massachusetts, yet water quality concerns and wetland protection laws challenge its commercial production. Here, we report inputs and outputs of water, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) for a 2.12-ha cranberry bed over a 2-year period from 2013 to 2015. Water-budget analysis indicated that precipitation contributed 40%, floodwater 37%, irrigation 15%, and groundwater 8% of water inputs to the cranberry bed. Minor annual variation in surface water discharge (similar to 90mmyear(-1) or 3%) contrasted with large decreases in net (= outputs - inputs) nutrient export, from 16.2 to 9.1kgNha(-1)year(-1) for total (dissolved+suspended particulate) nitrogen (TN) and from 3.34 to 1.47kgPha(-1)year(-1) for total phosphorus (TP) between Years 1 and 2. Annual variation in net TN and TP export was tied to decreases in spring and summer nutrient export and controlled by the combined effects of fertilizer management, soil biogeochemistry, and hydrology. The relatively high spring TN export in Year 1 was associated with coincident increases in soil temperature and rainfall. A second factor was the timing of fertilizer application, which occurred 1day prior to a major summer storm (i.e., third largest daily rainfall since 1926) and was responsible for up to 15% and 9% of the Year 1 TN and TP export, respectively. Nutrient budgets, which balanced water and fertilizer inputs with water, fruit, and vegetative outputs, were consistent with the burial of 21.6kgNha(-1)year(-1) and 7.27kgPha(-1)year(-1). Field measurements indicated that burial would increase TN and TP in the shallow (0-5cm) rooting zone by 14% and 6%, respectively, which seemed plausible based on the relatively young age of the bed (4-5years) and new root growth patterns in Vaccinium plants.

AB Transient flow in multiply layered aquifers, separated by connecting layers of aquitards which provide hydraulic interactions between the aquifers, is solved by the Green element method (GEM) in a manner that reveals one of its strengths of being able to correctly model the leakage Aux without resorting to adjusting the grid representing the one-dimensional (1-D) flow in the aquitards, as done in the finite element method (FEM). The hydraulic approach of approximating the flow is adopted so that flow in the aquifer takes place in two dimensions and that in the aquitards takes place in the one-dimensional vertical direction. The 1-D Green element (GE) model earlier developed for transient diffusion and referred to as the transient GE (TGE) formulation [Taigbenu and Onyejekwe, 1999] is used in modeling the flow in the aquitards, while the 2-D GE model developed for linear and nonlinear transient diffusion [Taigbenu and Onyejekwe, 1998] is used for calculating the flows in the confined and unconfined aquifers. Both models are coupled to solve regional flow problems in multiaquifer systems of arbitrary geometry which receive point and distributed recharge of arbitrary strengths. The solution procedure, which is iterative, provides information on the hydraulic heads and fluxes in the aquifers and aquitards at Various specified times. Because GEM is founded on the singular integral theory, singularities that arise from water abstractions at wells (point recharge) are naturally captured in the singular Green's function, thereby making it possible to use a more coarse grid for problems in which there exist active wells. Furthermore, the implementation procedure of GEM achieves sparsity of the coefficient matrix so that less amount of computing resources is required for its decomposition. The superiority of the current approach over FEM in predicting the leakage flux through the aquitards and achieving comparable accuracy for well problems with coarser grid is demonstrated.

AB Long-term hydrological partitioning of catchments can be well described by the Budyko framework with a parameter (e.g., Fu's equations with parameter omega). The Budyko framework considers aridity index as the dominant control on hydrological partitioning, while the parameter represents integrated influences of catchment properties. Our understanding regarding the controls of catchment properties on the parameter is still limited. In this study, two machine learning methods, that is, boosted regression tree (BRT) and CUBIST, were used to model omega. Interpretable machine learning methods were adopted for better physical understanding including feature importance, accumulated local effects (ALE), and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. Among the 15 properties of 443 Australian catchments, analysis of feature importance showed that root zone storage capacity (SR), vapor pressure, vegetation coverage (M), precipitation depth, climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI), and water use efficiency (WUE) were the six primary control factors on omega. ALE showed that omega varied nonlinearly with all factors, and varied non-monotonically with M, SAI, and WUE. LIME showed that the importance of the six dominant factors on omega varied between regions. CUBIST was further used to build regionally varying relationships between omega and the primary factors. Continental scale omega and evapotranspiration were further mapped across Australia based on the most robust BRT-trained parameterization scheme with a resolution of 0.05 degrees. Instead of using the machine learning method as a black box, we employed interpretability approaches to identify the controls. Our findings not only improved the capability of the Budyko method for hydrological partitioning across Australia, but also demonstrated that the controls of catchment properties on hydrological partitioning vary in different regions.

AB Future climate warming may increase water temperature, stratification, and the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms in drinking water reservoirs. Herein, past relationships between air temperature, water temperature, thermal stratification, and cyanobacteria prevalence are quantified in six Connecticut, U.S.A., reservoirs. Lake-specific empirical models were developed and used to project historical (1971-2000) and future (mid-century, 2041-2070) water temperature and thermal stratification in the study lakes. Projections are driven with downscaled air temperature projections from three general circulation models (i.e., HadGEM2-CC365, CCSM4, and GFDL-ESM 2M) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Results suggest that reservoirs in Connecticut are warming relatively quickly over time and that surface, average, and bottom water temperatures may continue to increase by 0.44 degrees C, 0.30 degrees C, and 0.16 degrees C per decade, respectively. Future projections of thermal stratification indicate that significant increases may occur in July-September and that stratification is likely to begin 2-4 weeks earlier and last 2-4 weeks longer by mid-century. High-risk cyanobacteria blooms, defined as those exceeding 70,000 cells ml(-1), historically occurred in three of the study reservoirs and are correlated with the occurrence of high surface water temperatures, cool bottom water temperatures, and high total Relative Thermal Resistance to Mixing (RTRM). Days per year with extreme high water temperatures and total RTRM are projected to increase significantly in the future. This shift may favor increased dominance of certain cyanobacteria species that tend to grow best in these extreme conditions, especially in reservoirs where cyanobacteria blooms are already a concern.

AB The uncertainty structure of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is largely unknown at fine spatiotemporal scales near the radar measurement scale. By using the WSR-88D radar network and gauge data sets across the conterminous US, an investigation of this subject has been carried out within the framework of the NOAA/NSSL ground radar-based Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) QPE system. A new method is proposed and called PRORATE for probabilistic QPE using radar observations of rate and typology estimates. Probability distributions of precipitation rates are computed instead of deterministic values using a model quantifying the relation between radar reflectivity and the corresponding true precipitation. The model acknowledges the uncertainty arising from many factors operative at the radar measurement scale and from the correction algorithm. Ensembles of reflectivity-to-precipitation rate relationships accounting explicitly for precipitation typology were derived at a 5 min/1 km scale. This approach conditions probabilistic quantitative precipitation estimates (PQPE) on the precipitation rate and type. The model components were estimated on the basis of a 1 year long data sample over the CONUS. This PQPE model provides the basis for precipitation probability maps and the generation of radar precipitation ensembles. Maps of the precipitation exceedance probability for specific thresholds (e.g., precipitation return periods) are computed. Precipitation probability maps are accumulated to the hourly time scale and compare favorably to the deterministic QPE. As an essential property of precipitation, the impact of the temporal correlation on the hourly accumulation is examined. This approach to PQPE can readily apply to other systems including space-based passive and active sensor algorithms.

AB Quantifying the uncertainty in solute mass discharge at an environmentally sensitive location is key to assess the risks due to groundwater contamination. Solute mass fluxes are strongly affected by the spatial variability of hydrogeological properties as well as release conditions at the source zone. This paper provides a methodological framework to investigate the interaction between the ubiquitous heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and the mass release rate at the source zone on the uncertainty of mass discharge. Through the use of perturbation theory, we derive analytical and semi-analytical expressions for the statistics of the solute mass discharge at a control plane in a three-dimensional aquifer while accounting for the solute mass release rates at the source. The derived solutions are limited to aquifers displaying low-to-mild heterogeneity. Results illustrate the significance of the source zone mass release rate in controlling the mass discharge uncertainty. The relative importance of the mass release rate on the mean solute discharge depends on the distance between the source and the control plane. On the other hand, we find that the solute release rate at the source zone has a strong impact on the variance of the mass discharge. Within a risk context, we also compute the peak mean discharge as a function of the parameters governing the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field and mass release rates at the source zone. The proposed physically-based framework is application-oriented, computationally efficient and capable of propagating uncertainty from different parameters onto risk metrics. Furthermore, it can be used for preliminary screening purposes to guide site managers to perform system-level sensitivity analysis and better allocate resources.

AB Degassing and in situ development of a mobile gas phase takes place when an aqueous phase equilibrated with a gas at a pressure higher than the subsurface pressure is injected in water-saturated porous media. This process, which has been termed supersaturated water injection (SWI), is a novel and hitherto unexplored means of introducing a gas phase in the subsurface. We give herein a first macroscopic account of the SWI process on the basis of continuum scale simulations and column experiments with CO2 as the dissolved gas. A published empirical mass transfer correlation [Nambi IM, Powers SE. Mass transfer correlations for nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution from regions with high initial saturations. Water Resour Res 2003;39(2):1030. doi:10.1029/2001WR000667] is found to adequately describe non-equilibrium transfer of CO2 between the aqueous and gas phases. Remarkably, the dynamics of gas-water two-phase flow, observed in a series of SWI experiments in homogeneous columns packed with silica sand or glass beads, are accurately predicted by traditional two-phase flow theory and the corresponding gas relative permeability is determined. A key consequence of this finding, namely that the displacement of the aqueous phase by gas is compact at the macroscopic scale, is consistent with pore scale simulations of repeated mobilization, fragmentation and coalescence of large gas clusters (i.e., large ganglion dynamics) driven entirely by mass transfer. The significance of this finding for the efficient delivery of a gas phase below the water table is discussed in connection to the alternative process of in situ air sparging, and potential advantages of SWI are highlighted.

AB Typical models for the representation of naturally fractured systems generally rely on the double-porosity Warren-Root model or on random arrays of fractures. However, field observations have demonstrated the existence of multiple length scales in a variety of naturally fractured media. Present models fail to capture this important property of self-similarity. We first use concepts: from the theory of fragmentation and from fractal geometry to construct numerically a network of fractures that exhibits self-similar behavior over a range of scales. The method is a combination of fragmentation concepts and the iterated function system approach and allows for great flexibility in the development of patterns. Next, numerical simulation of unsteady single-phase flow in such networks is described. It is found that the pressure transient response of finite fractals behaves according to the analytical predictions of Chang and Yortsos (1990) provided that there exists a power law in the mass-radius relationship around the test well location. Finite size effects can become significant and interfere with the identification of the fractal structure. The paper concludes by providing examples from actual well tests in fractured systems which are analyzed using fractal pressure transient theory.

AB The interactions between the stream and the geomorphologic units that compose the stream channel result in an exchange of water, heat, and chemicals that is an important component of the flows of energy and nutrients in the river ecosystem. This exchange is characterized by complex spatial and temporal dynamics that depend on the characteristics of the stream flow and morphology. At present, many studies have addressed the development of spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange that are induced by many geomorphological factors at different scales. However, much less is known about the temporal evolution of the surface-subsurface exchange in response to the dynamics of the stream discharge. In order to investigate this problem, the present work analyzes the influence of streamflow variability on the hyporheic exchange induced by fluvial bedforms. A stochastic approach is employed to generate streamflow series whose statistical properties are representative of streams with different hydrological regimes. The resulting exchange fluxes and travel times are then computed, and the relationships between the streamflow regime and the dynamics of the exchange flux and travel times are investigated. The results show that the mean stream discharge can be used to estimate the average features of the temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Moreover, exchange fluxes and residence times distributions exhibit significant fluctuations, which are tightly related to the coefficient of variation of the streamflow hydrograph.

AB This study presents a novel mathematical model for analysis of non-axisymmetrical solute transport in a radially convergent flow field with scale-dependent dispersion. A two-dimensional, scale-dependent advection-dispersion equation in cylindrical coordinates is derived based on assuming that the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities increase linearly with the distance of the solute transported from its injected source. The Laplace transform finite difference technique is applied to solve the two-dimensional, scale-dependent advection-dispersion equation with variable-dependent coefficients. Concentration contours for different times, breakthrough curves of average concentration over concentric circles with a fixed radial distance, and breakthrough curves of concentration at a fixed observation point obtained using the scale-dependent dispersivity model are compared with those from the constant dispersivity model. The salient features of scale-dependent dispersion are illustrated during the non-axisymmetrical transport from the injection well into extraction well in a convergent flow field. Numerical tests show that the scale-dependent dispersivity model predicts smaller spreading than the constant-dispersivity model near the source. The results also show that the constant dispersivity model can produce breakthrough curves of averaged concentration over concentric circles with the same shape as those from the proposed scale-dependent dispersivity model at observation point near the extraction well. Far from the extracting well, the two models predict concentration contours with significantly different shapes. The breakthrough curves at observation point near the injection well from constant dispersivity model always produce lesser overall transverse dispersion than those from scale-dependent dispersivity model. Erroneous dimensionless transverse/longitudinal dispersivity ratio may result from parametric techniques which assume a constant dispersivity if the dispersion process is characterized by a distance-dependent dispersivity relationship. A curve-fitting method with an example is proposed to evaluate longitudinal and transverse scale-proportional factors of a field with scale-dependent dispersion. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Groundwater contamination is one of the major concerns to public health and water resource management. Identification of contamination sources is essential for designing cost-effective groundwater remediation systems and minimizing risks of further contamination. Various numerical approaches have been applied to reconstruct spatiotemporal distributions of contaminant sources. Due to difficulties in obtaining source information, the backward probability model is computationally efficient; however, its applications have largely been limited to relatively simple problems such as two-dimensional or simplified three-dimensional steady-state saturated flow conditions with a single contaminant source. More importantly, the traditional backward probability model requires some a priori knowledge on the suspected source locations or source release times to quantify source area location probabilities. Here we improve the capability of the backward probability model for solving real-world problems by implementing it into a three-dimensional transient variably saturated flow model. To evaluate the applicability of the model, we apply it combined with the shift-average method to a field-scale problem for identifying multiple contaminant sources occurring in the vadose zone that release contaminants to the saturated zone through infiltration. Compared with the suspected potential sources reported through a site characterization study, the enhanced backward probability model reasonably captures most of the reported potential sources under various hydrologic/hydrogeological/dispersion conditions, which demonstrates that the approach developed here can overcome limitations of the backward probability theory previously reported in the literature.
   Key Points
   The backward probability model is improved for identifying multiple contaminant sources under complex hydrogeological conditionsThis study presents a new method for combining multiple probability density functions for identifying multiple contaminant sourcesThe systematic approach developed in this study is useful and practical for addressing complex groundwater contamination problems

AB Bare soil evaporation is a key process for water exchange between the land and the atmosphere and an important component of the water balance. However, there is no agreement on the best modeling methodology to determine evaporation under different atmospheric boundary conditions. Also, there is a lack of directly measured soil evaporation data for model validation to compare these methods to establish the validity of their mathematical formulations. Thus, a need exists to systematically compare evaporation estimates using existing methods to experimental observations. The goal of this work is to test different conceptual and mathematical formulations that are used to estimate evaporation from bare soils to critically investigate various formulations and surface boundary conditions. Such a comparison required the development of a numerical model that has the ability to incorporate these boundary conditions. For this model, we modified a previously developed theory that allows nonequilibrium liquid/gas phase change with gas phase vapor diffusion to better account for dry soil conditions. Precision data under well-controlled transient heat and wind boundary conditions were generated, and results from numerical simulations were compared with experimental data. Results demonstrate that the approaches based on different boundary conditions varied in their ability to capture different stages of evaporation. All approaches have benefits and limitations, and no one approach can be deemed most appropriate for every scenario. Comparisons of different formulations of the surface boundary condition validate the need for further research on heat and vapor transport processes in soil for better modeling accuracy.

AB Existing, high-fidelity models for sewer network modeling are accurate but too slow and inflexible for modern applications such as optimization or scenario analysis. Reduced complexity surrogate modeling has been applied in response to this, however, current approaches are expensive to set up and still require high-fidelity simulations to derive parameters. In this study, we compare and develop graph partitioning algorithms to automatically group sections of sewer networks into semi-distributed compartments. These compartments can then be simulated using sewer network information only in the integrated modeling framework, CityWat-SemiDistributed (CWSD), which has been developed for application to sewer network modeling in this study. We find that combining graph partitioning with CWSD can produce accurate simulations 100-1,000x faster than existing high-fidelity modeling. Because we anticipate that many CWSD users will not have high-fidelity models available, we demonstrate that the approach provides reasonable simulations even under significant parametric uncertainty through a sensitivity analysis. We compare multiple graph partitioning techniques enabling users to specify the spatial aggregation of the partitioned network, also enabling them to preserve key locations for simulation. We test the impact of temporal resolution, finding that accurate simulations can be produced with timesteps up to one hour. Our experiments show a log-log relationship between temporal/spatial resolution and simulation time, enabling users to pre-specify the efficiency and accuracy needed for their applications. We expect that the efficiency and flexibility of our approach may facilitate novel applications of sewer network models ranging from continuous simulations for long-term planning to spatially optimizing the placement of network sensors.

AB Accurate prediction of runoff signatures is important for numerous hydrological and water resources applications. However, there are lack of comprehensive evaluations of various approaches for predicting hydrological signatures. This study, for the first time, introduces regression tree ensemble approach and compares it with other three widely used approaches (multiple linear regression, multiple log-transformed linear regression, and hydrological modeling) for assessing prediction accuracy of 13 runoff characteristics or signatures, using a large data set from 605 catchments across Australia. The climate, in particular, mean annual precipitation and aridity index, has the most significant influence on the runoff signatures. Physical catchment attributes including forest ratio, slope, and soil water holding capacity also have significant influence (p < 0.05) on the runoff signatures. All four approaches can predict the long-term average and high flow signatures accurately. The regression approaches can also well predict majority of the other runoff signatures, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency larger than 0.60. The regression tree ensemble outperforms the two linear regressions in predicting signatures of flow dynamics. The hydrological models, calibrated to one specific objective criterion, cannot predict many of the runoff signatures, particularly those reflecting low flows and flow dynamics. This is because in most hydrological model applications, the simulations allow satisfactory predictions of long-term average and high flow signatures. In applications where a specific runoff signature is needed, regression relationships that directly relate that runoff signature to catchment attributes give the best predictions. Here the regression tree ensemble is overall best and offers significant potential, being able to predict most of the runoff signatures very well.

AB Recent computational studies of two-phase flow suggest that the role of fluid-fluid interfaces should be explicitly included in the capillarity equation as well as equations of motion of phases. The aim of this study has been to perform experiments where transient movement of interfaces can be monitored and to determine interfacial variables and quantities under transient conditions. We have performed two-phase flow experiments in a transparent micromodel. Specific interfacial area is defined, and calculated from experimental data, as the ratio of the total area of interfaces between two phases per unit volume of the porous medium. Recent studies have shown that all drainage and imbibition data points for capillary pressure, saturation, and specific interfacial area fall on a unique surface. But, up to now, almost all micromodel studies of two-phase flow have dealt with quasi-static or steady state flow conditions. Thus, only equilibrium properties have been studied. We present the first study of two-phase flow in an elongated PDMS micromodel under transient conditions with high temporal and spatial resolutions. We have established that different relationships between capillary pressure, saturation, and specific interfacial area are obtained under steady state and transient conditions. The difference between the surfaces depends on the capillary number. Furthermore, we use our experimental results to obtain average (macroscale) velocity of fluid-fluid interfaces and the rate of change of specific interfacial area as a function of time and space. Both terms depend on saturation nonlinearly but show a linear dependence on the rate of change of saturation. We also determine macroscale material coefficients that appear in the equation of motion of fluid-fluid interfaces. This is the first time that these parameters are determined experimentally.

AB Field and column studies of biocolloid transport in porous media have yielded a large body of information, used to design treatment systems, protect water supplies and assess the risk of pathogen contamination. However, the inherent "black-box" approach of these larger scales has resulted in generalizations that sometimes prove inaccurate. Over the past 10-15 years, pore scale visualization techniques have improved substantially, allowing the study of biocolloid transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media at a level that provides a very clear understanding of the processes that govern biocolloid movement. For example, it is now understood that the reduction in pathways for biocolloids as a function of their size leads to earlier breakthrough. Interception of biocolloids by the porous media used to be considered independent of fluid flow velocity, but recent work indicates that there is a relationship between them. The existence of almost stagnant pore water regions within a porous medium can lead to storage of biocolloids, but this process is strongly colloid-size dependent, since larger biocolloids are focused along the central streamlines in the flowing fluid. Interfaces, such as the air water interface, the soil-water interface and the soil-water-air interface, play a major role in attachment and detachment, with significant implications for risk assessment and system design. Important research questions related to the pore-scale factors that control attachment and detachment are key to furthering our understanding of the transport of biocolloids in porous media.

AB Identifying key driving forces for streamflow variation is essential for improving sustainable water resource management in terms of understanding how changes in the watershed translate to changes in streamflow. In this study, the relationships between trends in total annual streamflow and trends in watershed characteristics across the contiguous U.S. during 1981-2016 are investigated with data from 2,621 USGS gages. The regions of homogeneous hydrologic change, i.e. watersheds that are undergoing similar statistically significant streamflow trends, are delineated and frequent pattern mining (i.e. Apriori algorithm) and variable importance (i.e. Random Forest) are used to derive the key driving forces for these regions. As expected, the trends in streamflow are highly associated with the trends of precipitation. In contrast, the influences of anthropogenic factors vary substantially across regions. Particularly, the influence of water use change tends to be significant in the regions dominated by agricultural land, e.g. Dakotas. The importance of land use change is highlighted in the regions with relatively large forest coverage, e.g. Northeast. However, these important identified water use changes are not frequently associated with the increasing streamflow in sub-regions, e.g. Great Lakes, and thus the significance of the water use impacts are site-specific. Therefore, the changes in climate and land use are frequently and importantly identified together in the sub-regions with increasing streamflow, which can be collectively used to discover the major causes of the streamflow trends in those regions. Although the impacts of changing water use are highlighted in the Southwest, climate trends are primarily responsible for the decreasing streamflow.

AB The flow duration curve (FDC) is a hydrologically meaningful representation of the statistical distribution of daily streamflows. The complexity of processes contributing to the FDC introduces challenges for the direct exploration of physical controls on FDC. In this paper, the controls of climate and catchment characteristics on FDC are explored using a stochastic framework that enables construction of the FDC from three components of streamflow: fast and slow flow (during wet days) and slow flow during dry days. The FDC during wet days (FDCw) is computed as the statistical sum of the fast flow duration curve (FFDC) and the slow flow duration curve (SFDCw), considering their dependency. FDC is modeled as the mixture distribution of FDCw and the slow flow duration curve during dry days (SFDCd), by considering the fraction of wet days (delta) for perennial streams and both delta and the fraction of days of zero streamflow for ephemeral streams. The Kappa distribution is employed to fit the FFDC, SFDCw, and SFDCd for 300 catchments from Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) across the United States. Results show that the 0-20th percentile of FDC is controlled by FFDC and SFDCw, the 90-100th percentile of FDC is controlled by SFDCd, and the 20-90th percentile of FDC is controlled by three components. The relationships between estimated Kappa distribution parameters and climate and catchment characteristics reveal that the aridity index, the coefficient of variation of daily precipitation, timing of precipitation, time interval between storms, snow, topographic slope, and slope of recession slope curve are dominant controlling factors.

AB The recently introduced geological entropy concept evaluates spatial order/disorder in the structure of the hydraulic conductivity (K) field to explain and predict certain characteristics of transport behavior. This concept is expanded in this work by introducing a novel tool for spatial analysis called entrogram from which a metric called entropic scale (H-S) can be calculated to measure the overall persistency of patterns of spatial association in a distributed field and to allow robust comparisons between different spatial structures. The entrogram and the entropic scale concepts are applied here to investigate the link between solute transport behavior and the spatial structure of K fields modeled as the distribution of three hydrofacies in alluvial aquifers. Accurate empirical relationships are found between H-S and key transport quantities confirming the clear correlation between transport and the structure of the K field described in terms of its entropic scale. The entrogram analysis is also applied to continuous 2-D and 3-D fields having identical lognormal K distributions, but with different connectivity. Comparisons between the entrograms and the calculated H-S values for these fields, as well as for their corresponding flow velocity distributions, shed light on the key differences among these structures in 2-D and in 3-D, which in turn explain their dissimilar impact on solute transport. The entrogram-based interpretation of the transport simulations seems to confirm that the geological entropy is a promising approach for predicting solute transport behavior simply from a description of the K field heterogeneity.

AB Improved understanding of stream solute transport requires meaningful comparison of processes across a wide range of discharge conditions and spatial scales. At reach scales where solute tracer tests are commonly used to assess transport behavior, such comparison is still confounded due to the challenge of separating dispersive and transient storage processes from the influence of the advective timescale that varies with discharge and reach length. To better resolve interpretation of these processes from field-based tracer observations, we conducted recurrent conservative solute tracer tests along a 1 km study reach during a storm discharge period and further discretized the study reach into six segments of similar length but different channel morphologies. The resulting suite of data, spanning an order of magnitude in advective timescales, enabled us to (1) characterize relationships between tracer response and discharge in individual segments and (2) determine how combining the segments into longer reaches influences interpretation of dispersion and transient storage from tracer tests. We found that the advective timescale was the primary control on the shape of the observed tracer response. Most segments responded similarly to discharge, implying that the influence of morphologic heterogeneity was muted relative to advection. Comparison of tracer data across combined segments demonstrated that increased advective timescales could be misinterpreted as a change in dispersion or transient storage. Taken together, our results stress the importance of characterizing the influence of changing advective timescales on solute tracer responses before such reach-scale observations can be used to infer solute transport at larger network scales.

AB The effect of bedrock permeability and underlying catchment boundaries on stream base flow mean transit time (MTT) and MTT scaling relationships in headwater catchments is poorly understood. Here we examine the effect of bedrock permeability on MTT and MTT scaling relations by comparing 15 nested research catchments in western Oregon; half within the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and half at the site of the Alsea Watershed Study. The two sites share remarkably similar vegetation, topography, and climate and differ only in bedrock permeability (one poorly permeable volcanic rock and the other more permeable sandstone). We found longer MTTs in the catchments with more permeable fractured and weathered sandstone bedrock than in the catchments with tight, volcanic bedrock (on average, 6.2 versus 1.8 years, respectively). At the permeable bedrock site, 67% of the variance in MTT across catchments scales was explained by drainage area, with no significant correlation to topographic characteristics. The poorly permeable site had opposite scaling relations, where MTT showed no correlation to drainage area but the ratio of median flow path length to median flow path gradient explained 91% of the variance in MTT across seven catchment scales. Despite these differences, hydrometric analyses, including flow duration and recession analysis, and storm response analysis, show that the two sites share relatively indistinguishable hydrodynamic behavior. These results show that similar catchment forms and hydrologic regimes hide different subsurface routing, storage, and scaling behaviora major issue if only hydrometric data are used to define hydrological similarity for assessing land use or climate change response.

AB Pore-scale models are useful for studying relationships between fundamental processes and phenomena at larger (i.e., Darcy) scales. However, the size of domains that can be simulated with explicit pore-scale resolution is limited by computational and observational constraints. Direct numerical simulation of pore-scale flow and transport is typically performed on millimeter-scale volumes at which X-ray computed tomography (XCT), often used to characterize pore geometry, can achieve micrometer resolution. In contrast, laboratory experiments that measure continuum properties are typically performed on decimeter-scale columns. At this scale, XCT resolution is coarse (tens to hundreds of micrometers) and prohibits characterization of small pores and grains. We performed simulations of pore-scale processes over a decimeter-scale volume of natural porous media with a wide range of grain sizes, and compared to results of column experiments using the same sample. Simulations were conducted using high-performance codes executed on a supercomputer. Two approaches to XCT image segmentation were evaluated, a binary (pores and solids) segmentation and a ternary segmentation that resolved a third category (porous solids with pores smaller than the imaged resolution). We used a multiscale Stokes-Darcy simulation method to simulate the combination of Stokes flow in large open pores and Darcy-like flow in porous solid regions. Flow and transport simulations based on the binary segmentation were inconsistent with experimental observations because of overestimation of large connected pores. Simulations based on the ternary segmentation provided results that were consistent with experimental observations, demonstrating our ability to successfully model pore-scale flow over a column-scale domain.

TI Field experimental approach to bromide leaching as affected by
   scale-specific rainfall characteristics

   MOVEMENT; TABLE; TIME; SALT
AB Although inherent soil spatial and temporal variabilities complicate analysis of solute leaching, impacts of specific processes associated with rainfall amount, intensity, and frequency on solute leaching under field conditions require investigation. The objective of this study was to introduce (1) a new experimental approach to quantify bromide (Br-) leaching under field conditions as influenced by rainfall characteristics and (2) analytical opportunities applicable to scale-specific spatial treatment distribution. The quantitative range of treatments was established in nonrandom periodically oscillating patterns. The characteristic length of a period over which a treatment fluctuates was considered the specific treatment scale. A Br- tracer study was established in the field with treatments applied at two different spatial scales. The tracer was applied with a sprayer in a transect of 32 plots, each 2 m long, followed by a site-specific sprinkler irrigation, and 128 soil cores subsequently taken at 0.5 m intervals and divided into 10-cm depth increments. The scale-specific associations between treatments and Br- center of mass (COM) were addressed. Treatments can be periodically imposed over specific scales and their spatial relationships quantified with semivariance and power spectral analysis. An additive state-space model was applied to separate the long-and short-wave components of Br- COM. Subsequently, the large-scale process was described in an autoregressive state-space model. The proposed experimental approach and the separation of small-and large-scale variability components support studying soil ecosystem processes that vary at different scales even in the presence of underlying large-scale trends that are currently considered obstacles in field research.

TI Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE): A modular

AB The problems of identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure remain outstanding research challenges for the discipline of hydrology. Progress on these problems requires understanding of the nature of differences between models. This paper presents a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures: the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE). FUSE was used to construct 79 unique model structures by combining components of 4 existing hydrological models. These new models were used to simulate streamflow in two of the basins used in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX): the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina). Results show that the new models produced simulations of streamflow that were at least as good as the simulations produced by the models that participated in the MOPEX experiment. Our initial application of the FUSE method for the Guadalupe River exposed relationships between model structure and model performance, suggesting that the choice of model structure is just as important as the choice of model parameters. However, further work is needed to evaluate model simulations using multiple criteria to diagnose the relative importance of model structural differences in various climate regimes and to assess the amount of independent information in each of the models. This work will be crucial to both identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure. To facilitate research on these problems, the FORTRAN-90 source code for FUSE is available upon request from the lead author.

AB Ecosystems of dry climates are a particularly interesting subject for ecohydrological studies, as water is generally considered to be the key limiting resource. This work focuses on vegetation-water-energy dynamics occurring on the complex terrain of a semiarid area characteristic of central New Mexico. The study employs a mechanistic model of coupled interactions to construct a set of numerical experiments carried out for two small-scale synthetic domains that exhibit particular hillslope curvatures. The linkages between terrain attributes and patterns of C-4 grass productivity and water balance components are examined for three generic soil types. It is argued that in conditions of negligible moisture exchange, aspect and slope are the key determinants of both the hydrologic behavior and the degree of site "favorability'' to vegetation. Certain topographic locations are more favorable to vegetation, as compared to a flat horizontal surface not influenced by lateral effects. These locations are associated with sites of northerly aspect with surface slopes within a narrow range of magnitudes. Contributions from both rainfall and radiation forcings are discussed to explain the existence of these topographic niches. The sensitivity of results is investigated by modifying the dominant mechanism of lateral water transfer. Two additional controlling topographic features are explored, corresponding to the contiguous and global terrain convergence levels. It is argued that their effects on vegetation-hydrology dynamics at a given location are characteristically superimposed with the impact of site-specific terrain attributes. Furthermore, the results lead to a conceptual relationship linking vegetation-hydrology quantities at different landscape locations.

Furthermore, investigating surface water/groundwater interactions within wetlands is now acknowledged to be essential in order to better understand the effect of wetland hydrology on water quality. In this study, the development of a general comprehensive wetland model Wetland Solute Transport Dynamics (WETSAND) that has both surface flow and solute transport components is presented. The model incorporates surface water/groundwater interactions and accounts for upstream contributions from urbanized areas. The effect of restored wetlands on storm water runoff is also investigated by routing the overland flow through the wetland area, collecting the runoff within the stream, and transporting it to the receiving water using diffusion wave routing techniques. The computed velocity profiles are subsequently used to obtain water quality concentration distributions in wetland areas. The water quality component solves the advection-dispersion equation for several nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, and it also incorporates the surface water/groundwater interactions by including the incoming/outgoing mass due to the groundwater recharge/discharge. In addition, output from the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) is incorporated into this conceptual wetland model to simulate the runoff quantity and quality flowing into a wetland area from upstream urban sources. Additionally, the model can simulate a water control structure using storage routing principles and known stage-discharge spillway relationships.

AB We use a large and diverse data set from mountain streams around the world to explore relationships between reach-scale channel morphology and control variables. The data set includes 177 step-pool reaches, 44 plane-bed reaches, and 114 pool-riffle reaches from the western United States, Panama, and New Zealand. We performed several iterations of stepwise discriminant analysis on these data. A three-variable discriminant function using slope (S), D-84, and channel width (w) produced an error rate of 24% for the entire data set. Seventy percent of plane-bed reaches were correctly classified (16% incorrectly classified as pool-riffle and 14% incorrectly classified as step-pool). Sixty-seven percent of pool-riffle channels were correctly classified (31% incorrectly classified as plane-bed and 2% as step-pool). Eighty-nine percent of step-pool reaches were correctly classified (9% incorrectly classified as plane-bed and 2% as pool-riffle). The partial R 2 values and F tests indicate that S is by far the most significant single explanatory variable. Comparison of the eight discriminant functions developed using different data sets indicates that no single variable is present in all functions, suggesting that the discriminant functions are sensitive to the specific stream reaches being analyzed. However, the three-variable discriminant function developed from the entire data set correctly classified 69% of the 159 channels included in an independent validation data set. The ability to accurately classify channel type in other regions using the three-variable discriminant function developed from the entire data set has important implications for water resources management, such as facilitating prediction of channel morphology using regional S-w-D-84 relations calibrated with minimal field work.

AB Karst aquifers provide large parts of the water supply for Mediterranean countries, though climate change is expected to have a significant negative impact on water availability. Recharge is therefore a key variable that has to be known for sustainable groundwater use. In this study, we present a new approach that combines two independent methods for karst recharge estimation. The first method derives spatially distributed information of mean annual recharge patterns through GIS analysis. The second is a process-based karst model that provides spatially lumped but temporally distributed information about recharge. By combining both methods, we add a spatial reference to the lumped simulations of the process-based model. In this way, we are able to provide spatiotemporal information of recharge and subsurface flow dynamics also during varying hydroclimatic conditions. We find that there is a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and recharge rates resulting in strong decreases of recharge following even moderate decreases of precipitation. This is primarily due to almost constant actual evapotranspiration amounts despite varying hydroclimatic conditions. During the driest year in the record, almost the entire precipitation was consumed as actual evapotranspiration and only little diffuse recharge took place at the high altitudes of our study site. During wettest year, recharge constituted a much larger fraction of precipitation and occurred at the entire study site. Our new method and our findings are significant for decision makers in similar regions that want to prepare for possible changes of hydroclimatic conditions in the future.
   Key Points
   A new approach for spatiotemporal recharge estimation for karst aquifers Impacts of hydroclimatic extremes on the entire karst system are elaborated Recharge rates are more sensitive to a precipitation decrease than an increase

AB This study aims to develop a simulation-based optimization model applicable to mitigate hazardous floods in storm events in a watershed which consists of a complex channel network and irregular topography. A well-established model, CCHE1D, is used as the simulation model to predict water stages and discharges of unsteady flood flows in a channel network, in which irregular (i.e. non-rectangular and non-prismatic) cross-sections are taken into account. Based on the variational principle, the adjoint equations are derived from the nonlinear hydrodynamic equations of CCHE1D, which are to establish a unique relationship between flood control variables and hydrodynamic variables. The internal conditions at the confluence in channel network for solving the adjoint equations in a watershed are obtained. An implicit numerical scheme (i.e. Preissman's scheme) is implemented for discretizing and solving the adjoint equations with the derived internal conditions and boundary conditions. The applicability of this integrated optimization model is demonstrated by searching for the optimal diversion hydrographs for withdrawing flood waters through a single floodgate and multiple floodgates into detention basins. Numerical optimization results show that this integrated model is efficient and robust. It is found that the single-floodgate control leads to an unfavorable speed-up in river flow which may create extra erosions in the channel bed; and multiple-floodgates diversion control diverts less flood waters, therefore can be a cost-effective control action. This simulation-based optimization model is capable of determining the optimal schedules of diversion discharge, optimal floodgate locations, minimum capacities of flood water detention basins in rivers and watersheds.

AB Accurate characterization and modeling of subsurface how in multi-fluid soil systems require development of a rapid, reproducible experimental method that yields the information necessary to determine the parameters of the capillary pressure-saturation and permeability functions. Previous work has demonstrated that parameter optimization using inverse modeling is a powerful approach to indirectly determine these constitutive relationships for air-water systems. We consider extension of the inverse parameter estimation method to the modified multi-step outflow method for two-fluid (air-water, air-oil and oil-water) flow systems. The wellposedness of the proposed parameter estimation problem is evaluated by its accuracy, uniqueness and parameter uncertainty. Seven different parametric models for the capillary pressure-saturation and permeability functions were tested in their ability to fit the multi-step outflow experimental data; these included the van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) model, van Genuchten-Burdine (VGB), Brooks-Corey-Mualem (BCM), Brooks-Corey-Burdine (BCB), Brutsaert-Burdine (BRB), Gardner-Mualem (GDM) and Lognormal Distribution-Mualem (LNM) models. The VGB, BCM and BCB models fitted the multi-step outflow data poorly, and resulted in relatively large values for the root-mean-squared residuals. It was concluded that the remaining VGM, LNM, BRB and GDM models successfully characterized the multi-step experimental data for two-fluid flow systems. Although having one parameter less than the other models, the GDM model's performance was excellent. Finally, we conclude that optimized capillary pressure-saturation functions for the oil-water and air-oil could be predicted from the respective air-water function using interfacial tension ratios.

ID COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS
AB Multi-event universal kriging (MEUK) is a method of interpolation that creates a series of maps, each corresponding to a specific sampling "event", which exhibit spatial relationships that persist over time MEUK is computed using minimum-variance unbiased linear prediction from data obtained via a sequence of events. MEUK assumes multi-event data can be described by a sum of (a) spatial trends that vary over time, (b) spatial trends that are invariant over time, and (c) spatially- and temporally-stationary correlation among the residuals from the combination of these trends. The fundamental advance made by MEUK versus traditional universal kriging (UK) lies with the generalized least squares (GLS) model and the multi event capability it facilitates, rather than in the geostatistics, although it is shown how use of MEUK can greatly reduce predictive variances versus UK. For expediency, MEUK assumes a spatial covariance that does not change over time although it does not have to - which is an advantage over space-time methods that employ a full space-time covariance function. MEUK can be implemented with large multi event datasets, as demonstrated by application to a large water level ciataset. Often, MEUK enables the stable solution of multiple events for similar computational effort as for a single event. MEUK provides an efficient basis for developing "wheel-and-axle" monitoring strategies 1321 that combines frequently sampled locations used monitor changes over time with many more locations sampled periodically to provide synoptic depictions. MEUK can aid in the identification of the core monitoring locations, allowing for reduced sampling frequency elsewhere. Although MEUK can incorporate longitudinal variograms as in other space-time methods, doing so reduces the computational advantages of MEUK. (C) 2015 Elsev er Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many natural environments, such as in underwater hot springs and hydrothermal vents, thermal gradients are accompanied with changes in the concentration of chemical compounds transported to the seawater, causing the so-called double-diffusive, mixed convection. To study the physical scenarios in such systems, a vertical channel filled with a porous medium saturated with saline water is considered. The motion in the sediment-filled channel is induced by two buoyancy forces and an external pressure gradient, similar to the situation in a vent with an upward flow direction. The fluid flow has been modeled by an extended Darcy model, and the flow instability mechanisms have been studied numerically. The linear stability analysis is performed considering a wide range of Darcy number (Da = 10(-5) -10(-8)). The instability boundary curve showed three distinct dynamic regimes: (i) Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T), (ii) log-log non-linear variation, and (iii) log-log linear variation. The domain of different regimes were sensitive to external pressure gradient as well as permeability. Similar to cross-diffusive natural convection in pure viscous fluids, a linear relationship between logarithmic absolute values of critical thermal Rayleigh number (vertical bar Ra-T vertical bar) and solute Rayleigh number (Ra-C) is found in the third regime. Based on the permeability, for any solute Rayleigh number (Ra-C), there existed a minimum value of Reynolds number (Re), below which R-T type of instability appeared. Above this minimum value, the instability was due to two buoyancy forces, known as buoyant instability. Simulations of secondary flow via energy analysis demonstrated the development of complex dynamics at the critical state in all three regimes characterized by transition of multi to uni-cellular structures and vice verse.

AB The present study examined groundwater recharge/discharge mechanisms in the regional Central Sudan Rift Basins (CSRB). Aquifers in CSRB constitute poorly sorted silisiclastics of sand, clay and gravels deposited in closed hydrologic systems of the Cretaceous-Pleistocene fluviolacustrine environments. CSRB are bounded to the north by the highlands of the Central African Shear Zone (CAZS) that represents the surface and groundwater divides. Sporadic recharge in the peripheries of the basins along the CASZ occurs subsequent to decadal and centennial storm events. Inflow from the Nile into the aquifers represents an additional source of recharge. Thus, groundwater resources cannot be labelled fossil nor can they be readily recharged. Closed hydrologic troughs located adjacent to the influent Nile system mark areas of main groundwater discharge characterized by lower hydraulic heads. This study has examined mechanisms that derive the discharge of the groundwater in these closed basins and concluded that only evapotranspirative discharge can provide a plausible explanation. Groundwater abstraction is mainly through deep-rooted trees and effective evaporation. The increase of TDS along the flow indicates local recharge at the peripheries of basins and shows the influence of evaporation and rock/water interaction. The decline in groundwater level along a flow path was calculated using Darcy's law to estimate average recharge and evapotranspirative discharge, which are equal under natural equilibrium and make the only fluxes in CSRB. Steady-state 2D flow modelling has demonstrated that an average recharge of 4-8 mm yr(-1) and evapotranspirative discharge of 1-22 mm yr(-1) will maintain natural equilibrium in CSRB. Sporadic storms provide recharge in the highlands to preserve the current hydraulic gradient and maintain aquifer dynamics. Simulated recharge from the Nile totals about 17.5 mm yr(-1) and is therefore a significant contributor to the water balance. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The goal of this work is to improve the inference of nonaqueous-phase contaminated source zone architectures (CSA) from field data. We follow the idea that a physically motivated model for CSA formation helps in this inference by providing relevant relationships between observables and the unknown CSA. Typical multiphase models are computationally too expensive to be applied for inverse modeling; thus, state-of-the-art CSA identification techniques do not yet use physically based CSA formation models. To overcome this shortcoming, we apply a stochastic multiphase model with reduced computational effort that can be used to generate a large ensemble of possible CSA realizations. Further, we apply a reverse transport formulation in order to accelerate the inversion of transport-related data such as downgradient aqueous-phase concentrations. We combine these approaches within an inverse Bayesian methodology for joint inversion of CSA and aquifer parameters. Because we use multiphase physics to constrain and inform the inversion, (1) only physically meaningful CSAs are inferred; (2) each conditional realization is statistically meaningful; (3) we obtain physically meaningful spatial dependencies for interpolation and extrapolation of point-like observations between the different involved unknowns and observables, and (4) dependencies far beyond simple correlation; (5) the inversion yields meaningful uncertainty bounds. We illustrate our concept by inferring three-dimensional probability distributions of DNAPL residence, contaminant mass discharge, and of other CSA characteristics. In the inference example, we use synthetic numerical data on permeability, DNAPL saturation and downgradient aqueous-phase concentration, and we substantiate our claims about the advantages of emulating a multiphase flow model with reduced computational requirement in the inversion.

AB A quantification of the fine sediment budget of a wadi (dryland river) in NW Algeria is presented for a period of 22 hydrological years (1973-1995). The climate is Mediterranean over the Wadi Abd basin (2480 km(2)), the mean annual precipitation is 250 mm and the mean annual discharge is 1.0 m(3) s(-1) at the gauging station. Regression relationships between water discharge Q and suspended sediment concentration C are calculated from 1432 paired measurements in the Wadi Abd, leading to power-law equations of the type C = a Q(b). The variability of coefficients a and b, calculated for 138 floods and flood stages, is analyzed. The median value of b is 0.757, indicating that C is almost proportional to Q(3/4). Given that the (a, b) pairs are correctly aligned (r(2) = 0.578), the coefficients a and b are not independent. Regression relationships between daily Q and daily suspended sediment concentration and discharge Q(s) are calculated from 702 input data. The performances of these regression relationships are shown to be equivalent, leading to over-estimations of 20-25% of the suspended sediment flux. The non-biased C-Q sediment rating curve is used to extrapolate a time series of C measurements, and thus to analyze the long-term patterns in suspended sediment transport. Average sediment wash-down (136 t km(-2) yr(-1)) is similar to the mean global value. The ratio of sediment wash-down to the river water discharge is 10.7 x 10(6) t km(3), 20 times greater than the average ratio in the Earth's eastern hemisphere, and illustrates the highly erosive power of wadis. Variability is shown to be significant at the seasonal scale (CV = 89%) and higher at the interannual scale (CV = 139%). The fine sediment flux mainly occurs in autumn (48.4%) and spring (32.7%). Although precipitation decreased, it was more irregular from one year to another over the period 1985-1995 than during the period 1973-1985, and the Wadi Abd, which was a perennial river, became intermittent in the late 1980s. This increasing irregularity is accompanied by: an amplification of the variations of discharge, an increase in the average discharge of approximately 20% during the second period, and a higher and more irregular suspended particulate flux. The mean annual suspended sediment yield is shown to be highly correlated with the standard deviation of mean daily discharge calculated per year (r(2) = 0.989). The highly significant interannual. variability points to the difficulty of defining a suitable period to calculate a reference value for sediment budgets. It also emphasizes the absolute necessity of continuing a series of measurements over Longer time periods to study fluctuations in the context of climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The paper deals with the hydro-chemical analysis performed in order to reveal processes, sources, paths and timing of the runoff generation in an experimental catchment representative of the hilly, terrigenous and forested watershed in the Mediterranean humid eco-region of southern Italy. The analysis is based on the data recorded at the outlet of the catchment during 2013-2014. A mixing law procedure was applied on discharge (Q) and electrical conductivity (EC) data, by using the Q-EC end members previously collected at selected groundwater, sub-surficial and surficial stations. In this way, we found four bound curves delimiting fields in a Q-EC plot, each with hydro-chemograph value ranges. At annual time scale, the analysis revealed a seasonal behaviour of the hydrological response, different for the wet period, when the aquifer is recharging, and the dry periods, when the aquifer is discharging, despite frequent summer rain showers. At event time scale, the catchment seems to show the behaviour of a typical hydro-geomorphic threshold system. We interpreted this behaviour as due to a progressive addition of water from distinctive components (i.e. deep aquifer, riparian corridor, hillslope and hollow), each with originally different mechanisms of runoff production (i.e. groundwater, groundwater ridging, saturation excess, infiltration excess and soil pipe exfiltration) and response time. During the event, the contributing areas enlarge upward the riparian corridors and the zero-order basins, where the aforementioned components become superposed and the mechanisms interact more and more. We hypothesize that the threshold values between different states of the system are defined by the intersections of the boundary curves on the Q-EC plot. Different patterns in the Q-EC hysteretic cycles are prevalently related to the pre-event soil saturation and groundwater contributions to stormflow and recharge mechanisms.

AB Experiments were conducted with a laboratory-scale variable-aperture dolomite rock fracture to compare the transport of virus-sized microspheres and viruses. Transport tests were conducted using bromide, two sizes (20 and 200 nm diameter) of carboxylatemodified latex (CML) microspheres, and two bacteriophages (MS2 and PR772) that are often used as pathogenic virus surrogates. Retention of negatively charged MS2 was two to three times lower than retention of similarly sized negatively charged 20 nm microspheres, in contrast to expectations from Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory. Retention and transport of MS2 and PR772 were much closer to that of the 200 nm microspheres, with approximately 20% greater retention of MS2 compared to PR772 for all conditions tested. Microsphere transport was more significantly affected by ionic strength than the bacteriophage transport, particularly the 20 nm microspheres. Impacts of calcium chloride were significant and different for microspheres compared to bacteriophages. Application of a one-dimensional advection-dispersion transport model with two types of kinetic attachment and detachment terms gave good fits to microsphere and bacteriophage transport data. However, blocking was required to accurately simulate transport of the 20 and 200 nm microspheres. Blocking was not a significant process for MS2 or PR772 under most conditions tested. Overall, results indicate that 20 nm CML microspheres are not suitable surrogates for transport of MS2 and PR772 in fractured dolomite, and therefore, likely not suitable as surrogates for other viral pathogens. The 200 nm microspheres would be more suitable as surrogates but show different responses to changes in solution chemistry compared to bacteriophages. Citation: Mondal, P. K., and B. E.

AB Rainfall is arguably the most important yet most variable input for rainfall-runoff hydrologic models. In this study, the authors search for the characteristics of radar-rainfall estimates that are most important for skillful streamflow predictions. They perform comprehensive hydrologic investigations of radar-rainfall characteristics, including spatiotemporal resolution, radar range visibility, statistical characterization of rainfall variability, all vis-a-vis basin characteristics such as size and river network topology. Since the true rainfall fields are unknown, the authors exploit a paradigm of using two independently constructed radar-rainfall products i.e., Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor and IFC-ZR used operationally by the Iowa Flood Center (IFC). Using the distributed hydrologic model called the Hillslope-Link Model for the domain of the state of Iowa, they evaluate streamflow prediction at 140 USGS gauge stations that monitor rivers in Iowa. Through spatial and temporal rainfall aggregation experiments, the authors show that the impact of spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall is significant typically for smaller basins while starts reducing significantly for basins larger than 1,000 km(2). Other rainfall characteristics they explored do not reveal a strong signature in the relationship of rainfall differences between the two products and hydrograph errors. However, exploring the product similarities rather than differences reveals that the basin-wide rainfall volume has the most significant effect on streamflow prediction. The results from this study are generalizable for all rainfall observing systems.

AB Many details about the flow of water in soils in a hillslope are unknowable given current technologies. One way of learning about the bulk effects of water velocity distributions on hillslopes is through the use of tracers. However, this paper will demonstrate that the interpretation of tracer information needs to become more sophisticated. The paper reviews, and complements with mathematical arguments and specific examples, theory and practice of the distribution(s) of the times water particles injected through rainfall spend traveling through a catchment up to a control section (i.e., "catchment" travel times). The relevance of the work is perceived to lie in the importance of the characterization of travel time distributions as fundamental descriptors of catchment water storage, flow pathway heterogeneity, sources of water in a catchment, and the chemistry of water flows through the control section. The paper aims to correct some common misconceptions used in analyses of travel time distributions. In particular, it stresses the conceptual and practical differences between the travel time distribution conditional on a given injection time (needed for rainfall-runoff transformations) and that conditional on a given sampling time at the outlet (as provided by isotopic dating techniques or tracer measurements), jointly with the differences of both with the residence time distributions of water particles in storage within the catchment at any time. These differences are defined precisely here, either through the results of different models or theoretically by using an extension of a classic theorem of dynamic controls. Specifically, we address different model results to highlight the features of travel times seen from different assumptions, in this case, exact solutions to a lumped model and numerical solutions of the 3-D flow and transport equations in variably saturated, physically heterogeneous catchment domains. Our results stress the individual characters of the relevant distributions and their general nonstationarity yielding their legitimate interchange only in very particular conditions rarely achieved in the field. We also briefly discuss the impact of oversimple assumptions commonly used in analyses of tracer data.

AB We present results from pore-scale observations of colloid transport in an unsaturated physical micromodel. The experiments were conducted separately using three different sizes of carboxylate polystyrene latex spheres and Bacteriophage MS2 virus. The main focus was to investigate the pore-scale transport processes of colloids as they interact with the air-water interface (AWI) of trapped air bubbles in unsaturated porous media, as well as the release of colloids during imbibition. The colloids travel through the water phase but are attracted to the AWI by either collision or attractive forces and are accumulated at the AWI almost irreversibly, until the dissolution of the air bubble reduces or eliminates the AWI. Once the air bubbles are near the end of the dissolution process, the colloids can be transported by advective liquid flow, as colloidal clusters. The clusters can then attach to other AWI down-gradient or be trapped in pore throats that would have allowed them to pass through individually. We also observed small air bubbles with attached colloids that traveled through the porous medium during the gas dissolution process. We used Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to help explain the observed results. The strength of the force that holds the colloids at the AWI was estimated, assuming that the capillary force is the major force that holds the colloids at the AWI. Our calculations indicate that the forces that hold the colloids at the AWI are larger than the energy barrier between the colloids. Therefore it is quite likely that the clusters of colloids are formed by the colloids attached at the AWI as they move closer at the end of the bubble dissolution process. Coagulation at the AWI may increase the overall filtration for colloids transported through the vadose zone. Just as important, colloids trapped in the AWI might be quite mobile when the air bubbles are released at the end of the dissolution process, resulting in increased breakthrough. These pore-scale mechanisms are likely to play a significant role in the macroscopic transport of colloids in unsaturated porous media.

AB Over the past two decades there have been repeated calls for the collection of new data for use in developing hydrological science. The last few years have begun to bear fruit from the seeds sown by these calls, through increases in the availability and utility of remote sensing data, as well as the execution of campaigns in research catchments aimed at providing new data for advancing hydrological understanding and predictive capability. In this paper we discuss some philosophical considerations related to model complexity, data availability and predictive performance, highlighting the potential of observed patterns in moving the science and practice of catchment hydrology forward. We then review advances that have arisen from recent work on spatial patterns, including in the characterisation of spatial structure and heterogeneity, and the use of patterns for developing, calibrating and testing distributed hydrological models. We illustrate progress via examples using observed patterns of snow cover, runoff occurrence and soil moisture. Methods for the comparison of patterns are presented, illustrating how they can be used to assess hydrologically important characteristics of model performance. These methods include point-to-point comparisons, Spatial relationships between errors and landscape parameters, transects, and optimal local alignment. It is argued that the progress made to date augers well for future developments, but there is scope for improvements in several areas. These include better quantitative methods for pattern comparisons, better use of pattern information in data assimilation and modelling, and a call for improved archiving of data from field studies to assist in comparative studies for generalising results and developing fundamental understanding.

AB The interaction of geomechanics and flow within a soil body induces deformation and pore pressure change. Deformation may change hydrogeological and elastic properties, which alters the mechanical behaviour and results in non-linearity. To investigate this interaction effect in a heterogeneous porous medium, a stochastic poroelastic model is proposed. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the mean and uncertainty of the parameter changes, displacement, and change in pore water pressure. Hydraulic conductivity is treated as the only random variable in the coupled geomechanics-flow system due to its large variation compared to other mechanical and hydrogeological properties in natural environments. The three considered non-linear models for the interaction between parameters and deformation are those that consider (1) porosity and hydraulic conductivity; (2) porosity and Young's modulus; and (3) a combined effect that includes porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and Young's modulus. Boundary effects oil the coupled system are also explored. The relationships between changes of porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and Young's modulus are analytically shown to be non-linear. Among the considered parameters, the deformation effect induces the largest reduction in hydraulic conductivity. The deformation-induced change in hydraulic conductivity shows the most significant effect on the mean and variance of the change in pore water pressure and displacement, while changes in Young's modulus have the least effect. When the deformation effect is considered, the superposition relationship does not exist in the mean displacement and mean change in pore water pressure for the three scenarios considered; it exists for the case without deformation effects. Deformation also causes a reduction in the effective hydraulic conductivity for the whole domain. The scenario that considers both loading and discharge boundaries has larger changes in hydrogeological and geo-mechanical parameters than those in scenarios that consider loading and discharge boundaries separately. The results indicate that the interaction between deformation and changes in parameters has a profound effect oil the poroelastic system. The effect of deformation should thus be considered in modelling and practice. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic regimes through hydrologic modeling is challenged by data uncertainty, predictor-selection uncertainty, and model uncertainty as well as their interrelationships. In this study, a Multi-level factorial ensemble data-driven hydrological model (MFEDHM) is developed to quantify the interactive, individual, and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions (e.g., climate conditions) on hydrological processes, and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non-predictor impacts. In the MFEDHM, multi-level factorial analysis is integrated with ensemble prediction (i.e., Bayesian Model Averaging) and data-driven hydrological model. The MFEDHM is applied to quantitatively analyze the rainfall-runoff relationships of 16 catchments over China. Results reveal that the multilevel factorial analysis can accurately reveal both individual and interactive impacts of climate variables on hydrologic processes, and the impacts of non-climatic factors. As the most important finding of this study, climate-change impacts on hydrology show significant spatial heterogeneities over China. For instance, contemporaneous climatic conditions dominate (57%-64%) runoff changes and variations in Southern China, while precedent climate conditions pose significant impacts (20%-67%) on runoffs in Northern China; the overall influence of non-predictor factors (anthropogenic) on runoffs may decrease by 0.07% for the catchment-area increment of 10000 km(2) and ranges from 4% to 27% over China. The development of the MFEDHM can enhance the reliability of ensemble hydrologic prediction, and provide scientific support for climate-change impacts assessment and adaptation under complexities.

AB Remote sensing of soil moisture effectively provides soil moisture at a large scale, but does not explain highly heterogeneous soil moisture characteristics within remote sensing footprints. In this study, field scale spatio-temporal variability of root zone soil moisture was analyzed. During the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily soil moisture profiles (i.e., 0-6, 5-11, 15-21, and 25-31 cm) were measured in two fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Ames, Iowa, USA. Theta probe measurements of the volumetric soil moisture profile data were used to analyze statistical moments and time stability and to validate soil moisture predicted by a simple physical model simulation. For all depths, the coefficient of variation of soil moisture is well explained by the mean soil moisture using an exponential relationship. The simple model simulated very similar variability patterns as those observed.
   As soil depth increases, soil moisture distributions shift from skewed to normal patterns. At the surface depth, the soil moisture during dry down is log-normally distributed, while the soil moisture is normally distributed after rainfall. At all depths below the surface, the normal distribution captures the soil moisture variability for all conditions. Time stability analyses show that spatial patterns of sampling points are preserved for all depths and that time stability of surface measurements is a good indicator of subsurface time stability. The most time stable sampling sites estimate the field average root zone soil moisture value within +/- 2.1% volumetric soil moisture. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC) and biomass production is important for sustainable resources management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron ratio (N-r) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear relationship between N-r and the aboveground biomass that allowed to continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22 kg/m(2). This information was used together with measured belowground biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error from 0.046 to 0.013 cm(3)/cm(3). We anticipate that future research on the N-r can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception, ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary and roving CRNS systems.

AB Digital rock physics carries the dogmatic concept of having to segment volume images for quantitative analysis but segmentation rejects huge amounts of signal information. Information that is essential for the analysis of difficult and marginally resolved samples, such as materials with very small features, is lost during segmentation. In X-ray nanotomography reconstructions of Hod chalk we observed partial volume voxels with an abundance that limits segmentation based analysis. Therefore, we investigated the suitability of greyscale analysis for establishing statistical representative elementary volumes (sREV) for the important petrophysical parameters of this type of chalk, namely porosity, specific surface area and diffusive tortuosity, by using volume images without segmenting the datasets. Instead, grey level intensities were transformed to a voxel level porosity estimate using a Gaussian mixture model. A simple model assumption was made that allowed formulating a two point correlation function for surface area estimates using Bayes' theory. The same assumption enables random walk simulations in the presence of severe partial volume effects. The established sREVs illustrate that in compacted chalk, these simulations cannot be performed in binary representations without increasing the resolution of the imaging system to a point where the spatial restrictions of the represented sample volume render the precision of the measurement unacceptable. We illustrate this by analyzing the origins of variance in the quantitative analysis of volume images, i.e. resolution dependence and intersample and intrasample variance. Although we cannot make any claims on the accuracy of the approach, eliminating the segmentation step from the analysis enables comparative studies with higher precision and repeatability.

AB This introduction to the second annual review issue of Hydrological Processes tries to put the collection of papers on preferential flows and travel time distributions into a more general context of testing models as hypotheses about how catchment systems function. It is suggested that, because of the possibilities of non-stationary and epistemic errors in both data and models, such tests could be carried out within a rejectionist limits-of-acceptability framework. The principles and difficulties of hypothesis testing within these particular research areas are discussed. An important point to take from this discussion is that the use of a formal testing framework, and the consequent rejection of models as hypotheses after allowing for uncertainties in the data, is the starting point for developing better theories and data sets.

AB Nested groundwater flow systems have been revealed in Toth's theory as the structural property of basin-scale groundwater circulation but were only well known with two-dimensional (2D) profile models. The method of searching special streamlines across stagnation points for partitioning flow systems, which has been successfully applied in the 2D models, has never been implemented for three-dimensional (3D) Tthian basins because of the difficulty in solving the dual stream functions. Alternatively, a new method is developed to investigate 3D nested groundwater flow systems without determination of stagnation points. Connective indices are defined to quantify the connection between individual recharge and discharge zones along streamlines. Groundwater circulation cells (GWCCs) are identified according to the distribution of the connective indices and then grouped into local, intermediate and regional flow systems. This method requires existing solution of the flow velocity vector and is implemented via particle tracking technique. It is applied in a hypothetical 3D Tethian basin with an analytical solution of the flow field and in a real-world basin with a numerical modeling approach. Different spatial patterns of flow systems compared to 2D profile models are found. The outcrops boundaries of GWCCs on water table may significantly deviate from and are not parallel to the nearby water table divides. Topological network is proposed to represent the linked recharge-discharge zones through closed and open GWCCs. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the development of GWCCs depends on the basin geometry, hydraulic parameters and water table shape. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   REYNOLDS-EQUATION; PERMEABILITY; TRANSPORT; JOINTS; MODEL; CONTACT
AB We investigate the validity of applying the "local cubic law" (LCL) to flow in a fracture bounded by impermeable rock surfaces. A two-dimensional order-of-magnitude analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations yields three conditions for the applicability of LCL flow, as a leading-order approximation in a local fracture segment with parallel or nonparallel walls. These conditions demonstrate that the "cubic law" aperture should not be measured on a point-by-point basis but rather as an average over a certain length. Extending to the third dimension, in addition to defining apertures over segment lengths, we find that the geometry of the contact regions influences flow paths more significantly than might be expected from consideration of only the nominal area fraction of these contacts. Moreover, this latter effect is enhanced by the presence of non-LCL regions around these contacts. While contact ratios of 0.1-0.2 are usually assumed to have a negligible effect, our calculations suggest that contact ratios as low as 0.03-0.05 can be significant. Analysis of computer-generated fractures with self-affine walls demonstrates a nonlinear increase in contact area and a faster-than-cubic decrease in the overall hydraulic conductivity, with decreasing fracture aperture; these results are in accordance with existing experimental data on flow in fractures. Finally, our analysis of fractures with self-affine walls indicates that the aperture distribution is not lognormal or gamma as is frequently assumed but rather truncated-normal initially and increasingly skewed with fracture closure.

AB Artificial thermal effluent (ATE) is used as an effective measure for solving the problem of ice damage in cold regions; the ATE outlets introduce thermal water (approximately 10 degrees C) into the diversion channel to increase the temperature of the channel water. This study discusses two approaches for determining the change in the water temperature during the winter operation period at the Hongshanzui diversion channel situated on the Manas River, China. One method involves field observations to determine the temperature change process of the diversion channel. The results indicate that the water temperature of the diversion channel increased from 0.2 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C (average 0.5 degrees C) after ATE outlets were employed. The process of change in the water temperature is segregated into rapid-rising, rapid-dropping, and slow-decreasing periods while the water flows through the ATE outlet. The second approach includes numerical simulations performed with a 3D nonhydrostatic model validated with field-observed water temperature data. The current research explores fundamental relationships among air temperature, diversion channel discharge, ATE out discharge, ATE out temperature, and diversion channel water temperature. The paper provides a discussion on the fundamental interdependency among the heat flux ratio (HFR), air temperature, and diversion channel water temperature. The water temperature attenuation curve is a power function distribution with a logarithmic relationship between the index and the HFR given by y = 0.03ln(x) + 0.2. Further, the air temperature of -10 degrees C is the turning point of the attenuation law. It is suggested that the changing process of water temperature in diversion channel after ATE outlets could be segregated into sudden-drop, transitional, and slowed-down periods depending on the HFR and atmospheric temperature. Finally, taking Hongshanzui and Jingou River hydropower stations as examples, the calculated unfrozen influence distances in this study are compared with the calculated results of three previous studies, which indicates that each method has its applicability and the calculation formula in this study takes into account the influence of various factors and has a wider scope of application.

AB Determining the biogeochemical pathways utilized by microbes living in groundwater is essential for understanding the subsurface C cycle and the fate of organic compounds, including pollutants. The radiocarbon signature (Delta C-14) of fatty acid methyl esters derived from microbial phospholipids (PLFA) provides useful information for differentiating microbial C sources and infering microbial metabolism. However, in subsurface environments, those analyses remain challenging. Here we present a method combining large volume groundwater filtration (up to 10,000L) and PLFA purification for subsequent compound-specific radiocarbon analyses. The analytical method involves conventional chemical extraction of PLFA followed by purification of individual compounds by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography. Different saturated PLFA in amounts of up to 10g each can be simultaneously separated on a C-18 high-load column using a mixture of MeOH/water and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. Our procedure introduced dead-C-ext contaminations of 0.57 +/- 0.29 and 0.35 +/- 0.18 mu g for the high-performance liquid chromatography and combustion/graphitization steps of the sample preparation, respectively. However, tests on different high-performance liquid chromatography C-18 columns revealed a large difference in dead C-ext associated with column bleed. Modern C-ext in the amount of 0.40 +/- 0.20 mu g was introduced by the combustion/graphitization step of the sample preparation, but other steps did not add modern C-ext. The entire method recovered approximate to 50% of the purified compounds on average, but this did not affect their C-14 content. This method will allow routine analysis of the Delta C-14 of PLFA isolated from groundwaters or other sample types, revealing the relationships between microbial and soil-derived C, sedimentary or dissolved C sources.

AB More than 100,000 community wells have been installed in the 150-300 m depth range throughout Bangladesh over the past decade to provide low-arsenic drinking water (<10 mu g/L As), but little is known about how aquifers tapped by these wells are recharged. Within a 25 km(2) area of Bangladesh east of Dhaka, groundwater from 65 low-As wells in the 35-240 m depth range was sampled for tritium (H-3), oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water (O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1), carbon isotope ratios in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, C-14/C-12 and C-13/C-12), noble gases, and a suite of dissolved constituents, including major cations, anions, and trace elements. At shallow depths (<90 m), 24 out of 42 wells contain detectable H-3 of up to 6 TU, indicating the presence of groundwater recharged within 60 years. Radiocarbon (C-14) ages in DIC range from modern to 10 kyr. In the 90-240 m depth range, however, only five wells shallower than 150 m contain detectable H-3 (<0.3 TU) and C-14 ages of DIC cluster around 10 kyr. The radiogenic helium (He-4) content in groundwater increases linearly across the entire range of C-14 ages at a rate of 2.5 x 10(-12) ccSTP He-4 g(-1) yr(-1). Within the samples from depths >90 m, systematic relationships between O-18/O-16, H-2/H-1, C-13/C-12, and C-14/C-12, and variations in noble gas temperatures, suggest that changes in monsoon intensity and vegetation cover occurred at the onset of the Holocene, when the sampled water was recharged. Thus, the deeper low-As aquifers remain relatively isolated from the shallow, high-As aquifer.

AB Estimation of soil specific surface area (SSA) and dry-end water vapor adsorption are important for porous media characterization and for prediction of water and vapor fluxes in arid environments. The objective of the presented study was to model water adsorption, film thickness, and SSA based on the t-curve theory originally developed for N-2 adsorption. Data from 21 source soils with clay contents ranging from 0.6 to 52.2% were used to estimate specific surface area based on water retention, a t-curve type method, the linear prediction method, and a simplified monolayer method. The water retention and the t-curve methods were found to be mathematically analogous and were among the most accurate with regard to correlation coefficient (r=0.97) and root-mean-square error (RMSE=11.36 x 10(3) m(2)/kg) when compared to measurements obtained with the standard ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) method. The corrected t-curve method significantly overestimated SSA when compared to EGME data. Comparison of all considered methods with N-2-BET (BET) measurements disclosed lower correlation coefficients. For soil studies, the vapor adsorption in conjunction with the t-curve or water retention methods should be preferred for SSA estimation as they show much higher correlation with soil clay content and EGME measurements.

AB Modeling of uncertainty associated with subsurface dynamics has long been a major research topic. Its significance is widely recognized for real-life applications. Despite the huge effort invested in the area, major obstacles still remain on the way from theory and applications. Particularly problematic here is the confusion between modeling uncertainty and modeling spatial variability, which translates into a (mis) conception, in fact an inconsistency, in that it suggests that modeling of uncertainty and modeling of spatial variability are equivalent, and as such, requiring a lot of data.
   This paper investigates this challenge against the backdrop of a 7 km, deep underground tunnel in China, where environmental impacts are of major concern. We approach the data challenge by pursuing a new concept for Rapid Impact Modeling (RIM), which bypasses altogether the need to estimate posterior distributions of model parameters, focusing instead on detailed stochastic modeling of impacts, conditional to all information available, including prior, ex-situ information and in-situ measurements as well.
   A foundational element of RIM is the construction of informative priors for target parameters using ex-situ data, relying on ensembles of well-documented sites, pre-screened for geological and hydrological similarity to the target site. The ensembles are built around two sets of similarity criteria: a physically-based set of criteria and an additional set covering epistemic criteria. In another variation to common Bayesian practice, we update the priors to obtain conditional distributions of the target (environmental impact) dependent variables and not the hydrological variables. This recognizes that goal-oriented site characterization is in many cases more useful in applications compared to parameter-oriented characterization.

AB The effect of the sample size on prediction quality is well understood. Recently, studies have assessed this relationship using near-continuous water quality samples. However, this is rarely possible because of financial constraints, and therefore, many studies have relied on simulation-based methods utilizing more affordable surrogates. A limitation of simulation-based methods is the requirement of a good relationship, which is often not present. Therefore, catchment managers require a direct method to estimate the effect of sample size on the mean using historical water quality data. One measure of prediction quality is the precision with which a mean is estimated; this is the focus of this work. By characterizing the effect of sample size on the precision of the mean, it is possible for catchment managers to adjust the sample size in relation to both the cost and the precision. Historical data are often sparse and generally collected using several different sampling schemes, all without inclusion probabilities. This means that an approach is needed to obtain unbiased estimates of the variance of the mean using a model-based approach. With the use of total phosphorus data from 17 sub-catchments in southeastern Australia, the ability of a model-based approach to estimate the effect of sample size on the precision of event and base-flow mean concentrations. The results showed that for estimating annual base-flow mean concentration, little gain in precision was achieved above 12 observations per year. Sample sizes greater than 12 samples per event improved event-based estimates; however, the inclusion of more than 12 samples per event did not greatly reduce the event mean concentration uncertainties. The precision of the base-flow estimates was most correlated to percentage urban cover, whereas the precision of the event mean estimates was most correlated with catchment size. The method proposed in this work could be readily applied to other water quality variables and other monitoring sites. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Streamflow generation was investigated using isotopic and geochemical tracers in semiarid, glacier-covered, montane catchments in the upper Shule River, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Samples from stream water, precipitation, glacier meltwater, and groundwater were collected at the Suli and Gahe catchments along the Shule River, with an area of 1908 and 4210 km(2), respectively. The samples were analysed for stable isotopes of water and major ions. Results of diagnostic tools of mixing models showed that Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl-, along with delta O-18 and delta H-2, behaved conservatively as a result of mixing of three endmembers. The three endmembers identified by the mixing analysis were surface runoff directly from precipitation, groundwater, and glacier meltwater. Streamflow was dominated by groundwater, accounting for 59% and 60% of streamflow on average in the Suli and Gahe catchments, respectively, with minimum groundwater contribution in July (47% and 50%) and maximum contribution in October (69% and 70%). The contributions of surface runoff were slightly higher in the Suli catchment (25%) than in the Gahe catchment (19%). However, the contributions of glacier meltwater were higher in the Gahe catchment (21%) compared to the Suli catchment (17%), as a result of a higher percentage of glacier covered area in the Gahe catchment. This difference followed well the non-linear power-law trend of many glacier-covered catchments around the world. As glacier retreat continues in the future, the reduction of streamflow in glacier-covered upper Shule catchment likely will be accelerated and possibly elsewhere in the Tibetan Plateau. This study suggests that it is critical to define the turning point of an accelerated reduction in glacier meltwater for glacier-covered catchments around the world in order to better assess and manage water resources.

AB A catchment-scale model based on the input-output budget of a solute is developed. The model describes stochastic dynamics of solute concentration in stream water considering fluctuations of water and solute inputs as a white noise. This stochastic dynamics generates a statistical ensemble with the probability density obeying a Fokker-Planck equation. Solving this equation yields a lognormal distribution with seasonally dependent parameters. This distribution law is tested on extensive data sets of river discharge and water composition indicators for the Moscow River at Rublevo including: 15-year daily data series for 7 hydrochemical indicators such as turbidity, color, permanganate oxidizability, total alkalinity, total iron, and pH values, as well as 10-year data series of different sampling frequencies for 6 microbial indicators such as total and thermotolerant coliforms, sulfite-reducing clostridia, total microbial count, coliphages, and fecal streptococci. The lognormal distribution law is confirmed with a different accuracy in all the cases. Most often this law is realized in the form of two lognormal branches corresponding to different seasonal phenomena. Transition between the branches occurs under the action of changing seasonal conditions and can be interpreted as a first-order phase transition between qualitatively different states of the water medium. It is shown that these transitions are accompanied by stepwise changes of entropy. (C) Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about water movement, volume, or residence time (RT), and how those characteristics affect sediment trapping efficiency (TE) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) in the United States' largest remaining bottomland hardwood swamp, the Atchafalaya River Basin. To better understand these dynamics, this study used bathymetry, lidar, and stage records to determine volumes in the Basin's hydrologically distinct water management units (WMUs). Discharge measurements determined flow distribution and RT. Residence time was compared with DO to identify conditions that coincided with DO increases or decreases. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were used to determine TE relative to calculated and measured discharge and RT. Discharge through units (85-2,200 m(3)/s) and RT (0.37-231 d) depended on connectivity and river stage. At high stages, with water temperatures >20 degrees C, DO in the largest WMU declined by -0.21 mg/l/day. DO trends indicated less well-connected areas of the WMU contributed hypoxic waters as the flood wave lengthened and stages fell. In the two WMUs examined for TE, TE (-266% to 99% and up to 38 Gg/day) correlated with hydrologic connectivity, SSC, RT, water volume, and, in one WMU, discharge losses. Long RT and high TE indicated a high potential to process nutrients. These relationships varied among WMUs. Large volumes of sediment-laden water moving over the floodplain combined with long RT, high TE, and hypoxia indicate that this ecosystem has continental-scale importance in reducing nutrient loads to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Reports from other systems suggest similar processes may be operating on other large river floodplains globally.

AB Large-scale covariations of freshwater fluxes and storages on land can critically regulate the balance of green (evapotranspiration) and blue (runoff) water fluxes, and related land-atmosphere interactions and hydroclimatic hazards. Such large-scale covariation patterns are not evident from smaller-scale hydrological studies that have been most common so far, and remain largely unknown for various regions and climates around the world. To contribute to bridging the large-scale knowledge gaps, we synthesize and decipher hydroclimatic data time series over the period 1980-2010 for 6,405 catchments around the world. From observation-based data, we identify dominant large-scale linear covariation patterns between monthly freshwater fluxes and soil moisture (SM) for different world parts and climates. These covariation patterns are also compared with those obtained from reanalysis products and Earth System Models (ESMs). The observation-based data sets robustly show the strongest large-scale hydrological relationship to be that between SM and runoff (R), consistently across the study catchments and their different climate characteristics. This predominantly strongest covariation between monthly SM and R is also the most misrepresented by ESMs and reanalysis products, followed by that between monthly precipitation and R. Comparison of observation-based and ESM results also shows that an ESM may perform well for individual monthly variables, but fail in representing the patterns of large-scale linear covariations between them. Observation-based quantification of these patterns, and ESM and reanalysis improvements for their representation are essential for fundamental understanding, and more accurate and reliable modeling and projection of large-scale hydrological conditions and changes under ongoing global and regional change.

AB Most spatially explicit hydrologic models require estimates of air temperature patterns. For these models, empirical relationships between elevation and air temperature are frequently used to upscale point measurements or downscale regional and global climate model estimates of air temperature. Mountainous environments are particularly sensitive to air temperature estimates as spatial gradients are substantial, and air temperature plays a critical role in snow-related processes. We use a distributed, coupled ecohydrologic model to compare estimates of streamflow, snowmelt, transpiration, and net primary productivity (NPP) using five temperature interpolation approaches for a forested mountain basin that is dominated by a rain-snow zone in Western Oregon, USA. We compare model estimates using a standard adiabatic lapse rate of -6.5 degrees C km(-1); basin-specific lapse rates created using daily point observations at high, middle, and low elevations; and gridded temperature estimates from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived at 800 and 50 m resolutions. We show that temperature interpolation strategies influence model calibration. Point-based estimates using a low-elevation station or 800 m PRISM grids result in significantly fewer parameter sets that model streamflow well, suggesting a bias in parameter selection due to errors in input data. The greatest postcalibration impact of temperature lapse rate estimates occurs for model estimates of NPP. The constant temperature lapse rate results in substantially reduced NPP estimates that are more sensitive to the interannual variation in climate forcing. Citation: Garcia, E. S., C. L.

AB In mid-high latitude areas, seasonal freeze-thaw cycles generate significant effects on pore structure of soils, and in turn, affect soil mechanical properties and soil erosion processes. Furthermore, soil particles can be detached on ridged farmland by snowmelt or rainfall concentrated flow due to topographic relief during the spring snowmelt period. To explore the changes in pore structure characteristics under freeze-thaw effects on soil detachment rates under simulating concentrated flow, fifteen soil columns and twenty soil tanks underwent a freeze-thaw pre-treatment of zero, one, five, ten, and fifteen cycles. Soil structure characteristics were quanti-tatively obtained by scanning soil columns with industrial computer tomography at a 25-mu m resolution. Soil strength was measured by a portable vane shear instrument on the surface of soil tanks. Detachment rates of soil tanks were measured in a flume under changeless flow shear stress (tau = 2.32 Pa). Results indicated that freeze-thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength by changing pore network structure, including increasing total imaged porosity and elongated-pore porosity. The detachment rate significantly rose with the rising freeze-thaw cycles (p < 0.05) and had a power relationship with the soil strength (R2 = 0.503, p < 0.05). Thus, the increase in detachment rate was mainly caused by the decrease in soil strength, which is dependent on large and elongated pores that formed during freeze-thaw cycles and on the geometrical characteristics of the pore network. The findings improve the understanding of the generation mechanism of soil erosion as a result of changes in pore structure characteristics during the spring snowmelt period.

AB Drought and flood management practices require accurate estimates of precipitation. Gauge observations, however, are often sparse in regions with complicated terrain, clustered in valleys, and of poor quality. Consequently, the spatial extent of wet events is poorly represented. Satellite-derived precipitation data are an attractive alternative, though they tend to underestimate the magnitude of wet events due to their dependency on retrieval algorithms and the indirect relationship between satellite infrared observations and precipitation intensities. Here we offer a Bayesian kriging approach for blending precipitation gauge data and the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation satellite-derived precipitation estimates for Central America, Colombia, and Venezuela. First, the gauge observations are modeled as a linear function of satellite-derived estimates and any number of other variablesfor this research we include elevation. Prior distributions are defined for all model parameters and the posterior distributions are obtained simultaneously via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The posterior distributions of these parameters are required for spatial estimation, and thus are obtained prior to implementing the spatial kriging model. This functional framework is applied to model parameters obtained by sampling from the posterior distributions, and the residuals of the linear model are subject to a spatial kriging model. Consequently, the posterior distributions and uncertainties of the blended precipitation estimates are obtained. We demonstrate this method by applying it to pentadal and monthly total precipitation fields during 2009. The model's performance and its inherent ability to capture wet events are investigated. We show that this blending method significantly improves upon the satellite-derived estimates and is also competitive in its ability to represent wet events. This procedure also provides a means to estimate a full conditional distribution of the true observed precipitation value at each grid cell.

AB Catchment modeling in areas dominated by active geomorphologic processes, such as soil erosion and landsliding, is often hampered by the lack of reliable methods for the spatial estimation of soil depth. In a catchment, soil thickness h can vary as a function of many different and interplaying factors, such as underlying lithology, climate, gradient, hillslope curvature, upslope contributing area, and vegetation cover, making the distributed estimation of h challenging and often unreliable. In this work we present an alternative methodology which links soil thickness to gradient, horizontal and vertical slope curvature, and relative position within the hillslope profile. While the relationship with gradient and curvature should reflect the kinematic stability of the regolith cover, allowing greater soil thicknesses over planar and concave areas, the distance from the hill crest (or from the valley bottom) accounts for the position within the soil toposequence. This last parameter is fundamental; points having equal gradient and curvature can have significantly different soil thickness due to their dissimilar position along the hillslope profile. The proposed model has been implemented in a geographic information system environment and tested in the Terzona Creek basin in central Italy. Results are in good agreement with field data (mean absolute error is 11 cm with 8.5 cm standard deviation) and average errors are lower than those obtained with other topography-based methods, where mean absolute error ranges from 47 cm for a model based on curvature, position, and slope gradient to 94 cm for a model based solely on slope gradient. As a further test, the predicted soil thickness was used to determine derived quantities, such as the factor of safety for landsliding potential. Our model, when compared to other empirical methods, returns the best results and, therefore, can improve the prediction of soil losses and sediment production when utilized in conjunction with hydrological and landsliding models.

AB Artificial drainage of wetlands in the Great Plains has been linked to increased runoff, erosion, and the consolidation of small, seasonal wetlands into larger, more permanent bodies of water. We analyzed hydrologic changes to over 1.2 million water bodies across the entire North Dakota portion of the Prairie Pothole Region using the ratio of aggregate water area and total perimetric length in a landscape-scale shape index calculated from existing Landsat derived data of water presence/absence. This ratio showed a clear change point toward more consolidation of wetlands around the period 1999 (+/- 1 year) after an extended multiyear period of above-average rainfall. We used hydrologic simulations with forcing data from across the region to show that this shift is unlikely to be due solely to natural variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Using county-level regressions, we found that wetland consolidation as measured by the shape index was highly correlated with agricultural transitions out of wheat and into corn and soybeans over the period 1984-2014 (R-2 > 0.4), though we do not find evidence of a strong correlation between reported drainage and wetland consolidation. These results highlight a potential hysteretic interaction involving interannual variations in hydrologic forcing and anthropogenic landscape alterations on wetland consolidation in the North Dakota prairie potholes.
   Plain Language Summary We measured the area and perimeter of a large number of water bodies in the North Dakota prairies using satellite imagery and found evidence of a clear break in their usual relationship around the year 1999 following a period of above-average rainfall. The magnitude of this change appears to be related to changes in agricultural practices across the region. These findings suggest that the behavior of wetland systems can change abruptly at large scales as a result of human-climate interactions.

AB Optimization theories explain a variety of forms and functions in plants. At the leaf scale, it is often hypothesized that carbon gain is maximized, thus providing a quantifiable objective for a mathematical definition of optimality conditions. Eco-physiological trade-offs and limited resource availability introduce natural bounds to this optimization process. In particular, carbon uptake from the atmosphere is inherently linked to water losses from the soil as water is taken up by roots and evaporated. Hence, water availability in soils constrains the amount of carbon that can be taken up and assimilated into new biomass. The problem of maximizing photosynthesis at a given water availability by modifying stomatal conductance, the plant-controlled variable to be optimized, has been traditionally formulated for short time intervals over which soil moisture changes can be neglected. This simplification led to a mathematically open solution, where the undefined Lagrange multiplier of the optimization (equivalent to the marginal water use efficiency, lambda) is then heuristically determined via data fitting. Here, a set of models based on different assumptions that account for soil moisture dynamics over an individual dry-down are proposed so as to provide closed analytical expressions for the carbon gain maximization problem. These novel solutions link the observed variability in lambda over time, across soil moisture changes, and at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations to water use strategies ranging from intensive, in which all soil water is consumed by the end of the dry-down period, to more conservative, in which water stress is avoided by reducing transpiration.

AB A variational data assimilation model is developed to estimate surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST). Components of the surface energy balance (sensible, latent, and ground heat fluxes) have different degrees of efficiency in dissipating available energy. LST is the state variable of the surface energy balance (SEB). Land surface models that capture the exchange and storage of energy in the soil and vegetation media use LST as a prognostic variable. Sequences of LST measurements implicitly contain information on partitioning of available energy among the components of SEB. In this study, we focus on the estimation of the sum of the turbulent fluxes as well as the partitioning among them. Two dimensionless parameters are used to characterize the sum and the partitioning. Using LST observations from a constellation of satellites, these parameters are mapped over a large region. The remotely sensed LST is assimilated to the heat diffusion equation within the SEB framework. In addition, a model error term is added to the SEB equation such that the variational data assimilation scheme includes model uncertainty as well as observation error. The framework is tested over the Southern Great Plains region. The mapped results of the surface evaporation estimation are used to study the surface control on evaporation. Independent mapped soil moisture estimates from an airborne microwave campaign are used. The dependence of the evaporation control-soil moisture relationship on vegetation cover and plant functional types over large regions is examined in this first and exploratory study.

AB During the past decade, significant spatial and temporal variability in the release of nitrate-nitrogen (N) from catchments in a sugar maple forest in central Ontario was observed. To explain this variability, we tested the flushing hypothesis [Hornberger ef al., 1994], where, when the soil saturation deficit is high, N accumulates in the upper layers of the soil and, as the soil saturation deficit decreases, the formation of a saturated subsurface layer flushes N from the upper layers of the soil into the stream. We used the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System to simulate water, carbon, and N dynamics. A N flushing index was modeled as S/S-30, the ratio of the current day saturation deficit to the previous 30-day average saturation deficit. A N source index was modeled as the ratio of N supply/demand. The relationship between the simulated N indices and the observed release of N indicated two mechanisms for the release of N from catchments: (1) a N flushing mechanism, where the N-enriched upper layer of the soil is flushed, after a period of low demand for N by the forest (e.g., during spring snowmelt and autumn stormflow, the water table rising into previously unsaturated parts df a N-enriched soil profile) or after a period of high demand for N by the forest (e.g., during summer droughts, the water table rising into previously saturated parts of a N-impoverished soil profile following a period of enhanced rates of nitrification); and (2) a N draining mechanism, where spring snowmelt recharge of the groundwater translocates N from the upper layer of the soil into deeper hydrological flow pathways that are released slowly over the year.

AB Many concepts have been proposed to explain hydrologic connectivity of hillslopes with streams. Hydrologic connectivity is most often defined by qualitative assessment of spatial patterns in perched water tables or soil moisture on hillslopes without a direct linkage to water flow from hillslopes to streams. This form of hydrologic connectivity may not explain the hydrologic response of catchments that have network(s) of preferential flow paths, for example, soil pipes, which can provide intrinsic connectivity between hillslopes and streams. Duplex soils are known for developing perched water tables on hillslopes and fostering lateral flows, but the connectivity of localized perched water tables on hillslopes with soil pipes has not been fully established. The objectives of this study were to characterize pipeflow dynamics during storm events, the relationships between perched water tables on hillslopes and pipeflows, and their threshold behaviour. Two well-characterized catchments in loess soil with a fragipan were selected for study because they contain multiple, laterally extensive (over 100 m) soil pipe networks. Hillslopes were instrumented with shallow wells adjacent to the soil pipes, and the wells and pipe collapse features were equipped with pressure transducers. Perched water tables developed on hillslopes during a wetting up period (October-December) and became well connected spatially across hillslope positions throughout the high flow period (January-March). The water table was not spatially connected on hillslopes during the drying out (April-June) and low flow (July-September) periods. Even when perched water tables were not well-connected, water flowing through soil pipes provided hydrologic connectivity between upper hillslopes and catchment outlets. Correlations between soil pipeflow and perched water tables depended on the size and location of soil pipes. The threshold relationship between available soil-moisture index plus storm precipitation and pipeflow was dependent on the season and strongest during dry periods and not high-flow seasons. This study demonstrated that soil pipes serve as a catchment backbone of preferential flow paths that provide intrinsic connectivity between upper hillslopes and streams.

AB Snail-borne trematodiases, such as fascioliasis and schistosomiasis, belong to the neglected tropical diseases; yet, millions of people and livestock are affected. The spatial and temporal distribution of intermediate host snails plays an important role in the epidemiology and control of trematodiases. Snail distribution is influenced by numerous environmental and anthropomorphic factors. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and constitution of the snail fauna during the dry season in constructed and natural water bodies in the Tchologo region, northern Cote d'Ivoire, and to relate these findings to environmental factors and human infections. Snails were collected using standard procedures and environmental parameters were assessed from a total of 50 water bodies in and around 30 randomly selected villages. A canonical correspondence analysis was performed to establish the relationship between snail occurrence and environmental factors. Furthermore, a total of 743 people from the same 30 villages and nearby settlements were invited for stool and urine examination for the diagnosis of Fasciola spp., Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni. Snails of medical importance of the genera Biomphalaria, Bulinus, Lymnaea and Physa were found. Differences in snail occurrence from sites sampled in December 2014 and snails sampled in February 2015, as well as between the northern and southern part of the study area, were revealed. Various environmental factors, such as temperature and human activities, were related to the occurrence of intermediate host snail species in the region. Only 2.3% of human participants tested positive for schistosomiasis, while no Fasciola eggs were found in stool samples. We conclude that intermediate host snails of Fasciola and Schistosoma co-occur in water bodies in the Tchologo region and that the distribution of these snails correlates not only with environmental factors, but also with the presence of humans and animals and the environmental contamination of their excreta.

AB Multiphase flow in porous media is described by coupled nonlinear mass conservation laws. For immiscible Darcy flow of multiple fluid phases, whereby capillary effects are negligible, the transport equations in the presence of viscous and buoyancy forces are highly nonlinear and hyperbolic. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow processes in heterogeneous formations requires the development of discretization and solution schemes that are able to handle the complex nonlinear dynamics, especially of the saturation evolution, in a reliable and computationally efficient manner. In reservoir simulation practice, single-point upwinding of the flux across an interface between two control volumes (cells) is performed for each fluid phase, whereby the upstream direction is based on the gradient of the phase-potential (pressure plus gravity head). This upwinding scheme, which we refer to as Phase-Potential Upwinding (PPU), is combined with implicit (backward-Euler) time discretization to obtain a Fully Implicit Method (FIM). Even though FIM suffers from numerical dispersion effects, it is widely used in practice. This is because of its unconditional stability and because it yields conservative, monotone numerical solutions. However, FIM is not unconditionally convergent. The convergence difficulties are particularly pronounced when the different immiscible fluid phases switch between co-current and counter-current states as a function of time, or (Newton) iteration. Whether the multiphase flow across an interface (between two control-volumes) is co-current, or counter-current, depends on the local balance between the viscous and buoyancy forces, and how the balance evolves in time. The sensitivity of PPU to small changes in the (local) pressure distribution exacerbates the problem. The common strategy to deal with these difficulties is to cut the timestep and try again. Here, we propose a Hybrid-Upwinding (HU) scheme for the phase fluxes, then HU is combined with implicit time discretization to yield a fully implicit method. In the HU scheme, the phase flux is divided into two parts based on the driving force. The viscous-driven and buoyancy-driven phase fluxes are upwinded differently. Specifically, the viscous flux, which is always co-current, is upwinded based on the direction of the total-velocity. The buoyancy-driven flux across an interface is always counter-current and is upwinded such that the heavier fluid goes downward and the lighter fluid goes upward. We analyze the properties of the Implicit Hybrid Upwinding (IHU) scheme. It is shown that IHU is locally conservative and produces monotone, physically-consistent numerical solutions. The IHU solutions show numerical diffusion levels that are slightly higher than those for standard FIM (i.e., implicit PPU). The primary advantage of the IHU scheme is that the numerical overall-flux of a fluid phase remains continuous and differentiable as the flow regime changes between co-current and counter-current conditions. This is in contrast to the standard phase-potential upwinding scheme, in which the overall fractional-flow (flux) function is non-differentiable across the boundary between co-current and counter-current flows.

AB Ecohydrological systems may be characterized as nonlinear, complex, open dissipative systems. Such systems consist of many coupled processes, and the couplings change depending on the system state or scale in space and time at which the system is analyzed. The arrangement of couplings in a complex system may be represented as a network of information flow and feedback between variables that measure system processes. The occurrence of feedback on such a network provides sufficient conditions for self-organized and nonlinear behaviors to emerge. We adapt an information-theoretic statistical method called transfer entropy for the purposes of robustly measuring the directionality, relative strength, statistical significance, and time scale of information flow between pairs of ecohydrological variables using time series data. A process network may be delineated where variables are cast as nodes and information flows as weighted directional links between them. The process network captures key couplings and time scales and represents the state of the complex system as a whole, including functional groups of variables (subsystems) and synchronization resulting from feedbacks. It is therefore able to identify interactions which are not detectable using methods which examine the system using one relationship at a time. We assemble an information flow process network using July 2003 FLUXNET data for a Midwestern corn-soybean ecohydrological system in a healthy, peak growing season state and compare the results with those using July 2005 data for the same site during a severe drought. We find that the process network during drought is substantially decoupled, and regional-scale information feedback is reduced during the drought. We conclude that the proposed process network methodology is able to identify the differences between two states of an ecohydrological system on the basis of variations in the pattern of feedback coupling on the network.

DT Article
ID LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SUCTION STRESS; MODEL
AB Slope-stability analyses are mostly conducted by identifying or assuming a potential failure surface and assessing the factor of safety (FS) of that surface. This approach of assigning a single FS to a potentially unstable slope provides little insight on where the failure initiates or the ultimate geometry and location of a landslide rupture surface. We describe a method to quantify a scalar field of FS based on the concept of the Coulomb stress and the shift in the state of stress toward failure that results from rainfall infiltration. The FS at each point within a hillslope is called the local factor of safety (LFS) and is defined as the ratio of the Coulomb stress at the current state of stress to the Coulomb stress of the potential failure state under the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Comparative assessment with limit-equilibrium and hybrid finite element limit-equilibrium methods show that the proposed LFS is consistent with these approaches and yields additional insight into the geometry and location of the potential failure surface and how instability may initiate and evolve with changes in pore water conditions. Quantitative assessments applying the new LFS field method to slopes under infiltration conditions demonstrate that the LFS has the potential to overcome several major limitations in the classical FS methodologies such as the shape of the failure surface and the inherent underestimation of slope instability. Comparison with infinite-slope methods, including a recent extension to variably saturated conditions, shows further enhancement in assessing shallow landslide occurrence using the LFS methodology. Although we use only a linear elastic solution for the state of stress with no post-failure analysis that require more sophisticated elastoplastic or other theories, the LFS provides a new means to quantify the potential instability zones in hillslopes under variably saturated conditions using stress-field based methods.

AB According to the concept of "natural flow regime." introduced and developed in the 1990's in aquatic ecology, streamflow can be described using five basic characteristics magnitude, frequency, duration, period of occurrence and variability A sixth could be added to these, namely, distribution curve Our study, which focused exclusively on the temporal variability of these six characteristics, had these objectives: (1) to compare their stationanty. (2) to determine the links among these characteristics and (3) to analyze, for the first time, their relationship to six climatic indices (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Artic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Nino3 4, Pacific decadal Oscillation and Southern Oscillation Index) To do this, we used the Vermilion River (2670 km(2)) as an example, analyzing the streamflow of heavy spring floods (equal to or greater than the annual flood streamflow), as measured between 1934 and 2000.
   The comparison of the stationarity of these six characteristics by means of linear regression analysis and Mann-Kendall test revealed that flood duration has increased and flood frequency has decreased during the 1934-2000 period As for the link among the six characteristics, magnitude, the primary fundamental characteristic, is correlated to all the other characteristics, except for the coefficient of skewness The AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) climatic index is correlated to all the characteristics, except for frequency and coefficient of skewness This last characteristic is correlated to AO (Arctic Oscillation)
   This example shows that this concept can serve to link climatology, hydrology, fluvial geomorphology and aquatic ecology for a better understanding of the interactions among the different components of the aquatic ecosystems. The understanding of these interactions is important for better watercourse management and could serve as a potential framework for predicting the evolution of river ecosystems in light of climate change, using a combination of these various disciplines.

AB Glacierised basins are significant sources of sediments generated by glacial retreat. Estimation of suspended sediment transfer from glacierised basins is very important in reservoir planning for hydropower projects in Himalaya. The present study indicates that storage and release of sediment in proglacial streams may categorise the pattern of suspended sediment transfer from these basins. Assessment of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), suspended sediment load (SSL) and yield has been undertaken for Dunagiri Glacier basin located in Garhwal Himalaya (30(o)33'20N, 79(o)53'36E), and its results are compared with the Gangotri and Dokriani glaciers sharing close proximity. Out of the total drainage basin area, about 14.3 % of the area is glacierised. Data were collected for five ablation seasons (1984-1989, barring 1986). The mean daily SSCs for July, August and September were 333.9, 286.0 and 147.15mg/l, respectively, indicating highest concentration of mean daily suspended sediment in July followed by August. SSL trends were estimated to be 93.0, 57.0 and 21.3 tonnes. About 59% of the total SSL of the melt period was transported during the months of August and September. Sediment yield for the study basin was computed to be 296.3t km(-2) yr (-1). It is observed that the cumulative proportion of SSC precedes the discharge throughout the melt season except in the year 1987. Release of SSL in terms of total load is less in the early part of melt season than in the later stage as compared to that of discharge. Diurnal variations in SSC reach their maximum at 2400h, and therefore, SSC was found to be high during night (2000-0400h). There was a good relationship between SSC and SSL with discharge for the ablation seasons (1988 and 1989). Mean monthly SSC and mean monthly SSL provide a good exponentional relationship with mean monthly temperature. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We present a method to characterize soil moisture freeze-thaw events and freezing/melting point depression using permittivity and temperature measurements, readily available from in situ sources. In cold regions soil freeze-thaw processes play a critical role in the surface energy and water balance, with implications ranging from agricultural yields to natural disasters. Although monitoring of the soil moisture phase state is of critical importance, there is an inability to interpret soil moisture instrumentation in frozen conditions. To address this gap, we investigated the freeze-thaw response of a widely used soil moisture probe, the HydraProbe, in the laboratory. Soil freezing curves (SFCs) and soil thawing curves (STCs) were identified using the relationship between soil permittivity and temperature. The permittivity SFC/STC was fit using a logistic growth model to estimate the freezing/melting point depression (T-f/m) and its spread (s). Laboratory results showed that the fitting routine requires permittivity changes greater than 3.8 to provide robust estimates and suggested that a temperature bias is inherent in horizontally placed HydraProbes. We tested the method using field measurements collected over the last 7 years from the Environment and Climate Change Canada and the University of Guelph's Kenaston Soil Moisture Network in Saskatchewan, Canada. By dividing the time series into freeze-thaw events and then into individual transitions, the permittivity SFC/STC was identified. The freezing and melting point depression for the network was estimated as T-f/m = - 0.35 +/- 0.2,with T-f = - 0.41 +/- 0.22 degrees C and T-m = - 0.29 +/- 0.16 degrees C, respectively.

AB We examined the effects of forest floor coverage on overland flow generation and soil erosion in mature Japanese cypress plantations with different coverage conditions: sparse understory and litter (uncovered plots), dense fern understory and litter (covered plots), and experimental removal of vegetative floor coverage on the covered plots (removal plots). We measured soil hydraulic properties and monitored overland flow and soil erosion in three replicated plots (approximately 1 x 2 m each) representing uncovered, covered, and removal conditions. Because of the strong water repellency of the surface soil, a substantial amount of overland flow occurred, even in covered plots. Nevertheless, the annual overland flow in covered plots was 37% of that in uncovered plots. Annual soil erosion in uncovered plots was 3.7 times greater than that in covered plots. Although overland flow in removal plots was similar to that in uncovered plots, soil erosion in the former was significantly greater than in the latter. These results suggest that differences in soil erodibility between the plots were essential determining factors of erosion and were no less important than floor coverage. We quantified the effects of floor coverage and soil erodibility independently and examined the relationship between coverage and erosion by applying an erosion model. In covered plots, floor coverage prevented 95% of soil detachment by raindrops, which was the dominant mechanism in reducing soil erosion, as compared with it inhibiting overland flow and resisting sediment transport. The soil erodibility of plots with ground cover was 4.5 times higher than that of uncovered plots. This implies that simply comparing plots with different coverage conditions is not sufficient for examining the effects of vegetation coverage on soil erosion.

TI Comparison of four models to determine surface soil moisture from C-band

AB [1] Four approaches for deriving estimates of near-surface soil moisture from radar imagery in a semiarid, sparsely vegetated rangeland were evaluated against in situ measurements of soil moisture. The approaches were based on empirical, physical, semiempirical, and image difference techniques. The empirical approach involved simple linear regression of radar backscatter on soil moisture, while the integral equation method (IEM) model was used in both the physical and semiempirical approaches. The image difference or delta index approach is a new technique presented here for the first time. In all cases, spatial averaging to the watershed scale improved agreement with observed soil moisture. In the empirical approach, variation in radar backscatter explained 85% of the variation in observed soil moisture at the watershed scale. For the physical and best semiempirical adjustment to the physical model, the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) between modeled and observed soil moisture were 0.13 and 0.04, respectively. Practical limitations to obtaining surface roughness measurements limit IEM utility for large areas. The purely image-based delta index has significant operational advantage in soil moisture estimates for broad areas. Additionally, satellite observations of backscatter used in the delta index indicated an approximate 1:1 relationship with soil moisture that explained 91% of the variability, with RMSE = 0.03. Results showed that the delta index is scaled to the range in observed soil moisture and may provide a purely image based model. It should be tested in other watersheds to determine if it implicitly accounts for surface roughness, topography, and vegetation. These are parameters that are difficult to measure over large areas, and may influence the delta index.

AB [1] Where changes in hydrologic regime occur, whether as a result of change in land use or climate, statistical procedures are needed to test for the existence of trend in hydrological data, particularly those expected to follow extreme value distributions such as annual peak discharges, annual minimum flows, and annual maximum rainfall intensities. Furthermore, where trend is detected, its magnitude must also be estimated. A later paper [Clarke, 2002] will consider the estimation of trends in Gumbel data; the present paper gives results on tests for the significance of trends in annual and minimum discharges, where these can be assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. The statistical procedures, already fully established in the statistical analysis of survival data, convert the problem into one in which a generalized linear model is fitted to a power-transformed variable having Poisson distribution and calculates the trend coefficients (as well as the parameter in the power transform) by maximum likelihood. The methods are used to test for trend in annual minimum flows over a 19-year period in the River Paraguay at Caceres, Brazil, and in monthly flows at the same site. Extension of the procedure to testing for trend in data following a generalized extreme value distribution is also discussed. Although a test for time trend in Weibull-distributed hydrologic data is the motivation for this paper, the same approach can be applied in the analysis of data sequences that can be regarded as stationary in time, for which the objective is to explore relationships between a Weibull variate and other variables (covariates) that explain its behavior.

AB Because of the many uncertainties associated with most flow and transport parameters, studies often implement the numerical simulations within a Monte Carlo frame of work. The large numbers of realizations needed to achieve convergence for the statistics of concern make the Monte Carlo approach computationally demanding. In this study we attempt to develop an empirical-numerical approach to generate Lagrangian particle trajectories in two-dimensional domain given a certain input heterogeneity model without repeatedly solving the flow equation for each realization, with the purpose of evaluating ensemble plume statistics. Artificial neural networks are used to map the relationship between the particle trajectories and the physical properties of the formation. This is achieved by training the neural network through a set of sufficient examples derived from a few realizations using an exponential log-K covariance. The trained network is then used to predict particle trajectories in heterogeneity characterized by an exponential, a Gaussian, a hole-type, or a fractal covariance model. The network that is trained using the exponential model successfully predicts transport results for other models with high accuracy and low computational effort. Accuracy of prediction of the trajectory (percent of explained variance) reaches 94% in the direction of mean flow and 91% normal to it. For the cases studied here, the speed of calculation is similar to7.8 times faster than the traditional approach for 1000 realizations. As the number of realizations increases, the speed factor approaches 12.8. Solute mass flux (mean and standard deviation) and mean-plume concentrations predicted by the trained network agree very closely with the target result obtained via traditional Monte Carlo simulations.

AB Prior studies have shown that colloids can facilitate contaminant migration in unimodal porous media. To investigate the effect of no-flow regions on flow and contaminant transport in dual-porosity soils, we model a porous medium composed of two different homogeneous, superposed, and interacting regions: the mobile region and the immobile region. We assume that the advective-dispersive processes govern the transport of contaminant and colloids in the mobile region, while the diffusion process dominates in the immobile region. The contaminant and colloid mass transfer mechanisms between these two regions are represented by a first-order mass transfer. Colloid deposition on the solid matrix is expressed by a kinetic sorption relationship. The contaminant sorption with the solid matrix and colloidal surfaces is also incorporated into the model. Coupled with mass transfer terms, two sets of governing equations representing the fate and transport of contaminant and colloids in both the mobile and immobile regions are developed and applied to experimental data available in the literature. Numerical solutions are obtained by employing a fully implicit, finite difference scheme. The numerical results indicate that the colloidal facilitation is increased in a dual-porosity porous medium compared to a unimodal medium. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data available in the literature for colloid-facilitated contaminant transport in a single-porosity medium and contaminant transport in a colloid-free, dual-porosity medium. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to deduce the effect of major model parameters on contaminant transport. The analysis demonstrates that, although both the volumetric fraction of the mobile region and the mass transfer rate coefficients between the two regions have effects on the dual-porosity transport, the early breakthrough is affected mainly by the volumetric fraction of the mobile region, while the tailing is affected largely by the mass transfer rate coefficients.

AB To assess the potential of radar rainfall nowcasting for early warning, nowcasts for 659 events were used to construct discharge forecasts for 12 Dutch catchments. Four open-source nowcasting algorithms were tested: Rainymotion Sparse (RM-S), Rainymotion DenseRotation (RM-DR), Pysteps deterministic (PS-D), and probabilistic (PS-P) with 20 ensemble members. As benchmark, Eulerian Persistence (EP) and zero precipitation input (ZP) were used. For every 5-min step in the available nowcasts, a discharge forecast with a 12-hr forecast horizon was constructed. Simulations using the observed radar rainfall were used as reference. Rainfall and discharge forecast errors were found to increase with both increasing rainfall intensity and spatial variability. For the discharge forecasts, this relationship depends on the initial conditions, as the forecast error increases more quickly with rainfall intensity when the groundwater table is shallow. Overall, discharge forecasts using RM-DR, PS-D, and PS-P outperform the other methods. Threshold exceedance forecasts were assessed by using the maximum event discharge as threshold. Compared to benchmark ZP, an exceedance is, on average, forecast 223 (EP), 196 (RM-S), 213 (RM-DR), 119 (PS-D), and 143 min (PS-P) in advance. The EP results are counterbalanced by both a high false alarm ratio (FAR) and inconsistent forecasts. Contrarily, PS-D and PS-P produce lower FAR and inconsistency index values than all other methods. All methods advance short-term discharge forecasting compared to no rainfall forecasts at all, though all have shortcomings. As forecast rainfall volumes are a crucial factor in discharge forecasts, a future focus on improving this aspect in nowcasting is recommended.

AB This paper introduces Prec-DWARF (Precipitation Downscaling With Adaptable Random Forests), a novel machine-learning based method for statistical downscaling of precipitation. Prec-DWARF sets up a nonlinear relationship between precipitation at fine resolution and covariates at coarse/fine resolution, based on the advanced binary tree method known as Random Forests (RF). In addition to a single RF, we also consider a more advanced implementation based on two independent RFs which yield better results for extreme precipitation. Hourly gauge-radar precipitation data at 0.125 degrees from NLDAS-2 are used to conduct synthetic experiments with different spatial resolutions (0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees, and 1 degrees). Quantitative evaluation of these experiments demonstrates that Prec-DWARF consistently outperforms the baseline (i.e., bilinear interpolation in this case) and can reasonably reproduce the spatial and temporal patterns, occurrence and distribution of observed precipitation fields. However, Prec-DWARF with a single RF significantly underestimates precipitation extremes and often cannot correctly recover the fine-scale spatial structure, especially for the 1 degrees experiments. Prec-DWARF with a double RF exhibits improvement in the simulation of extreme precipitation as well as its spatial and temporal structures, but variogram analyses show that the spatial and temporal variability of the downscaled fields are still strongly underestimated. Covariate importance analysis shows that the most important predictors for the downscaling are the coarse-scale precipitation values over adjacent grid cells as well as the distance to the closest dry grid cell (i.e., the dry drift). The encouraging results demonstrate the potential of Prec-DWARF and machine-learning based techniques in general for the statistical downscaling of precipitation.

AB This study explores field-scale modeling of U(VI) reactive transport through incorporation of laboratory and field data. A field-scale reactive transport model was developed on the basis of laboratory-characterized U(VI) surface complexation reactions (SCRs) and multirate mass transfer processes, as well as field-measured hydrogeochemical conditions at the U. S. Department of Energy, Hanford 300 Area (300 A), Washington. The model was used to assess the importance of multirate mass transfer processes on U(VI) reactive transport and to evaluate the effect of variable geochemical conditions caused by dynamic river water-groundwater interactions on U(VI) plume migration. Model simulations revealed complex spatiotemporal relationships between groundwater composition and U(VI) speciation, adsorption, and plume migration. In general, river water intrusion enhances uranium adsorption and lowers aqueous uranium concentration because river water dilution increases pH and decreases aqueous bicarbonate concentration, leading to overall enhanced U(VI) surface complexation. Strong U(VI) retardation was computed for the field-measured hydrogeochemical conditions, suggesting a slow dissipation of the U(VI) plume, a phenomenon consistent with field observations. The simulations also showed that SCR-retarded U(VI) migration becomes more dynamic and synchronous with the groundwater flow field when multirate mass transfer processes are involved. Breakthrough curves at selected locations and the temporal changes in the calculated mass during the 20 year simulation period indicated that uranium adsorption/desorption never attained steady state because of the dynamic flow field and groundwater composition variations caused by river water intrusion. Thus, the multirate SCR model appears to be a crucial consideration for future reactive transport simulations of uranium contaminants at the Hanford 300 A site and elsewhere under similar hydrogeochemical conditions.

AB The global prevalence of rapid and extensive land use change necessitates hydrologic modelling methodologies capable of handling non-stationarity. This is particularly true in the context of Hydrologic Forecasting using Data Assimilation. Data Assimilation has been shown to dramatically improve forecast skill in hydrologic and meteorological applications, although such improvements are conditional on using bias-free observations and model simulations. A hydrologic model calibrated to a particular set of land cover conditions has the potential to produce biased simulations when the catchment is disturbed. This paper sheds new light on the impacts of bias or systematic errors in hydrologic data assimilation, in the context of forecasting in catchments with changing land surface conditions and a model calibrated to pre-change conditions. We posit that in such cases, the impact of systematic model errors on assimilation or forecast quality is dependent on the inherent prediction uncertainty that persists even in pre-change conditions. Through experiments on a range of catchments, we develop a conceptual relationship between total prediction uncertainty and the impacts of land cover changes on the hydrologic regime to demonstrate how forecast quality is affected when using state estimation Data Assimilation with no modifications to account for land cover changes. This work shows that systematic model errors as a result of changing or changed catchment conditions do not always necessitate adjustments to the modelling or assimilation methodology, for instance through re-calibration of the hydrologic model, time varying model parameters or revised offline/online bias estimation.

AB Accurately predicting bare-soil evaporation requires the proper characterization of the near-surface atmospheric conditions. These conditions, dependent on factors such as surface microtopography and wind velocity, vary greatly and therefore require high-resolution datasets to be fully incorporated into evaporation models. These factors are oftentimes parameterized in models through the aerodynamic resistance (r(a)), in which the vapor roughness length (z(0v)) and the momentum roughness length (z(0m)) are two crucial parameters that describe the transport near the soil-atmosphere interface. Typically, when evaluating bare-soil evaporation, these two characteristic lengths are assumed equal, although differences are likely to occur especially in turbulent flows over undulating surfaces. Thus, this study aims to investigate the relationship between z(0v) and z(0m) above undulating surfaces to ultimately improve accuracy in estimating evaporation rate. To achieve this goal, four uniquely designed wind tunnel-soil tank experiments were conducted considering different wind speeds and undulation spacings. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the velocity field above the undulating surface in high resolution. Using the high-fidelity data set, the logarithmic ratio of z(0v) to z(0m) is determined and used to estimate r(a). Results confirm that these lengths differ significantly, with the logarithmic ratio roughly ranging from -15 to -5 under the conditions tested. PIV-measured results demonstrate this ratio is closely tied to the mass and momentum transport behaviors influenced by surface undulations. Using the data-integrated formulation of r(a), predictions of evaporation rate were prepared for both the laboratory and lysimeter experiments, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach in this study.

AB Large circumpolar rivers influence the biogeochemistry of coastal shelf ecosystems and Arctic Ocean circulation. From 2007 to 2010, Mackenzie River nutrients were measured immediately upstream of the Mackenzie Delta. Total suspended sediment (TSS) and the dissolved and particulate fractions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were measured throughout the water year, stratified by hydrologically defined seasonal periods. Sampling was most frequent during the ice breakup and freshet periods to capture changes in sediment and nutrient concentrations that occurred with rapidly changing discharge. Our 4 year sampling coverage yielded constituent-specific concentration-discharge relationships that differed among seasonal hydrological periods for 6 of 12 constituents. Results revealed that having data from the rising-water freshet, when ice effects drive much higher water levels for a given discharge than during open water, had a surprisingly modest effect on annual flux calculations for most constituents. The rising freshet, however, was dominated by high relative levels of C-rich dissolved organic matter, P-rich particles, and N-rich inorganic nutrients. Comparisons with fluxes based on volume-weighted means of sample concentrations revealed that most, though not all, river fluxes were strongly driven by short-term concentration-discharge dynamics rather than by total annual discharge. Comparisons with fluxes derived for the Mackenzie discharge record, where results from other years are available, suggest that concentration-discharge relations may not be robust beyond the observation period in this system. Constituent fluxes herein differ from previously published fluxes for the Mackenzie (e.g., lower TSS, higher dissolved organic carbon), likely reflecting more frequent measurements, more representative characterization of differing hydrological periods, and possible changes in concentration-discharge relations during the longer-term Mackenzie record.

AB In general, preferential flow occurring in forest catchments cannot be reasonably described using classical partial differential equations. As a result, linear or nonlinear reservoir models are widely used in hillslope and catchment hydrology. Currently, few studies have simulated the hydrological threshold behavior that has been observed in many experimental catchments. In this study, five models with different structures were constructed using linear reservoir method to explore the inherent mechanisms of threshold behavior and to analyze the uncertainty of model structure in threshold simulations. According to the model results, the average bedrock depression storage over the study catchment (0.99 km(2)), which can be represented using the height of the lowest lateral outlet from the reservoir bottom (h(1)), was 1.5-5.1 mm. Substantial movable water percolated into the fissure bedrock and was discharged into the streamflow as base flow after storm events, illustrating why the slope of the linear relationships between the total event precipitation plus the antecedent soil moisture index (P+ASI) and the event quick flow depth above the rising threshold was less than one. Streamflow was simulated effectively by all five models with (h(1)>0) or without (h(1)=0) bedrock depression storage; however, different ratios of annual infiltration into bedrock to annual interflow discharged to the stream were obtained by models with h(1)>0 (2.5-2.8) and h(1)=0 (1.8-1.9). Namely, the calculated infiltration into bedrock was larger by models with h(1)>0 than that by models with h(1)=0. At the storm event scale, the simulated total bedrock flow was larger than the interflow for models with h(1)>0 by a ratio of 1:0.7, whereas for models with h(1)=0 the ratio was approximate to 1:1.5.

AB The solution to the 2-D time-dependent unsaturated flow equation is numerically approximated by a second-order accurate cell-centered finite-volume discretization on unstructured grids. The approximation method is based on a vertex-centered Least Squares linear reconstruction of the solution gradients at mesh edges.
   A Taylor series development in time of the water content dependent variable in a finite-difference framework guarantees that the proposed finite volume method is mass conservative. A Picard iterative scheme solves at each time step the resulting non-linear algebraic problem. The performance of the method is assessed on five different test cases and implementing four distinct soil constitutive relationships. The first test case deals with a column infiltration problem. It shows the capability of providing a mass-conservative behavior. The second test case verifies the numerical approximation by comparison with an analytical mixed saturated-unsaturated solution. In this case, the water drains from a fully saturated portion of a 1-D column. The third and fourth test cases illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme on sharp soil heterogeneities on 1-D and 2-D multi-layered infiltration problems. The 2-D case shows the passage of an abrupt infiltration front across a curved interface between two layers. Finally, the fifth test case compares the numerical results with an analytical solution that is developed for a 2-D heterogeneous soil with a source term representing plant roots. This last test case illustrates the formal second-order accuracy of the method in the numerical approximation of the pressure head. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The probability density function (pdf) of solute concentration is a useful tool for modeling transport of contaminants in heterogeneous aquifers that is increasingly used in risk assessment and, more generally, as a mean to quantify uncertainty in transport modeling. In order to be effective the pdfs should be linked in a simple manner to the spatial variability model of hydraulic properties, pore-scale (local) dispersion, and a suitable parametrization of the geochemical processes. We analyze the pdf and concentration moments of two aqueous species in equilibrium with their precipitate reacting upon mixing in two-and three-dimensional geological formations. The speciation equations, resulting from application of the chromatographic theory, provide the link between concentration pdfs (and moments) of the aqueous species and that of a passive tracer. Within this framework, we investigate the role of pore-scale dispersion and macrodispersion in enhancing mixing, and thus reaction between the aqueous species, in the case of an instantaneous injection of a water with contrasting concentrations with respect to the ambient water under the constraint that in both waters the two aqueous species are in equilibrium with their precipitate. The main conclusion of our analysis is that for the pore-scale dispersion typically observed in natural formations, the local concentration pdfs of both species are far from being Gaussian, and therefore the first two concentration moments provide very limited information of the underlying transport dynamics. Instead, the pdfs provide crucial information for applications, such as the probability of exceeding a given concentration, for example, the regulatory limit, at a particular location within the domain of interest. Furthermore, by analyzing the second-order moments of the concentration, we show that mixing is strongly affected by space dimensionality and that the two-dimensional approach, often used for computational convenience, may severely underestimate reaction rates in real settings.

AB An inverse model is proposed to calculate unit hydrographs as well as the impulse response of fluxes from rainfall-runoff or rainfall-flux data, the purpose of which is hydrograph separation. Contrary to what hydrologists have been doing for years, hydrograph separation is carried out by using transfer functions in their entirety, which enables accurate separation of fluxes. All the components that participate in the global hydrologic balance are calculated in order to fit historical and computed flow and fluxes. The effective rainfall and the effective input fluxes are calculated from inversion. Unit hydrograph as well as impulse response of fluxes are decomposed into a quick and a slow component, and, consequently, the effective rainfall is decomposed into two parts, one contributing to the quick flow (or flux) and the other contributing to the slow flow generation. A regularization method is proposed to inverse the problem, whatever the degree of stability of the numerical systems since the regularization parameters are optimized. This regularization method borrows most of its principles from the L curve theory. The inverse method is applied to understand the mechanisms affecting nitrate transport in the Coet-Dan catchment, Brittany (France), where high levels of nitrate pollution result from intensive agriculture. The hydrograph response to dissolved species is decomposed into quick and slow components, the former being separated into two subcomponents related to shallow and deep groundwater, respectively. Variable pollution levels and efficient denitrification of deep groundwater through pyrite oxidation lead to variable chemical composition in the groundwater column. By using nitrate and sulfate fluxes, the slow component of the unit hydrograph response can be separated into nitrate-contaminated and denitrified groundwater responses to rainfall, which enables an accurate assessment of the denitrification capacity of the catchment.

AB [ 1] Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of water movement through the bedrock in the rainfall-runoff process on steep hillslopes. However, quantitative information on this process is still limited. The objective of this study was to address the following questions: ( 1) How large is the area where bedrock groundwater seeps into the soil layer, and ( 2) what is the rate of water flow out of the bedrock? To address these questions, detailed hydrological, hydrochemical, and thermal measurements were conducted at a forested steep unchanneled granitic concave slope in the Tanakami Mountains, central Japan. The relationship between the amplitude of annual soil temperature variation and the measurement depth showed that in a normal low-flow period, the seepage area ranged between 14 and 21 m 2 and the ratio of this area to that of the whole catchment was about 2.0%. In a drought period the seepage area ranged between 3.5 and 5.5 m(2), and the ratio to the whole catchment was around 0.5%. The variation in the area of seepage was controlled both by the short-term precipitation pattern during the preceding several weeks and by the long-term pattern over several preceding months. A two-component geochemical hydrograph separation indicated that the ratio of bedrock groundwater to streamflow was about 0.82 for the normal low-flow periods and 0.90 for the drought period. The rate of flow out of the bedrock into the soil layer ranged from 0.5 to 3.3 m(3) d(-1). That is, although the seepage area was small (0.5-2.0% of the catchment), the contribution of bedrock groundwater was considerable (50-95% of streamflow).

AB In this study, the analysis of documentary records on the storm events in the Annals of the Choson Dynasty, covering the entire period of 519 years from 1392 to 1910, was carried out. By applying various key words related to storm events, a total of 556 documentary records could be identified. The main objective of this study was to develop rules of classification for the documentary records on the storm events in the Annals of the Choson Dynasty. The results were also compared with the rainfall data of the traditional Korean rain gauge, named Chukwooki, which are available from 1777 to 1910 (about 130 years). The analysis is organized as follows. First, the frequency of the documents, their length, comments about the size of the inundated area, the number of casualties, the number of property losses, and the size of the countermeasures, etc. were considered to determine the magnitude of the events. To this end, rules of classification of the storm events are developed. Cases in which the word 'disaster' was used along with detailed information about the casualties and property damages, were classified as high-level storm events. The high-level storm events were additionally sub-categorized into catastrophic, extreme, and severe events. Second, by applying the developed rules of classification, a total of 326 events were identified as high-level storm events during the 519 years of the Choson Dynasty. Among these high-level storm events, only 19 events were then classified as the catastrophic ones, 106 events as the extreme ones, and 201 events as the severe ones. The mean return period of these storm events was found to be about 30 years for the catastrophic events, 5 years for the extreme events, and 2-3 years for the severe events. Third, the classification results were verified considering the records of the traditional Korean rain gauge; it was found that the catastrophic events are strongly distinguished from other events with a mean total rainfall and a storm duration equal to 439.8 mm and 49.3 h, respectively. The return period of these catastrophic events was also estimated to be in the range 100-500 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We used the 3D continuum-scale reactive transport models to simulate eight core flood experiments for two different carbonate rocks. In these experiments the core samples were reacted with brines equilibrated with pCO(2) = 3, 2, 1, 0.5 MPa (Smith et al., 2013 [27]). The carbonate rocks were from specific Marly dolostone and Vuggy limestone flow units at the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project in south-eastern Saskatchewan, Canada. Initial model porosity, permeability, mineral, and surface area distributions were constructed from micro tomography and microscopy characterization data. We constrained model reaction kinetics and porosity-permeability equations with the experimental data. The experimental data included time-dependent solution chemistry and differential pressure measured across the core, and the initial and final pore space and mineral distribution. Calibration of the model with the experimental data allowed investigation of effects of carbonate reactivity, flow velocity, effective permeability, and time on the development and consequences of stable and unstable dissolution fronts.
   The continuum scale model captured the evolution of distinct dissolution fronts that developed as a consequence of carbonate mineral dissolution and pore scale transport properties. The results show that initial heterogeneity and porosity contrast control the development of the dissolution fronts in these highly reactive systems. This finding is consistent with linear stability analysis and the known positive feedback between mineral dissolution and fluid flow in carbonate formations. Differences in the carbonate kinetic drivers resulting from the range of pCO2 used in the experiments and the different proportions of more reactive calcite and less reactive dolomite contributed to the development of new pore space, but not to the type of dissolution fronts observed for the two different rock types. The development of the dissolution front was much more dependent on the physical heterogeneity of the carbonate rock. The observed stable dissolution fronts with small but visible dissolution fingers were a consequence of the clustering of a small percentage of larger pores in an otherwise homogeneous Marly dolostone. The observed wormholes in the heterogeneous Vuggy limestone initiated and developed in areas of greater porosity and permeability contrast, following pre-existing preferential flow paths.
   Model calibration of core flood experiments is one way to specifically constrain parameter input used for specific sites for larger scale simulations. Calibration of the governing rate equations and constants for Vuggy limestones showed that dissolution rate constants reasonably agree with published values. However the calcite dissolution rate constants fitted to the Marly dolostone experiments are much lower than those suggested by literature. The differences in fitted calcite rate constants between the two rock types reflect uncertainty associated with measured reactive surface area and appropriately scaling heterogeneous distribution of less abundant reactive minerals. Calibration of the power-law based porosity-permeability equations was sensitive to the overall heterogeneity of the cores. Stable dissolution fronts of the more homogeneous Marly dolostone could be fit with the exponent n = 3 consistent with the traditional Kozeny-Carman equation developed for porous sandstones. More impermeable and heterogeneous cores required larger n values (n = 6-8). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Adjusting measured peak discharges from an urbanizing watershed to

AB [1] A procedure to adjust gauged streamflow data from watersheds urbanized during or after their gauging period is presented. The procedure adjusts streamflow to be representative of a fixed land use condition, which may reflect current or future development conditions. Our intent is to determine what an event resulting in a peak discharge in, for example, 1950 (i.e., before urbanization) would produce on the current urban watershed. While past approaches assumed uniform spatial and temporal changes in urbanization, this study focuses on the use of geographic information systems (GIS) based methodologies for precisely locating in space and time where land use change has occurred. This information is incorporated into a hydrologic model to simulate the change in discharge as a result of changing land use conditions. In this paper, we use historical aerial photographs, GIS linked tax-map data, and recent land use/land cover data to recreate the spatial development history of eight gauged watersheds in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Using our procedure to determine discharge series representative of the current urban watersheds, we found that the increase of the adjusted 2-year discharge ranged from 16 to 70 percent compared with the measured annual maximum discharge series. For the 100-year discharge the adjusted values ranged from 0 to 47 percent greater than the measured values. Additionally, relationships between the increase in flood flows and four measures of urbanization (increase in urban land, decrease in forested land, increase in high-density development, and the spatial development pattern) are investigated for predicting the increase in flood flows for ungauged watersheds. Watersheds with the largest increases in flood flows typically had more extensive development in the areas far removed from the outlet. In contrast, watersheds with development located nearer to the outlet typically had the smallest increases in peak discharge.

AB Since the development of the entropy theory by Shannon in the late 1940s and of the principle of maximum entropy (POME) by Jaynes in the late 1950s there has been a proliferation of applications of entropy in a wide spectrum of areas, including hydrological and environmental sciences. The real impetus to entropy-based hydrological modelling was provided by Amorocho and Espildora in 1972. A great variety of entropy applications in hydrology and water resources have since been reported, and new applications continue to unfold. This paper reviews the recent contributions on entropy applications in hydrology and water resources, discusses the usefulness and versatility of the entropy concept, and reflects on the strengths and limitations of this concept. The paper concludes with comments on its implications in developing countries. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID WETTING FRONT INSTABILITY; MELTWATER MOVEMENT
AB Water flow through a melting snow pack modifies its structure and stability and affects the release of water and nutrients into soils and surface waters. Field and laboratory observations indicate a large spatial variability on various scales of the liquid water content and flow, a dominant system feature currently not included in numerical models. We investigated experimentally water and dye tracer movement through microstructurally different snow pack horizons and the persistence of preferential flow paths. Naturally rounded snow of varying grain size was artificially packed to obtain well known conditions by sieving it into rectangular bins. Surface melt was induced with infrared lamps. The flow paths were visualized with tracers and liquid water content was monitored with time domain reflectometry probes. Vertical cuts through the snow pack were imaged. The dye tracer patterns allowed the two flow regimes,matrix flow' and 'preferential flow' to be distinguished. Matrix flow is apparently dominated by film and capillary flow in the unsaturated snow matrix. The capillary barrier effect at a boundary between a fine over a coarse textured layer on matrix flow in snow was confirmed. In contrast, preferential flow appears as well-defined flow fingers that advance from 0.1 to 1 cm s(-1). During a melt phase, the advancing flow fingers enlarge and are only partially time invariant. It remains to be shown whether the continuum concept, including the Darcy-Buckingham law is apt to describe the extremely non-linear nature of water flow and the travel time of solutes in Snow under conditions of melt water percolation. Probably, snow packs that include faceted crystals and large variations in bulk density, feature more pronounced capillary barriers and preferential flow triggering, but also stronger impeding of fingers by lateral dispersion. Further, triggering and persistence of preferential flow is complicated by the usually transient infiltration rate. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Bed material transported in geomorphically active gravel bed rivers often has a local source at nearby eroding banks and ends up sequestered in bars not far downstream. However, most 1-D numerical models for gravel transport assume that gravel originates from and deposits on the channel bed. In this paper, we present a 1-D framework for simulating morphodynamic evolution of bed elevation and size distribution in a gravel-bed river that actively exchanges sediment with its floodplain, which is represented as an off-channel sediment reservoir. The model is based on the idea that sediment enters the channel at eroding banks whose elevation depends on total floodplain sediment storage and on the average elevation of the floodplain relative to the channel bed. Lateral erosion of these banks occurs at a specified rate that can represent either net channel migration or channel widening. Transfer of material out of the channel depends on a typical bar thickness and a specified lateral exchange rate due either to net channel migration or narrowing. The model is implemented using an object oriented framework that allows users to explore relationships between bank supply, bed structure, and lateral change rates. It is applied to a similar to 50-km reach of the Ain River, France, that experienced significant reduction in sediment supply due to dam construction during the 20th century. Results are strongly sensitive to lateral exchange rates, showing that in this reach, the supply of sand and gravel at eroding banks and the sequestration of gravel in point bars can have strong influence on overall reach-scale sediment budgets.

AB Many studies over the past four decades have observed that capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S-w) relationships are often different when measured dynamically under rapidly changing pressure inputs. This phenomenon has been referred to as a dynamic capillary effect, and its magnitude is often quantified by the dynamic capillary coefficient, tau. Experimentally-reported values of tau have varied by orders of magnitude, even for seemingly similar experimental systems. The purpose of the present work is to numerically explore the likely impact of fluid properties on the calculation of tau from experimental measurements. Specifically, the emphasis is on understanding how spatial averaging of the saturation profiles resulting from different fluid combinations contributes to the apparent magnitude of tau derived from experimental measurements.
   Simulations of dynamic drainage in a packed sand column were conducted using the CompSim multiphase flow simulator. Four nonwetting phase fluids with viscosities spanning four orders of magnitude were studied. Comparison between local and spatially-averaged rates of saturation change show significant differences, with the magnitude of the difference increasing with increasing viscosity to interfacial tension ratio and increasing drainage rate. Results show that at averaging scales likely to be experienced during experimental saturation measurements, this effect is likely to produce significant differences in the ultimate magnitude of the calculated tau values for different fluid systems and drainage rates. This result means that conventional flow phenomena may produce an inherent systematic bias in experimental measurements of tau, amplifying measured values for high viscosity or low interfacial tension systems and for experiments where higher drainage rates are used.

AB In snow-fed catchments, it is crucial to monitor and model the snow water equivalent (SWE), particularly when simulating the melt water runoff. SWE distribution can, however, be highly heterogeneous, particularly in forested environments. Within these locations, scant studies have explored the spatiotemporal variability in SWE in relation with vegetation characteristics, with only few successful attempts. The aim of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap, through a detailed monitoring at nine locations within a 3.49 km(2) forested catchment in southern Quebec, Canada (47 degrees N, 71 degrees W). The catchment receives an annual average of 633 mm of solid precipitation and is predominantly covered with balsam fir stands. Extracted from intensive field campaign and high-resolution LiDAR data, this study explores the effect of fine scale forest features (tree height, tree diameter, canopy density, leaf area index [LAI], tree density and gap fraction) on the spatiotemporal variability in the SWE distribution. A nested stratified random sampling design was adopted to quantify small-scale variability across the catchment and 1810 manual snow samples were collected throughout the consecutive winters of 2016-17 and 2017-18. This study explored the variability of SWE using coefficients of variation (CV) and relating to the LAI. We also present existing spatiotemporal differences in maximum snow depth across different stands and its relationship with average tree diameter. Furthermore, exploiting key vegetation characteristics, this paper explores different approaches to model SWE, such as multiple linear regression, binary regression tree and neural networks (NN). We were unable to establish any relationship between the CV of SWE and the LAI. However, we observed an increase in maximum snow depth with decreasing tree diameter, suggesting an association between these variables. NN modelling (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] = 0.71) revealed that, snow depth, snowpack age and forest characteristics (tree diameter and tree density) are key controlling variables on SWE. Using only variables that are deemed to be more readily available (snow depth, tree height, snowpack age and elevation), NN performance falls by only 7% (NSE = 0.66).

AB This study focuses on experimental evaluation of the Forchheimer equation coefficients for non-Darcy flow in deformable rough-walled fractures. Water flow tests through twelve granite fracture samples with different roughness were conducted in a triaxial cell under confining stresses varying from 1.0 MPa to 30.0 MPa. A total of 2280 experimental data in the form of pressure gradient versus discharge were collected. Three representative types of nonlinear flow behaviors induced by inertial effect, fracture dilation and solid water interaction, respectively, were observed. Regression analyses of the experimental data show that the Forchheimer equation adequately describes the non-Darcy flow behavior induced by significant inertial effect. Based on the experimental observations, two empirical equations were proposed for parametric expression of the Forchheimer's nonlinear coefficient, one as a power function of hydraulic aperture and the other dependent on both hydraulic aperture and peak asperity of the fracture surface. A new criterion was presented for assessing the applicability of Darcy's law, which relies on the ratio of discharge or pressure gradient predicted by the Forchheimer's law incorporated with the single-parameter equation to that predicted by the Darcy's law. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the double-parameter equation for examining the dependence of the Forchheimer's nonlinear coefficient on peak asperity, demonstrating the importance of incorporating the fracture roughness in the development of non-Darcy flow models. The experimental results and the proposed models are useful for understanding and numerical modeling of the nonlinear flow behaviors in fractured aquifers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and reliable near-real-time satellite precipitation estimation is of great importance for operational large-scale flood forecasting and drought monitoring. The state-of-the-art precipitation post-processing model is based on a deterministic approach to construct relationships between satellites estimates and ground observations. We propose a probabilistic postprocessor, the Probabilistic Post-Processing of Near-Real-Time Satellite Precipitation Estimates using Quantile Regression Forests (QRF4P-NRT), based on quantile modeling, yielding both deterministic and probabilistic predictions. The experimental design incorporates different solutions of near-real-time predictors to further improve the model performance. Using the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals Early Run for Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG-E) product as an example, we illustrate that the proposed method significantly improves the overall quality of the raw IMERG-E and is also superior to the bias-corrected product (IMERG Final Run, IMERG-F) at daily scale in a complex mountain basin. Evaluations of the corrected IMERG-E, raw IMERG-E, and IMERG-F using ground observation show that the corrected IMERG-E improves correlation coefficients (0.7), mean error (-0.14 mm/day) and root mean square error (3.3 mm/day) relative to the raw IMERG-E (0.31, -0.72 and 5.5 mm/day) and IMERG-F (0.34, -0.09 and 6.0 mm/day). The error decomposition further confirms that the QRF4P-NRT improves on the various deficiencies of the raw IMERG-E product. The ensemble assessment also demonstrates that the quantile outputs provide reliable prediction spread and sharp prediction intervals. The promising results indicate the great potential of the proposed method for probabilistic post-processing for near-real-time satellite precipitation estimates, and for further applications such as hydrological ensemble forecasting.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In this paper, a new index is proposed for the selection of the best regional frequency analysis method. First, based on the theory of reliability, the new selective index is developed. The variances of three regional T-year event estimators are then derived. The proposed methodology is applied to an actual watershed. For each regional method, the reliability of various T-year regional estimates is computed. Finally, the reliability-based selective index graph is constructed from which the best regional method can be determined. In addition, the selection result is compared with that based on the traditional index, root mean square error. The proposed new index is recommended as an alternative to the existing indices such as root mean square error, because the influence of uncertainty and the accuracy of estimates are considered.

AB The sea surface temperature (SST), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as the oceanic-atmospheric parameters could be used as input parameters for long-term drought modeling. This study, for the first time in hydro-climatic studies, applies the concept of the Z-number valued if-then rules to predict the monthly dry, wet, and normal periods. In contrast to the classic fuzzy logic, which does not talk about the confidence and reliability of data and information, Z-numbers consist of restraint and reliability and have significant potential to describe the uncertainty of human knowledge. To highlight this approach, classified monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI) of two synoptic stations of Tabriz and Kermanshah in Iran as predictands and different lags of SST time series of surrounding seas (Black, Mediterranean and Red Seas), NAO and SOI indices as predictors (for 1955-2019) were used to construct teleconnection between inputs and outputs and the obtained results were compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy model. The results indicated that the approach using Z-numbers could lead to more comprehensive and accurate results averagely up to 146% and 590%, respectively, for the Kermanshah and Tabriz owing to its ability to consider uncertainty and reliability of information and allocating appropriate weights to the rules.

AB We present a trajectory-based technique for calculating solute transport in a porous medium that has several advantages over existing methods. Unlike streamlines, the extended trajectories are influenced by each of the important parameters governing transport, including molecular diffusion and transverse dispersion. The approach is complete and does not require any additional techniques, such as operator splitting or particle tracking, in order to account for the full dispersion tensor. The semianalytic expressions make it clear how the flow field, the concentration distribution, and the dispersion tensor contribute to the velocity field of an injected solute. The equations are valid for an arbitrary porous medium, including those with rapid spatial variations in properties, overcoming limitations faced by previous approaches based upon asymptotic techniques. A test on a layered model with sharp boundaries indicates that the extended trajectories are compatible with the results of a numerical simulator and differ from streamlines. We also describe a new form of the dispersion tensor that incorporates a known asymmetry. The trajectories indicate that the modifications of the dispersion tensor lead to more focused transport within regions of high conductivity. Finally, the trajectories are used to define a semianalytic relationship between solute travel times and variations in solute velocities along a path that may be used for tomographic imaging. In an application to the injection of a radioactive tracer into a Berea sandstone core, monitored using micropositron emission tomographic (micro-PET) observations, the sensitivities are used to map the spatial variations of permeability within the core.
   Plain Language Summary We describe a new approach to calculating the trajectories of solute moving in a flow field. The paths reflect the effects of the physical processes influencing the solute migration. The trajectories are useful for visualization of solute transport and for efficient imaging approaches that resemble medical tomography.

AB Using a first-order cross-correlation analysis, this paper investigates the relationship between observed heads and hydraulic properties in the saturated and vadose zones at different times and locations of three-dimensional unconfined aquifers during pumping tests. Cross-correlation analysis is a weighted sensitivity analysis casted into a stochastic framework. It determines the relative impact of each parameter with respect to others in time and space on the observed heads according to uncertainty or spatial variability of each parameter. It reveals the information content in measured drawdowns about heterogeneity during a pumping test in an unconfined aquifer, which is critical for aquifer parameter estimation. Based on a synthetic, numerical example, our cross-correlation analysis reveals that heads in the saturated zone at late times carry the greatest nonsymmetrically weighted information content about the hydraulic conductivity (K-S) distribution within the cone of depression. On the other hand, heads in the saturated zone at early times contain the most information about the specific storage (S-S) heterogeneity in a narrow region between the observation and pumping locations. During intermediate and late times, heads in the saturated zone largely reflect the effects of saturated water content (theta(S)) and pore-size parameter (alpha) in the thin unsaturated region near the water table above the pumping and observation locations. At last, heads in the vadose zone at late times carry the greatest information about theta(S) and alpha around the observation point. Citation: Mao, D., T.-C. J. Yeh, L. Wan, C.-H. Lee, K.-C.

AB Multidecadal variability can have profound implications for long-term viability of existing water management practices and design of water conveyance, storage, and treatment infrastructure. However, baseline hydrology for water supply planning and engineering design rarely includes the full range of variability and extremes captured by proxies and models of pre- and postinstrumental climate and hydrology. This paper examines the paleohydrology of the Saskatchewan River Basin (SRB), where Canada's fastest growing economy and population are vulnerable to drought and heavily reliant on runoff from the Rocky Mountains. We take a novel approach to time-series analysis of tree-ring reconstructions of the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers. This study evaluates shifts in water availability, volatility as defined in terms of statistical dispersion, and stability as defined in terms of Shannon entropy, between adjacent 30 year windows-corresponding to the standard climatic normal period, and human generational timescales. Broadly speaking, outcomes reveal that gauge records appear unreliable as a basis for long-term water supply planning and engineering design. For example, (1) two preinstrumental periods of stable water deficits represent sustained droughts that current water use and management could not endure, (2) hydroclimatic relationships between the two subbasins, and with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, change over the generations, and (3) the most anomalous period of the past millennium, with coinciding high levels of availability, volatility, and stability, was about 1890-1920. This happens precisely when the SRB was transformed from prairie and parkland to agricultural land cover- and the precedents for water allocation and use were established. Citation: Fleming, S.

AB Mass and heat transfer occurring across phase-interfaces in multi-phase flow in porous media are mostly approximated using equilibrium relationships or empirical kinetic models. However, when the characteristic time of flow is smaller than that of mass or heat transfer, non-equilibrium situations may arise. Commonly, empirical approaches are used in such cases. There are only few works in the literature that use physically-based models for these transfer terms. in fact, one would expect physical approaches to modeling kinetic interphase mass and heat transfer to contain the interfacial area between the phases as a variable. Recently, a two-phase flow and solute transport model was developed that included interfacial area as a state variable [36]. In that model, interphase mass transfer was modeled as a kinetic process.
   In this work, we extend that model to account for kinetic heat transfer between two fluid phases as well as the solid phase. Therefore, we have introduced energy balances for both fluid phases and the solid phase and exchange terms that are proportional to specific interfacial areas.
   We briefly discuss how these macro-scale energy balances are developed. The resulting macro-scale equation system for two-phase flow, including kinetic heat and mass transfer, is discussed and non-dimensionalized. Based on the dimensionless equation system, possible simplifications are discussed. A numerical example illustrates a case where both kinetic interphase mass and heat transfer are relevant, and results are compared to those from a classical approach with equilibrium mass and heat transfer.

AB The direct numerical simulation of flows through composites is difficult due to the fine-scale heterogeneity in the media and also due to the complexity of the dynamic systems. Thus, flow based on upscaling of the effective diffusion has become an important step in practical simulations of flow through composites. In this paper, an analytical form for computing the effective diffusion tensor is proposed when the variable coefficient is locally isotropic, K(x) = k(x)I, where k(x) is a scalar function, not necessarily periodic, and may be defined as a step function. Currently, similar results are obtained by numerical means and require a special (re)design of a numerical code and may be computationally demanding. The proposed analytical upscaled tensor approximates the one obtained from the periodic cell-problem in the context of classical homogenization theory. The diagonal values are computed by an averaging procedure of the well known Cardwell and Parsons bounds. The off-diagonals are derived from the rotation of an angle related to the center of mass of the unit cell or representative elementary volume (REV). When comparing the proposed form with various known analytical and numerical results, it shows to be accurate within less than 3% on average. The comparisons include realistic reservoirs description and analytical results, such as the concentric spheres of Hashin-Shtrikman and the two and four-phase checkerboard geometries. Moreover, convergence results corroborate theoretical ones from classical homogenization literature. Convergence is obtained by performing successive refinement from an initial coarse description of a given heterogeneous medium, which include the SPE10 comparative solution project.

TI Effect of missing data on performance of learning algorithms for
   hydrologic predictions: Implications to an imputation technique
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MODELS
AB A common practice in preprocessing of data for use in hydrological modeling is to ignore observations with any missing variable values at any given time step, even if it is only one of the independent variables that is missing. In most cases, these rows of data are labeled incomplete and would not be used in either model building or subsequent model testing and verification. We argue that this is not necessarily an optimal approach for dealing with missing data because significant information could be lost when incomplete rows of data are discarded. Learning algorithms are affected by such problems more than physically based models because they rely heavily on data to learn the underlying input/output relationships of the systems being modeled. In this study, the extent of damage to the performance of learning algorithms due to missing data is explored in a field-scale application. To do so, we employed two well-known learning algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) for short-term prediction of groundwater levels at a well field. Performance comparison is made by subjecting these algorithms to various levels of missing data. In addition to understanding the relative strengths of these algorithms in dealing with missing data, an approach for filling the data gaps in the form of an imputation methodology is proposed and tested against observed data. The utility of the current approach is further demonstrated by analyzing model runs obtained with and without imputed data. It is shown that as the percentage of missing data increases, the forecasting accuracy of ANNs is compromised more than that of SVMs. However, ANNs also derive the greater benefit from the use of imputed data.

AB The pioneering work of Jaynes in Bayesian/maximum entropy methods has been successfully explored in many disciplines. The principle of maximum entropy (PME) is a powerful and versatile tool of inferring a probability distribution from constraints that do not completely characterize that distribution. Minimum relative entropy (MRE) is a method which has all the important attributes of the maximum entropy approach with the advantage that prior information may be easily included. In this paper we use MRE to determine the prior probability density function (pdf) of a set of model parameters based on limited information. The resulting pdf is used in Monte Carlo simulations to provide expected values in field variables such as concentration, and confidence limits. We compare the probabilistic results from a traditional advection-dispersion (ADE) model based on volumetric averaging concepts with that of a model based on the assumption that the hydraulic conductivity is a stationary stochastic process. The results suggest that although Naff's (1990) model satisfies the observed data to a better degree than ADE model, the upper and lower confidence bands about the mean value are larger than the ADE results. This result we attribute to the fact that Naff's (1990) model simply contains more parameters, each of which is unknown and has to be estimated. There is no statistical difference between the expected values of second-spatial moments for the two models. The examples presented in this paper illustrate problems associated with assigning Gaussian pdfs as priors in a probabilistic model. First, such an assumption for the input parameters actually injects more information into the problem than may actually exist, whether consciously or unconsciously. This fact is borne out by comparison with minimum relative entropy theory. Second, the output parameters as suggested from the Monte Carlo analysis cannot be assumed to be Gaussian distributed even when the prior pdf is Gaussian in form. In a practical setting, the significance of this result and the approximation of Gaussian form would depend on the toxicity and environmental standards that apply to the problem.

AB Inter-basin water transfers (IBWT) are implemented to re-allocate unevenly distributed water resources. However, many conflicting objectives associated with society, economy, and environment have made the water resources allocation problem in IBWT more complicated than ever before. Thus, there is a continuous need for in-depth research with the latest optimization techniques to secure many-objective allocation of water resources for IBWT. In addition, being troubled of easily falling into local minima and premature convergence in some multi-objective optimization algorithms, it is necessary to explore new alternatives to improve their search quality. Here we propose a many-objective optimization methodology for IBWT, which includes three modules: (1) formulating a many-objective optimization problem based on realistic controls; (2) developing a new multi-objective real-coded quantum inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm (r-MQSFLA) to solve the optimization problem; (3) utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-Entropy method to filter the Pareto solutions. In r-MQSFLA, the real-coded quantum computer and the external archive with dynamic updating mechanism are applied to SFLA. The performance of r-MQSFLA is first compared to that of other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in solving mathematical benchmark problems. A case study of the Eastern Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project in Jiangsu Province, China varying from a normal to an extremely dry year, demonstrates that r-MQSFLA displays approximate performance on some compared algorithms and is improved significantly than MOSFLA in terms of convergence, diversity and reasonable solutions. This study can update the understanding of quantum theory to MOEAs and will provide a reference for better water resources allocation in IBWT under uncertainty.

AB Dynamics of solute export from catchments can be classified in terms of chemostatic and chemodynamic export regimes by an analysis of concentration-discharge relationships. Previous studies hypothesized that distinct export regimes emerge from the presence of solute mass stores within the catchment and their connectivity to the stream. However, so far a direct link of solute export to identifiable catchment characteristics is missing. Here we investigate long-term time series of stream water quality and quantity of nine neighboring catchments in Central Germany ranging from relatively pristine mountain catchments to agriculturally dominated lowland catchments, spanning large gradients in land use, geology, and climatic conditions. Given the strong collinearity of catchment characteristics we used partial least square regression analysis to quantify the predictive power of these characteristics for median concentrations and the metrics of export regime. We can show that median concentrations and metrics of the export regimes of major ions and nutrients can indeed be inferred from catchment characteristics. Strongest predictors for median concentrations were the share of arable land, discharge per area, runoff coefficient and available water capacity in the root zone of the catchments. The available water capacity in the root zone, the share of arable land being artificially drained and the topographic gradient were found to be the most relevant predictors for the metrics of export regime. These catchment characteristics can represent the size of solute mass store such as the fraction of arable land being a measure for the store of nitrate. On the other hand, catchment characteristics can be a measure for the connectivity of these solute stores to the stream such as the fraction of tile drained land in the catchments. This study demonstrates the potential of data-driven, top down analyses using simple metrics to classify and better understand dominant controls of solute export from catchments.

AB Transit times are being increasingly explored as process-based tools for conceptualizing hydrological function at a range of scales. Despite this, little effort has been made to relate transit times to conventional hydrometric flow statistics. Rather, the identification of the appropriate transit time distribution (TTD) for a hydrological system and the derivation of metrics such as the mean transit time (MTT) have required quantitative assessment of input-output relationships for conservative tracers using lumped parameter models. This has allowed the main landscape controls to be identified and has facilitated the prediction of MTTs in ungauged basins in particular geomorphic provinces, though relationships with streamflow measures have been unexamined. We used estimated MTTs (with uncertainty) for 16 experimental catchments (0.5-690 km(2) in area) with contrasting geologic, topographic, pedologic and climatic characteristics in Scotland. The MTT was highly variable ranging from 60 days to ca > 1500 days, reflecting differences in catchment soil cover, geomorphic properties and precipitation. The MTT was closely correlated with key hydrometric design statistics such as the mean annual flood (MAF) and percentiles of high (Q(5)) and low (Q(95)) flows. Analysis of MTT estimates, in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS)-based assessment of landscape controls, showed that MTT could be predicted to within 30% for ungauged basins from catchment soil cover and drainage density. Furthermore, hydrometric design statistics for ungauged basins could also be forecast from MTT predictions with median relative errors of 14, 11 and 28% for the MAF, Q(5) and Q(95) respectively. We suggest that MTTs-predicted from mapped landscape characteristics-can be useful diagnostic metrics for ungauged montane basins, as well as a useful similarity index for process-based catchment classification. This is important as montane headwaters are often critical, but data-poor environments influencing the quantity, quality and ecology of downstream flows. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this manuscript, we focus on the study of flow structures in a channel partially obstructed by arrays of vertical, rigid, emergent, vegetation/cylinders. Special attention is given to understand the effect of the contraction ratio, defined as the ratio of the obstructed area width to the width of the unobstructed area, on the flow hydrodynamic structures and to analyze the transversal flow velocity profile at the obstructed-unobstructed interface. A large data set of transversal mean flow velocity profiles and turbulence characteristics is reported from experiments carried out in a laboratory flume. The flow velocities and turbulence intensities have been measured with a 3D Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV)-Vectrino manufactured by Nortek. It was observed that the arrays of emergent vegetation/cylinders strongly affect the flow structures, forming a shear layer immediately next to the obstructed-unobstructed interface, followed by an adjacent free-stream region of full velocity flow.
   The experimental results show that the contraction ratio significantly affects the flow hydrodynamic structure. Adaptation of the Prandtl's log-law modified by Nikuradse led to the determination of a characteristic hydrodynamic roughness height to define the array resistance to the flow. Moreover, an improved modified log-law predicting the representative transversal profile of the mean flow velocity, at the obstructed-unobstructed interface, is proposed. The benefit of this modified log-law is its easier practical applicability, i.e., it avoids the measurements of some sensitive turbulence parameters, in addition, the flow hydrodynamic variables forming it are predictable, using the initial hydraulic conditions.

AB We examined how the projected increase in atmospheric CO2 and concomitant shifts in air temperature and precipitation affect water and carbon fluxes in an Asian tropical rainforest, using a combination of field measurements, simplified hydrological and carbon models, and Global Climate Model (GCM) projections. The model links the canopy photosynthetic flux with transpiration via a bulk canopy conductance and semi-empirical models of intercellular CO2 concentration, with the transpiration rate determined from a hydrologic balance model. The primary forcing to the hydrologic model are current and projected rainfall statistics. A main novelty in this analysis is that the effect of increased air temperature on vapor pressure deficit (D) and the effects of shifts in precipitation statistics on net radiation are explicitly considered. The model is validated against field measurements conducted in a tropical rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia under current climate conditions. On the basis of this model and projected shifts in climatic statistics by GCM, we compute the probability distribution of soil moisture and other hydrologic fluxes. Regardless of projected and computed shifts in soil moisture, radiation and mean air temperature, transpiration was not appreciably altered. Despite increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) and unchanged transpiration, canopy photosynthesis does not significantly increase if C-i/C-n is assumed constant independent of D (where C-i is the bulk canopy intercellular CO2 concentration). However, photosynthesis increased by a factor of 1.5 if C-i/C-a decreased linearly with D as derived from Leuning stomatal conductance formulation [R. Leuning. Plant Cell Environ 1995;18:339-55]. How elevated atmospheric CO2 alters the relationship between C-i/C-a and D needs to be further investigated under elevated atmospheric CO2 given its consequence on photosynthesis (and concomitant carbon sink) projections.

It shows that in order to obtain a unique estimate of hydraulic parameters, along each streamline of the flow field (1) spatial and temporal head observations must be given; (2) the number of spatial and temporal head observations required should be greater or equal to the number of unknown parameters; (3) the flux boundary condition or the pumping rate of a well must be specified for the homogeneous case and both boundary flux and pumping rate are a must for the heterogeneous case; (4) head observations must encompass both saturated and unsaturated conditions, and the functional relationships for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity/pressure head and for the moisture retention should be given, and (5) the residual water content value also need to be specified a priori or water content measurements are needed for the estimation of the saturated water content.
   For field problems, these necessary conditions can be collected or estimated but likely involve uncertainty. While the problems become well defined and have unique solutions, the solutions likely will be uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, stochastic approaches are deemed to be appropriate for inverse problems as they are for forward problems to address uncertainty. Nevertheless, knowledge of these necessary conditions is critical to reduce uncertainty in both characterization of the vadose zone and the aquifer, and prediction of water flow and solute migration in the subsurface.

AB StorAge Selection (SAS) functions describe how catchments selectively remove water of different ages in storage via discharge, thus controlling the transit time distribution (TTD) and solute composition of discharge. SAS-based models have been emerging as promising tools for quantifying catchment-scale solute export, providing a coherent framework for describing both velocity-driven and celerity-driven transport. Due to their application in headwaters only, the spatial heterogeneity of catchment physiographic characteristics, land use management practices, and large-scale validation have not been adequately addressed with SAS-based models. Here, we integrated SAS functions into the grid-based mHM-Nitrate model (mesoscale Hydrological Model) at both grid scale (distributed model) and catchment scale (lumped model). The proposed model provides a spatially distributed representation of nitrogen dynamics within the soil zone and a unified approach for representing both velocity-driven and celerity-driven subsurface transport below the soil zone. The model was tested in a heterogeneous mesoscale catchment. Simulated results show a strong spatial heterogeneity in nitrogen dynamics within the soil zone, highlighting the necessity of a spatially explicit approach for describing near-surface nitrogen processing. The lumped model could well capture instream nitrate concentration dynamics and the concentration-discharge relationship at the catchment outlet. In addition, the model could provide insights into the relations between subsurface storage, mixing scheme, solute export, and the TTDs of discharge. The distributed model shows results that are comparable to the lumped model. Overall, the results reveal the potential for large-scale applications of SAS-based transport models, contributing to the understanding of water quality-related issues in agricultural landscapes.

AB Diel temperature fluctuations have been used to quantify vertical water flow through saturated sediments with 1-D analytical heat models. The underlying transport equation relies on assumptions that could be violated using field temperature records. To test the capability of this method a hydraulic laboratory experiment was designed. A mass of fully water-saturated homogeneous sand was exposed to 19 different uniform pressure gradients inducing steady state Darcy velocities 0 < q < 25 m d(-1). An areal heating grid generated steady sinusoidal thermal forcing. Multipoint sediment temperature responses demonstrated increasing spatial variability for increasing velocities. This introduced horizontal temperature gradients. Velocities calculated from heat tracing were compared to velocities independently obtained from solute slugs. Heat- and solute-derived velocities agreed for q < 3 m d(-1), but heat-derived velocities were consistently larger at higher velocities. Temperature amplitude- and phase-derived velocities revealed significant scatter when compared to solute velocities. This scatter reduced when amplitude- and phase-derived velocities were compared for each sensor pair. The variability in heat-derived velocities therefore represents a spatially variable flow field in the sand. However, amplitude-and phase-derived velocities deviated from a 1: 1 relationship at higher velocities. This can partly be explained by longitudinal thermal dispersivity, and partly by enhanced thermal spreading due to horizontal temperature gradients originating from nonuniform flow. This is surprising given the homogeneous sand and transition zone transport conditions (Pe(t) < 0.7). These findings have implications for the quantification of velocities from field records because field conditions are likely more heterogeneous, which would exacerbate the effects found in this study.

AB This study examines the impact of a sloping base on the movement of transients through groundwater systems. Dimensionless variables and regression of model results are employed to develop functions relating the transient change in saturated thickness to the distance upgradient and downgradient from recharge or withdrawal. Convolution of these transient response functions (made possible due to linearity of partial differential equations in the model) enables computation of changes in saturated thickness over recharge/withdrawal that varies over space and time. Establishing the criteria and form of these functions led to the discovery of fundamental underlying properties: upgradient and downgradient responses may be scaled to achieve a symmetrical relationship, expressions are developed to compute change in saturated thickness at the location of water use, and downgradient response at large times form a S-shaped curve that effectively adds a diffusive component to the average velocity of the kinematic wave approximation, where the hydraulic gradient is equal to the bed slope. Hydrogeologic data for three study regions in the High Plains Aquifer are summarized, and model results are presented for changes in saturated thickness. The transient response functions are used to reconstruct and interpret groundwater response to historical water-use practices and to predict future changes in saturated thickness for a series of hypothetical alternative water-use scenarios. Depressions in groundwater elevation are observed both upgradient and downgradient from areas of high water use; however, these depressions preferentially move downgradient over time and may continue to spread downgradient far into the future. This approach quantifies and provides understanding of the impacts of changes in natural and anthropogenic hydrologic forcings on aquifer systems.

AB Several approaches are commonly applied to modeling fractured aquifers, including stochastic continuum (SC) and discrete fracture network (DFN) models. While DFN models provide a more realistic representation of the system, their development necessitates an accurate characterization of the fracture network. Extensive, and often prohibitive, resources are typically required to map a reliable fracture network, which is essential to develop an effective DFN model. The present study develops and demonstrates a simple framework for mapping transport pathways in fractured systems utilizing the coherence between solute transport and the lagged interdependence between two time series evaluated through the stochastic event synchrony (SES) technique. The SES-based framework was applied to solute breakthrough curves obtained i) analytically at different locations along a single, synthetic fracture both with and without matrix diffusion; and, ii) numerically at multiple locations within a synthetic, impervious fracture network. In all cases, the framework was capable of accurately mapping the transport pathways represented by direct pathes between the locations considered. The framework was also capable of identifying the hydrogeologic characteristics within each connection (i.e., flow velocity or its relationship to the dispersion coefficient). This framework is expected to significantly reduce the extensive resources required to identify the transport pathways within complex fractured aquifers. Additionally, the SES-based transport pathways identified may be used to enhance the reliability of other fracture network mapping, or generation, approaches by representing an additional constraint. This study is the first in the field of hydrogeology to adopt synchronization analysis and is expected to open the gate for using SES to address related problems

AB In this paper, we present an upscaled model for horizontal immiscible displacement in highly heterogeneous media. This type of heterogeneity can be found, for instance, in fractured rock, which consists of two flow domains, a mobile fracture and a virtually immobile matrix. We derive an upscaled double-continuum model capable of predicting flow in mobile-immobile domains using homogenization theory. The model consists of a flow equation for the saturation of displacing fluid in the fracture domain, and a capillary flow equation for saturation in the matrix, which are coupled via a source term. By linearizing capillary counter current flow in the matrix domain, we combine this system of equations into a non-local single-equation model for the fracture saturation, which can be interpreted as a multi-rate mass-transfer (MRMT) model for immiscible displacement. We discuss this simplification and the parametrization of the upscaled model equation from local hydraulic parameters obtained from rock samples and from knowledge of the average flow properties of the fracture network. We demonstrate its performance for predicting two-phase flow by considering a single fracture with imbibition into a rectangular matrix domain. The upscaled model is parameterized directly from geometry and hydraulic parameters of matrix and fracture of the reference model, which means that no parameters need to be fitted. We compare the detailed and upscaled models in terms of breakthrough curves for the displaced fluid at a control plane within the medium. Both the detailed numerical simulations and the upscaled model show a pre-asymptotic t(-1/2) scaling and a breakoff at the characteristic time scale for filling the matrix by counter current flow.

AB The potential for riverine drinking source water to become contaminated with pathogens is related to the production and transport of fecal waste from within the local catchment area. Identifying specific relationships between land-use types and fecal contamination in riverine water provides an indication of the risk associated with land-use change and helps to target mitigation measures toward land-use types of concern. Fecal coliform (FC) data from 42 riverine sites across British Columbia (BC), Canada, were examined in relation to land-use composition (including 16 land-use types) in the local catchment area. FC concentration significantly increased in relation to anthropogenic land-use impacts but was negatively associated with undisturbed and high-elevation land types. Regression tree analysis identified that highest FC concentrations occurred in catchments characterized by more than 12.5% agricultural land and more than 1.6% urban land. Furthermore, the risk of violation of the BC partial treatment raw drinking water quality guideline for FC concentration (100 CFU 100 mL(-1)) increased in relation to agricultural impacts. Additional factors, such as sewage treatment discharge, low dilution in smaller streams, and higher temperatures, were associated with higher FC concentration among sites with similar levels of agricultural development. These results identify land-use types that present the greatest threat to riverine contamination, namely agricultural and urban land, and indicate the proportion of such land use associated with high contamination. Land use should be managed and source water protection should be targeted in light of these results so as to minimize the risk of surface water exposure to fecal contaminants.

AB [1] The relationship between dielectric permittivity, water saturation, and clay content for the Sherwood Sandstone from NE England was characterized as part of a wider study of the vadose zone moisture dynamics and pollution vulnerability of this aquifer. Dielectric permittivity was measured over the full range of saturation levels, for various lithologies ranging from clean medium-grained sandstone to fine-grained sandstone containing up to 5% clay, using a specially constructed dielectric cell. Dielectric constant, K-r, is largely independent of frequency between 350 MHz and 1000 MHz. Below 350 MHz, Kr of fine-grained, clay-rich sandstone shows frequency dispersion. Tests on physical models of the sandstone consisting of a fine fraction of Ottawa Sand and montmorillonite clay indicate that the clay minerals within the sandstone are responsible for its frequency dispersive behavior. These tests also show that increasing pore fluid salinity increases dielectric dispersion at the lower end of the frequency range, which indicates that this arises from the interfacial Maxwell-Wagner mechanism associated with platy clay particles. Water saturated sand: clay mixtures show very low dielectric constants at high frequencies (over 650 MHz). This effect is independent of salinity and probably results from the layered geometric arrangement of solids, bound and free water within the swelling clay. The complex refractive index method (CRIM) with a mineral dielectric constant of about 5 provides a good match to the water saturation versus dielectric constant data for all Sherwood Sandstone lithologies at frequencies between 350 and 1000 MHz and for clay-poor sandstone at lower frequencies. Below 350 MHz the presence of a few percent of clay in some Sherwood Sandstone lithologies raises their CRIM best fit mineral dielectric constant substantially.

AB Spatial variability of surface hydraulic properties and the extrinsic (e.g., traffic, cropping, etc.) and intrinsic (e.g., soil type, pore size distribution, etc.) factors; associated with these properties are important for infiltration and runoff processes in agricultural fields. Disc infiltrometers measured infiltration at 296 sites arranged on two parallel transects. To examine and differentiate the factors contributing to spatial structure under different field conditions these measurements were made in the corn rows, no-track interrows, and wheel track interrows of the field using four different soil water tensions Psi (0, 30, 60, and 150 mm). Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were maximum in the corn rows and minimum in wheel track interrows, with no-track interrows intermediate. Exponents (alpha parameters) of K-s and K relationships (K = K-s exp(-alpha Psi)) for corn rows and no-track interrows were not significantly different from each other but were significantly different from ct for the wheel track interrows at P = 0.01 level. Spatial variability of K and K-s values showed some pseudoproportional effect in nugget variance for all three field conditions. No-track interrows clearly showed an inverse trend for semivariogram of K with changing tension (Psi) values, whereas differences were found for corn rows and wheel traffic interrows. The spatial structure of a: for all three field conditions were mostly white noise. Under corn rows, in addition to random variation, a small five-row periodic variation at the P = 0.20 level, matching the five-row traffic configuration, was discovered. The spatial structure of ct was influenced by soil type for the no-track interrows. Spatial structure was absent in wheel track interrows, indicating the destruction of pore structure due to compaction.

TI A Hybrid Model for Fast and Probabilistic Urban Pluvial Flood Prediction
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Urban flooding is highly uncertain, so the use of probabilistic approaches in early flood warning is encouraged. While well-established 1-D/2-D hydrodynamic sewer models do exist, their deterministic nature and long computational time undermine their applicability for real-time urban flood nowcasting. Aiming at meeting the needs of fast and probabilistic flood modeling, a new hybrid modeling method integrating a suite of lumped hydrological models and logistic regression is proposed. The lumped models are configured using graph theory techniques, based on the sewer system's topology and characteristics, to account for the spatial heterogeneity and physical processes and properties. The logistic regression models are calibrated to lumped models' results and Yes/No flooding information. Due to its conceptual and data-driven nature, the hybrid model makes fast probabilistic flood predictions at manhole locations. In two case studies, the results showed that when incorporating most dominant physical processes and properties in the model setup, the hybrid model can achieve up to 86% accuracy for flood warnings issued at 50% probability, with 96% computation saving, compared with a traditional 1-D hydrodynamic model. When such a detailed model is in place, the hybrid model is set up easily, but the accuracy could be further increased when historical flooding observations are considered.
   Plain Language Summary Forecasting urban flooding in real time requires a set of future rainfall scenarios and an urban drainage model. This procedure needs to be not only fast, so that the forecasts can be quickly updated, but also informative about the uncertainties in the forecasts. State-of-theart urban drainage models could simulate floods at street level based on physical processes, but the level of details make them slow and deterministic. Therefore, creating a model by reducing its physical complexity and complementing it with data-driven methods is promising to meet the need for real-time urban flood forecasting. The current study adopts such a hybrid model to predict flooding probabilities at detailed intracity locations.

AB The growth of vegetation is affected by water availability, while vegetation growth also feeds back to influence regional water balance. A better understanding of the relationship between vegetation state and water balance would help explain the complicated interactions between climate change, vegetation dynamics, and the water cycle. In the present study, the impact of vegetation coverage on regional water balance was analyzed under the framework of the Budyko hypothesis by using data from 99 catchments in the nonhumid regions of China, including the Inland River basin, the Hai River basin, and the Yellow River basin. The distribution of vegetation coverage on the Budyko curve was analyzed, and it was found that a wetter environment (higher P/E-0) had a higher vegetation coverage (M) and was associated with a higher evapotranspiration efficiency (E/E-0). Moreover, vegetation coverage was related not only to climate conditions (measured by the dryness index DI = E-0/P) but also to landscape conditions (measured by the parameter n in the coupled water-energy balance equation). This suggests that the regional long-term water balance should not vary along a single Budyko curve; instead, it should form a group of Budyko curves owing to the interactions between vegetation, climate, and water cycle. A positive correlation was found between water balance component (E/P) and vegetation coverage (M) for most of the Yellow River basin and for the Inland River basin, while a negative correlation of M similar to E/P was found in the Hai River basin. Vegetation coverage was successfully incorporated into an empirical equation for estimating the catchment landscape parameter n in the coupled water-energy balance equation. It was found that interannual variability in vegetation coverage could improve the estimation of the interannual variability in regional water balance.

AB Stemflow of xerophytic shrubs was monitored on event basis within a revegetated sand dune. Quantity of stemflow showed a clear species-specific dependence in combination with the rainfall characteristics. Results obtained revealed that for ovate-leaved C. korshinskii with an inverted cone-shaped canopy and smooth bark, the quantity of stemflow in depth accounted for 7.2% of the individual gross rainfall, while it was 2.0% for needle-leaved A. ordosica with a cone-shaped canopy and coarse bark. There were significant positive linear relationships between stemflow and individual gross rainfall and rainfall intensity for the two shrubs. An individual gross rainfall of 1.4 and 1.8 mm was necessary for stemflow generation for C. korshinskii and A. ordosica, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that the abiotic and biotic variables including the individual gross rainfall, mean windspeed (WS), canopy height, branch length, and canopy volume have significant influence on stemflow for C. korshinskii, whereas for A. ordosica, the notable influencing variables were individual gross rainfall, stem diameter, and leaf area index. Generally, WS has less effect on stemflow than that of rainfall for A. ordosica. The correlation relationship between individual gross rainfall and funneling ratio showed that the funneling ratio attains its peak when the gross rainfall is 13 and 16 mm for C. korshinskii and A. ordosica, respectively, implying that the canopy morphology emerged as determining factors on funneling ratio decrease when the individual gross rainfall exceeds these values. In comparison, higher WS increased the funneling ratio remarkably for C. korshinskii than A. ordosica due partly to the greater branch length and canopy projection area in C. korshinskii. Funneling ratio can be used as an integrated variable for the effects of canopy morphology and rainfall characteristics on stemflow. The implication of stemflow on water balance and its contribution to sustain the shrubs and the revegetation efforts was discussed. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The simulation of long time series of rainfall rates at short time steps remains an important issue for various applications in hydrology. Among the various types of simulation models, random multiplicative cascade models (RMC models) appear as an appealing solution which displays the advantages to be parameter parsimonious and linked to the multifractal theory. This paper deals with the calibration and validation of RMC models. More precisely, it discusses the limits of the scaling exponent function method often used to calibrate RMC models, and presents an hydrological validation of calibrated RMC models. A 8-year time series of 1-min rainfall rates is used for the calibration and the validation of the tested models. The paper is organized in three parts. In the first part, the scaling invariance properties of the studied rainfall series is shown using various methods (q-moments, PDMS, autocovariance structure) and a RMC model is calibrated on the basis of the rainfall data scaling exponent function. A detailed analysis of the obtained results reveals that the shape of the scaling exponent function, and hence the values of the calibrated parameters of the RMC model, are highly sensitive to sampling fluctuation and may also be biased. In the second part, the origin of the sensivity to sampling fluctuation and of the bias is studied in detail and a modified Jackknife estimator is tested to reduce the bias. Finally, two hydrological applications are proposed to validate two candidate RMC models: a canonical model based on a log-Poisson random generator, and a basic micro-canonical model based on a uniform random generator. It is tested in this third part if the models reproduce faithfully the statistical distribution of rainfall characteristics on which they have not been calibrated. The results obtained for two validation tests are relatively satisfactory but also show that the temporal structure of the measured rainfall time series at small time steps is not well reproduced by the two selected simple random cascade models.

AB Rock fragment cover has long been an important agricultural crop production technique on the Loess Plateau, China. Although this approach plays an important role in controlling hydrological processes and preventing soil erosion, inconsistent results have been recovered in this field. In this study, we investigated the effects of rock fragment cover on infiltration, run-off, soil erosion, and hydraulic parameters using rainfall simulation in the field in a semi-arid region of China. Two field plots encompassing 6 rock fragment coverages (0%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, and 40%), as well as 2 rock fragment positions and sizes were exposed to rainfall at a particular intensity (60mmh(-1)). The results of this study showed that increasing the rock fragment coverage with rock fragments resting on the soil surface increased infiltration but decreased run-off generation and sediment yield. A contrasting result was found, however, when rock fragments were partially embedded into the soil surface; in this case, a positive relationship between rock fragment coverage and run-off rate as well as a nonmonotonic relationship with respect to soil loss rate was recovered. The size of rock fragments also exerted a positive effect on run-off generation and sediment yield but had a negative effect on infiltration. At the same time, both mean flow velocity and Froude number decreased with increasing rock fragment coverage regardless of rock fragment position and size, whereas both Manning roughness and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were positively correlated. Results show that stream power is the most sensitive hydraulic parameter affecting soil loss. Combined with variance analysis, we concluded that the order of significance of rock fragment cover variables was position followed by coverage and then size. We also quantitatively incorporated the effects of rock fragment cover on soil loss via the C and K factors in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. Overall, this study will enable the development of more accurate modelling approaches and lead to a better understanding of hydrological processes under rock fragment cover conditions.

AB It has been widely observed in field experiments that the apparent rate of bacterial attachment, particularly as parameterized by the collision efficiency in filtration-based models, decreases with transport distance (i.e., exhibits scale-dependency). This effect has previously been attributed to microbial heterogeneity; that is, variability in cell-surface properties within a single monoclonal population. We demonstrate that this effect could also be interpreted as a field-scale manifestation of local-scale correlation between physical heterogeneity (hydraulic conductivity variability) and reaction heterogeneity (attachment rate coefficient variability). A field-scale model of bacterial transport developed for the South Oyster field research site located near Oyster, Virginia, and observations from field experiments performed at that site, are used as the basis for this study. Three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of bacterial transport were performed under four alternative scenarios: (1) homogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) and attachment rate coefficient (K-f); (2) heterogeneous K, homogeneous K-f; (3) heterogeneous K and K-f with local correlation based on empirical and theoretical relationships; and (4) heterogeneous K and K-f without local correlation. The results of the 3D simulations were analyzed using ID model approximations following conventional methods of field data analysis. An apparent decrease with transport distance of effective collision efficiency was observed only in the case where the local properties were both heterogeneous and correlated. This effect was observed despite the fact that the local collision efficiency was specified as a constant in the 3D model, and can therefore be interpreted as a scale effect associated with the local correlated heterogeneity as manifested at the field scale.

AB Estuary bays are vulnerable to salinization effects due to relative sea level rise and modification in upland hydrology owing to a variety of factors. Much research has evaluated the one-sided effect of runoff discharge or sea level on the water exchange and saltwater intrusion for an estuary, while their combined effects have not been evaluated, especially for an estuary bay with narrow river mouth. Taking the Wanquan Estuary Bay (WEB), China, as study case, this paper has revealed the long-term significant increasing trend of freshwater runoff in non-flood season during years 1956-2017 using the Man-Kendall trend analysis, robust principle component regression and Theil-Sen's estimator. A 3-D hydrodynamic-salinity-tracer numerical model is built and calibrated based on the finite-volume community ocean model, and the effects of runoff increase and sea level rise on the water exchange and saltwater intrusion are investigated. This paper shows the following: (1) The freshwater runoff during non-flood season in WEB shows significant long-term increasing trend, and the mean changing magnitude is 0.4546 m(3)/s/a. (2) The increased runoff accelerates the water exchange, and reduces the turn-over time and saltwater intrusion in the WEB. The sea level rise reduces the water exchange and increase the saltwater intrusion. (3) For the estuary bay with narrow river mouth, the salinity distributions show more vertical stratification characteristics. The freshwater runoff has power relationships with the average turnover time and salinity, and the sea level has linear relationships. (4) The water exchange and salinity of an estuary bay is more vulnerable to the changed runoff than the sea level rise, while the impacts of sea level rise would increase for estuaries with wide river mouth. This paper provides support for the freshwater exploitation and utilization in estuary bay under the background of climate change and sea level rise.

AB Vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data still remain to be used for analysing the relationship between climatic factors and vegetation seasonal phenology in middle latitudes with subtropical conditions forests such as the Canarian laurel forest. The Garajonay National Park, located in the La Gomera Island, protects one of the best preserved examples of the Macaronesian laurel forest, due to the cloud banks produced by trade winds, with rainfall and temperature field data showing a clear Mediterranean climatic pattern. We have analysed seasonal vegetation indices trend for different types of forest inside the Garajonay National Park using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products derived from moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) Aqua data for two hydrological years (October 2003 to September 2005) in relationship with the existing field climatic data: rainfall, net fog water and temperature. Maximum annual EVI maps show the highest vegetation indices in the laurel forest of La Gomera that occur during the dry season, mainly in late spring to early summer, with EVI temporal profiles showing that valley-bottom laurel forest areas have the most clear seasonal trend. Difference maps of EVI values between months with the lowest and highest rainfall of each hydrological year clearly confirm the highest photosynthetic activity in the laurel forest during the dry season. In addition, these forests show a significative temporal correlation between EVI values and the temperature in the forest (p < 0.001). Our results prove the absence of summer drought stress in the laurel forest implying that the fog drip income is high enough to maintain enough soil moisture to allow the forest fully transpire when temperatures are higher. As the laurel forest of La Gomera occurs in the main recharge area of the island's aquifer system, our analysis of EVI data suggests that fog drip constitutes a key hydrological factor.

AB The resolution of a digital elevation model (DEM) is a crucial factor in watershed hydrologic and environmental modelling. DEM resolution can cause significant variability in the representation of surface topography, which further affects quantification of hydrologic connectivity and simulation of hydrologic processes. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of DEM resolution on (1) surface microtopographic characteristics, (2) hydrologic connectivity, and (3) the spatial and temporal variations of hydrologic processes. A puddle-to-puddle modelling system was utilized for surface delineation and modelling of the puddle-to-puddle overland flow dynamics, surface runoff, infiltration, and unsaturated flow for nine DEM resolution scenarios of a field plot surface. Comparisons of the nine modelling scenarios demonstrated that coarser DEM resolutions tended to eliminate topographic features, reduce surface depression storage, and strengthen hydrologic connectivity and surface runoff. We found that reduction in maximum depression storage and maximum ponding area was as high as 97.56% and 76.36%, respectively, as the DEM grid size increased from 2 to 80 cm. The paired t-test and fractal analysis demonstrated the existence of a threshold DEM resolution (10 cm for the field plot), within which the DEM-based hydrologic modelling was effective and acceptable. The effects of DEM resolution were further evaluated for a larger surface in the Prairie Pothole Region subjected to observed rainfall events. It was found that simulations based on coarser resolution DEMs (> 10 m) tended to overestimate ponded areas and underestimate runoff discharge peaks. The simulated peak discharge from the Prairie Pothole Region surface reduced by approximately 50% as the DEM resolution changed from 2 to 90m. Fractal analysis results elucidated scale dependency of hydrologic and topographic processes. In particular, scale analysis highlighted a unique constant-threshold-power relationship between DEM scale and topographic and hydrologic parameters/variables. Not only does this finding allow one to identify threshold DEM but also further develop functional relationships for scaling to achieve valid topographic characterization as well as effective and efficient hydrologic modelling.

AB Large eddy simulations (LESs) are performed for turbulent flow through and around a porous patch of thin vertical plates at a plate Reynolds number of Re-p=5,800. The plates are arranged in a staggered pattern, presenting an elliptical planform and mimicking streamwise-oriented blades of emergent vegetation. The immersed boundary method is employed to explicitly resolve the interaction between flow and plates. Three flow cases, each with a different number of plates within the same planform area, that is, different patch density, are studied. The Reynolds number based on freestream velocity and plate length is the same in all cases. Inspection of the distribution of velocity and vorticity in the horizontal plane reveals that downstream plates are significantly impacted by the wakes from upstream plates. It is therefore proposed that the plates can be divided into two groups based on the local flow characteristics, which are a function of position within the patch: a free group and a wake group. This classification is subsequently used in the quantitative analysis of boundary layer development and drag force at plate scale. The thickness and character of the simulated boundary layers on the plates differ significantly from predictions based on analytical or empirical relationships, which is due to wake effects and the finite length of the plates. The simulations demonstrate the so-called sheltering effect; that is, the drag forces acting on downstream plates (in the wake group) are significantly lower than those acting on upstream plates, a result of the lower approach flow speed. Although the front-area-to-lateral-area ratio of the plates is low (1/40), pressure drag is observed to be larger than friction drag for each plate. The ratio of pressure drag to the total drag at patch scale shows only very little dependence on the plate density of the patch.

AB Tree transpiration is an important water movement process in forest ecosystems, and it plays a decisive role in the coupling feedback of hydrological and ecological processes. Therefore, identifying the impact of different factors on sap flow can promote efficient water management and improve assessment of the climate change impacts. However, the interaction between sap flow and control factors is not clear, and there is no accurate model to predict sap flow change of Picea crassifolia Kom. This study explored the correlation between sap flow and environmental factors and compared the performances of the back-propagation neural network (BPANN) and multiple regression (MLR) models, and the importance of the time-lag effect and different soil moisture conditions in the response mechanism of sap flow was also explained. A higher fitting performance was found in the BPANN model (R-2 > 0.90) based on the relationships between air temperature (Ta), air relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (Rn) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and sap flux density (Q) than that MLR (R-2 = 0.8915). The correlation was improved due to the consideration of time-lag effect. Other variables, such as maximum temperature (Tmax), wind speed (WS) and precipitation (P), explained smaller portions of the variance in sap flow, while minimum temperature (Tmin) and leaf area index (LAI) had almost no effect. Moreover, the R-2 of the water stress condition (REW <0.38) was lower than that of the non-water stress condition (REW >= 0.38), and even lower than the R-2 of the whole experimental period. Therefore, the sap flow prediction model based on BPANN could more reasonably explain the nonlinear relationship between transpiration and control factors, which provided a basis for the estimation of plant water-use and the construction and management of ecological vegetation in alpine arid and semi-arid areas, especially in response to the continuous enhancement of aridification and climate warming.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

AB An important aspect of flood management is the estimation of catchment response to storm events by simulation of flood wave propagation through the catchment storage. A derivation of the wave speed (c) is presented in terms of discharge (Q) and the exponent (m) in the storage (S)-discharge relationship S = kQ(m). The wave speed-discharge relationship has the form c = (alpha(c)(m)/m)Q(1-m), where alpha(c) is a parameter in the kinematic wave model. The parameters in this relationship, however, change with flow conditions in the cross section, especially as flow leaves the main channel to inundate the floodplain. This finding confirms that the parameters in the single storage-discharge relationship do not have discrete values as used in many runoff-routing models, and hence the use of single parameter values is not suitable for estimating floods in many situations. It is shown that a more reasonable relationship is S = S-c + k(1)LQ(1/b), where S-c is a threshold storage, and the other parameters are functions of the flow conditions. The parameters k(1), L, b and also the parameters in the wave speed-discharge relationship change between inbank, overbank, and fully developed floodplain flow situations. This paper investigates the relationship between the kinematic wave exponent (1/beta(c)) and discharge that gives an estimate of (lib) which is not provided by the wave speed-discharge relationship. This estimate is shown to be approximately equal to m, the exponent conventionally used in the storage-discharge relationship S = kQ(m). Further, the kinematic wave exponent (1/beta(c)) can be approximated by the ratio between the water velocity and the flood wave speed. This analysis is used to explain the complicated behaviour of wave speed and water velocity in channel, overbank, and fully developed floodplain flows.

AB The fate and transport of soluble contaminants released in natural streams are strongly dependent on the spatial variations of the flow field and of the bed topography. These variations are essentially related to the presence of the channel banks and to the planform configuration of the channel. Large velocity gradients arise near to the channel banks, where the flow depth decreases to zero. Moreover, single thread alluvial rivers are seldom straight, and usually exhibit meandering planforms and a bed topography that deviates from the plane configuration. Channel axis curvature and movable bed deformations drive secondary helical currents which enhance both cross sectional velocity gradients and transverse mixing, thus crucially influencing longitudinal dispersion. The present contribution sets up a rational framework which, assuming mild sloping banks and taking advantage of the weakly meandering character often exhibited by natural streams, leads to an analytical estimate of the contribution to longitudinal dispersion associated with spatial non-uniformities of the flow field. The resulting relationship stems from a physics-based modeling of the flow in natural rivers, and expresses the bend averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the relevant hydraulic and morphologic parameters. The treatment of the problem is river specific, since it relies on an explicit spatial description, although linearized, of the flow field that establishes in the investigated river. Comparison with field data available from tracer tests supports the robustness of the proposed framework, given also the complexity of the processes that affect dispersion dynamics in real streams.

AB To maintain a navigable channel and improve high-flow conveyance, engineers have recently proposed constructing longitudinal training walls as an alternative to the traditional transverse groynes. However, previous work has shown that the system of parallel channels created by a longitudinal training wall might be unstable in rivers with alternate bars. Many questions remain unanswered, particularly whether a stable system can be obtained by carefully designing the bifurcation point. This work analyses the stability of the bifurcating system created by a thin longitudinal wall in sand-bed rivers with alternate bars or point bars. The methodology includes performing 102 numerical tests using the Delft3D code to reproduce an idealized low-land river, either straight or meandering. The results show that the system of parallel channels separated by a training wall may indeed become unstable. An important factor is found to be the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a neighboring bar or point bar. The same trends are observed for both constant and variable discharge, in straight and meandering channels. The results suggest that cyclic growth and decline of the bifurcating channels may arise as inherent system behavior, without the need of any additional external forcing. We explain this from changes in the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio as the bifurcation evolves. This cyclic behavior can be regarded as a form of system stability and can be obtained by carefully placing the starting point of the longitudinal training wall, and thus the bifurcation point, near the top of a bar.

AB Dispersive transport in porous media is usually described through a Fickian model, in which the flux is the product of a dispersion tensor times the concentration gradient. This model is based on certain implicit assumptions, including slowly varying conditions. About fifty years ago, it was first suggested that the parameterization of the second-order dispersion tensor for anisotropic porous media involves a fourth-order dispersivity tensor. However, the properties of the dispersivity tensor have not been adequately studied. This work contributes to achieving a better grasp of dispersion in anisotropic porous media through a number of ways. First, with clearly stated assumptions and from first principles, we use the method of moments to derive a mathematical formula for the fourth-order dispersivity tensor, and show that it is a function of pore geometry, fluid velocity, and pore diffusion. Second, by using pore-scale flow and transport simulations through orderly and randomly packed 2-D and 3-D porous media, we evaluate the effects of the three factors on dispersivity. Different relationships with the Peclet number are observed for the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities and for orderly and randomly packed media. Third, we discuss the limitations of 2-D periodic media with simple structures in computing transverse dispersivity, which is more accurately predicted in the 3-D periodic media and 2-D randomly packed media. Fourth, we exhibit through numerical simulations that the method of moments can, computational limitations notwithstanding, be extended to stationary porous media. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Operational flood forecasting requires accurate forecasts with a suitable lead time, in order to be able to issue appropriate warnings and take appropriate emergency actions. Recent improvements in both flood plain characterization and computational capabilities have made the use of distributed flood inundation models more common. However, problems remain with the application of such models. There are still uncertainties associated with the identifiability of parameters; with the computational burden of calculating distributed estimates of predictive uncertainty; and with the adaptive use of such models for operational, real-time flood inundation forecasting. Moreover, the application of distributed models is complex, costly and requires high degrees of skill. This paper presents an alternative to distributed inundation models for real-time flood forecasting that provides fast and accurate, medium to short-term forecasts. The Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) methodology exploits a State Dependent Parameter (SDP) modelling approach to derive a nonlinear dependence between the water levels measured at gauging stations along the river. The transformation of water levels depends on the relative geometry of the channel cross-sections, without the need to apply rating curve transformations to the discharge. The relationship obtained is used to transform water levels as an input to a linear, on-line, real-time and adaptive stochastic DBM model. The approach provides an estimate of the prediction uncertainties, including allowing for heterescadasticity of the multi-step-ahead forecasting errors. The approach is illustrated using an 80 km reach of the River Severn, in the UK. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper is concerned with the estimation of the effective transport characteristics of fluid-saturated porous media via rigorous microstructure-property relations. We are particularly interested in predicting the formation factor F, mean survival time tau, principal NMR (diffusion) relaxation time T-1, principal viscous relaxation time Theta(1), and fluid permeability k. To do so, we employ rigorous methods to estimate the fluid permeability and these other transport properties of "hyperuniform" and nonhyperuniform models of porous media from microstructural information. Disordered hyperuniform materials are exotic amorphous states of matter that have attracted great attention in the physical, mathematical and biological science but little is known about their fluid transport characteristics. In carrying out this investigation, we not only draw from ideas and results of the emerging field of hyperuniformity, but from homogenization theory, statistical geometry, differential equations (spectrum of Laplace and Stokes operators), and the covering and quantizer problems of discrete geometry. Among other results, we derive a Fourier representation of a classic rigorous upper bound on the fluid permeability that depends on the spectral density to infer how the permeabilities of hyperuniform porous media perform relative to those of nonhyperuniform ones. We find that the velocity fields in nonhyperuniform porous media are generally much more localized over the pore space compared to those in their hyperuniform counterparts, which has implications for their permeabilities. Rigorous bounds on transport properties suggest a new approximate formula for the fluid permeability that provides reasonably accurate permeability predictions of a certain class of hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform porous media. These comparative studies shed new light on the microstructural characteristics that determine the transport properties of general porous media. Our findings also have implications for the design of porous materials with desirable transport properties.

AB The variability in land surface heat (H), water vapor (LE), and CO2 (or net ecosystem exchange, NEE) fluxes was investigated at scales ranging from fractions of seconds to years using eddy-covariance flux measurements above a pine forest. Because these fluxes significantly vary at all these time scales and because large gaps in the record are unavoidable in such experiments, standard Fourier expansion methods for computing the spectral and cospectral statistical properties were not possible. Instead, orthonormal wavelet transformations (OWT) are proposed and used. The OWT are ideal at resolving process variability with respect to both scale and time and are able to isolate and remove the effects of missing data (or gaps) from spectral and cospectral calculations. Using the OWT spectra, we demonstrated unique aspects in three appropriate ranges of time scales: turbulent time scales (fractions of seconds to minutes), meteorological time scales (hour to weeks), and seasonal to interannual time scales corresponding to climate and vegetation dynamics. We have shown that: (1) existing turbulence theories describe the short time scales well, (2) coupled physiological and transport models (e.g. CANVEG) reproduce the wavelet spectral characteristics of all three land surface fluxes for meteorological time scales, and (3) seasonal dynamics in vegetation physiology and structure inject strong correlations between land surface fluxes and forcing variables at monthly to seasonal time scales. The broad implications of this study center on the possibility of developing low-dimensional models of land surface water, energy, and carbon exchange. If the bulk of the flux variability is dominated by a narrow band or bands of modes, and these modes "resonate" with key state and forcing variables, then low-dimensional models may relate these forcing and state variables to NEE and LE.

ID OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION; ALGORITHM
AB The forecast-informed hydropower operation for mixed reservoir systems, which consist of parallel and cascade reservoirs, is of considerable importance in practice; however, this operation still lacks an analytical basis in theory. From the perspective of energy, this paper introduces the concept of "hydraulic potential energy" and mathematically derives the energy transformation formula for multi-reservoir hydropower operation. Based on this formula and the rolling single-period forecast, a maximum hydraulic potential energy model (E1 model) is proposed. The presented rigorous proofs demonstrate the deficiencies of the commonly considered objectives or principles of minimizing the outflow-induced energy-cost, while the objective function of the E1 model is demonstrated to be superior. If the constraints of power output and reservoir storage are nonbinding, the derived optimal spatial principle for hydropower operation is (1) to equalize the Relative Marginal Energy (RME) among reservoirs or (2) if this status is not feasible, to release water and generate hydropower first from the reservoirs that have the largest RME values. Considering the uncertainty of future inflow, the E1 model is extended to the two-stage hydraulic potential energy model (E2 model). A case study of a hypothetical mixed three-reservoir system demonstrates the superior performance of the E2 model compared with the conventional K-value principle and the minimum energy-cost model. This paper provides an innovative spatial principle and a practical model for the realization of forecast-informed hydropower operation, which contributes to the optimization of the large-scale energy market.
   Key Points
   The energy transformation formula for multi-reservoir hydropower operation is proved based on the concept of hydraulic potential energy The theoretical Relative Marginal Energy principle is mathematically derived for the optimal spatial allocation of reservoir storages The hydraulic potential energy model is an effective tool to improve the forecast-informed hydropower operation for mixed reservoir systems
