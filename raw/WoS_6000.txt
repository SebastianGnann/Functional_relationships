AB Although both raindrop driven processes and diffusion play important roles in the transfer of chemicals from soil to surface runoff, current transport models either do not consider the two processes together, or use 'effective' parameters with uncertain physical definitions. We developed a physically based, solute transport model that couples both mechanisms and tested it with laboratory experiments. One unique aspect of this study is that all the parameters were either directly measured or previously published, that is, there was no model 'calibration' or 'fitting.' Our model assumes that chemicals near the surface of the soil are ejected into runoff by raindrop impact and chemicals deeper in the soil diffuse into a surface layer, or 'exchange layer,' via diffusion. The exchange layer depth and transfer processes are derived from the 'shield' concept in the Rose soil erosion model (e.g. Rose, 1985). The model's governing equations were solved numerically and the results agreed well with experimental data (R-2 > 0.90). The model's sensitivity to various physical and chemical parameters illuminated the importance of both raindrop controlled processes and diffusion on chemical transport from soil to surface runoff.

AB This study evaluates the hydrological conditions in a harvested bog where various water management schemes have been implemented to ameliorate conditions limiting Sphagnum regeneration. The study sites included a natural bog (natural), a recently drained and harvested bog (drained), which provided the hydrological extremes. Also included are a drained harvested bog with ditches blocked with (1) no other management (blocked), (2) peat bounded by open water at 5-m intervals (5-m), and (3) with straw mulch on the surface (mulch).
   The study period from May to September 1995 was drier than normal. The water table in the drained site descended to -107 cm by late August, compared with -72.5 cm at the blocked site. Both the 5-m and mulch sites (ditches also blocked) had water table recessions similar to the natural site (minimum approx. 62 cm). In the drained and blocked sites, little variation in water table depth occurred after early July, suggesting water exchanges with the atmosphere occurred to and from the unsaturated zone only. Soil moisture in the upper 3 cm layer on the drained and blocked site were similar, in spite of greatly different water table depths, dropping below 20% by volume, compared with a minimum of 30% when mulch was used. Soil water tension profiles suggest most of this storage change occurred in the upper 30 cm. The water table depth, therefore, was not a good indicator of water availability at the surface.
   Pressure head in the unsaturated zone (1 cm below the surface) in the drained and blocked sites was maintained between 0 and -100 cm (mb) 18 and 34% of the time, respectively, and with water management with open water (5-m) and mulch, increased to 55 and 97% of the time, respectively. The greatest tension, however, was observed on the blocked site (-355 cm), rather than the drained site (-247 cm), suggesting lower suitability for Sphagnum at the former. This was attributed to the higher bulk density (hence smaller pore structure) at the blocked site (rho(b) = 92.1 kg compared with 55.7 kg m(-3)). Higher bulk density at the blocked site was ascribed to its longer time since disturbance. This implies' restoration should begin as soon as possible after harvesting is finished.

AB A well-constructed drainage network is essential for hydrological modeling. Agricultural watersheds with heavy human alternations often contain man-made features like terraced fields and ponds. Incorporating these features in the drainage network in these watersheds is extremely important for hydrological modeling. This study proposed a novel hybrid vector-raster approach to drainage network construction in this type of regions. First, a watershed is discretized using a hybrid vector-raster data model to accurately represent the shapes and areas of irregular geographical entities. Then, the flow directions among discretized units are determined firstly within each land use type and then on the boundaries of different land use types based on elevation and land use specific boundary rules. After that, loops among units are processed to make sure each unit can flow out of the watershed. A small agricultural watershed in Jiangsu Province, China was selected to conduct a case study, and the results showed that the proposed method can obtain a more realistic drainage network than traditional methods, both in terms of geometric shapes and spatial topology.

AB Streamwater nitrate (NO3-) concentrations along the main stream and at the outlet of several subcatchments within the 114.3 km(2) Zwalm watershed in Flanders, Belgium, have been monitored regularly since 1991. Land use within the Zwalm catchment is predominantly agricultural, with forested regions in the south and urban concentrations in the north-east of the catchment. Streamwater NO3- concentrations increased with increases in stream discharge rates, but in general, discharge rate explained only about 30% of the variation in NO3- concentrations. The low R-2 values were attributed to the observed anticlockwise hysteresis in the NO3- concentration-discharge relationship and to differences in NO3- concentrations between both seasonal flow and various flow regimes, with winter flow explaining 51% of the variation in NO3- concentrations, whereas summer flow explained only 28% of the variation. A hypothesis was formulated in which flow regime accounts for the seasonal variation in NO3- export, postulating that the catchment seasonally alternates between two hydrological stages. The first stage occurs during wet winter periods, when the catchment drains as a single source area, whereas the second stage occurs during dry summer periods, when the groundwater store disconnects into separate subcatchments. This causes NO3- concentration peaks to be more delayed during summer storm events compared with winter storm events. Regarding flow regimes, differences between high and low flow conditions and between increasing and stable/decreasing flow were not as pronounced a differences between seasons. In contrast to the estimation of NO3- concentrations, discharge was a strong predictor (R-2 = 0.71) of the NO3- flux within the tributaries of the Zwalm catchment. The NO3- concentrations in the main stream increased with decreasing elevation, whereas the seasonal concentration patterns along the main channel were similar to those observed at the outlet. NO3- concentrations varied considerably among catchments and showed a high variability over time, although in general, the variation in NO3- concentration was higher between catchments than within catchments. The impact of land use is clearly reflected in the streamwater NO3- concentrations, although NO3- concentration patterns were also affected by topography and, to a lesser extent, by soil type. A gradual increase in NO3- concentrations at the outlet of the Zwalm catchment could be observed throughout the 1991-1998 study period, providing evidence for the general trends of increase in Flanders, which are attributed to the intensification of agricultural activities.

AB The Saint-Venant equations have consistently proved capable of accurately simulating hydrographs at plot scale. However, recent works showed that even though the hydrograph is satisfyingly reproduced, the flow velocity field within the plot might be wrong, with the highest velocity largely underestimated. Moreover, the choice of roughness models to be used in the Saint-Venant equations is most often done in the purpose of increasing the hydrograph quality, while the actual travel time of water is ignored. This paper presents a tracer experiment made on a 10-m by 4-m rainfall simulation plot, where travel time and tracer mass recovery as well as local flow velocity have been measured. Four roughness models are tested: (i) Darcy-Weisbach's model, (ii) Lawrence's model, (iii) Manning's model with a constant roughness coefficient, and (iv) Manning's model with a variable roughness coefficient which decreases as a power law of the runoff water depth.
   Models with a constant friction factor largely underestimate high velocities. Moreover, they are not able to simulate tracer travel-times. Lawrence's model correctly simulates low and high velocities as well as tracer breakthrough curves. However, a specific set of parameters are required for each breakthrough curve from the same experiment. The best results are obtained with the Manning's model with a water-depth dependent roughness coefficient: simulated velocities are consistent with measurements, and a single set of parameters captures the entire set of breakthrough curves, as well as tracer mass recovery.
   The study reported here brings the following findings: (i) roughness coefficient is flow-dependent, (ii) faithful simulation of the velocity fields does not imply a good prediction of travel time and mass recovery, (iii) the best model is a Manning type model with a roughness coefficient which decreases as a power law of water depth.
   The full dataset used in this work is available on request. It can be used as benchmark for overland flow and transport models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The majority of infiltration equations in use today were developed for infiltration into rigid porous media based either on the classic diffusion equation or empirical formulation. In this paper, we present new equations of infiltration into swelling soils derived from the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (fFPE) of flow in swelling porous media formulated in a material coordinate. The cumulative infiltration we derived is I(t)= At + St(beta/2), where S is the fractional sorptivity, A the final infiltration rate, and beta the order of fractional derivative in the fFPE. Using the data published in the literature on cumulative infiltration against time, beta, S and A are determined. The determined value of beta = 0.2385 for this reported soil is much less than 1.0 which implies that infiltration into this specific swelling soil belongs to the category of sub-diffusion. We show that the new cumulative infiltration equation not only fits the reported data exceptionally better than Philip's two-term infiltration equation, more importantly, it provides fresh explanation and understanding of infiltration into swelling media. The new infiltration equation deviates from the majority of infiltration equations which were developed for rigid soils and ignore the realistic swelling and shrinking properties of the soils.

AB High-resolution gridded precipitation products are rare globally, particularly below a daily time-step, yet many hydrological applications require, or can be improved by, a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data. Here, we present a new 1 km resolution gridded hourly rainfall dataset for Great Britain (Gridded estimates of hourly areal rainfall for Great Britain (1990-2014) [CEH-GEAR1hr]) using data from over 1900 quality controlled rainfall gauges, which improves upon the current UK national gridded precipitation datasets at daily time-step. We extend and automate a quality control (QC) procedure to permit the use of hourly data for 1990-2014 and independently validate the QC using daily rainfall data and recorded historic events. Our two-tiered validation approach, at daily and hourly timescales, indicates that spurious extreme values are excluded from the resultant dataset, while legitimate values are preserved. We use a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme to derive gridded hourly rainfall values at 1 km resolution, to temporally disaggregate the CEH-GEAR daily gridded dataset and produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals. This provides a unique resource for hydrological applications in Great Britain. The CEH-GEAR1hr dataset, associated metadata and QC information, will be freely available from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and hosted alongside the daily and monthly CEH-GEAR product.

AB An evaluation of Pacific and Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and Colombian streamflow was performed to identify coupled regions of SST and Colombian streamflow variability. Applying the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) statistical method, SSTs (and Colombian streamflow for 10 stations) were evaluated for (a) the Pacific Ocean, (b) the Atlantic Ocean, and (c) the combined Pacific and Atlantic Ocean for a 41 year period of record (1960-2000). A lead-time approach was adopted such that spring-summer seasonal (April through September) SSTs were evaluated with streamflow for the following calendar-year (January through December). The Et Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been acknowledged in previous research efforts as an influence of Colombian streamflow. The ENSO signal identified that warmer (cooler) equatorial SSTs resulted in lesser (greater) streamflow. In general, the use of predefined published indices, such as ENSO, is appealing for water managers and forecasters. However, the utilization of SSTs for entire regions (Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) eliminates any spatial bias as to which oceanic SST region (or regions) impact hydrology. This will assist in the identification of regions that may not be represented in existing indices and could lead to improved forecasting. The SVD 1st temporal expansion series of Pacific (and the combined Pacific and Atlantic) Ocean SSTs and streamflow for several stations resulted in correlation values greater than that of well known climate indices (e.g., ENSO), which could result in improved streamflow predictability.

AB Detailed simulation studies, highly resolved in space and time, show that a physical relationship exists among instantaneous soil-moisture values integrated over different soil depths. This dynamic relationship evolves in time as a function of the hydrologic inputs and soil and vegetation characteristics. When depth-averaged soil moisture is sampled at a low temporal frequency, the structure of the relationship breaks down and becomes undetectable. Statistical measures can overcome the limitation of sampling frequency, and predictions of mean and variance for soil moisture can be defined over any soil averaging depth d. For a water-limited ecosystem, a detailed simulation model is used to compute the mean and variance of soil moisture for different averaging depths over a number of growing seasons. We present a framework that predicts the mean of soil moisture as a function of averaging depth given soil moisture over a shallow d and the average daily rainfall reaching the soil. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

ID TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; PERMEABILITY; NETWORKS; MEDIA; ROCKS
AB As a justification for the geoelectric characterization of the hydraulic conductivity field, this paper shows theoretically and empirically that electrical and hydraulic (eh) conductivities of aquifers can be correlated. The correlation, demonstrated at the microscale by a published network model of eh transport, arises from the fact that both eh conductivities are a function of connected pore volumes and connected pore surface areas. By considering skewed pore size distributions the microscale equations of eh conductivity scale up to power laws of porosity and specific surface area similar to Archie's law and the Kozeny equation. Also, a third, apparently unreported Archie-type power law relating electrical conductivity to specific surface area and the cation exchange phenomenon is predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. These equations imply a simple log-log linear correlation between eh conductivities that is either positive or negative. The positive correlation corresponds to a pore-volume-dominated electrical flow environment and the negative correlation corresponds to a pore-surface-dominated electrical how environment. These relationships are supported by many published laboratory and field investigations cited in the paper.

ID MODEL; RAINFALL; PRAIRIE; COVER
AB A simple theoretical model demonstrates that some amount of randomness in snow and ice mass balance is sufficient to reproduce empirically observed power law and exponential distributions of snow patch and glacier sizes. No other assumptions about the underlying topography or snow accumulation and ablation processes are necessary to extract this important spatial property. The inclusion of additional geometrical and physical processes can alter the specific scaling constants of the size distributions, but the fundamental behavior remains unchanged. Specifically, for snow patch and glacier sizes less than some correlation length the size distribution is a decreasing power law, and for sizes larger than the correlation length the distribution decreases rapidly as an exponential. The solution is based on a mapping to a relatively well explored class of problems in percolation theory.

AB Natural bed topography and habitat is affected by the composition of gravels in various shapes and sizes. Traditional measurement methods for grain size distribution are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in image processing techniques facilitate automated grain size measurement through digital images. This study introduces a refined automated grain sizing method (R-AGS) incorporating a neural fuzzy network for automatically estimating the grain size distribution, specifically for digital images composed of grains ranging from 16 mm to 512 mm. A total of 130 digital images captured from the Lanyang river-bed in northeast Taiwan are used to assess the R-AGS performance. We demonstrate the neural fuzzy network can adequately identify the binary threshold, which is a crucial parameter of the AGS procedure, and the proposed R-AGS can be intelligibly used for automated accurate estimation of grain size distribution with much less labor-intensiveness for each digital image. Moreover, it is easy to re-construct the network by updating rule nodes for image samples significantly different from this study; consequently its applicability and practicability could be expanded.

AB A river watershed is a complex ecosystem, and its spatial structure and temporal dynamics are driven by various natural factors such as soil properties and topographic features, human activities, and their interactions. In this study, we explored the characteristics of the ecosystem and environment of watershed by analyzing and modeling the relationships among socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape metrics. Landsat 8 data were used to generate a land cover classification map and to derive landscape pattern indices. Governmental finance statistics yearbook data were referred to provide socio-economic indices. Moreover, 9 samples were collected from the upstream to the downstream to obtain the values of heavy metal concentrations in the water body. Then, both correlation and regression analyses were applied to analyze and model the relationships among these indices. The results of this study showed that 1) The ecological status and process (social economy, land cover, water and soil pollution) of this river watershed could be explained by analyzing the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices selected based on correlation analysis; 2) The accumulated socio-economic indices were significantly correlated with Al, Fe and Ni and should be applied to the integrated assessment of the watershed ecological environment; 3) Cu, Zn and Pb were the main elements that showed significant correlations with the forest land; 4) Some landscape patterns indices such as Total Area (TA) and Effective Mesh Size (MESH) could be used to the integrated assessment of the watershed characteristics because of their strong correlations with the area (or area percentage) of important landscape types; and 5) transportation land had a close relationship with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study implied that analyzing and modeling the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices can provide a powerful tool for characterizing the ecosystem of the river watershed and useful guidelines for the watershed management and sustainable development.

ID DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships are currently constructed based on an at-site frequency analysis of rainfall data separately for different durations. These relationships are not accurate and reliable since they depend on many assumptions such as distribution selection for each duration; they require a large number of parameters, and are not time-independent.
   In this study, scaling proper-ties of extreme rainfall are examined to establish scaling behaviour of statistical non-central moments over different durations. A scale invariance concept is explored for disaggregation (or downscaling) of rainfall intensity from low to high resolution and is applied to the derivation of scaling IDF curves. These curves are developed for gauged sites based on scaling of the generalized extreme value (GEV) and Gumbel probability distributions.
   Numerical analysis was performed on annual maximum rainfall series for the province of Ontario, for storm durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 min (the typical time of concentration for small urban catchments) and 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h (the typical time of concentration for larger rural watersheds).
   Results show that rainfall does follow a simple scaling process. Estimates found from the scaling procedure are comparable to estimates obtained from traditional techniques; however, the scaled approach was more efficient and gives more accurate estimates compared with the observed rainfall total at all stations.

AB The probability distribution of the annual maximum peak flows on the River Tiber at the town of Rome (Ripetta) can be evaluated using the information available since the XV century. In this paper the probability distribution of two series of annual peak flows maxima observed at the Ripetta gauge is analysed: the systematic series, including all the data observed since the beginning of the systematic stage record in 1782, and the censored series of the exceptional floods that inundated the town of Rome, starting from the XV century. In order to find a criterion for choosing the "optimum" distribution law for the high return period quantiles, an index that takes into account both the accuracy and the uncertainty of the quantiles estimation is proposed.

AB The main objective of this study is to take advantage of spatial altimetry data to help monitoring river discharges in poorly gauged basins. A methodology is defined to obtain high accuracy relationships between water levels provided by spatial altimetry and water discharge computed by a hydrological model. The proposed method is based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model calibrated and validated against a few in situ data. Discharge is modeled in a daily time step at river locations tracked by the satellite and combined with water height observations to produce rating curves. The methodology is evaluated in the Northern Amazon basin, corresponding to the upper part of the Branco River basin, the major tributary of the Negro River. The MGB-IPH (an acronym from the Portuguese for Large Basins Model and Institute of Hydraulic Research) is run for a 10-year period, from January 1997 to December 2006, in a daily time step. Eight gauge stations are used to calibrate and validate the model, resulting in Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients from 0.47 (Maloca do Contao station - 5896 km(2)) to 0.85 (Caracarai station 126,085 km(2)) in the calibration process, and 0.42 (Posto Funai station - 9708 km(2)) to 0.94 (also at Caracarai station) in the validation process. Results suggest the existence of relations between model accuracy and the size of drainage areas, which can be firstly attributed to a poor rainfall monitoring and also to model restrictions. which was specially developed to large basins. Water level time series (35-day time step) at 12 virtual stations (VS) are deduced from ENVISAT tracks from October 2002 to November 2006. The rating curve parameters, including the zero-flow depth (h), are estimated by fitting a power-law relation between modeled discharges and satellite-derived water altimetry. Zero-flow depths are optimized for each VS in order to define the best fitted curve. Additionally, slopes along reaches where two or more VS's are defined can be provided. Comparisons between daily water discharges provided by in situ observations and rating curve estimates at three VS's resulted in RMS errors from 9.9% to 26.9%, which are in accordance with previous experiences and acceptable for most hydrological applications. River bed slopes derived from both ENVISAT and SRTM were compared. Results suggest that altimetric data provide more accurate slopes and it should be preferred whenever it is available.

TI Constraining continuous rainfall simulations for derived design flood
   estimation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Rainfall simulation; Rescaling; Intensity frequency duration
ID GENERATION
AB Stochastic rainfall generation is important for a range of hydrologic and water resources applications. Stochastic rainfall can be generated using a number of models; however, preserving relevant attributes of the observed rainfall including rainfall occurrence, variability and the magnitude of extremes continues to be difficult. This paper develops an approach to constrain stochastically generated rainfall with an aim of preserving the intensity-durationfrequency (IFD) relationships of the observed data. Two main steps are involved. First, the generated annual maximum rainfall is corrected recursively by matching the generated intensity-frequency relationships to the target (observed) relationships. Second, the remaining (non-annual maximum) rainfall is rescaled such that the mass balance of the generated rain before and after scaling is maintained. The recursive correction is performed at selected storm durations to minimise the dependence between annual maximum values of higher and lower durations for the same year. This ensures that the resulting sequences remain true to the observed rainfall as well as represent the design extremes that may have been developed separately and are needed for compliance reasons. The method is tested on simulated 6 min rainfall series across five Australian stations with different climatic characteristics. The results suggest that the annual maximum and the IFD relationships are well reproduced after constraining the simulated rainfall. While our presentation focusses on the representation of design rainfall attributes (IFDs), the proposed approach can also be easily extended to constrain other attributes of the generated rainfall, providing an effective platform for post-processing of stochastic rainfall generators.

AB Analytical solutions to the 1D heat transport equation can be used to derive point measurements of flux between surface water and groundwater from streambed temperature time series. Recent studies have used empirical relationships between measured flux and point-in-time observations of streambed temperatures to produce detailed plan view maps of flux from instantaneous temperature maps. Here, the accuracy of such flux maps, derived using streambed temperatures as a quantitative proxy, was assessed from synthetic streambed temperature data generated by numerical flow and transport simulations. The use of numerical simulations is advantageous because maps of flux from the temperature proxy method can be compared to known flux maps to quantify error. Empirical flux-temperature relationships are most accurate if developed from data collected when stream temperatures are at a maximum. The true relationship between flux and streambed temperature will generally be non-linear and well approximated as a cubic function, although linear relationships may be applied when data density is low. Intermediate fluxes (+/- 1.0 m/day) returned by the temperature proxy method have errors typically less than +/- 0.1 m/day. Errors in estimated flux increase for strong upwelling (>1.0 m/day) or downwelling (<-1.0 m/day), although the direction of flux is still accurate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Being an important variable for various applications, for example hydrological and weather prediction models or data assimilation, a large range of global soil moisture products from different sources, such as modeling or active and passive microwave remote sensing, are available. The diverse measurement and estimation methods can lead to differences in the characteristics of the products. This study investigates the spatial and temporal behavior of three different products: (i) the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 product, retrieved with a physically based approach from passive microwave remote sensing brightness temperatures, (ii) the MetOp-A Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) product retrieved with a change detection method from radar remote sensing backscattering coefficients, and (iii) the ERA Interim product from a weather forecast model reanalysis. Results show overall similar patterns of spatial soil moisture, but high deviations in absolute values. A ranking of mean relative differences demonstrates that ASCAT and ERA Interim products show most similar spatial soil moisture patterns, while ERA and SMOS products show least similarities. For selected regions in different climate classes, time series of the ASCAT product generally show higher variability of soil moisture than SMOS, and especially than ERA products. The relationship of spatial mean and variance is, especially during wet periods, influenced by sensor and retrieval characteristics in the SMOS product, while it is determined to a larger degree by the precipitation patterns of the respective regions in the ASCAT and ERA products. The decomposition of spatial variance into temporal variant and invariant components exhibits high dependence on the retrieval methods of the respective products. The change detection retrieval method causes higher influence of temporal variant factors (e.g. precipitation, evaporation) on the ASCAT product, while SMOS and ERA products are stronger determined by temporal invariant factors (e.g. topography, soil characteristics). The investigation of the effect of changing scales on spatial variance in three different areas indicates that the variance does not vary with increasing support scale. Increasing extent scales from 250 to 3000 km raise spatial variance of all products and all study areas according to a power law, which is varying seasonally. ERA shows a consistent scaling behavior with a constant power scale factor and similar intercepts across all study regions. In general, the investigated products show overall different spatial and temporal statistics which are induced by their different estimation methods and which are important to be aware of for the selection of a product for application and for their up- or downscaling.

AB The calculation of intensity- duration -frequency (IDF) relationships for rainfall requires records of rainfall accumulated over periods shorter than 1 day when the application is for small and/or urban catchments. Such records are commonly available only for limited periods, and gaps are frequent due to instrumental failure. With short and fragmentary records, it is essential to make the fullest possible use of the information contained in them. This paper compares a number of approaches by which IN relationships can be obtained in such circumstances. Using, as a basis, a reliable 18-year record of hourly rainfall at Eskdalemuir, Scotland, modified records were created which contained gaps of varying degrees of severity, and OF relationships calculated from each artificially fragmented record were compared with the IN relationships given by the full record. The methods were broadly of two types: (a) one in which the period of modified record was divided into sub-intervals (months or years), with analysis of the maximum rainfalls occurring within the sub-intervals, and with allowances for the possible incompleteness of record during the sub-intervals; (b) one in which a '' peak-over-threshold series '' (series of rainfall events exceeding a given threshold) was calculated for each modified record. Of these options, the method using series of monthly maxima with up to 20% missing data is recommended, being simple to apply and exhibiting small or nonexistent bias and small dispersion of the rainfall estimates.

AB In this paper two models are presented for calculating the hourly evapotranspiration lambda E (W m(-2)) using the Penman-Monteith equation. These models were tested on four irrigated crops (grass, soya bean, sweet sorghum and vineyard), with heights between 0.1 and 2.2 m at the adult growth stage. In the first model (Katerji N, Perrier A. 1983. Modelisation de l'evapotranspiration reelle ETR d'une parcelle de luzerne : role d'un coefficient cultural. Agronomie 3(6): 513-521, KP model), the canopy resistance r(c) is parameterized by a semi-empirical approach. In the second model (Todorovic M. 1999. Single-layer evapotranspiration model with variable canopy resistance. Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering-ASCE 125: 235-245, TD model), the resistance r(c) is parameterized by a mechanistic model. These two approaches are critically analysed with respect to the underlying hypotheses and the limitations of their practical application. In the case of the KP model, the mean slope between measured and calculated values of lambda E was 1.01 +/- 0.6 and the relative correlation coefficients r(2) ranged between 0.8 and 0.93. The observed differences in slopes, between 0.96 and 1.07, were not associated with the crop height. This model seemed to be applicable to all the crops examined. In the case of the TD model, the observed slope between measured and calculated values of lambda E for the grass canopy was 0.79. For the other crops, it varied between 1.24 and 1.34. In all the situations examined, the values of r(2) ranged between 0.73 and 0.92. The TD model underestimated lambda E in the case of grass and overestimated it in the cases of the other three crops. The under- or overestimation of lambda E in the TD model were due: (i) to some inaccuracies in the theory of this model, (ii) to not taking into account the effect of aerodynamic resistance r(a) in the canopy resistance modelling. Therefore, the values of r(c) were under-or overestimated in consequence of mismatching the crop height. The high value of air vapour pressure deficit also contributed to the overestimation of lambda E, mainly for the tallest crop. The results clarify aspects of the scientific controversy in the literature about the mechanistic and semi-empirical approaches for estimating lambda E. From the practical point of view the results also present ways for identifying the most appropriate approach for the experimental situations encountered. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms provides valuable data for monitoring and gauging river discharge. One effective approach first estimates river stage from satellite-measured inundation area based on the inundation area-river stage relationship (IARSR), and then the estimated river stage is used to compute river discharge based on the stage-discharge rating (SDR) curve. However, this approach is difficult to implement because of a lack of data for constructing the SDR curves. This study proposes a new method to construct the SDR curves using remotely sensed river cross-sectional inundation areas and river bathymetry. The proposed method was tested over a river reach between two USGS gauging stations, i.e., Kingston Mines (KM) and Copperas Creek (CC) along the Illinois River. First a polygon over each of two cross sections was defined. A complete IARSR curve was constructed inside each polygon using digital elevation model (DEM) and river bathymetric data. The constructed IARSR curves were then used to estimate 47 river water surface elevations at each cross section based on 47 river inundation areas estimated from Landsat TM images collected during 1994-2002. The estimated water surface elevations were substituted into an objective function formed by the Bernoulli equation of gradually varied open channel flow. A nonlinear global optimization scheme was applied to solve the Manning's coefficient through minimizing the objective function value. Finally the SDR curve was constructed at the KM site using the solved Manning's coefficient, channel cross sectional geometry and the Manning's equation, and employed to estimate river discharges. The root mean square error (RMSE) in the estimated river discharges against the USGS measured river discharges is 112.4 m(3)/s. To consider the variation of the Manning's coefficient in the vertical direction, this study also suggested a power-law function to describe the vertical decline of the Manning's coefficient with the water level from the channel bed lowest elevation to the bank-full level. The constructed SDR curve with the vertical variation of the Manning's coefficient reduced the RMSE in the estimated river discharges to 83.9 m(3)/s. These results indicate that the method developed and tested in this study is effective and robust, and has the potential for improving our ability of remote sensing of river discharge and providing data for water resources management, global water cycle study, and flood forecasting and prevention.

AB It is now well recognized that large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations fluctuations have a strong impact on the global hydrological cycle. Because of the complexity of the hydrological processes over continental surfaces, it is often proposed to deduce this variability from insightful analysis of river discharge time series since it integrates a large number of climatological parameters such as precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration but also land cover evolutions. However, up to now these studies remain restricted to basin or regional scale and no larger scale of these relationships between climate and continental hydrology has yet been proposed. Such relationships are helpful in the global understanding of the non-stationary relationships that exist between ocean and atmosphere mean conditions and freshwater discharge integrated at a continental scale.
   Based on a recent estimation of annual continental freshwater discharge over the 1876-1994 interval, a cross wavelet analysis (including cross wavelet spectrum and wavelet coherence) together with selected climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO, Arctic Oscillation - AO, Southern Oscillation Index SOI, Pacific Decadal Oscillation - PDO and NINO3.4 - Pacific mean Sea Surface Temperature) is exposed. The relationships are characterised by a high temporal unstationarity but three main bands of variability are identified and analyzed: 2-10-year, 10-20-year and 20-30-year variability. The five continents exhibit a temporal correlation with the five indexes sometimes on the entire interval but more often on restricted intervals. NAO and AO impact the 4-15-year variability of the five continents discharge. SOI impacts the 2-7-year variability of all continent discharge variability except Europe. NINO3.4 impacts the 2-8-year variability of Africa, Asia and South America discharge but also the 10-20-year variability of Africa, Asia, North America and South America discharge variability. Finally, PDO impacts the similar to 10-30-year variability of Asia, Europe, North America and South America discharge variability.
   These results could allow a first order prediction of the future evolutions of continental water resources from a climate change point of view in relationship with climate scenarios of evolution of atmospheric and sea surface temperature conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a model for pore spaces that consists of two parts related by duality: (1) a decomposition of an open polyhedral pore space into open contractible pore bodies separated by relatively open interfaces and (2) a pore network that is homotopy equivalent to the pore space. The dual model is unique and free of parameters, but it relies on regularity conditions for the pore space. We show how to approximate any pore space by the interior of a polyhedral complex such that the regularity conditions are fulfilled. Thus, we are able to calculate the dual model from synthetic porous media and images of real porous media. The pore bodies are unions of relatively open Delaunay cells with respect to the corners of the pore boundary, and the pore network consists of certain at most two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi cells with respect to the corners of the pore boundary. The pore network describes the neighborhood relations between the pore bodies. In particular, any relatively open 2D Delaunay face f separating two pore bodies has a unique (relatively open) dual network edge. In our model, f is a pore throat only if it is hit by its dual network edge. Thus, as opposed to widespread intuition, any pore throat is convex, and adjacent pore bodies are not necessarily separated by pore throats. Due to the duality between the pore network and the decomposition of the pore space into pore bodies it is straightforward to store the geometrical properties of the pore bodies [pore throats] as attributes of the dual network vertices [edges]. Such an attributed network is used to perform 2D drainage Simulations. The results agree very well with those from a pore-morphology based modeling approach performed directly on the digital image of a porous medium. Contractibility of the pore bodies and homotopy equivalence of the pore space and the pore network is proven using discrete Morse theory and the nerve theorem from combinatorial topology.

AB An existing closed form model is modified to describe the damped response of groundwater in a fractured bedrock borehole with variable apertures and dips to a slug test. The existing theory, which requires single sized horizontal fractures, is accurately calibrated by slug test data from three uncased bedrock boreholes in the Dedham Granite and an observation well screened just below the contact surface with a till drumlin. Apertures and dips vary however, so the ability of the modified theory to accommodate different sizes and inclinations improves upon the physical validity of its predecessor when fracture information accompanies slug test data. Geophysical logs identify a large number and dip of fractures in the uncased boreholes in the Dedham Granite in this regard. A lognormally distributed, horizontal aperture calibration of the slug tests in the uncased boreholes retains the accuracy of the single size model, and yields aperture statistics more consistent with literature values. The slug test in the screened observation well is accurately calibrated with the modified horizontal theory for discrete (two) sizes, based upon the average fracture spacing found in the uncased boreholes. All four results yield comparable compressibility estimates, which depend on fracture spacing but not size or dip. The calibrated aperture size and calculated fracture porosity and permeability decrease with length of the borehole into the Dedham Granite. The measured dip and aperture for flowing and nonflowing fractures in one of the boreholes accurately calibrates the modified theory. The inclusion of dip reduces the calibrated permeability because of the increased ellipsoidal area at the interface of the borehole and the inclined fractures. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Simplified versions of the Shallow Water Equations, known as Kinematic and Diffusive models, are commonly applied to the analysis of debris- and mud- flow dynamics. For this reason, the study of their applicability conditions represents an important concern. The present work investigates on the applicability conditions of the Diffusive Wave Model (DWM) for the prediction of mud-flows of shear-thinning fluid represented by a power-law rheology. The study has been carried out through the numerical solution of the DWM and the Full Wave Model (FWM) in unsteady conditions with hydrographs of different durations assigned at the channel inlet. The analysis has considered different rheological indexes, several values of the Fmude (F) and of the Kinematic Wave (K) numbers. Predictions of DWM and FDM have been compared considering the mean value of dimensionless errors on maximum flow depth,epsilon(h)*, and maximum discharge epsilon(q)*. Positive (negative) error leads to an overestimation (underestimation) of the maximum flow depth and flow discharge in the prediction of the DWM. In the present analysis the DWM is considered safely applicable in case of underestimation, i.e. for positive values of epsilon(h)* and epsilon(q)*. Negative errors are acceptable if their absolute value is smaller than 5%. For all the investigated values of the governing parameters, the performance of the DWM has been found to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index, worsening as the fluid rheology becomes more shear-thinning. Regardless of the hydrograph duration, and for fixed power-law exponent (n) and F values, results indicate the existence of limiting values of the kinematic wave number (K) over bar (h) and (K) over bar (q) above which the DWM is applicable in terms of maximum depth and discharge, respectively. For K values smaller than (K) over bar (h) and (K) over bar (q), the DWM applicability depends also on the hydmgraph duration. In these conditions and for several values of the (F, n) pair, the threshold values of the hydmgraph duration necessary for DWM applicability have been identified. The presented applicability criteria represent a useful guideline for the practical application of the DWM in assessing the hazard of a mud flood.

AB We evaluated the relative accuracy of four methods of producing maps of long-term runoff for part of the northeast United States: MAN, a manual procedure that incorporates expert opinion in contour placement; RPRIS, an automated procedure based on water balance considerations: PnET-II, a physiologically based model of carbon/water balance in forests: and MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant Soil System), a rule/process-based vegetation distribution/water balance model. Our goal was to confirm the accuracy of the modeling and mapping procedures, and to see if any improvements to the models and methods might be suggested.
   In our analyses, we compared contour maps derived from the four methods both qualitatively (visual inspection) and quantitatively (raster overlay and uncertainty analysis). The manual and automated (RPRIS) methods gave the best results, our analyses suggest that methods directly integrating gaged runoff data (i.e. MAN and RPRIS) provide the best results under current climatic conditions. For predicting runoff under altered conditions. e.g. climate change, the existing models studied here (i.e, PnET-II and MAPSS) hold significant promise. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Because of its impact on water quality, organic matter (OM) in karst groundwater has been widely studied. The present article describes a method for monitoring OM in karst aquifers characterized by quick responses to rainfall. This method combines weekly manual sampling and continuous monitoring to provide, qualitative and quantitative information about OM flow. Weekly samples were analyzed for Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content and spectrofluorescence, while continuous monitoring was carried out at the main spring, using a field fluorimeter (310/400-700 nm and 280/300-600 nm) to quantify chromophoric organic matter (COM). The type and quantity of COM were defined by decomposing Excitation Emission Matrices (EEMs) and by applying a 2D fluorescence decomposition method. Continuous monitoring data showed that the dominant COM was humic-like (HL). We found three types of relationship between HL and discharge and between HL and TOC, showing that caution must be exercised when using field fluorimeter measurements to quantify TOC. Each relationship was characterized by global differences in OM content and by the presence of different percentages of non-chromophoric organic matter. These three relationships are associated with changes in hydrology and microorganism activity during the year. We used these relationships to estimate the annual OM flow (about 15 kg/ha/year) and thereby quantify OM flow during the year. Our results show the importance of the non-chromophoric organic matter in such estimation. That work illustrates the need to couple qualitative and quantitative monitoring of OM in karst spring to improve the global comprehension of karst system and of the sources implies in the OM flow.

AB This study explores the application of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference systems to rainfall-runoff modelling. The models developed intend to describe the non-linear relationship between rainfall as input and runoff as output to the real system using a system based approach. Two types of fuzzy models are proposed, where the first type is intended to account for the effect of changes in catchment wetness in the rainfall-runoff transformation and the second type incorporates seasonality as a source of non-linearity in this relationship. The models developed are applied to data from six catchments of diverse climatic characteristics. The results of the fuzzy models are compared with those of the Simple Linear Model, the Linear Perturbation Model and the Nearest Neighbour Linear Perturbation Model, which use similar input information. The results of this study indicate that fuzzy inference systems are a suitable alternative to the traditional methods for modelling the non-linear relationship between rainfall and runoff.

AB An overview of the hydrological data from Patagonia's Perito Moreno Glacier-Lake Argentino- and Santa Cruz River system reinforces our previous assertion that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) are teleconnected with the rupture sequence when the glacier's snout harmonically dams (during certain interannual periods) the Rico branch of Lake Argentino. It is clear, however, that the incidence of interannual climatic anomalies is not uniform in time and appears embedded in decadal or quasi bidecadal periods of relative damming inactivity. The use of nonparametric tests shows that there are no significant positive trends in the river's annual discharge with the only exception of the yearly snowmelt/ice melt periods (September-October), when riverine flow appears to increase with statistical significance. The question of the glacier's stability looks like a complex multivariate process, although we do not rule out the occasional role of ENSO/AAO. A longer hydrological data series (i.e., 100 years) would prove useful in casting some light on this intriguing process, surely accounting for the glacier's response time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper is concerned with the determination of relationships between precipitation rates p and lightning flash-rates in thunderstorms. Previous calculations predicting that the lightning frequency f is proportional to the product of the downflux of solid precipitation p and the mass upflux I of ice crystals, have been extended in order to derive direct relationships between f and p. The form of the f/p relationship depends upon the dominant glaciation mechanism. If primary nucleation is dominant f is proportional to the first power of p, but if Hallett-Mossop nucleation prevails the exponent is roughly 1.5. In order to test these predictions adequately, significant additional field-data analysis is required. The estimated values of precipitation yield per lightning flash, Y, are 10(7) and 2 X 10(6) kg/flash, respectively. These predictions are in reasonable agreement with field data. Improved predictions of Y should further increase the reported important role of lightning data-when assimilated into mesoscale models-in improving the accuracy of quantitative precipitation forecasting and shortterm forecasts of flooding.

AB The conceptual recession model based on the storage-discharge relationship was proposed to account for the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction. The recession model was formulated by combining the constitutive storage-discharge relationship with the integral balance equation for unsaturated and saturated water storage. The functional form of the constitutive storage-discharge relationship was determined from the spatial integration of the Richards equation. The performance of the recession model was tested by comparing with the solution of the Richards equation for different simulation geometric shapes and soil types. The conceptual recession model incorporating the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction was in good agreement with the recession response of the Richards equation. However, the recession model that neglected the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction was comparable to the Richards equation only for soils with the weak interaction between unsaturated water storage and saturated water storage. This result suggests the important role of the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction in the formulation of the recession process when the derivative of the functional relationship between the unsaturated water storage and saturated water storage becomes significant.

AB Runoff in many locations within the Canadian Prairies is dominated by intermittent fill-and-spill between depressions. As a result, many basins have varying fractions of their areas connected to their outlets, due to changing depressional storage. The objective of this research is to determine the causes of the relationships between water storage and the connected fraction of depression-dominated Prairie basins. It is hypothesized that the shapes of the relationship curves are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage. Three sets of numerical experiments are presented to test the hypothesis.
   The first set of experiments demonstrates that where the number of depressions is small, their size and spatial distributions are important in controlling the relationship between the volume of depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin. As the number of depressions is increased, the areal fractions of the largest depressions decrease, which reduces the importance of the spatial distribution of depressions.
   The second set of experiments demonstrates that the curve enveloping the connected fraction of a basin can be derived from the frequency distribution of depression areas, and scaling relationships between the area, volume and catchment area of the depressions, when the area of the largest depression is no greater than approximately 5% of the total.
   The third set of experiments demonstrates that the presence of a single large depression can strongly influence the relationship between the depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin, depending on the relative size of the large depression, and its location within the basin. A single depression containing 30% of the total depressional area located near the outlet was shown to cause a basin to be nearly endorheic. A similar depression near the top of a basin was demonstrated not to fill and was therefore unable to contribute flows.
   The implications of the findings for developing hydrological models of large Prairie drainage basins are discussed.

AB The presence of fracture roughness, isolated contact areas and the occurrence of nonlinear flow complicate the fracture flow process. To experimentally investigate the fluid flow regimes through deformable rock fractures, water flow tests through both mated and non-mated sandstone fractures were conducted in triaxial cell under changing confining stress from 1.0 MPa to 3.5 MPa. For the first time Forchheimer's nonlinear factor b describing flow in non-mated fractures under variable confining stress has been quantified. The results show that linear Darcy's law holds for water flow through mated fracture samples due to high flow resistance caused by the small aperture and high tortuosity of the flow pathway, while nonlinear flow occurs for non-mated fracture due to enlarged aperture. Regression analyses of experimental data show that both Forchheimer equation and Izbash's law provide an excellent description for this nonlinear fracture flow process. Further, the nonlinear flow data indicate that for smaller true transmissivity, the appreciable nonlinear effect occurs at lower volumetric flow rates. The experimental data of both mated and non-mated fracture flow show that the confining stress does not change the linear and nonlinear flow patterns, however, it has a significant effect on flow characteristics. For mated fracture flow, the slope of pressure gradient versus flow rate becomes steeper and the transmissivity decreases hyperbolically with increase of confining stress, while for non-mated fracture flow, the rate of increase of the nonlinear coefficient b used in Forchheimer equation steadily diminishes with the increase of confining stress. Based on Forchheimer equation and taking 10% of the nonlinear effect as the critical state to distinguish between linear and nonlinear flow, the critical Reynolds number was successfully estimated by using a nonlinear effect coefficient E. This method appears effective to determine critical Reynolds numbers for specific flow cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Investigating factors controlling the temporal patterns of nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports on the basis of a comparative study of different land uses is beneficial for managing water resources, especially in agricultural watersheds. We focused our research on an agricultural watershed (AW) and a forested watershed (FW) located in the Shibetsu watershed of eastern Hokkaido, Japan, to investigate the temporal patterns of N and DOC exports and factors controlling those patterns at different timescales (inter-annual, seasonal, and hydrological event scales). Results showed that the annual patterns of N and DOC exports significantly varied over time and were probably controlled by climate. Higher discharge volumes in 2003, a wet year, showed higher N and DOC loadings in both watersheds. However, this process was also regulated by land use associated with N inputs. Higher concentrations and loadings were shown in the agricultural watershed. At the seasonal scale, N and DOC exports in the AW and the FW were more likely controlled by sources associated with land use. The Total N (TN) and Nitrate-N (NO3- -N) had higher concentrations during snowmelt season in the AW, which may be attributed to manure application in late autumn or early winter in the agricultural watershed. Concentrations of TN, NO3--N, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and DOC showed higher values during the summer rainy season in the FW, related to higher litter decomposition during summer and autumn and the fertilizer application in the agricultural area during summer. Higher DOC concentrations and loadings were observed during the rainy season in the AW, which is probably attributed to higher DOC production related to temperature and microbial activity during summer and autumn in grasslands. Correlations between discharge and concentrations differed during different periods or in different watersheds, suggesting that weather discharge can adequately represent the fact that N export depends on N concentrations, discharge level, and other factors. The differing correlations between N/DOC concentrations and the Si concentration indicated that the N/DOC exports might occur along different flow paths during different periods. During baseflow, the high NO3--N exports were probably derived from deep groundwater and might have percolated from uplands during hydrological events. During hydrological events, NO3--N exports may occur along near-surface flow paths and in deep groundwater, whereas DOC exports could be related to near-surface flow paths. At the event scale, the relationships between discharge and concentrations of N and DOC were regulated by antecedent soil moisture (shallow groundwater condition) in each watershed. These results indicated that factors controlling N and DOC exports varied at different timescales in the Shibetsu area and that better management of manure application during winter in agricultural lands is urgently needed to control water pollution in streams.

AB A method of estimating large floods using a linear storage-routing approach is presented. The differences between the proposed approach and those traditionally used are (1) that the flood producing properties of basins are represented by a linear system, (2) the storage parameters of the distributed model are determined using a volume law which, unlike other storage-routing models, accounts for the distribution of storage in natural basins, and (3) the basin outflow hydrograph is determined analytically and expressed in a succinct mathematical form. The single model parameter is estimated from observed data without direct fitting, unlike most traditionally used methods. The model was tested by showing it could reproduce observed large floods on a number of basins. This paper compares the proposed approach with a traditionally used storage routing approach using observed hood data from the Hacking River basin in New South Wales, Australia. Results confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach for estimation of large floods.

AB Observation of temporal variations in soil moisture along transects is important when examining hydrological processes on a hillslope. Although there is substantial interest in characterizing catchment hydrology through an investigation of hydrologic connectivity, few attempts have been made to explore hydrologic connectivity within soil layers using soil moisture observations. Mathematical relationships among soil moisture differences are reproducible when Granger causality is defined within the context of hydrological connectivity because the process based transfer functions facilitate soil moisture predictions. Soil moisture time series along two transects on a steep hillslope were obtained using a multiplexed time domain reflectometry system during the growing season in June 2008 and 2009. The transfer function relationships between multiple soil moisture differences were delineated to determine a representative point for reliable time series modeling, and to establish the spatial pattern of areal clusters that will enable model identification and prediction. The impact of hillslope topography on the modeling of coupled soil moisture was highlighted by configuring the threshold behavior of model predictability. Results showed that soil moisture temporal relationships can be used for the prediction of volumetric soil moisture, within a specific area associated with representation point. Reliable relationships among soil moistures were apparent for points having greater upslope areas between 400 m(2) and 1000 m(2). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB This paper investigates the impacts of climate change on groundwater droughts making use of regional projections and standardized indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI). The method adopted, using historical precipitation and temperature data and water levels collected in monitoring wells, first investigates the possible correlations between meteorological and groundwater indices at each well. Then, if there is a correlation, a linear regression analysis is used to model the relationships between SGIs and SPIs, and SGIs and SPEIs. The same relationships are used to infer future SGIs from SPI and SPEI projections obtained by means of an ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), under different climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). This methodology has been applied to data collected in northern Tuscany (Italy) in an area served by a water company, where historical series of daily climate variables (since 1934) and daily records for 16 wells, covering the period 2005-2020, are available. The impacts on groundwater have been computed in the short- (2006-2035), medium- (2036-2065) and long-term (2066-2095). The analysis indicates that, in the historical period and for most of the monitoring wells, there is a good correlation between SGIs and SPIs or SPEIs. The results point out that making use of the SGI-SPI relationships, slight variations in the availability of groundwater are expected in the future. However, in a global warming scenario, the influence of temperature on evapotranspiration phenomena cannot be overlooked and, for this reason, the SGI-SPEI relationships seem more suitable to forecast groundwater droughts. According to these relationships, negative effects on groundwater levels in almost all wells are estimated for the future. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, the largest decline in groundwater level is expected in the medium-term, while for the RCP 8.5 scenario future SGIs will significantly decrease over the long-term. Due to the type of data required and its simplicity, this methodology can be applied to different areas of interest for a quick estimate of groundwater availability under climate change scenarios.

AB Land surface schemes are vital components of general circulation models (GCMs) which provide the fluxes of heat, water and momentum at the land-atmosphere interface. The fluxes simulated by these schemes are especially dependent on the way in which the canopy (or 'bulk stomatal') conductance for plant transpiration is modelled. Considerable research has been carried out into the dependences of canopy conductance on the local environment, and empirical relationships for such dependences have been obtained by fitting the data collected in field and laboratory experiments. However, observed leaf level relationships between stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis suggest an alternative approach. Given an appropriate algorithm for scaling these values up to canopy level, such relationships allow canopy conductance values to be derived from (comparatively) well validated models of leaf photosynthesis. This approach is likely to become especially attractive as land surface schemes are extended to simulate CO2 fluxes, since the shared environmental dependences of canopy conductance and photosynthesis reduce the number of model parameters which require independent specification. This paper is concerned with the evaluation of canopy level relationships between photosynthesis and conductance using data from the first international satellite land surface climatology project (ISLSCP) held experiment (FIFE). Simultaneous measurements of CO2 and water vapour fluxes, taken over a predominantly C-4 grassland, are used to independently test the conductance and photosynthesis models. Based on these tests, a simple coupled model of canopy conductance and photosynthesis is developed which produces a good match to the experimental data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Empirical relationships linking kinetic energy to rainfall intensity are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity. In this paper, using the drop-size distribution (DSD) proposed by Marshall and Palmer, a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power was firstly deduced. This equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity and its application also reveals the drawback of needing the measurement of the whole DSD by an expensive disdrometric technique.
   Then, using a fictitious precipitation, which is both constituted by droplets having the same diameter (mean volume diameter) and having the same volume of the actual rainfall, a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was deduced. This last equation has the advantage of allowing the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets, reaching a horizontal unit area in an unit time, which can be acquired by a cheap device using a piezoelectric force transducer.
   This new relationship for estimating the rainfall kinetic power was tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in Italy (Palermo) and in Spain (El Teularet). These experimental tests demonstrated that the rainfall kinetic power estimated by the mean volume diameter has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships proposed by Wischmeier and Smith, Brown and Foster and McGregor et al.
   Finally this investigation also showed that this novel approach can be applied estimating the median volume diameter by the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the measured drop diameters, whose measurement can be obtained by a force transducer.

AB Ten years of detailed upland stream and bulk deposition water quality data from Plynlimon, mid-Wales, are examined for trend. A robust statistical test (the seasonal Kendall test) is applied and data are presented graphically. Smoothing techniques are used to highlight the patterns of change which underlie high data scatter. The graphs show long-term cycles within the data which violate the assumptions of common statistical tests for trend. These cycles relate to fluctuations in the weather patterns at Plynlimon. Even though the seasonal Kendall test is significant for some determinands, the evidence from the graphs suggests that many of these 'trends' are unlikely to continue.
   For solutes in rainfall, there is no convincing long-term trend. There is a possible increase in ammonium concentrations, which may indicate an increasing atmospheric source generated by farming activities, but this will require a longer data series for confirmation. Several trace metal concentrations increased significantly part way through the study period, but later returned to the original levels. The bulk precipitation sea salt input has been uneven over the 10-year sampling period, with the highest inputs occurring during the wetter winters.
   For solutes in streamwaters, there are clear trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOG), iodine and bromide, which increase over time and may be attributed to an increase in organic decomposition in the catchment. Previous studies in Wales have shown similar behaviour for colour, which is related to DOG, but the corresponding changes for bromide and iodine are new. For most other streamwater determinands, any changes are masked by the effects of year to year variations in the quality and quantity of rainfall. For example, zinc and chromium variations parallel the corresponding rainfall quantity variations. The effect of rainfall quality variation is marked for marine-derived elements such as chloride. For sulphate, streamwater variations are inverted relative to chloride. This suggests that dry deposition may vary with weather conditions: high when the wind direction is from the land and low when weather systems are predominantly frontal and laden with sea salts. Alternatively, high sea salt rainfall may be affecting absorption/solubility reactions in the soils.
   There are four main conclusions. Firstly, there is no indication of changing acid deposition inputs or changing acidity within the runoff, despite a decline in UK sulphur dioxide emissions. Secondly, streamwater DOC has shown an increase over time, but there is no clear corresponding decrease in pH as might be expected from acidification theory. Thirdly, there are cyclical variations in bulk precipitation inputs and in streamwater quality, which mean that trends cannot be established even with 10 years of data. Long-term cycles are likely to exist in other environmental data and extreme care is required for the interpretation of trend, especially if data sets are short. This aspect strongly supports the continuation of long-term monitoring programmes over several decades. Finally, the graphical application strongly enhances data analysis and should be considered an essential component of trend investigation.

AB High-frequency, spatially-dense discharge monitoring was conducted over fifteen months to characterise unsaturated zone flow at Harrie Wood Cave (HWC), in the Snowy Mountains, Yarrangobilly (SE Australia). The cave was formed in the Late Silurian Yarrangobilly Limestone, a fractured rock associated with very low primary porosity due to past diagenesis. Over our monitoring period we simultaneously measured rainfall, soil moisture saturation and drip discharge rate at fourteen sites to characterise infiltration-discharge relationships. All drip discharge sites exhibited non-Gaussian distributions, indicating long periods where low discharge predominates, punctuated by short infrequent periods of high discharge. However, there was significant variability in discharge between sites and consequently no spatial correlation in the cave. We investigated the depth-discharge relationship at HWC and found a moderate relationship between depth and drip discharge lag (response) times to soil moisture content, but only weak relationships between depth and mean and maximum discharge. This highlights that the karst architecture plays an important role in controlling drip discharge dynamics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchal Clustering (AHC) were used to classify similar drip types, revealing five unique drip regimes. Two-phase flow and non-linear response to recharge behaviour were observed, suggesting secondary porosity is controlling unsaturated zone flow in mature limestone environments with low primary porosity. Using the data presented here, the first coupled conceptual and box hydrological flow model was developed. This study highlights the heterogeneous nature of hydrological flow in karst and the need to understand unsaturated zone hydrology at the individual drip discharge level, to inform speleothem studies for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SPATIALLY-VARIABLE FIELDS; INFILTRATION; SOIL
AB The rectangular profiles assumption (as in the model of Green and Ampt) is utilized for developing an approximate model for one-dimensional, vertical, unsaturated flow with root water uptake. The simplified model reduces the non-linear partial differential equation (Richard's equation) for water movement to non-linear algebraic equations whose solutions require less computer effort. The basic hydraulic principles (continuity and Darcy's law) are retained in the approximate model. Soil surface boundary conditions of infiltration and redistribution are considered. Analytical solutions are available for the depth to the wetting front when the soil surface is held at saturation. Comparisons between the numerical solutions and approximate solutions are made for two distinct soil types. The approximate model predicts root water uptake quite accurately when compared with predictions from the numerical solution of Richard's equation. It is concluded that such simplified models hold promise in a variety of practical applications.

AB In multi-agent decision making, agents' decisions are coherently interdependent, and the objectives of agents are possibly inconsistent. In this type of decision-making, agents need to reason and act strategically. Therefore, game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper presents a new hierarchical decision-making methodology, which uses the advantages of both game theory (i.e. Stackelberg leadership model) and Evidential Reasoning (ER). ER, as a multi-attribute decision-making method, considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes, and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives. The backward induction method and Monte-Carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader-follower game. The methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for Urmia Lake, which is the biggest saltwater lake in the Middle East. In the past decade, the lake's surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought. In this paper, 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated, and a scenario, which is corresponding to a 40% reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from Nezam Abad dam, is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game.

ID FLOW; PERSISTENCE; RAINFALL
AB A frequency dependence of river runoff power spectrum is deduced from the integrated runoff and storage dynamics, derived from the mass and momentum balance equations for the water on a river catchment. The power spectrum consists of three multipliers: a 1/f(beta) noise factor with beta similar to 1 reflecting a stochastic behavior of precipitation; a Lorentzian factor 1/(f(c)(2)+ f(2)) damping high frequency runoff oscillations; and the sum of spectral modes of annual and intra-annual periodicity. This spectrum has two different power-law trends, separated by the crossover frequency f(c), with the exponents beta and beta + 2 at tow and high frequencies, respectively. The theoretical results are tested on four discharge time series (3580-6575 daily records) of the river Volga at Staritsa and three rivers of the Volga basin, catchment areas varied from 1850 to 21,100 km(2). The time series are used to calculate empirical power spectra of river discharges and to construct the theoretical power spectra by fitting model parameters to the data. The calculations indicate that the spectral exponent beta is approximately equal to 1 for three rivers and to 0.67 for one river. The crossover frequency f(c) corresponds to a period of 12 days for large catchment areas and similar to 3 days for small one. The comparison shows that the model and empirical spectra by their spectral trends at low and high frequencies, crossover frequency, and positions of first several spectral modes are in satisfactory agreement. To isolate an effect of fluctuations, we consider a transformed runoff time series for one of the rivers, obtained by subtraction of the multiyear average daily hydrograph from the raw time series. The transformed time series interpreted as discharge fluctuations is used to calculate the fluctuation power spectrum. This spectrum has two different power-law trends with a spectral exponent of 0.6 at low frequencies and 2.7 at high frequencies. The difference is about 2 like for the power spectrum of raw time series, but the crossover frequency slightly moves to a value corresponding to a period of 15 days. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Determination of stage-discharge relationships in natural rivers is extremely important in flood control projects. Observational data at various stages cannot be collected simultaneously. It may take a considerable amount of time and a great deal of difficulty to collect the data required for establishing the rating curves. The main purpose of the current paper is to estimate the discharge using the concept of isovel contours with the corresponding hydro-geometric parameters of the cross sections which was first introduced by Maghrebi (2006). Although the accuracy of the contours is not very high, it is believed that when the sum of the whole cross sectional contour values is used as a single parameter in the proposed relationship the accuracy of discharge estimation is surprisingly high. A relationship based on dimensional analysis is used to interrelate the discharges at two different stages by simply using the geometrical parameters such the cross-sectional area, wetted perimeter, the width of the free surface and a quantity which is related to the summations of isovel contours. Then, the most accurate relationship that is obtained by minimization of the differences between the calculated and analytical discharges at two different stages is introduced. For verification, the results of the proposed method are compared with the observed stage-discharge data taken from the Main and Severn rivers in UK, the Tomebamba River in Ecuador and the Yangtze River in China. The results indicate the high accuracy of the proposed method such that the mean values of MAPE and NRMSE of all selected rivers do not exceed 8.7% and 0.09, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ecohydrological and biochemical processes responsible for the globally significant stores of carbon in northern peatlands are largely controlled by the soil's hydrophysical properties, in particular the relationship that soil water tension (psi) has with soil water content (theta) and hydraulic conductivity (K). Despite the importance, little is known about how these relationships vary between species in different physiological Sphagnum microforms, such a hummock and hollow, as well as with depth within a profile. Complicating matters is that laboratory experiments to determine these relationships are almost always completed with 5 cm high samples, despite no real scientific evidence supporting this height. To address these shortcomings, we sampled 8 replicates/samples (moss surface to 15 cm depth) each from a S. magellanicum hollow and a S. fuscum hummock. We determined the K(psi) and theta(psi) relationships at various pressure heads (0 to -32 cm) and then sub-sectioned the 15-cm samples into 3x5-cm (top, middle, bottom) samples and repeated the tests. There were important differences in both K(psi) and theta(psi) relationships between the top, middle and bottom samples. Additionally, comparison of the average of the 3x5-cm samples versus the 15-cm samples suggested that the 15-cm samples were not a good representation due to not being fully compatible with the methodology, and that 3x5-cm samples were preferred. Using Hydrus-1D to simulate a 30-day drought period with local hydroclimatological data, we assessed whether the statistically significant differences were ecohydrologically significant when accounting for the different topographic niches of the two species. The different moss species responded differently, with S. fuscum becoming more water stressed than S. magellanicum, yet S. fuscum lost less water from soil water storage than S. magellanicum. This highlighted the critically important need to replicate the species' niche in the landscape, and not give two distinct species the same hydrological modelling boundary conditions to compare results.

ID DERIVATION; RUNOFF
AB For watersheds where flow data are unavailable, the geomorphology-hydrology relationship can be used to estimate the direct flow response to excess rainfall. Two of the most common approaches used to compute this response are Geomorphological Instantaneous Unit Hydrographs (GIUH) and Spatially Distributed Unit Hydrographs (SDUH). In the former, the hydrograph is determined from the input of morphometric parameters and an average channel velocity, where in the latter a time-area relationship is used to compute the hydrograph. Generally, both approaches involve an estimate of velocity to parameterize the Unit Hydrograph (UN), however, information on this parameter is generally limited for watersheds where these methods are most appropriate, when there is no flow data to derive the UN directly. The aim of this work is to investigate if the velocity parameters involved in GIUH and SDUH methods can be estimated directly from watershed characteristics, and allow these methods to be applied in ungauged watersheds. Four watersheds in southern Australia with daily flow records have been considered, to allow the observed direct flow response to be determined. It was found that both approaches could be calibrated to accurately represent the expected response for all four watersheds considered. The SDUH model implemented considered hillslope and channel flow processes separately, which allowed the velocity parameters involved to be estimated from the watershed using Manning's equation. However, the GIUH model combines these flow processes into one average velocity parameter, and due to this averaging a relationship between the calibrated value and the watershed characteristics could not be determined. The results suggest that the SDUH model can be directly parameterized for a given watershed in the absence of flow data, however, further work is required to investigate if the relationships proposed are suitable for a wider range of watersheds.

AB Rigorous validation of the first-order detachment-transport coupling concept using different sediment sizes is nonexistent in the literature. We hypothesized that particle sizes in a sediment-laden flow can affect soil detachment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between detachment rates by rill flows and hydraulic parameters under low flow discharges, and to quantify the responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and median sizes. A concentrated flow flume test was conducted under three low flow discharges (0.00033, 0.00067 and 0.00100 m(2).s(-1)) and three sediment concentrations (50, 100 and 200 kg.m(-3)) with five median sizes (0.233, 0.204, 0.169, 0.115 and 0.078 mm). The results showed that the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model well (R-2 = 0.89). Stream power, compared with shear stress, is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rates under different sediment concentrations. The soil detachment rates by sediment-laden rill flows were negatively related to both sediment loads and sediment median sizes, validating the first-order sediment feedback relationships used in the WEPP model. The overall responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and sediment median sizes followed multivariate linear relationships, further demonstrating the negative feedbacks of sediment load and size on soil detachment by rill flow.

AB A two-dimensional depth-averaged continuum framework is developed for simulating the interaction of flows outside and within porous media. A unique set of generalized equations applicable to both surface and subsurface systems is derived originating from conservation laws of microscopic variables with first volume-averaging and then integrating vertically. The model is free of ad-hoc coupling as interface conditions are satisfied implicitly owing to the generalized nature of the governing equations. The set of depth-integrated equations (unconditionally hyperbolic) is resolved by employing a Total-Variation-Diminishing MacCormack scheme. The developed model is validated with four one-dimensional experimental test-cases (containing both Darcy and non-Darcy regimes) and applied to a demonstrative two-dimensional scenario having various interface conditions. Results obtained from the proposed framework highlights the potential applicability of the generalized model for diverse time-scales and vertical/ sloping interface conditions.

AB The effectiveness of genetic programming (GP) for solving regression problems in hydrology has been recognized in recent studies. However, its capability to solve classification problems has not been sufficiently explored so far. This study develops and applies a novel classification-forecasting model, namely Binary GP (BGP), for teleconnection studies between sea surface temperature (SST) variations and maximum monthly rainfall (MMR) events. The BGP integrates certain types of data pre-processing and post-processing methods with conventional GP engine to enhance its ability to solve both regression and classification problems simultaneously. The model was trained and tested using SST series of Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Red Sea as potential predictors as well as classified MMR events at two locations in Iran as predictand. Skill of the model was measured in regard to different rainfall thresholds and SST lags and compared to that of the hybrid decision tree-association rule (DTAR) model available in the literature. The results indicated that the proposed model can identify potential teleconnection signals of surrounding seas beneficial to long-term forecasting of the occurrence of the classified MMR events.

AB Modeling and simulating overland flow fed by rainfall is a common issue in watershed surface hydrology. Modelers have to choose among various friction models when defining their simulation framework. The purpose of this work is to compare the simulation quality for the Manning, Darcy-Weisbach, and Poiseuille friction models on the simple case of a constant rain on a thin experimental flume. Results show that the usual friction law of Manning is not suitable for this type of flow. The Poiseuille friction model gave the best results both on the flux at the outlet and the velocity and depth profile along the flume. The Darcy-Weisbach model shows good results for laminar flow. Additional testing should be carried out for turbulent cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of nutrient loads are critical for managing the effects of nutrient pollution in receiving waters. An accurate calculation of load requires sub-daily, concurrent measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations. Continuous flow measurements are common, but nutrient concentrations are often measured infrequently, and so, statistical estimates of flow - concentration relationships are often used to infer nutrient concentration on unsampled days. Contributions of diffuse, nonpoint sources to flow - concentration relationships in neighboring sites may be similar, and methods are available to apportion in-stream concentrations to contributions from point and nonpoint sources. Combining a source apportionment model with a hierarchical statistical model may be a useful approach for leveraging information from more intensively sampled sites to improve estimates of re-lationships at more sparsely sampled sites. The approach is tested using daily measurements of total phosphorus and flow from eight rivers in Ohio, USA. Data from seven of the rivers are randomly subsampled to a single sample from each month, and a hierarchical model fit to estimate flow - concentration relationships for all sites. Hierarchical model estimates of phosphorus loads in subsampled sites were compared with three site-specific models: a linear flow - concentration relationship, a quadratic flow - concentration relationship with seasonal corrections, and Beale's ratio method. The hierarchical model improved substantially on the precision of esti-mated total phosphorus loads at sparsely sampled sites, yielding an interquartile range of prediction errors of 22%. Simple linear load - concentration models were the next best performing method with an interquartile range of 33%. The average bias in hierarchical model predictions of phosphorus loads was 8%, whereas the smallest biases associated with the comparison methods were -10% for both the linear load - concentration model and Beale's ratio. These results suggest that a hierarchical statistical model can be valuable for improving nutrient load estimates when data from a small number of intensively sites are available.

AB Groundwater vulnerability variation over time due to groundwater depth variation caused by pumping reduction is an issue of great interest that should be properly investigated; this is because pumping reduction results in groundwater level increase on the one hand and groundwater vulnerability increase, as a result of groundwater depth decrease, on the other hand. In this context, the present study introduces a novel approach, which considers the spatio-temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability and at the same time focuses on the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate (i. e. the highest rate of pumping reduction under which the highest increase in groundwater levels occurs without an increase in groundwater vulnerability taking place) in over-exploited and contaminated aquifers. In a first stage, a dynamic and time-dependent approach involving the linkage between a GIS-based DRASTIC model and a groundwater flow model was developed in order to determine groundwater vulnerability changes under different pumping reduction rates (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%), and thus to produce the necessary data sets for investigating their relationship. Subsequently, regression analysis was conducted to define this relationship and estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate. Our implementation of the methodology showed that groundwater vulnerability displays small changes during the projection period for all reduction rates, while decreasing for 0% and 10% reduction of withdrawals and increasing for 20%, 30% and 40% reduction. After finding that a quadratic equation accurately describes the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction (R-2 = 0.999), an optimal reduction rate of 16.4% was estimated. By confirming that no change in vulnerability occurs under this value during the projection period, the validity of the equation defined was affirmed.

AB The objective of this study is to develop a nonlinear perturbation model (NLPM) based on artificial neural network (ANN), defined as NLPM-ANN, for the purpose of improving the rainfatt-runoff forecasting efficiency and accuracy. The NLPM-ANN model structure is similar to that of the linear perturbation model. (LPM). The deference is that ANN, instead of the linear response function, was used to simulate the unknown relationship between the input perturbations and the output perturbations. Eight watersheds, across of a range of climatic conditions and watershed area magnitudes located in China, were selected for testing the daily rainfall-runoff forecasting ability of this model. The proposed model was also compared with the LPM, a nonlinear perturbation model. considering catchment wetness (NLPM-API), and two different ANN models. It is shown that the model. efficiency of NLPM-ANN model is significantly higher than that of the LPM. The results demonstrate that the relationship between the perturbations is high nonlinear though subtracting the seasonal means, and ANN is capable to simulate this relationship. Comparing with the NLPM-API, the NLPM-ANN also shows advantages in simulating the nonlinear relationship between the rainfall and runoff. The results also indicate that consideration of the seasonal information can improve the model. efficiency of not only the linear models but also the ANN models. Subtracting the seasonal means, which is adopted in the LPM, is also a feasible way to reduce the system complexity and improve the model. efficiency of ANN models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change and human activities have induced alterations to hydrological processes. The quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge, especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities. In this study, the decomposition method based on Budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in Huifa River basin by defining prechange period (1953-1974) and postchange period (1975-2005). The results are further verified by the monthly abcd model. Both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale, with 68% of the change contributed by direct human activities. At the seasonal scale, the direct human-induced declines in streamflow account for 67% and 39% of the total changes for energy-limited and water-limited seasons, respectively; whereas, the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation. In addition, the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy-limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season.

AB A computer model for meandering rivers that couples water flow, bed topography, the sorting of sediments with different grain sizes, and channel migration has been developed using the linear theory of Johannesson and Parker [1989] for the dynamics of meandering rivers and the theory of Parker and Andrews [1985] for bed load sediment transport and sorting in meander bends. The equations for single-size sediment transport used in the linear theory of Johannesson and Parker were replaced by multiple-size sediment transport and sorting equations obtained from the theory of Parker and Andrews. This paper is the first of a pair. In this paper, the theoretical framework of the model is presented, and the derivation of the theory from the earlier theories is detailed. It is shown that there are five different regions in the two-dimensional model parameter space [epsilon (G(1) - 3), (pi /2)(2)G(2)], where G(1) is a measure of the coupling of the longitudinal sediment flow to the longitudinal water flow, epsilon is the resealed bed friction coefficient, and G(2) characterizes the coupling of the transverse (cross channel) sediment flow to the transverse component of the bed inclination. The model is not stable in two of the regions (regions I and 2). Alternating bars develop in region 4 but propagate along the channel with damped amplitudes, and no alternating bars develop in region 5. In region 3, which is the boundary between regions 2 and 4, alternating bars develop and propagate undamped throughout the entire channel. Increasing the floodplain inclination, channel width/depth ratio, average sediment size, or the breadth of the sediment size distribution in the model increases the tendency toward a transition from a stable meandering state to an unstable, presumably braided, state.

AB Three-dimensional response to well pumping in a multilayer aquifer system with rigorous treatment of interfacial flow attracts great attention among the subsurface hydrologists because of its theoretical importance and practical merits. In this study, a general theory of three-dimensional groundwater flow to a well of infinitesimal radius in an anisotropic three-layer aquifer system is developed with a constant-rate pumping in the lower layer, and associated semi-analytical solutions of drawdowns in individual layers are obtained. This theory discards many previous assumptions for studying a multilayer aquifer system such as simplified flow configuration in the aquitard, treatment of cross-formation flow as a volumetric averaged term adding to the governing equations of aquifer flows, and sometimes negligence of vertical flow components in the aquifers. Additionally, this theory considers three types of commonly used top boundary conditions: A water table with delayed gravity drainage boundary condition (Case 1), a constant-head top boundary condition (Case 2), and a no-flow top boundary condition (Case 3). The dimensionless drawdown solutions in Laplace domain are obtained and inverted numerically to calculate the time-domain solutions. The solution encompasses existing solutions for a two-layer or a single-layer (e.g. unconfined or confined) aquifer system as subsets. The developed solutions are tested extensively with a finite-element numerical solution using COMSOL and other existing solutions, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to prioritize the influences of different parameter groups. The results of this study can be used to predict the pumping induced drawdown at any position with an observation well, and to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the lower pumped layer and upper layer, as well as the middle layer. The developed theory provides a basis for other potential applications such as geotechnical engineering and groundwater management.

AB Head gradients along meandering rivers induce surface water-groundwater exchange across pointbars. We analyze this exchange process by finite-element modeling of groundwater flow and transport through model-generated river planforms taken from previous studies. The river is considered as a constant-head boundary that decreases linearly along the direction of the channel. This leads to an irregular groundwater flowfield in the pointbar that is controlled by channel sinuosity. Simulations under homogeneous aquifer conditions shows that the variable flowpath lengths coupled with the heterogeneous flow velocities lead to non-Fickian transport characterized by power-law residence time distributions. This anomalous transport behavior is enhanced by increased aquifer dispersivity. The broad transit time distribution implies that time-dependent chemical transformation processes in near-stream zones may be equally variable as the flowfield, even in the absence of heterogeneity in aquifer hydraulic properties.

AB Western US water management is underpinned by spring-summer water supply forecasts (WSFs) from hydrologic models forced primarily by winter mountain snowpack data. The US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates the largest such system regionally. NRCS recently developed a next-generation WSF prototype, the multi-model machine-learning metasystem (M-4). Here, we test this ensemble artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational WSF model. In 20 hindcasting test-cases spanning diverse environments across the western US and Alaska, on average out-of-sample R-2 and RPSS improved over 50% and RMSE improved 13% relative to current benchmarks. The M-4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them. Live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows, as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes, belying the black-box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients. This was accomplished using WSF-focused pragmatic solutions, like "popular votes" for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems, and graphical visualization of reduced-dimension, AI-extracted nonlinear feature-target relationships. We also found that certain M-4 technical design elements, including autonomous machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter pre-calibration, and theory-guided data science, collectively permitted automated ("over-the-loop") training and operation. Overall, the analyses confirmed M-4 meets requirements for NRCS operational adoption. This finding signals that, despite negligible operational-community uptake of machine learning so far, suitably purpose-designed novel AI systems have capacity to transition into large-scale practical applications with service-delivery organizations; it appears M-4 will be the largest AI migration into operational river forecasting to date. It may ultimately provide a broader integration platform for harnessing multiple data and model types.

AB Many models that describe the energy balance of plant canopies are unsuitable for use as components of larger-scale climate models because their computational and data input requirements are too large. Models based on 'higher-order-closure' and Lagrangian simulations of particle trajectories provide examples. More practical models are usually based on diffusion theory, even though turbulent transport within canopies is not a diffusive process. Recently, Raupach (Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 115, 609-632, 1989) presented an efficient analytical model based on Lagrangian principles. In Raupach's theory, the profile of scalar concentration within a canopy is described as the sum of a 'far-field' contribution, predicted using diffusion theory, and a 'near-field' contribution, for which the diffusion equation is inappropriate. The latter contribution is referred to as 'non-diffusive' transport. This approach still requires a detailed description of canopy turbulence and the distribution of sources.
   In this paper, Raupach's theory is used to develop a model for a 'typical' two-layer canopy consisting of an overstorey and a ground layer. An expression for the average 'near-field' contribution within the upper storey is derived by integrating Raupach's equations. This average contribution is computed for a range of 'typical' scalar source profiles and turbulence profiles in the overstorey. It is shown that the near-field contribution is rather insensitive to the description of the canopy turbulence and it is not unduly sensitive to the assumed source distribution, particularly as its total contribution is rather small. The average 'near-field' contribution to the scalar profile in the overstorey can be represented by a 'near-field resistance', r(n), which can be added to a traditional resistance model, The modified model can then predict counter-gradient fluxes in appropriate cases. Because the near-field resistance is small compared with the 'far-field' resistances of the model, the results show that non-diffusive exchange processes play a minor role in determining transport of scalars between the atmosphere and dense plant canopies.

AB Characterizing physical relationships between the sensible, latent and ground heat flux at the Earth surface is of crucial importance in studying the global energy, water, and carbon cycles. Here we demonstrate an analogy between the daily mean turbulent heat transfer in the atmospheric surface layer and conductive-advective heat transfer in soil. This finding, in conjunction with temperature continuity at the land-atmosphere interface, uncovers a physical linkage between sensible and ground heat flux. The proposed relationship and its ramification for estimation of latent heat flux are validated based on daily averaged data from six AmeriFlux eddy covariance stations in North America over a wide range of land covers and climate regimes.

AB This paper shows how an exact analytical solution for the transient-state spatial moments of the cross-sectional average tracer concentration in large open channel flows can be derived from the depth-averaged advection-diffusion equation resorting to the method of Green's functions, without any simplifying assumption about the regularity of the actual concentration field, the smallness of the fluctuations, or the large space-time scale of variation of the average concentration gradient (justifying the a priori localization of the problem), which were the basis of the classic Taylor dispersion theory. The results reveal that in agreement with the findings by Aris (1956) and later by others for flows within a conduit, there are an initial centroid displacement and a variance deficit dependent on the specific position and dimension of the initial injection. The second central moment asymptotically tends to the linearly increasing function predictable on the basis of Taylor's classic theory, and the skewness, which is constantly zero for the cross-sectionally uniform injection, in the case of nonuniform initial distributions tends to slowly vanish after having reached a maximum. Thus, the persistent asymmetry exhibited by the field concentration data, as well as the retardations and the accelerations in the peak trajectory, can be justified without making any a priori assumption about the physical mechanism underlying their appearance, like transient storage phenomena, just by rigorously solving the governing equation for the cross-sectional average concentration in the presence of nonuniform, asymmetrically located solute injections.

AB To better understand water and energy cycles in forests over years to decades, measurements of spatial and long-term temporal variability in evapotranspiration (E-a) are needed. In mountainous terrain, plot level measurements are important to achieving this. Forest inventory data including tree density and size measurements, often collected repeatedly over decades, sample the variability occurring within the geographic and topographic range of specific forest types. Using simple allometric relationships, tree stocking and size data can be used to estimate variables including sapwood area index (SAI), which may be strongly correlated with annual E-a. This study analysed plot-level variability in SAI and its relationship with overstorey and understorey transpiration, interception and evaporation over a 670 m elevation gradient, in non-water-limited, even-aged stands of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. to determine how well spatial variation in annual Ea from forests can be mapped using SAI.
   Over the 3 year study, mean sap velocity in five E. regnans stands was uncorrelated with overstorey sapwood area index (SAI) or elevation: annual transpiration was predicted well by SAI (R-2 0.98). Overstorey and total annual interception were positively correlated with SAI (R-2 0.90 and 0.75). E-a from the understorey was strongly correlated with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and net radiation (R-n) measured just above the understorey, but relationships between understorey E-a and VPD and R-n differed between understorey types and understorey annual E-a was not correlated with SAI.
   Annual total E-a was also strongly correlated with SAI: the relationship being similar to two previous studies in the same region, despite differences in stand age and species. Thus, spatial variation in annual E-a can be reliably mapped using measurements of SAI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface area is an important input parameter for reactive transport modelling and it changes with time when rocks dissolve. Here we show direct observations of increased surface area due to chalk (predominantly CaCO3) dissolution, using 3D in situ X-ray microtomography. This transient increase cannot be explained by changes in fluid accessibility or by surface roughening that arises from preferential leaching. We use model simulations to explain how this increase in surface area correlates with the size of the Damkohler space, defined macroscopically using a phenomenological dissolution rate law and the cumulative surface of the microstructure. We attribute this transient increase to the coupling between fluid flow and mineral dissolution and argue that the extent is determined by the advective penetration distance of the reactants. We conclude that using a macroscopic dimensionless number as a qualitative indicator for microstructure evolution has limited applicability.

TI Complementary relationship with a convective boundary layer model to
   estimate regional evaporation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SENSIBLE HEAT; VEGETATION; TEMPERATURE; SURFACES; DESERT; HEIFE
AB An idea to use a simple convective boundary layer (CBL) model in the complementary relationship to estimate regional evaporation was explored. The CBL model simulated the potential specific humidity deficit D in CBL when the bulk stomatal resistance r(st) = 0. This value of D was then used in the Penman-type equation to derive evaporation E-po that would occur with ample soil moisture under the prevailing weather condition. The same equation was also used to produce the potential evaporation E with the actual humidity deficit, and these E-p and E-po values allowed the evaluation of the actual evaporation E by applying the complementary relationship E = etaE(po) - E-p,, where eta is assumed as 2.0. This was tested with the data set obtained in Hexi Corn desert area in northwestern China with a modified version of a simple CBL model developed by Lhomme [1997]. It was found that the method produced better estimates of the daytime mean E values with smaller bias than those obtained from a conventional application of the complementary relationship without the CBL model. Also, it was shown that the assumption of eta = 2.0 in the complementary relationship was only approximate in most cases. To take this into account, an additional procedure was explored in which eta was treated as a variable, and an iteration process with the CBL model determined the final 77 and E values. It was found that this process produced E values that have smaller systematic error and agree better with the measurements on average, but the unsystematic error got worse than that found with 77 = 2.0, probably because of use of the CBL model with r(st) not equal 0 in the iteration process.

AB Rainfall is a key driver of geomorphological processes ranging from impacting drops that lead to the small-scale dislodgement of soil particles to large-scale morphogenic floods and rainfall-induced hillslope processes. Although rainfall has been identified in seismic records, the associated power spectral density and its quantitative relation to the underlying physical processes have not yet been studied. Here, we analyze nearly 2 years of combined seismic and optical disdrometer measurements, where the latter enables the drop-based quantification of rainfall physical properties. Our measurements confirm the broadband observation of ground velocity power spectral density due to rainfall, allowing the seismic identification of rainfall at intensities as low as 1 mm/h. Seismic power, P, shows a power-law scaling with rainfall intensity, I, and kinetic energy, E: P proportional to I-2.1 and P proportional to E-1.6. The observed scaling relations are consistent between the three monitored sites although there are absolute differences in seismic power of about 1 order of magnitude, which are likely due to variability in landcover and subsurface seismic properties. With a physical model, we demonstrate that the observed power-law relations are set by an underlying linear relation between seismic power and rainfall impulse power, and that the associated exponent values of I and E are due to the covariance of the raindrop size distribution with the total number of drops. The largest raindrop fractions, whose relative contribution increases with rainfall intensity, dominate the seismic signal where, in our case, 90% of the seismic power is attributed to drops larger than 3 mm. Using our model, we estimate the contributing area of rainfall to seismic observations to be within a radial distance of -5-25 m. The spatially integrated nature of the seismic measurements and their sensitivity to large raindrops, which control the disaggregation and the mobilization of soil particles, make seismic records well-suited for the investigation of soil erosion processes. More generally, our work provides a basis for the temporally-resolved seismic quantification of rainfall that drives the dynamics of various hydro-geomorphological processes.

AB The extreme variability of rainfall over huge ranges of space-time scales makes direct rain gauge measurements of areal rainfall impossible; assumptions about the rainfall scaling-whether trivial (homogeneous), or multifractal (heterogeneous)are required even for interpolation. The alternative is to use rain surrogates such as radar reflectivities or those based on visible-infra red radiances. In this paper, we argue that cloud radiances should be studied to obtain basic information about the range and type of scaling in the atmosphere. Since, rain and clouds are strongly non-linearly coupled-and since the scaling of the fields, the scale invariance of the generators/exponents is a symmetry principle-a break in the scaling in one of the fields would cause a break in the other. Using 909 images from three satellites and six sensors (visible and infra red) collectively spanning the range of scales 5000-1 km, we demonstrate that power law scaling is respected to within an error of +/- 0.3-0.5%; that an upper bound on the deviations from the theoretical universal multifractal scaling is 1-2% per octave in scale. We also show that the outer scale of the cascade is very close to 20,000 km, the largest great circle distance on the earth. Allowing for (one-parameter) subpower law (logarithmic) scaling corrections we show that universal multifractal cascades starting at this scale explain the isotropic moments (order <= 1.6) to within an error of +/- 0.8%. We argue that the scaling of these isotropic statistics shows that the diversity of cloud morphologies reflects differences in anisotropies which are effectively washed out by the isotropic statistical methods used. We compare and contrast existing multifractal models showing which can be used as realistic cloud and rain models. We go on to use continuous in scale, anisotropic, space-time multifractal rain and cloud simulations (including radiative transfer) to show how diverse cloud, rain and radiance morphologies can be compatible with the observed isotropic scaling statistics. Finally, we argue that these will be necessary for solving measurement problems including the use of rain gauge, radar and visible/infra red surrogate fields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rainfall and runoff data collected from plots (108 m(2)) at 1-min intervals allow accurate determination of the time difference between peak rainfall intensity and peak runoff rate. Manning's equation for fully turbulent flows implies that a power function can be used to characterize the relationship between the lag time and peak runoff rate. An exponent close to -0.4 would validate the Manning's equation for overland flow and the coefficient can then be used to estimate the roughness coefficient (Manning's n) during natural storm events. The relationship between the observed lag time and peak runoff rate was investigated for three different surface treatments on a loamy sand: (a) bare fallow, (b) farmers' practice-pineapple beds with bare furrows constructed across the slope, and (c) furrows covered with mulch from residues of previous pineapple crops. Manning's equation was found to be applicable for these treatments and Manning's n is consistently between 0.04 and 0.06. The relationship between lag time and peak runoff rate can be used to model runoff hydrographs at the plot scale. The effect of mulch cover on flow resistance was found to be minimal. Velocity measurements using a dye tracing technique at the same site showed similar results, although the estimated Manning's n was lower. Resistance to flow was significantly increased only when fresh pineapple leaves from a growing pineapple crop were in contact with the soil.

AB The relationship between the distributed transient storage (TS) and lumped aggregate dead zone (ADZ) models of longitudinal solute transport in rivers and streams is examined by a parallel application to tracer data and through an investigation of parameter relationships. Both models accurately describe observed solute transport in a stream where the effects of storage or dead zones significantly affect longitudinal dispersion. A moment matching technique, based on theoretical temporal moments, is used to develop parameter relationships. Tests using the previously calibrated parameters, in addition to simulation experiments, show that the moment matching procedure allows ADZ model parameters to be reliably derived from TS model parameters and vice versa. An investigation of these parameter relationships reveals an important difference between the effective solute transport velocity and the average reach flow velocity in streams subject to transient storage or dead zone processes. A number of practical uses for the derived relationships are suggested, including the ability to utilize powerful methods of system identification in the estimation of TS model parameters.

AB This paper applies a continuous simulation approach to the estimation of flood frequency for a dam site in a large catchment (1186 km(2)) in the Czech Republic. The models used allow for the simulation of both high intensity and low intensity rainfall events. and snowmelt events, over subcatchments in contributing to the flood frequency distribution. The methodology is implemented within a Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation framework that allows for uncertainty in the model parameters and for the realisation effect in reproducing the apparent statistics of potential flood events represented by the short series of observations. A fuzzy rules method is used to evaluate each model run, based on the available observations of peak discharges. flow duration curves and snow water equivalents. This yields a combined likelihood measure that is used to weight the flood predictions for each behavioural parameter set. The cumulative distribution for flood peaks for any chosen probability of exceedence over all behavioural models can then be estimated. This can be used to assess the risk of a potential flood peak (or duration or volume) within a risk based dam safety assessment. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multivariate stochastic generation model for daily weather variables is proposed that extends the multivariate k-nearest neighbor resampling approach (MKNN). Major drawbacks of the MKNN approach include repetitive historical multivariate patterns, underestimating variance and serial correlation, and reshuffling of historical data. These drawbacks cause under-generation of events that are extreme in their frequency and magnitude. In this study, these drawbacks are addressed by applying a stochastic optimization technique (i.e., a genetic algorithm (GA)) and a perturbation using a gamma kernel density estimate (GKDE). The competitive selection operator in the GA was used to better preserve the historical variance and serial correlation as well as to produce unprecedented multivariate patterns. By employing the GKDE, the resampled precipitation data are perturbed, and thus new precipitation values are generated. To preserve the distribution of the annual maximum events fitted to a general extreme value (GEV), the GKDE bandwidth was selected by employing the statistics of the historical annual maximum. The proposed method was applied to generate six daily weather variables (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, dew point temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and precipitation) of the summer season (June-September) for a station in Seoul, South Korea. The presented results indicate that the suggested weather generator is an appropriate alternative for generating daily weather variables while reproducing the historical extreme distribution.

AB The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) is an essential effective parameter for the development of improved distributed hydrological models and area-differentiated risk assessment of chemical leaching. Basic soil properties such as the particle size distribution or, more recently, air permeability are commonly used to estimate Ksat. Conversely, links to soil gas diffusivity (DPDo) have not been fully explored even though gas diffusivity is intimately linked to the connectivity and tortuosity of the soil pore network. Based on measurements for a coarse sandy soil, potential relationships between K-sat and D-p/D-o were investigated. A total of 84 undisturbed soil cores were extracted from the topsoil of a field site, and D-P/D-o and K-sat were measured in the laboratory. Water-induced and solids-induced tortuosity factors were obtained by applying a two-parameter D-P/D-o model to measured data, and subsequently linked to the cementation exponent of the well-established Revil and Cathles predictive model for saturated hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, a two-parameter model, analogue to the Kozeny-Carman equation, was developed for the K-sat - D-p/D-o, relationship. All analyses implied strong and fundamental relationships between K-sat and D-p/D-o. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increases in extreme drought events and channel alteration challenge the existing reservoir operation rules. Therefore, reservoir operation should be reconsidered to accommodate these challenges. A conflict resolution model for reservoir operation considering the decision-makers' preference is developed for the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation in dry seasons under channel alteration, to achieve the goal of meeting minimum environmental flow, landslide stability, and river-lake connection constraints. This model with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the Yangtze River. The results show that minimum navigation discharge for the post-dam period is greater than that for the pre-dam period, indicating channel alteration. Both average hydropower generation benefit and navigation reliability decrease with modification of the post-dam minimum navigation discharge, signifying the adverse effect of damming. The total benefits of navigation and hydropower generation decrease with the exceedance probability. A higher hydropower generation benefit leads to a smaller navigation benefit, reflecting the conflict of interest. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed conflict resolution model, as well as the navigation benefit-quantifying method and applicability to similar water resources management problems.

AB With ignorance and potential surprise dominating decision making in water resources, a framework for dealing with such uncertainty is a critical need in hydrology. We operationalize the 'potential surprise' criterion proposed by Shackle, Vickers, and Katzner (SVK) to derive decision rules to manage water resources under uncertainty and ignorance. We apply this framework to managing water supply systems in Bangladesh that face severe, naturally occurring arsenic contamination. The uncertainty involved with arsenic in water supplies makes the application of conventional analysis of decision-making ineffective. Given the uncertainty and surprise involved in such cases, we find that optimal decisions tend to favor actions that avoid irreversible outcomes instead of conventional cost-effective actions. We observe that a diversification of the water supply system also emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes of water contamination. Shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level (36%) compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had allocation levels of roughly 32% under each. The approach can be applied in a variety of other cases that involve decision making under uncertainty and surprise, a frequent situation in natural resources management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The stage-discharge relationship is one of the frequently used methods for continuous river flow measurement. In the management of water resources and flood control, the accuracy of the rating curve is a key priority. Various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage-discharge curves in open channels, including the model of Ahmadi et al. (2017) in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level. In the present study, a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi-objective optimization. To this end, multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross-section. The unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) approach. The validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross-sections. Results showed a close agreement between the estimated and observed data. In the next step, the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the previous model using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results demonstrated that the proposed model was more efficient than the previous one.

AB We characterize key features of subsurface flow paths relying on an energetic and probabilistic perspective. We consider subsurface flow in a free aquifer system as mainly ruled by gravity, the latter acting as the key driving force. Therefore, we study groundwater circulation relying upon stochastic simulations of aquifer bottom topography inferred from stratigraphic observations. Upon resting on the concept of optimal channel networks, we identify Preferential Groundwater Networks (PGNs) as spatially organized structures carved by locally following the steepest gradient associated with the aquifer bottom topography. A probabilistic description of PGNs is obtained by reconstructing the aquifer bottom topography as a spatial random field conditional on the available information, and using diverse area threshold values for PGNs delineation. We find that PGNs inferred from the (ensemble) averaged bottom topography with the highest area threshold considered are strikingly consistent with main flow directions and key subsurface flow patterns inferred from available piezometric data. The probabilistic distribution of PGNs is also consistent with geological and hydrogeological information at our disposal, such as geological data (and ensuing hydrogeological sections), and is coherent with the nature of the aquifers investigated.

AB This paper proposes a fuzzy entropy-based methodology for optimal design and performance assessment of a hydrometric monitoring network that provides information essential for hydrological studies. The methodology does not require choice of bin size for discretization of data to estimate entropy measures/indices. Therefore, it alleviates the uncertainty associated with bin size estimation which is a concern in analysis with conventional Shannon entropy-based methodology (SEBM). Advantage of the proposed methodology over SEBM and its related theoretical improvement EEBM (exponential entropy-based methodology) in arriving at optimal design of streamflow monitoring network is demonstrated through performance investigation on Mahanadi basin of India, which is frequently prone to floods. Following this, the methodology is used to assess the performance of streamflow monitoring networks in 16 river basins of Peninsular India and identify stream gauge deficit zones. This study is first of its kind which evaluates the effect of different entropy estimation methods and bin size estimation rules on: (i) prioritization of stream gauge stations for their importance in data collection, (ii) identification of stream gauge deficit zones, and (iii) design of optimal hydrometric network in a river basin. Proposed methodology appears promising and offers scope for application to networks monitoring various other hydrometeorological variables.

AB Riverine ecosystem protection requires the maintenance of natural flow and sediment regimes downstream from dams. In reservoir management schedules this requirement should be integrated with sedimentation control and human water supply. However, traditional eco-friendly reservoir operating methods have usually only considered the natural flow regime. This paper seeks to develop a reservoir operating method that accounts for both the natural flow and sediment regimes as well as optimizing the water supply allocations. Herein, reservoir water level (RWL), sediment-occupied ratio of reservoir volume (SOR) and rate of change of SOR (RCSOR) are adopted as three triggers of a drawdown-flushing-based sediment management policy. Two different groups of reservoir operating rule curves (RORCs) are designed for sediment-flushing and non-sediment-flushing years, and the three triggers, RWL, SOR and RCSOR, are used to change the "static" RORCs to "dynamic" ones. The approach is applied to the Wangkuai Reservoir, China to test its effectiveness. This shows that the approach can improve the flexibility of reservoir operators to balance the reservoir management, water supply management and the flow and sediment needs of the downstream riverine ecosystem.

AB The goal of the paper is to present a model for generating daily precipitation time series and its applications to two climatologically different areas. The rainfall is modeled as stochastic process coupled to atmospheric circulation. Rainfall is linked to the circulation patterns using conditional model parameters. Any kind of circulation pattern classification can be used for this purpose. In this study a new fuzzy rule based method of circulation patterns classification was used, The advantage of this classification technique is the fact that in contrast to common circulation patterns classifications its objective is to explain the variability of local precipitation. It means that the circulation patterns explain the relation between large-scale atmospheric circulation and surface climate (precipitation). Therefore the circulation patterns obtained by this classification method are suitable as input for the subsequent precipitation downscaling. The model was successfully applied in two regions with different climate conditions: Central Europe (Germany) and Eastern Mediterranean (Greece). Several tests like comparison of mean seasonal cycles, comparison of mean values and deviations of yearly totals and other standard diagnostics showed that simulated values agree fairly well with historical data.

AB Streamflow prediction is a challenging task due to the different processes involved in streamflow generation. These different processes have different characteristics of the relationships between hydro-meteorological variables and streamflow, which make it a challenging task to develop single data-driven stream flow prediction models that can map the input-output relationships for all different streamflow regimes. To improve the performance of streamflow prediction, we proposed a flow-regime-dependent approach to map the relationships between hydro-meteorological variables and streamflow based on hydro-meteorological condition classification. This approach integrates the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and therefore referred to as the LASSO-FCM-DBN approach. This approach employs LASSO to select the hydro-meteorological variables which have a significant impact on streamflow, FCM to identify different streamflow regimes, and DBN as a data-driven model to map the nonlinear and complex relationships between the selected hydro-meteorological variables and streamflow within different flow regimes. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, two comparative studies were carried out - 1) the multivariable FCM was compared to the traditional single-variable threshold-based method; and 2) the performance of the DBN was compared to a traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model. Two stations in the Tennessee River, USA were used as the case study. The results demonstrate that the performance of the multivariable-based FCM classification method is better and more stable than the traditional threshold-based single-variable method, due to the sensitivity of the single-variable method to different threshold values. In addition, DBNs performed better than traditional ANNs in all three statistical measures considered. Overall, the LASSO-FCM-DBN multi-model system significantly improved the performance of streamflow prediction and is therefore a valuable tool for water resources management and planning.

ID HEAD FLUCTUATIONS; GROUNDWATER; OCEAN; FLOWS
AB The aim of this work is to develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of groundwater head oscillations commonly observed in bores near boundaries of surface water bodies that are subject to periodic variations in stage height. Restricting attention to the linear groundwater flow equation, the dynamics of head variations induced by periodic modes acting at boundaries are governed by a complex-valued time-independent equation parameterized by the modal frequency of interest. For randomly heterogeneous aquifers the hydraulic conductivity field may be regarded as a spatial random variable. Stochastic relationships between the conductivity spectrum and the induced head oscillation spectrum are generated from a stochastic perturbation approach. Spatial correlative relationships are derived for several stochastic models incorporating up to three spatial dimensions. Explicit calculations of head oscillation autocovariances and spectral densities are parameterized by conductivity statistics, including integral scale and variance, and by modal frequency. The results show that time domain head responses to periodic boundary forcing are strongly dependent on multidimensional effects and on spatial correlation structure. Computational simulations show that the stochastic variance estimators match simulated head fluctuation variances for a range of modal frequencies and aquifer diffusivities and that joint inversion of conductivity integral scale and variance is possible with moderate numbers of sampling points.

AB Flood frequency analyses (FFAs) are needed for flood risk management. Many methods exist ranging from classical purely statistical approaches to more complex approaches based on process simulation. The results of these methods are associated with uncertainties that are sometimes difficult to estimate due to the complexity of the approaches or the number of parameters, especially for process simulation. This is the case of the simulation-based FFA approach called SHYREG presented in this paper, in which a rainfall generator is, coupled with a simple rainfall-runoff model in an attempt to estimate the uncertainties due to the estimation of the seven parameters needed to estimate flood frequencies. The six parameters of the rainfall generator are mean values, so their theoretical distribution is known and can be used to estimate the generator uncertainties. In contrast, the theoretical distribution of the single hydrological model parameter is unknown; consequently, a bootstrap method is applied to estimate the calibration uncertainties. The propagation of uncertainty from the rainfall generator to the hydrological model is also taken into account. This method is applied to 1112 basins throughout France. Uncertainties coming from the SHYREG method and from purely statistical approaches are compared, and the results are discussed according to the length of the recorded observations, basin size and basin location. Uncertainties of the SHYREG method decrease as the basin size increases or as the length of the recorded flow increases. Moreover, the results show that the confidence intervals of the SHYREG method are relatively small despite the complexity of the method and the number of parameters (seven). This is due to the stability of the parameters and takes into account the dependence of uncertainties due to the rainfall model and the hydrological calibration. Indeed, the uncertainties on the flow quantiles are on the same order of magnitude as those associated with the use of a statistical law with two parameters (here generalised extreme value Type I distribution) and clearly lower than those associated with the use of a three-parameter law (here generalised extreme value Type II distribution). For extreme flood quantiles, the uncertainties are mostly due to the rainfall generator because of the progressive saturation of the hydrological model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural soils and aquifers are inherently heterogenous and chemical transport through them is anomalous characterized by an early arrival followed by a persistent tail. How to describe such anomalous phenomena has been an interest and, as a result, a number of approaches have been proposed over the past few decades. Among others, the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) is a model able to describe anomalous transport when the dispersion is regional rather than local as presumed in the classical advection-dispersion equation. Practical application of FADE needs numerical solutions, which is challenging because its spatial discretization gives rise to a full coefficient matrix. In this paper, we propose a Lattice Boltzmann model to solve the two-dimensional FADE. Given that the anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers is hydrodynamic and caused by spatial variation in water velocity across the pore space and that the chemical plume spreads preferentially along the mean water-flow direction, the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative should be both anisotropic. The anisotropies are solved by the two-relaxation time Lattice Boltzmann model using different relaxation parameters in different directions. Compared with existing numerical methods for the FADE, the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit, second-order accurate in both time and space, mass-conservative, and free of numerical dispersion; its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient. We verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate Cl- movement in a tracer experiment conducted on an up-catchment hillslope. The results show that the FADE with backward skewness can reproduce the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment.

AB Multiple optima seriously confine the solution accuracy of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) for non-concave maximization models of reservoir operation. To address the problem, a two-stage optimization algorithm combining traversing and search is proposed to obtain an optimal decision at each state combination. Single or multiple promising regions where a local optimal solution may exist are identified through coarse traversing in the whole feasible region, and a local search algorithm is used to local optimization in each promising region. Energy maximization model is used to analyze the multiple optima problem and test the method. In the model, quadratic and concave penalty functions are used to address the total power constraint for smaller shortages and fewer shortage periods respectively. The total power constraint increases the probability of multiple local optima existence and intensifies the difficulty in finding optimal decisions. The proposed model and method are applied to the cascaded reservoir system on middle-lower Lancang River in China. Numerical results show that the total power constraint is well addressed, the computing time can be reduced by more than 50% using the two-stage algorithm in getting operating rules with similar performance comparing to only traversing, and the multi-point search algorithm is superior to traversing and single point search in solving the proposed model.

AB Many applications in support of water management decisions require hydrodynamic models with limited calculation time, including real time control of river flooding, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses by Monte-Carlo simulations, and long term simulations in support of the statistical analysis of the model simulation results (e.g. flood frequency analysis). Several computationally efficient hydrodynamic models exist, but little attention is given to the modelling of floodplains. This paper presents a methodology that can emulate output from a full hydrodynamic model by predicting one or several levels in a floodplain, together with the flow rate between river and floodplain. The overtopping of the embankment is modelled as an overflow at a weir. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) are exploited to cope with the varying factors affecting the flow. Different input sets and identification methods are considered in model construction. Because of the dual use of simplified physically based equations and data-driven techniques, the ANFIS consist of very few rules with a low number of input variables. A second calculation scheme can be followed for exceptionally large floods. The obtained nominal emulation model was tested for four floodplains along the river Dender in Belgium. Results show that the obtained models are accurate with low computational cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is straightforward to obtain an approximation of the matrix of sensitivity coefficients of hydraulic head response at a set of calibration data Locations to the values of permeability at each model cell. The approximate system of sensitivities consists of an indicator matrix of zeros and ones flagging locations of significant parameter sensitivity, with the appropriate sign. A rules-based approach for determining the required parameter sensitivity information is based upon: (1) delineation of flowpaths through the calibration head data, (2) transformation of the permeability field into a binary categorical variable in order to define relatively high-transmissivity and tow-permeability geobodies, and (3) identification of geobody connections to source or sink terms. A comparison with traditionally-computed exact sensitivity coefficients demonstrates the completeness of the approximate system of coefficients and that their use in iterative model calibration codes is feasible. The merit of this study is not only in demonstrating a relatively simple assessment of permeability sensitivity to hydraulic head, but also to provide a general. understanding of these sensitivity coefficients. Visualizing the Jacobian matrix reveals the physically-intuitive criteria that govern the structure of the sensitivity coefficients and precisely identifies which criteria affect the sensitivity of the hydraulic head response to the permeability field.

TI Potentials and their role in transport in porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSATURATED FLOW THEORY; CAPILLARY; WATER
AB The concept of ''capillary,'' or ''matric,'' potentials is commonly used in soil physics to describe water movement in unsaturated soils. The rigorous definition of these and other potentials is presented from fundamental thermodynamic principles at the microscopic level and extended to the macroscopic level by averaging over a representative elementary volume. Of special interest is the treatment of adsorptive surface forces and their associated potentials. Porous medium potentials are extended to a domain containing multiple fluid phases and multiple components. A macroscopic motion equation for a fluid phase (Darcy's law) is derived, incorporating the effect of potentials and surface forces. It relates advective fluxes to gradients of macroscopic chemical potentials and temperature. It reduces to the usual form of Darcy's law only when the aqueous phase is sufficiently dilute and temperatures are uniform. Kelvin's law, which relates relative humidity to matric potential, is extended to the case of multiple multicomponent fluid phases in a porous medium domain. The concept of ''irreducible'' (or ''residual'') wetting fluid saturation and its relationship to capillary pressure, surface forces, and the Gibbs chemical potential, are discussed. Common methods for determining the matric potential are reexamined in light of this work.

AB Variation diagrams are revisited from a compositional perspective. An alternative, consistent with the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, is proposed. The new multiple binary diagrams compare a reference balance, b(1), fixed on the x-axis, and a set of secondary balances, b(2), on the y-axis. The diagrams fulfill compositional principles of invariance under change of scale, guaranteeing consistency of interpretations and working better than diagrams based on raw concentrations of chemical species. The new diagrams allow us to investigate the nature of compositional changes, and inform about the elements or chemical species responsible for the variation when data are a priori ranked following some compositional (or non-compositional) criteria. An application example using the chemistry of large rivers illustrates the procedure. Data are extracted from the Global Register of river inputs, which contains the water quality of about 550 rivers having exorheic basins exceeding 10, 000 km(2) and water discharge exceeding 10 km(3)/yr. The chemistry of only 55 large rivers of the world (in mu mol/L, content of HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and SiO2(aq) as well as their discharge values are considered. The choice is based on the completeness of analytical data and representativeness with respect to water/rocks interaction processes. Results indicate that only the balances b(1)(Ca2+) and b(2)(HCO3-) have a high, significant correlation. They are the only two chemical components able to trace weathering processes on this large scale. On the contrary, large data scattering is found in all other cases, indicating a higher sensibility to different environmental parameters, like local lithology, climate or pollution. When all the balances are analyzed as a function of discharge values very low correlation is found, indicating that the chemostatic behavior appears to be a common condition. When samples are ranked for increasing values of b(1)(Ca2+), or alternatively by discharge values, the statistical investigation of chemical changes reveals interesting features of the analyzed compositions.

AB Vegetation activities sensitively response to topological conditions and a changing climate. To better understand vegetation dynamics under varying environmental conditions, we analyze observations of vegetation indices, Land Surface Temperature (LST), air temperature, and precipitation of a Korean forest over an 11 year period from year 2000 to 2010. While a positive relationship between EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LST is established for all seasons, independent of elevation, the EVI-LST relationship exhibits a threshold above which the rate of EVI increase over LST increase changes significantly. This transitional point is associated with the condition that the air temperature triggers the start of the growing season. The EVI-LST relationship above the threshold exhibits a hysteresis loop, i.e., rising limb differs from falling limb. We identify two types of hysteresis patterns, i.e., a single loop and a twisted loop. The variation in loop width between the ascending and descending paths contains a signature in annual precipitation of concurrent year. In our analysis, annual precipitation above 1600 mm is associated with LST difference more than 5 degrees C in the loop width. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes genetic programming (GP) as a new approach for the explicit formulation of daily suspended sediment-discharge relationship. Empirical relations such as sediment rating curves are often applied to determine the average relationship between discharge and suspended sediment load. This type of models generally underestimates or overestimates the amount of sediment. During recent decades, some black box models based on artificial neural networks have been developed to overcome this problem. But these type of models are implicit that can not be simply used by other investigators. Therefore it is still necessary to develop an explicit model for the discharge-sediment relationship. It is aimed in this study, to develop an explicit model based on genetic programming. Explicit models obtained using the GP are compared with rating curves and multi-linear regression techniques in suspended sediment toad estimation. The daily streamflow and suspended sediment data from two stations on Tongue River in Montana are used as case studies. The results indicate that the proposed GP formulation performs quite welt compared to sediment rating curves and multi-linear regression models and is quite practical for use. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is of primary interest to determine the extent that natural processes are linked to understand natural system dynamics. There is growing interest in investigating the coupling and coevolution occurring between natural processes and the interaction between natural systems. Soil moisture is a variable that is at the core of the interaction between multiple physical and biological processes; therefore, it is very important to understand the influence of soil moisture dynamics on that coevolution. Soil moisture memory (SMM) shows soil moisture dynamics and the nature of their interaction with other related processes.
   Several studies have recognized that SMM depends on soil properties and some other meteorological and biophysical variables; however, there has not been a study specifically devoted to studying the relationship between SMM and the main soil properties. The present study analyzes the relationship between several relevant soil properties (texture, bulk density and organic matter content) involved in soil water dynamics and the stored precipitation fraction (F-p) as a suitable expression of the SMM. The relationship between SMM and precipitation and soil water content was also analyzed. These relationships were analyzed both at the surface layer and at several soil layer depths and with four soil moisture sampling frequencies (3 and 12 h, and 1 and 3 days). The study was conducted with data collected over a period of 12 years, at two soil moisture monitoring networks (REMEDHUS and SCAN) located in Spain and the USA, respectively, covering a wide range of soil characteristics and environmental conditions.
   The results showed that soil texture plays the main role in understanding SMM dynamics and that organic matter content has a good relationship with F-p. The sand fraction is the variable more correlated with Fp, with a clear inverse relationship (correlation coefficient, from -0.62 to -0.92 in REMEDHUS, and from -0.65 to -0.76 in SCAN). The variations in F-p observed with the different soil layer depths are also mainly correlated with texture and organic matter content, but only for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days. The temporal variability of F-p in the different soil layers is more correlated with the soil water content than with annual precipitation, especially in the surface layer. At 0-5 depth, R ranges between 0.42 and 0.82. For sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days, the R values between Fp and mean soil moisture are always significant (p < 0.01) and higher than 0.66 in all soil layers. Therefore, in view of the cases studied and the results obtained, the most critical aspect of understanding SMM dynamics is precise characterization of the water storage conditions, especially in terms of texture and organic matter content.

AB In this paper an attempt is made to show that the performance of daily river flow forecasting is improved when data-preprocessing techniques are used with computational intelligence methods. Especially for forecasting longer lead-times, one of the inherent problems in all forecasting methods is that the reliability of forecasting decreases with increasing the lead-time. Therefore wavelet multi-resolution analysis is coupled with artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) which are two promising methods for forecasting nonlinear and non-stationary time series. Different models with a combination of the different input data sets are developed for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days ahead forecasting in Harvey River, Western Australia. Daubechies and Symlet wavelets are used to decompose river flow time series to different levels. Hybrid wavelet neural networks (WNN) models are trained using Levenberg-Marquart (LM) algorithm and the wavelet neuro-fuzzy (WNF) models with subtractive clustering method to find the optimum number of fuzzy rules. Comparing the results with those of the original ANN and ANFIS models indicates that the hybrid models produce significantly better results, especially for the peak values and longer lead-times.

AB This study examines the response of a complex lake-wetland system to variations in climate. The focus is on the lakes and wetlands of the Prairie Coteau, which is part of the larger Prairie Pothole Region of the Central Plains of North America. Information on lake size was enumerated from satellite images and aerial photos and yielded power law relationships for different hydrological conditions. Of particular interest is a recent drought and deluge sequence, 1988-1992 and 1993-1998. Results showed that lake sizes followed well-defined power laws that changed intra-annually and interannually as a function of climate. The power laws for spring seasons in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1997, and 2002 have a relatively constant slope. However, slopes changed with time within each year. These lines produced from Landsat images and aerial photos describe a systematic variation in sizes for lakes ranging in area from 100 m(2) to more than 30,000 m(2). This tendency for lake size to follow a power law coupled with area measurement from aerial photos taken on 29 July 1939 provides a basis for reconstructing the distribution of pothole lakes in summer 1939, near the end of the Dust Bowl drought. The study shows that the areas of smaller lakes are profoundly affected seasonally by the spring snowmelt and evaporation. The areas of larger lakes are influenced more slowly by longer-term periods of drought and deluge.

ID WATER-LEVEL CHANGES; LARGE EARTHQUAKES; FAULT ZONE; PERMEABILITY
AB Hydroseismograms reflect the oscillations of well water levels caused by seismic waves. In this study, the relationships between the hydroseismogram oscillation amplitude and three factors (seismic magnitude, epicentral distance, and focal depth) in Jingle well, China were analyzed. The results revealed that hydroseismogram amplitude increases exponentially with seismic magnitude as H-mag = (7.848 x 10(-8)) x e((2.1690xm)) + 0.047(m > Mw5.8) (m - seismic magnitude), decreases exponentially with epicentral distance as H-dis = (-2.1108 x 10(-5)) x e((2.3864x gamma)) + 0.011 (gamma - epicentral distance), and decreases exponentially with focal depth as H-dep = (-1.6438 x 10(-3)) x e((0.0254xd)) -0.203 (d is focal depth). However, these relationships become uncertain when the epicentral distance exceeds 4000 km and are not applicable to nuclear explosions. Based upon the single well-aquifer model constructed for Jingle well, the amplification (mu) of the water level oscillation by ground vibrations (mu = A(b)/A(a)= R-2 -R-2/r(2)) depends on the frequency of the water-level oscillations. For relatively high-frequency oscillations (caused by earthquakes with relatively small epicentral distances), the amplification will be small, while for low-frequency oscillations (caused by earthquakes with relatively large epicentral distances), the amplification will be large. Using the S-transform, the dominant hydroseismogram period increases with the epicentral distance as tau = 0.5826 x gamma + 12.51, which means that the amplification (mu) increases with the epicentral distance. Of course, the amplitude of ground oscillations will be greatly attenuated with increasing epicentral distance. Due to the anisotropy of the earth and seismic wave superposition, the relationships between the hydroseismogram amplitude and the seismic magnitude, epicentral distance, and focal depth become blurred or even uncertain with increasing epicentral distance and focal depth, leading to poor goodness-of-fit between the dominant hydroseismogram period and epicentral distance. The quantitative relationships between the hydroseismogram amplitude and the seismic magnitude, epicentral distance, and focal depth, which determine the ratio between the amplitudes of water-level oscillations and ground vibrations and the relationship between groundwater oscillations and seismic wave transmission, are proposed for the first time in the present work. These results will improve understanding of hydrogeological conditions and could also be important in identifying reliable earthquake precursors.

AB A critical issue facing groundwater flow models is the estimation of representative hydraulic conductivity assigned to the model units. In this study, an experiment-based, high-resolution hydraulic conductivity map offers a test case to evaluate this parameter. Various hydrogeological units are distinguished, each is of irregular shape with distinct heterogeneity pattern created by physical sedimentation. Extending a previous study which used numerical upscaling to compute equivalent conductivities for these units (at two upscaling scales) [Zhang, Y., Gable, C.W., Person, M., 2006. Equivalent hydraulic conductivity of an experimental stratigraphy - implications for basin-scale flow simulations. Water Resources Research 42, W05404. doi:10.1029/2005WR004720], this study compares them with local statistics and effective conductivities predicted by a stochastic theory. Results suggest that for a system with moderate lnK variance (4.07) and tow topographic slope (similar to 1 degrees), the arithmetic mean (K-A) provides a good estimate for the maximum principal component (K-max) of the equivalent conductivity. The minimum principal component (Kin) ties between the harmonic and geometric means: its closeness to the geometric mean is affected by heterogeneity pattern and upscating scale. Using K-max (alternatively, the arithmetic mean), geometric mean, and ln(K) variance, the stochastic theory predicts a K in that is consistent with the up-scated value. Similarly, knowing K-min, Kmax predicted by theory is also consistent with the up-scated value. For most deposits (some with variance greater than 1), a low-variance version of the theory is more accurate than a high-variance version. However, the increase of topographic slope (to similar to 4 degrees) and total lnK variance (to 16) result in increased deviation of K-max from K-A. High variance also results in significantly larger anisotropy ratio, possibly due to the dominance of preferential flow. Finally, for select units, equivalent conductivity exhibits scale effect. Field scale representative elementary volume thus does not exist and upscaling the full unit is necessary to obtain the representative conductivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Repeated dye tracer tests were undertaken from individual moulins at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, over a number of diurnal discharge cycles during the summers of 1989-1991. It was hoped to use the concepts of at-a-station hydraulic geometry to infer flow conditions in subglacial channels from the form of the velocity-discharge relationships derived from these tests. The results, however, displayed both clockwise and anticlockwise velocity-discharge hysteresis, in addition to the simple power function relationship assumed in the hydraulic geometry approach.
   Clockwise hysteresis seems to indicate that a moulin drains into a small tributary channel rather than directly into an arterial channel, and that discharges in the two channels vary out of phase with each other. Anticlockwise hysteresis is accompanied by strong diurnal variations in the value of dispersivity derived from the dye breakthrough curve, and is best explained by hydraulic damming of moulins or sub/englacial passageways.
   Despite the complex velocity-discharge relationships observed, some indication of subglacial flow conditions may be obtained if tributary channels comprise only a small fraction of the drainage path and power function velocity-discharge relationships are derived from dye injections conducted during periods when the supraglacial discharge entering the moulin and the bulk discharge vary in phase. Analyses based on this premise suggest that both open and closed channel flow occur beneath Haut Glacier d'Arolla, and that flow conditions are highly variable at and between sites.

AB Harmonic analysis is used to examine the impact of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on mean-monthly streamflow variability in Nepal. El Nino causes below normal streamflows in two core regions: the Western Region and the Eastern Region. La Nina produces above normal streamflows in only one core region: the Western Region. There is a stronger El Nino influence on streamflows compared to La Nina. A stronger overall ENSO impact in western Nepal than in eastern Nepal suggests an inverse relationship between El Nino streamflows and monsoon strength and a direct relationship between La Nina flows and monsoon strength.

AB This paper aims at quantifying the uncertainty on urban runoff associated with the unmeasured small scale rainfall variability, i.e. at a resolution finer than 1 km x 1 km x 5 min which is usually available with C-band radar networks. A case study is done on the 900 ha urban catchment of Cranbrook (London). A frontal and a convective rainfall event are analysed. An ensemble prediction approach is implemented, that is to say an ensemble of realistic downscaled rainfall fields is generated with the help of universal multifractals, and the corresponding ensemble of hydrographs is simulated. It appears that the uncertainty on the simulated peak flow is significant, reaching for some conduits 25% and 40% respectively for the frontal and the convective events. The flow corresponding the 90% quantile, the one simulated with radar distributed rainfall, and the spatial resolution are power law related. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present analytical and semi-analytical flow and transport models for 2D (x-z vertical plane) flow and particle transport in stratified rock of sedimentary type or vertically non-uniform bedrock aquifers, which are essentially phreatic. The main focus is on the flow induced by the areal discharge in watershed aquifers in hard-rock formations (e.g. granite, gneiss), the weathering profiles of which comprise two or more stratiform zones differing in hydraulic conductivity, k, which thus can be represented by a decay function of the vertical coordinate, i.e., the depth, k(z). Several models of depth-dependent hydraulic conductivity (stepwise, power-law, exponential) have been tested to show the sensitivity of groundwater flow paths and ages (transit or residence time distributions) to various geological and hydraulic simplifications related to rock heterogeneity. The mathematical setup handles the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation the validity of which, as well as the suggested solutions, were verified via comparison with numerical results obtained using MODFLOW-PMPATH packages.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID ACIDIFICATION; FISH
AB A modelling framework is presented which gives catchment-wide estimates of long-term stream water chemistry using complete spatial coverage of catchment characteristics combined with measurements of stream water chemistry at a limited number of sites. It has been developed for application to catchments having acid headwaters which are diluted downstream by less acid runoff, usually from improved agricultural land. The catchment is subdivided into landscape types based on land use, soils and other characteristics defined by existing national databases. Each landscape type is assumed to generate stream water having a characteristic annual mean concentration of chemical constituents. This concentration is estimated by regression analysis using measured stream water chemistry data from a number of subcatchments, knowing the proportion of each landscape type in each subcatchment. Catchment-wide stream water chemistry is estimated for conservative ions by mixing contributing area estimated loads. Concentrations of non-conservative ions are estimated using hydrochemical equilibrium equations constrained to give the acid neutralising capacity estimated from the conservative ions. The model is applied to the river Tywi, Wales and its performance investigated. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective soil thermal conductivity (lambda(eff)) is required by a variety of science and engineering studies and associated numerical simulations. Because water content is the dominant factor determining the magnitude of lambda(eff), modeling of lambda(eff) is usually based on the measured water content (theta) or degree of saturation (S-r). However, these approaches are largely soil dependent and no model was found for universal application. Prediction of lambda(eff) from energy states of soil water (i.e., psi, the matric potential or matric suction) provides a unique way that takes pore size and geometry of soil into account and the resultant lambda(eff)(psi) relationship is less sensitive to soil types compared to the lambda(eff)(theta) and lambda(eff) (S-r) relationships. The lambda(eff)(psi) relationship developed by McCumber and Pielke (1981) (MP1981) has been incorporated into over 10 land surface, climate or hydrological models for wide applications. But the MP1981 model was reported to give unreasonable estimates especially at low psi range. Lu a al. 2019 (LS2019) proposed an improved lambda(eff)(psi) model but limited to applications in high psi range. The objective of this study was to develop a new lambda(eff)(psi) model for applications across the full range of matric potential. Experimental measurements of lambda(eff)(psi) taken on 26 soils from four studies were used for the model development. A comparison of the new model with the MP1981, LS2019 and three other literature models showed the new model gave satisfactory estimates (RMSE < 0.2 W m(-1) degrees C-1, AD approximate to 0 W m(-1) degrees C-1 and NSE > 0.9) that outperformed all the other models. However, there is a lack of experimental measurements of lambda(eff)(psi) to further validate and calibrate this model. Future efforts on the measurement of lambda(eff)(psi) should be conducted and studies that investigate the effects of air entry and hysteresis on the behavior of lambda(eff)(psi) relationship is recommended.

AB We studied long-term monotonic trend in inflow volume to 20 reservoirs, plus a measure of system-wide hydroelectric power potentially available for generation, in British Columbia, Canada. The primary analysis involved application of a linear method with explicit signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) estimation to monthly and annual mean inflows over the period of record common to all basins, providing a broad and convenient overview of changes across the hydroelectric system. Additional analyses then investigated the sensitivity of the results to methodological choices, focussing on annual inflow volume for eight indicator basins and system power. In these auxiliary analyses, alternative data selection and processing schemes were explored: full period of record for each indicator basin; residual after Pacific Decadal Oscillation signal removal; and data from streamgauges on catchments within or near each indicator basin. Alternative analysis techniques were also applied: nonparametric Spearman rank correlation with adjustment for serial dependence; change point detection using Mann-Whitney sliding window analysis; and visual assessment of data low-pass filtered using polynomial fits of various orders. Finally, we studied changes in year-to-year water supply variability, employing a split-sample approach implemented using a standard F-test; a nonparametric Ansari-Bradley test; and a novel Monte Carlo-based test on the Shannon entropy, a measure of hydroclimatic information content. The results provided no substantial evidence for decreased annual water supply and pointed to some increases; seasonal inflow pattern shifts were also detected for many basins, in particular a wintertime flow increase. The split-sample tests yielded no evidence for shifts in the volatility and predictability of annual inflow. One of the more intriguing and perhaps broadly important findings was that methodological choices ultimately made little difference to final outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the climatological spatial scales (CSSs) of meteorological droughts in China and the linkages to climate variability. The Global Precipitation Climatology Centre monthly gridded precipitation with a spatial resolution of 25 km x 25 km for 1961-2010 is used. The standardized precipitation index at different timescales (1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month) is applied to characterize meteorological droughts. The CSSs of meteorological droughts are calculated using a method considering spatial correlation and anisotropy. The relationships between the CSSs and main monsoons and climate teleconnections in five selected regions are quantified using dynamic spatial panel models. The five regions are South China (SC), the Yangtze River Valley (YRV), North China (NC), Northeast China (NE), and the Tibetan Plateau (TIB). The following results are ob-tained: (1) The CSSs of multi-timescale meteorological droughts in China are determined. The means of the CSSs at various timescales in China are 68.9, 73.8, 71.8, 69.7, 68.8, 65.9, 62.9, and 60.8 x 104 km2, respectively. The CSSs in eastern China generally show a significant decrease with increasing timescale. (2) Significant quantifi-cation relationships (R2 greater than 0.85) suggest that there is not a simple linear relationship between climate anomalies and the CSSs, but rather a complex spatiotemporal interaction including exogenous and endogenous interaction effects. The CSSs not only strongly depend on their neighbors on the same timescale but also significantly depend on the CSSs of neighbors on adjacent timescales. Three monsoon indices (Indian monsoon, East Asian monsoon, and western North Pacific monsoon) have significant impacts on the multi-timescale CSS variations in the five regions, especially for NE, YRV, SC, and TIB, while the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation affect mainly SC and YRV. These findings could broaden our understanding of the spatiotemporal relationships of droughts and be useful for drought risk management.

AB Physical habitat is increasingly used worldwide as a measure of river ecosystem health when assessing changes to river flows, such as those caused by abstraction. The major drawback with this approach is that defining precisely the relationships between physical habitat and flow for a given river reach requires considerable data collection and analysis. Consequently, widely used models such as the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) system are expensive to apply. There is, thus, a demand for rapid methods for defining habitat-discharge relationships from simple field measurements. This paper reports the analysis of data from 63 sites in the UK where PHABSIM has been applied. The results demonstrate that there are strong relationships between single measurements of channel form and river hydraulics and the habitat available for target species. The results can form the basis of a method to estimate sensitivity of physical habitat to flow change by visiting a site at only one flow. Furthermore, the uncertainty in estimates reduces as more information is collected. This allows the user to select the level of investment in data collection appropriate for the desired confidence in the estimates. The method is demonstrated using habitat indicators for different life stages of Atlantic salmon, brown trout, roach and dace.

ID MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORK
AB To address the problem of a multipurpose reservoir flood control in Taiwan, this paper develops a reservoir real-time operation (RES-RT) model for determining the optimal real-time release during a typhoon. The RES-RT model. consists of three sub-models: a quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) model., which is developed to predict rainfall; a stream flow prediction (RTRL) model., which is developed to predict reservoir inflow; and a reservoir operation optimization (RESOP) model., which is developed to forecast the optimal. reservoir release hydrograph. The RESOP model objectives are (1) maximizing the peak flow reduction at selected downstream control points; and (2) optimizing reservoir storage at the end of the flood. The constraints incorporate the three-flood-stage operation guidelines that are suitably applied in Taiwan. The developed RES-RT model has been applied to Shihmen reservoir system in Taiwan. Comparing the three scenarios of historical operations, current rules, and RES-RT model. running, results show that the RES-RT model. produces much better performance for all scenarios in terms of reducing the peak flow at the downstream control point as well as meeting the target reservoir storage at the flood ending. Consequently, RES-RT model. demonstrates its effectiveness for estimating the optimal. real-time releases. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The parameters commonly considered to define climate are the mean annual precipitation and mean annual potential evapotranspiration. In this study an attempt ha been made to develop a relationship between average drought frequency and the evapotranspiration/precipitation ratio for the arid, semi-arid and subhumid climatic regions of India. The climatic regions are delineated using two climatic indices: namely (i) the ratio of mean annual precipitation (P-a) to global terrestrial mean annual precipitation (P-a), and (ii) the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration (Ep) to mean annual precipitation (P-g). It was noted that the average drought frequency (i e., year(-1).) decreases gradually from dry to wet regions. The return period varies from 2 to 3 years in the arid regions (12 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 5), 3 to 5 years in semi-arid ret ions (5 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 2), and 5 to 8 years in sub-humid regions (2 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 3/4). Another relationship was developed between the average frequency of drought occurrence and the ratio of mean annual deficit to mean annual precipitation, (E-p - P-a)/P-a. The results have been compared with the drought experiences documented for other regions of the world. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Editorial Material
DE Complementary relationship of evaporation; Crop evapotransiration; Soil

AB Kim et al. (2019) proposed to scale the generalized complementary-relationship-obtained daily evapotranspiration (ETGCR) rate by the wet-environment ET value (ETw) as an index (K-s) of soil water stress but they did not tie their index-values to any soil moisture data. With daily measurements from the same study area (Mead, Nebraska) and period (2002-2012) it is demonstrated that there indeed exists a statistically significant near-linear relationship between K-s (= ETGCR/ETw) and the volumetric soil water content (VWC) when scaled by its maximum observed value, a proxy for field capacity (FC). The soil moisture data therefore support, with increasing reliability as the length of the averaging period grows, the employment of ETGCR/ETw as a practical indicator of soil water stress, the latter here defined as VWC/FC.

AB Downscaling methods have been proposed to estimate catchment-scale soil moisture patterns from coarser resolution patterns. These methods usually infer the fine-scale variability in soil moisture using variations in ancillary variables like topographic attributes that have relationships to soil moisture. Previously, such relationships have been observed in catchments using soil moisture observations taken on uniform grids at hundreds of locations on multiple dates, but collecting data in this manner limits the applicability of this approach. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategic sampling techniques for characterizing the relationships between topographic attributes and soil moisture for the purpose of constraining downscaling methods. The strategic sampling methods are conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). Each sampling method is used to select a limited number of locations or dates for soil moisture monitoring at three catchments with detailed soil moisture datasets. These samples are then used to calibrate two available downscaling methods, and the effectiveness of the sampling methods is evaluated by the ability of the downscaling methods to reproduce the known soil moisture patterns. cLHS outperforms random sampling in almost every case considered. SRS usually performs better than cLHS when very few locations are sampled, but it can perform worse than random sampling for intermediate and large numbers of locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study proposes a method of relay-information-transfer for radar QPE (quantitative precipitation estimation) to overcome the limitation of the current QPE in Korea. The Z-R relationship was selected as the QPE information to be transferred. To examine the applicability of the proposed method, three different cases of relay-information-transfer were considered: (1) from the sea to inland, (2) from inland to another inland location, and (3) over a long distance. The results were: (1) Between the two parameters of the Z-R relationship, the parameter A was found to have an explanatory power of more than 70% of the Z-R relationship from one radar to the other. (2) All three cases showed that the relay-information-transfer of the parameter A was highly applicable, especially in the initial period of a storm. (3) Areal average rainfall and the root mean square error of the radar rain rate also confirmed that the relay-information-transfer method resulted in more reasonable estimates of the parameter A in the initial period of a storm. After the initial period, however, both the conventional method and the method proposed in this study were found to provide similar and reasonable estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We examine the potential predictability of an important Iberian river (Douro) based on the coupling of a time series approach (ARMA) and previous seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. A comprehensive search for predictors has identified only two key regions where spring streamflow anomalies are stably correlated with previous winter SST anomalies during the whole period under study (1956-2006); (1) central North Atlantic Ocean and (2) south-western Atlantic. A modelling scheme (the SST_model), based on linear regression, is developed and applied to simulate streamflow anomalies from these key SST regions.
   An additional study carried out over the residual time series (residual = flow SST_model) shows three significant quasi-oscillatory modes with periods around 5, 3 and 2.4 years. Based on this information an ARMA(4,3) model was fitted to the residual. The combined [SST_model + ARMA(4,3)] model considerably improves the skill of the model compared to the climatology or persistence, explaining 76% of the total variance for spring Douro streamflow series. We conclude that the predictability of the spring Douro streamflow can be divided in two parts: the seasonal predictability associated with the previous winter Atlantic SST and the linear interannual predictability, which is considerable lower and shows some kind of association with El Nino.

ID GLOBAL SURVEY; EXTREME; PRECIPITATION
AB Frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes is needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities as well as water resources management. A multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of these extremes. However, no single distribution has been accepted as a global standard. Employing the entropy theory, this study derived five generalized distributions for frequency analysis that used different kinds of information encoded as constraints. These distributions were the generalized gamma (GG), the generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB2), and the Halphen type A distribution (Hal-A), Halphen type B distribution (Hal-B) and Halphen type inverse B distribution (Hal-IB), among which the GG and GB2 distribution were previously derived by Papalexiou and Koutsoyiannis (2012) and the Halphen family was first derived using entropy theory in this paper. The entropy theory allowed to estimate parameters of the distributions in terms of the constraints used for their derivation. The distributions were tested using extreme daily and hourly rainfall data. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) values were very small, which indicated that the five generalized distributions fitted the extreme rainfall data well. Among them, according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values, generally the GB2 and Halphen family gave a better fit. Therefore, those general distributions are one of the best choices for frequency analysis. The entropy based derivation led to a new way for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes.

AB Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) were used to simultaneously measure resistivity and soil moisture at an experimental field site with the objective of quantifying soil moisture in 2D unsaturated zone profiles (>40 m long and 9 m deep). With a time-series data set and a modified form of Archie's Law, we used bulk conductivity derived from ERI models of soil resistivity, pore water conductivity derived using an exchangeable cation proxy (Ca + Mg), and percent clay content of soils, to convert 2D ERI profiles into 2D soil moisture profiles. We optimized the model using 1D access-tube time domain reflectometry (TDR) derived soil moisture measurements. Results show that this approach can be used to quantify soil moisture in heterogeneous soils, and thus provides a useful method for measuring 2D soil moisture at a variety of field sites and scales.

AB Crystalline-rock aquifers generally yield limited groundwater resources. However, some highly productive aquifers may be encountered, typically near tectonic discontinuities. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary experimental field approach to investigate the hydrogeological behavior of a sub-vertical permeable fault zone identified by lineament mapping. We particularly focused our investigations on the hydrogeological interactions with neighboring reservoirs.
   The geometry of the permeable domains was identified from geological information and hydraulic test interpretations. The system was characterized under natural conditions and during a 9-week large-scale pumping test. We used a combination of piezometric analysis, flow logs, groundwater dating and tracer tests to describe the interactions between permeable domains and the general hydrodynamical behaviors.
   A clear vertical compartmentalization and a strong spatial heterogeneity of permeability are highlighted. Under ambient conditions, the vertical permeable fault zone allows discharge of deep groundwater flows within the superficial permeable domain. The estimated flow across the total length of the fault zone ranged from 170 to 200 m(3)/day. Under pumping conditions, hydrological data and groundwater dating clearly indicated a flow inversion. The fault zone appears to be highly dependent on the surrounding reservoirs which mainly ensure its recharge. Groundwater fluxes were estimated from tracer tests interpretation. This study demonstrates the hydrogeological capacities of a sub-vertical fault aquifer in a crystalline context. By describing the hydrological behavior of a fault zone, this study provides important constrain about groundwater management and protection of such resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB An explicit relationship between seepage properties and microscopic structure of porous media is being sought for the development of oil and gas resources. An effective method to accurately characterize and quantify the microscopic structure of porous media is a key issue. Fractal geometry can take advantage of several physically-based parameters to analyze microstructures of reservoir rocks. In this study, three fractal structural parameters, fractal dimension, lacunarity and succolarity, were employed to characterize scale-invariant complexity, heterogeneity, and anisotropy of rock microstructures, respectively. Twelve three-dimensional digital cores of sandstone reservoir rocks were used to evaluate permeability in terms of fractal dimension, lacunarity and succolarity. The parameters were utilized to quantitatively characterize differences in core micro-structure and predict their effects on permeability. Due to the confounding influence of porosity, the fractal dimension was not an accurate predictor of the variation in permeability on its own. Instead, the results reveal that lacunarity and succolarity were better able to predict differences in structure and permeability. Succolarity, in particular, showed an exponential relationship with permeability, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.940. Using a combination of fractal structural parameters in the place of pore-size distribution, can provide a better explanation of the relationship between fluid flow, and the heterogeneous structure and anisotropic physical properties of reservoir rocks.

AB Despite the well-accepted value of soil hydraulic properties for describing and modeling matter and energy fluxes in the unsaturated zone, their accurate measurement across scales is still a daunting task. The increasing availability of continuous soil water content measurements at discrete points in space, as provided by sensor networks, offers still unexplored possibilities for evaluating soil physical properties across landscapes. In this study, we propose a new method, based on the Bruce and Klute equation, to estimate effective soil water diffusivity from soil water profile data observed during continuous desiccation periods. An analytical expression is proposed for the diffusion-soil water relationship, assuming an exponential relationship between soil water content and the Boltzmann variable. The method has been evaluated using soil water profile data observed at inter-row and under canopy locations across a rainfed olive orchard in SW Spain. The spatial variability of the effective soil water diffusivity across the orchard was estimated. Different soil conditions under the tree canopies as compared to inter-row areas resulted in significantly different effective diffusivity relationships, reflecting the effect of trees on soil physical properties and water dynamics across olive orchards. The proposed method offers a suitable alternative to traditional laboratory methods and can be easily extended to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention curves.

AB Seepage erosion is an important factor in hillslope instability and failure. However, predicting erosion by subsurface flow or seepage and incorporating its effects into stability models remains a challenge Limitations exist with all existing seepage erosion sediment transport functions, including neglecting the three-dimensional geometry of the seepage undercut and the cohesive nature of soils. The objective was to develop an empirical sediment transport function that can predict seepage erosion and undercutting with time based on three-dimensional soil block experiments covering a wide range of hydraulic, soil type, slope and bulk density combinations. The transport function was represented by an excess gradient equation (R-2 = 0.54). The critical gradient was predicted by the soil cohesion based on laboratory experiments. Using a three-dimensional Gaussian function, the geometric relationships between the maximum distance and lateral and vertical dimensions of the undercut were then derived. The proposed empirical relationships reasonably predicted the observed volume per unit area of undercut, erosion rate, and time at which a given amount of undercut developed. The flow gradient can be used with the derived sediment transport function, the first ever relationship proposed for predicting the dimensions and the geometry of the undercut, to predict the impact of seepage erosion undercutting on hillslope stability Users only need to input the seepage layer's cohesion, bulk density, and the hydraulic gradient over time in the near-bank ground water system (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aimed to clarify the effects of antecedent rain history on particulate phosphorus (PP) loss in a small mountainous watershed covered primarily with a plantation forest of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa). We analyzed stream discharge and PP concentration at 15-60 min intervals during 24 h in eight rain events with different discharge levels. The PP concentration versus stream discharge (PPC-Q) relationships exhibited clockwise hysteresis loops for each of the eight events monitored. Discharge could explain changes in PP concentration on the falling but not rising limb of the hydrograph. On the rising limb, a positive relationship between the rate of changes in discharge (dQ/dt) and the PP load (dL/dt) was found for each event. This indicates that a large amount of PP is strongly pulsed at times of rapidly increased discharge. These results suggest that dQ/dt is the driving force behind PP supply and the primary control on the clockwise hysteresis loop of PPC-Q relationship. There was a strong negative correlation between the antecedent precipitation index and the slope of the dL/dt versus dQ/dt relationship. This shows that a rapid increase in PP load occurs even with slight increases in discharge as antecedent moisture conditions become drier. The soil water repellency and rapid runoff response following dry conditions support that soil desiccation increases the PP supply associated with soil erosion via overland flow. Therefore, we concluded that the antecedent rain history affects the mobility of PP via soil desiccation. The findings of this study will fill gaps in our understanding of, temporal variations in released fine sediment and associated PP as reported in previous studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ID INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MODEL
AB Within the scope of a program to empirically assess the pathways across large river systems of substances from diffuse sources, a method has been proposed and demonstrated in part 1 of blind functional streamflow disaggregation (FSD). It yields fast, transient, and (s) low conceptual, parallel component flows. We apply the technique here to German and Austrian gauging stations from watersheds of the Elbe and Danube basins, covering geomorphologic conditions from lowlands to alpine. Potential relations to the classical concept of river runoff composition (base flow, interflow, and overland flow) are evaluated by contrasting FSD analyses with direct rainfall-runoff syntheses using the distributed models Large Area Runoff Simulation Model (LARSIM), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM). The material is supplemented in part by another empirical technique, Differentielle Ganglinien-Analyse (DIFGA), and by the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model in a lumped mode. Blind FSD in its shortcut version turns out to be competitive in general with the simulations consulted. A moderately higher surface and subsurface flow diversification, however, like the one borne in a "greedy'' FSD process, is indicated. We shed a glance in passing at further useful applications, from supporting hydrologic modeling to tracing climatic signatures in internal changes of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle.

AB Fitting statistical laws from a short time series does not give any guarantee of reliability on extreme flood estimation. Historical investigation through documentary sources can enlarge the record period. This paper presents a case study on the Ardeche river, based on collaboration between historians, archivists, hydraulic engineers and hydrologists for a better assessment of the flood risk. A list of historical flood levels from 1644 to the present has been drawn up and converted into discharge using hydraulic modelling. A sensitivity analysis provides error intervals on discharge estimates taking into account uncertainties on water level, roughness coefficient and channel geometry, and the impact of a nonpermanent discharge or the backward effect. A flood frequency analysis using systematic and nonsystematic data gives a practical example on how historical information can improve flood knowledge. It reduces the sampling uncertainty and shows also a good agreement with a hydrometeorological approach (Gradex model). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WATER CONTENT; L-BAND
AB This paper analyses data from two field experiments in Chickasha, Oklahoma, and Tifton, Georgia, carried out in July 1999 and June 2000 respectively. The observations on soil moisture at two depths, viz. 0-2(.)5 and 0-5(.)0 cm, surface temperature, and temperatures at 1, 5 and 10 cm depths are analysed. The relationship between the soil moisture and the temperature variability in time is examined as a function of vegetation type and location. Results from these experiments show that, during drydown, surface temperature shows an increase that corresponds to a decrease in the soil moisture. Linear models for prediction of soil moisture (at both depths) using surface temperature observations are examined. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

   PUMPING
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A heat transport model that incorporates the effect of decreases in hydraulic head due to pumping of groundwater has been developed to explain the decrease in groundwater temperature during the last three decades in the Nara basin, Japan. Vertical two-dimensional temperature analyses have been made based on a theory of simultaneous transfer of heat and water in porous media. The calculated relationships between the depth and the groundwater temperature in the discharge area agree well with the observed temperature-depth relationships. The model used suggests that the decrease in groundwater temperature is caused by the decrease in the hydraulic head due to pumping.

AB This work develops a simple exact and explicit solution of the one-dimensional transient and nonlinear Richards' equation for soils in a special case of exponential water retention curve and power law hydraulic conductivity. The exact solution is obtained as traveling wave based on the approach proposed by Philip (1957, 1967) and adopted by Zlotnik et al. (2007). The obtained solution is novel, and it expresses explicitly the water content as function of the depth and time. It can be useful to model infiltration into semi-infinite soils with time-dependent boundary conditions and infiltration with constant boundary condition but space-dependent initial condition. A complete analytical inverse procedure based on the proposed analytical solution is presented which allows the estimation of hydraulic parameters. The proposed exact solution is also important for the verification of numerical schemes as well as for checking the implementation of time-dependent boundary conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ID SCALE; RESOURCES; VALUES; POLICY
AB The absence of either state regulations or markets to coordinate the operation of individual wells has focussed attention on community level institutions as the primary loci for sustainable groundwater management in Rajasthan and Gujarat, India. The reported research relied on theoretical propositions that livelihood strategies, groundwater management and the propensity to cooperate are associated with the attitudinal orientations of well owners in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds, located in Gujarat and Rajasthan respectively. The research tested the hypothesis that attitudes to groundwater management and farming practices, household income and trust levels of assisting agencies were not consistent across the watersheds, implying that a targeted approach, in contrast to default uniform programs, would assist communities craft rules to manage groundwater across multiple hydro-geological settings. Hierarchical cluster analysis of attitudes held by survey respondents revealed four statistically significant discrete clusters, supporting acceptance of the hypothesis. Further analyses revealed significant differences in farming practices, household wealth and willingness to adapt across the four groundwater management clusters. In conclusion, the need to account for attitudinal diversity is highlighted and a framework to guide the specific design of processes to assist communities craft coordinating instruments to sustainably manage local aquifers described.

AB Time-dependencies of suspended-sediment discharge from six coastal watersheds of northern California - Smith River, Klamath River, Trinity River, Redwood Creek, Mad River, and Eel River - were evaluated using monitoring data from 1955 to 2010. Suspended-sediment concentrations revealed time-dependent hysteresis and multi-year trends. The multi-year trends had two primary patterns relative to river discharge: (i) increases in concentration resulting from both land clearing from logging and the flood of record during December 1964 (water year 1965), and (ii) continual decreases in concentration during the decades following this flood. Data from the Eel River revealed that changes in suspended-sediment concentrations occurred for all grain-size fractions, but were most pronounced for the sand fraction. Because of these changes, the use of bulk discharge-concentration relationships (i.e., "sediment rating curves") without time-dependencies in these relationships resulted in substantial errors in sediment load estimates, including 2.5-fold over-prediction of Eel River sediment loads since 1979. We conclude that sediment discharge and sediment discharge relationships (such as sediment rating curves) from these coastal rivers have varied substantially with time in response to land use and climate. Thus, the use of historical river sediment data and sediment rating curves without considerations for time-dependent trends may result in significant errors in sediment yield estimates from the globally-important steep, small watersheds.

AB To control algal blooms, the stressor-response relationships between water quality metrics, environmental variables, and algal growth need to be better understood and modeled. Machine-learning methods have been suggested as means to express the stressor-response relationships that are found when applying mechanistic water quality models. The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of regression trees in the development of a stressor-response model for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, using the results from site-specific mechanistic water quality modeling. The 2-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) model was applied to simulate water quality using four-year observational data and additional scenarios of air temperature increases for the Yeongsan Reservoir in South Korea. Regression tree modeling was applied to the results of these simulations. Given the well-expressed seasonality in the simulated Chl-a dynamics, separate regression trees were developed for months from May to September. The regression trees provided a reasonably accurate representation of the stressor-response dependence generated by the CE-QUAL-W2 model. Different stressors were then selected as split variables for different months, and, in most cases, splits by the same stressor variable yielded the same correlation sign between the variable and the Chl-a concentration. Compared to physical variables, nutrient content appeared to better predict Chl-a responses. The highest Chl-a temperature sensitivities were found for May and June. Regression tree splits based on ammonium concentration resulted in a consistent trend of greater sensitivity in the groups of samples with higher ammonium concentrations. Regression tree models provided a transparent visual representation of the stressor-response relationships for Chl-a and its sensitivity. Overall, the representation of relationships using classification and regression tools can be considered a useful approach to assess the state of aquatic ecosystems and effectively determine significant stressor variables.

AB Contaminants in water from intensively grazed catchments have been shown to cause significant environmental impacts. Effective intervention to reduce contaminant loads depends on identifying their sources and processes of mobilisation and transport. In this study, flow (Q) and analyte concentrations (CA) from a 12 ha catchment in north-west Tasmania used for grazing dairy cattle were monitored at a fine temporal scale and used to infer sources and processes of loss. Three groups of analytes identified based on C-A-Q relationships, which included hysteresis loops, demonstrated that the TP group (TP, DRP, TSS, TN, E. coli and Enterococcus) was transported by surface runoff processes while the behaviour of the NO3 group (NO3, TDS, Ca, Mg, Na) was explained by subsurface processes and pathways. The NH4 group (NH4, K) was dominated by the addition of large quantities of analyte from grazing. In addition to the C-A-Q relationships, concentrations of most analytes decreased linearly over each season of runoff. NH4 and K concentrations decreased exponentially following grazing events while TP concentrations decreased linearly. The study demonstrated the importance of understanding surface water and groundwater interactions and that relationships between runoff events, analyte concentrations and management as revealed by a fine temporal sampling regime may yield significant insights to sources and processes of loss of analytes in surface flow, at a given scale.

AB To test a conceptual model of non-linear response of hydrologic regimes to watershed characteristics, we selected 48 second- and third-order study sites on the North and South Shores of western Lake Superior, MN(USA) using a random-stratified design based on hydrogeomorphic region, fraction mature forest, and fraction watershed storage (lake+wetland area/watershed area). We calculated several commonly used hydrologic indices froth discharge and velocity estimates, including daily flow indices, overall flood indices, low flow variables, and ratios or ranges of flow percentiles reflecting the nature of cumulative frequency distributions. Four principal components (PCs) explained 85.9 and 88.6% of the variation of flow metrics among second- and third-order stream sites, respectively. Axes of variation corresponded to a runoff vs. baseflow axis, flow variability, mean flow, and contrasts between flood duration and frequency, Analysis of velocity metrics for third-order streams yielded four PCs corresponding to mean or maximum velocity, Froude number, and inferred shear velocity, as well;is spate frequencies vs. intervals associated with different velocity ranges.
   Using discriminant function analysis, we could discriminate among watershed classes based on region. mature forest, or watershed storage as a function of flow metrics. For second-order streams, median flow (Qs(S0)) increased as watershed storage increased. North Shore streams showed a more skewed distribution and greater spread of discharge values than did South Shore streams for both stream orders, while third-order North Shore streams exhibited a higher frequency of spates. Independent of regional differences, loss of mature forest increased the range of variation between baseflow and peak flows, and depressed baseflow. Consistent with our initial model for watershed classification, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis confirmed significant thresholds of change in flow metrics averaging between 0,506 and 0.036 for fraction mature forest and between 0.180 and 0.258 for fraction watershed storage.

AB Adaptive management (AM) is an approach that uses targeted monitoring and investigation to improve future management practices in a structured and iterative way through reassessment of the efficacy of management policies and system understanding. AM has received significant attention in groundwater management for its purported capability to counteract key uncertainties inherent in estimating future environmental responses to human activities. While the theoretical strengths of AM have long been recognized, practical applications have produced mixed results across the many facets of environmental management. In this study, we review AM principles and groundwater management case studies, including urban water supply, agriculture and mining applications, to critically evaluate AM strategies applied to groundwater contexts. We identified substantial variability in the interpretation of AM principles across eleven groundwater case studies. Comparison of published AM guidelines and groundwater examples of AM plans revealed significant shortcomings in many AM applications, while a small number of AM plans largely adhere to the key components of AM identified in the guidelines. The most notable issues in the application of AM to groundwater activities include a lack of substantive mitigation measures and/or assessment of the potential for remediation. Construction of clear definitions and guidelines for AM applied to groundwater management is required to set the expectations of regulatory bodies and government departments responsible for assessing groundwater-affecting projects, and to ensure that the protective attributes of AM are properly incorporated into project plans. This will lead to greater transparency in groundwater related planning and expected outcomes for stakeholders.

AB Current theories for water flow in porous media are valid for scales much smaller than those at which problem of public interest manifest themselves. This provides a drive for upscaled flow equations with their associated upscaled parameters. Upscaling is often achieved through volume averaging, but the solution to the resulting closure problem imposes severe restrictions to the flow conditions that limit the practical applicability. Here, the derivation of a closed expression of the effective hydraulic conductivity is forfeited to circumvent the closure problem. Thus, more limited but practical results can be derived. At the Representative Elementary Volume scale and larger scales, the gravitational potential and fluid pressure are treated as additive potentials. The necessary requirement that the superposition be maintained across scales is combined with conservation of energy during volume integration to establish consistent upscaling equations for the various heads. The power of these upscaling equations is demonstrated by the derivation of upscaled water content-matric head relationships and the resolution of an apparent paradox reported in the literature that is shown to have arisen from a violation of the superposition principle. Applying the upscaling procedure to Darcy's Law leads to the general definition of an upscaled hydraulic conductivity. By examining this definition in detail for porous media with different degrees of heterogeneity, a series of criteria is derived that must be satisfied for Darcy's Law to remain valid at a larger scale.

AB Bathymetric mapping for an accurate estimation of stored water volume in drying lakes is a key information for an effective monitoring of their recession or restoration status. Extraction of bathymetry in shallow saline lakes using remote sensing techniques has always been challenging due to the complex influences imposed by the physical properties of substrate and the spatial variability of salinity. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based model to quantify the implicit, non-linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance by leveraging extensive in-situ data and high-resolution satellite imagery. We trained and tested the learning model in the hyper-saline Lake Urmia (LU), which faced catastrophic drying over the past two decades. To this end, we used Landsat-8 imagery and 32,984 hydmgraphy data points surveyed by the Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) from 2017 to 2020 during six stages. To enhance the model accuracy, we tuned the model inputs by optimizing the spectral information and clustering in-situ data from stages with similar meteorological conditions into three classes. The results demonstrated the high accuracy of the developed intelligent model as evidenced by R-2 = 0.8 similar to 0.9 and RMSE = 7.8 similar to 17.9 cm for the three models. We found that the average water depth in the LU was increased from 0.43 m in September 2018 to 2.00 m in May 2020. In particular, the lake water volume in May 2020 was 3.6 times greater than that in February 2019, which marks a remarkable shift in the LU restoration. Dynamic bathymetric maps also witnessed considerable salt dissolution taking place across the lake during this period. Finally, we extracted the LU level-area relationship by processing 172 Landsat images between 1984 and 2020, which was validated against the field data surveyed along the lake water boundary in 2019. The results indicated that the level-area relationship follows a dual linear relationship separated at the water level of 1271.31 m.

   COOPERATION; HYDROPOWER; CONFLICT; BENEFITS
AB Water resources infrastructure is critical for energy and food security; however, the development of large-scale infrastructure, such as hydropower dams, may significantly alter downstream flows, potentially leading to water resources management conflicts and disputes. Mutually agreed upon water sharing policies for the operation of existing or new reservoirs is one of the most effective strategies for mitigating conflict, yet this is a complex task involving the estimation of available water, identification of users and demands, procedures for water sharing, etc. A water sharing policy framework that incorporates reservoir operating rules optimization based on conflicting uses and natural hydrologic variability, specifically tailored to drought conditions, is proposed. First, the trade-off between downstream and upstream water availability utilizing multi-objective optimization of reservoir operating rules is established. Next, reservoir operation with the candidate (optimal) rules is simulated, followed by their performance evaluations, and the rule selections for balancing water uses. Subsequently, a relationship between the reservoir operations simulated from the selected rules and drought-specific conditions is built to derive water sharing policies. Finally, the reservoir operating rules are re-optimized to evaluate the effectiveness of the drought-specific water sharing policies. With a case study of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile river, it is demonstrated that the derived water sharing policy can balance GERD power generation and downstream releases, especially in dry conditions, effectively sharing the hydrologic risk in inflow variability among riparian countries. The proposed framework offers a robust approach to inform water sharing policies for sustainable management of water resources.

AB Particle-size distribution (PSD) of soils has been widely used to estimate water retention curves (WRCs). Lognormal distribution model, which estimates the WRC directly from the PSD data by applying a lognormal distribution law to both PSD and void-size distribution (VSD), has been recently developed and successfully applied to sandy soils. The objective of this study was to investigate in detail the applicability of the lognormal distribution model for a broader range of soil textures. Performance of the model was evaluated on five aggregated USDA texture classes (coarse-, moderately coarse-, medium-, moderately fine-, and fine-texture soils) using 229 'undisturbed' soils (159 soils for model calibration and 70 soils for validation). The model performed worst for moderately fine-textured soils, since the PSDs and VSDs of soils included in this texture did not strongly follow the lognormal distribution. In general, performance of the model decreased with increase in fine particle fraction, possibly because of the surface sorption behavior of clay particles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Challenge remains to find the optimal carryover storage to balance the immediate and carryover utilities for long-term hydropower reservoir operation due to low forecast accuracy, limited foresight, and complex hydrologic, hydraulic and electric connections between cascade hydropower reservoirs. Thus, this paper proposes a long-term optimal operation model to dynamically control the optimal carryover storages for cascade hydropower reservoirs. First, the carryover utility of cascade hydropower stations is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy rather than the carryover storage, thus decreasing the function parameters and using the limited prior knowledge. Then, the utility function of the carryover potential energy (UFCPE) is fitted by a quadratic function based on a successive iteration method, based on which a two-stage optimal operation model (TSOOM) is developed to guide the long-term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations. The case study with five cascade hydropower stations in the Yalong River Basin shows that: 1) UFCPE can be well fitted by a quadratic function, and it increases linearly in the dry season, but monotonically at a decreasing rate in the flood season resulting from a large quantity of surplus water; and 2) The performance of UFCPE-based TSOOM is much superior to those of conventional rules and conventional optimization methods and quite close to that of dynamic programming successive approximation in guiding the long-term cascade hydropower reservoirs operation.

AB In the real-time operation of a flood control system, identifying effective reservoirs accurately and adaptively is the premise of establishing a mull-reservoir real-time flood control hybrid operation (MRFCHO) model. The existing effective reservoir intelligent reasoning (ERIK) method is based on the inference rules, which causes the identification results to be greatly influenced by the training samples. This paper establishes a random forest classification (RFC) model for identifying effective reservoirs to solve this problem. The performance of the RFC model is evaluated in terms of model stability and model accuracy, and compared with the ERIK model and other machine learning (ML) models. First, different flood samples are used to establish the models to verify the model stability. Then, the expected total cost under cross-validation is taken as the index to evaluate the classification accuracy. Finally, the average increase of expected total cost with cross-validation is proposed to evaluate the criteria importance and analyze the sensitive factors that affect the classification accuracy of the RFC model. The proposed method is applied to a mull-reservoir system in the Huaihe River basin in China. The results indicate that the RFC model has the characteristic of high classification accuracy, low sensitivity to flood samples and high stability. It displays more dominance in the dynamic identification of effective reservoirs compared to other models.

AB Streamflow, lake level and rainfall data acquired from 11 monitoring stations and 21 grid points at Rift Valley lakes basin of Ethiopia have been analyzed to evaluate short and long term dependence using parametric and non-parametric tests. Temporal variation in land use/cover has also been analyzed to investigate its effect on streamflow. Summer rainfall at Alaba Kulito and Bilate Farm show decreasing trend at 10% significance level. All other events of observed and gridded rainfall and total number of rainy days exhibit insignificant trends. Streamflow and lake level exhibit significant increasing trend for more than three-quarter of events investigated. Extreme wet years are marked with increased positive Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies whereas extreme dry years are characterized by negative SST anomalies. Even though there are such apparent associations between extreme rainfall magnitudes and SST, the frequency of above average total rainfall years to occur is relatively less during the analysis window. The observed trend in streamflow, lake level and rainfall is attributed to the combined effect of global climatic change and variability on local climate and altered catchment condition over the years. Thus, simultaneous analysis of catchment dynamics and hydro-climatic variables using multiple time series models to detect non-stationarity eliminate potential bias of ruling out the effect of catchment dynamics.

TI Scaling and physiographic controls on streamflow behaviour on the

AB Relationships explaining streamflow behaviour in terms of drainage basin physiography greatly assist efforts to extrapolate streamflow metrics from gauged to ungauged basins in the same landscape. The Dorset Environmental Science Centre (DESC) has monitored streamflow from 22 small basins (3.4-190.5 ha) on the Precambrian Shield in south-central Ontario, in some cases since 1976. The basins exhibit regional coherence in their interannual response to precipitation; however, there is often a poor correlation between streamflow metrics from basins separated by as little as 1 km. This study assesses whether inter-basin variations in such metrics can be explained in terms of basin scale and physiography. Several characteristics (annual maximum, minimum and average flow) exhibited simple scaling with basin area, while magnitude, range and timing of annual maximum daily runoff showed scaling behaviour consistent with the Representative Elementary Area (REA) concept. This REA behaviour is partly attributed to convergence of fractional coverage of the two dominant and hydrologically-contrasting land cover types in the DESC region with increasing basin size. Three Principal Components (PCs) explained 82.4% of the variation among basin physiographic properties, and several runoff metrics (magnitude and timing of annual minimum daily runoff, mean number of days per year with 0 streamflow) exhibited significant relationships with one or more PC. Significant relationships were obtained between basin quickflow (QF) production and the PCs on a seasonal and annual basis, almost all of which were superior to simple area-based relationships. Basin physiography influenced QF generation via its control on slope runoff, water storage and hydrologic connectivity; however, this role was minimized during Spring when QF production in response to large rain-on-snow events was relatively uniform across the DESC basins. The PC-based relationships and inter-seasonal changes in their form were consistent with previous research conducted at point, slope and basin scales in the DESC region, and perceptions of key hydrological processes in these small basins may not have been as readily obtained from scaling studies using streamflow from larger basins. This process understanding provides insights into scaling behaviour beyond those derived from simple scaling and REA analyses. The physiography of the study area is representative of large portions of the Precambrian Shield, such that basin streamflow behaviour could potentially be extended across much of south-central Ontario. This would assist predictions of streamflow conditions at ungauged locations, development and testing of hydrological models for this landscape, and interpretation of inter-basin and intra-annual differences in hydrochemical behaviour on the southern Precambrian Shield.

AB Natural fault networks involve a very broad range of fault lengths, modeled in general by a power law length distribution, n(l) similar to alpha l(-a). Such a scaling law does not allow to define any a priori pertinent scale of observation for hydraulic field experiments in fractured media. To investigate the relative effects of faults depending on their length, we undertake in the spirit of percolation theory a theoretical and numerical study of the connectivity of three-dimensional fault networks following power law length distributions. We first establish the correct analytical expression of a percolation parameter p, which describes the connectivity of the system. The parameter p is found to be dependent on the third moment of the length distribution for fault planes. It allows us to identify different regimes of connectivity depending on a, the exponent of the fault length distribution. The geometrical properties of the infinite cluster, which partly control transport properties, are also established at the percolation threshold. For natural fault networks, our theoretical analysis suggests that faults larger than a critical length scale may form a well-connected network, while smaller faults may be not connected on average. Tl-lis result, which implies an increase of the connectivity with scale, is consistent with scaling effects observed on permeability measurements.

   FRAMEWORK
AB River flows exert dominant controls on in-stream biota. Quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions. Hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow-ecology relationships and guide management actions. Traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition. We present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response. First, we developed regional flow-ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern California to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait-based biotic indices. Next, we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics. For our study sites, flow flashiness and low flow frequency (indicative of drying) were found to best explain biotic condition. Hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime. This ecological-calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow-ecology relationships, but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation.

AB In the present work the depth-specific energy relationship and the depth-total force relationship in open channel flows of wide rectangular cross-section are analytically inverted.
   The nondimensional expressions of the specific energy and of the total force, as functions of the nondimensional water depth, are considered. The inversion of such functions consists of finding the roots of third degree algebraic equations; simple analytical solutions are obtained. More specifically, for a given specific discharge and for each meaningful value of the specific energy, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are found analytically. Similarly, for a given specific discharge and for each meaningful value of the total force, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are found analytically. For both functions, it is also shown that the third root corresponds to a negative depth, which can be discarded on the basis of physics.
   Examples from classical open channel hydraulics and a numerical application show the consistency of these analytical solutions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An approximate solution is useful if the corresponding analytical solution is complicated and difficult to accurately evaluate. In the past, the relationship of small p versus large t was commonly applied to the Laplace domain solution and could successfully obtain a large-time solution in the groundwater area. The large-time solution usually has a simpler form than the analytical solution and is much easier for estimating the transient behavior of the groundwater flow system. However, Chen and Stone (1993) pointed out that the use of this relationship might fail to yield the correct solution in calculating the wellbore flux for the constant head test problem. Later, Mathias and Zimmerman (2003) indicated that a poor result was obtained by Gerke and van Genuchten (1993) when using the relationship of small p versus large t to derive the water transfer coefficient for the dual-porosity media problem. This note is to show the detailed mathematical derivations involved in the issues that Chen and Stone (1993) and Gerke and van Genuchten (1993) addressed and to ensure that the relationship of small p versus large t is correct to obtain a large-time solution for transient groundwater flow problems.

AB Often the Philips infiltration equation has been applied as a fitting equation or as the Subsurface component in run-off models. Many a time, the theoretical assumptions for the theory have not been fulfilled. Originally Philip showed that the power series solution can be applied for a constant-head boundary condition at the soil. surface. It has later been showed that the power series solution can be applied for failing head infiltration. More general, it is here shown that the power series solution can be applied for variable-head ponded infiltration when the ponding depth is described as a power series in t(n/2), n = 0, 1,2, It is shown that the sorptivity only is dependent on the initial ponding depth and not the ponding depth for t > 0. Results obtained using the power series theory and other solution methods of Richard's equation are finally compared. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

AB One of the largest contiguous karst areas in the world is southwest China, where special geological conditions, shallow soil layers, the frequency of precipitation extremes, unreasonable land use, and dam construction have rendered the relationship between water discharge and sediment load increasingly complex. Few studies have been devoted to this region to clarify the potential influencing factors of the water-sediment relationship on a monthly basis. Correspondingly, the present study evaluated the temporal variations in sediment rating curves (SRCs: Qs = aQ(b), where Q(s) is the sediment concentration or load, Q is the water discharge, the coefficient a and index b are fitted parameters) and decoupled the effects of climate change and vegetation dynamics on SRC parameters using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). To these ends, 2003 to 2017 data on the monthly water discharge, sediment load, climatic and vegetation factors of six karst watersheds were collected and analyzed. No significant trends in interannual variations of SRC parameters occurred. The PLS-SEM showed that the combined effects of climate and vegetation explained 18% to 43% and 8% to 57% of the variations in coefficient a and index b, respectively. In most cases, however, no significant relationship was found among climate, vegetation-related factors, and the SRC parameters. Special hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in the area increasingly complicated the sediment transport process, thus potentially weakening the influence of climate and vegetation on the SRC parameters. This study can serve as guidance for regional ecological management and the sustainable development of soil and water resources.

AB Temporal stability of spatial distributions of soil moisture are usually observed after repeated surveys of soil moisture across an area. To understand how temporal stability of soil moisture varied with soil depth under the combined influences of vegetation and local topography, we collected soil moisture data at intervals of 10 cm within 1-m profiles on a loessial slope in China in four plots (61 m x 5 m) under different types of vegetation (Korshinsk peashrub, KOP; purple alfalfa, ALP; natural fallow, NAF; millet, MIL). Measurements of soil water content were made by neutron probes on 15 occasions between 2010 and 2012. Soil moisture distributions in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions were investigated to describe its spatial pattern and to lay the groundwork for better understanding its temporal stability characteristics. The results indicated that: (1) soil moisture presented different vertical but similar horizontal trends in the four plots, with significant correlations of soil moisture occurring primarily among adjacent soil layers irrespective of vegetation types, mostly in soil profiles under KOP and ALF and less frequently in soil profiles under NAF and MIL; (2) based on Spearman rank correlation coefficients, with increasing depth temporal stability generally increased under KOP and MIL, but first increased and then decreased under ALF, and increased after the first three measurements under NAP; (3) based on the relative difference technique, points with extreme moisture tended to remain representative at more depths than did points with average moisture and their time stability increased with increasing soil depth; and (4) the correlation between MRD (mean relative differences) and the wetness index weakened with soil depth. The relationship between SDRD (the standard deviation of MRD) and the wetness index varied nonlinearly with soil depth. Vegetation type, soil depth and the wetness index, in descending order of influence, had significant effects on the temporal stability of soil moisture. Among selected soil properties, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and soil organic carbon all significantly affected the SDRDs. These observations are expected to add valuable information to the theory of temporal stability and for the practices of soil moisture management. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Potential of extending the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

DE rainfall intensity-duration-frequency; regional analysis; ungauged areas
AB Maximum rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are commonly applied to determine the design rainfall in water resource projects. Normally, the IDF relationship is derived from recording rain gauges. As the network of non-recording rain gauges (daily rainfall) in Taiwan has a higher density than recording rain gauges, attempts were made in this study to extend the IDF relationship to non-recording rain gauges. Eighteen recording rain gauges and 99 non-recording rain gauges over the Chi-Nan area in Southern Taiwan provide the data sets. The regional IDF formulae were generated for ungauged areas to estimate rainfall intensity for various return periods and rainfall durations larger than or equal to one hour. For rainfall durations less than one hour, a set of adjustment formulae were applied to modify the regional IDF formulae. The method proposed in this study had reasonable application to non-recording rain gauges, which was concluded from the verification of four additional recording rain gauges.

DE potential recharge; chloride mass balance; water storage structures;

AB Groundwater recharge from water storage structures under semi-arid conditions of western India has been estimated by employing water table fluctuation (WTF) and chloride mass balance (CMB) methods. Groundwater recharge was estimated as 7.3% and 9.7% of the annual rainfall by WTF method for the years 2003 and 2004, respectively while the two years average recharge was estimated as 7.5% using CMB method. A Recharge function depicting the relationship between potential recharge from storage structures and successive day averaged storage depths was better exhibited by a power function. A diagnostic relationship correlating the rainfall to the potential recharge from water storage structures has been developed to explain the characteristics of the storage structures for a given geographical location. The study has revealed that a minimum of 104.3 mm cumulative rainfall is required to generate 1 mm of recharge from the water storage structures. It was also inferred that the storage structures have limited capacity to induce maximum recharge irrespective of the amount of rainfall and maximum recharge to rainfall ratio is achieved at a lower rainfall than the average annual rainfall of the area. An empirical linear relationship was found to reasonably correlate the changes in chloride concentration with water table rise or fall in the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous time random walks (CTRW), multi-rate mass transfer (MRMT), and fractional advection-dispersion equations (FADEs) are three promising models of anomalous transport as commonly found in natural streams. Although these paradigms are mathematically related, understanding their advantages and limitations poses a challenge for model selection. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the advection-dispersion equation (ADE), fractional-mobile-immobile (FMIM), fractional-in-space ADE (sFADE), fractional in space transient storage (FSTS), truncated time-fractional model (TTFM), and CTRW models with truncated power-law waiting time distribution (CTRW-TPL) by fitting them first to synthetic data. We then applied these models to observations from tracer experiments conducted in several rivers. Based on the extensive analysis, we conclude that the performance of the FSTS model (in particular, the model with negative skewness beta = -1) is comparable or superior to the other nonlocal models evaluated in the paper, therefore, the model represents an alternative to existing models for simulating stream solute transport for spatially-homogeneous flows.

DE Sabine river; Semiparametric model; Spline
ID NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; REGIONALIZATION; WATER
AB In this article, a modeling approach for the mean annual flow in different segments of Sabine river, as released in the NHDPlus data in 2007, as a function of five predictor variables is described. Modeling flow is extremely complex and the deterministic flow models are widely used for that purpose. The justification for using these deterministic models comes from the fact that the flow is governed by some explicitly stated physical laws. In contrast, in this article, this complex issue is addressed from a completely statistical point of view. A semiparametric model is proposed to analyze the spatial distribution of the mean annual flow of Sabine river. Semiparametric additive models allow explicit consideration of the linear and nonlinear relations with relevant explanatory variables. We use a conditionally specified Gaussian model for the estimation of the univariate conditional distributions of flow to incorporate auxiliary information and this formulation does not require the target variable to be independent.

ID INPUT DETERMINATION
AB A hybrid neural network model is proposed in this paper to forecast the typhoon rainfall. Two different types of artificial neural networks, the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multilayer perceptron network (MLPN), are combined to develop the proposed model. In the proposed model, a data analysis technique is developed based on the SOM, which can perform cluster analysis and discrimination analysis in one step. The MLPN is used as the nonlinear regression technique to construct the relationship between the input and output data. First, the input data are analyzed using a SOM-based data analysis technique. Through the SOM-based data analysis technique, input data with different properties are first divided into distinct clusters, which can help the multivariate nonlinear regression of each cluster. Additionally, the topological relationships among data are discovered from which more insight into the typhoon-rainfall process can be revealed. Then, for each cluster, the individual relationship between the input and output data is constructed by a specific MLPN. For evaluating the forecasting performance of the proposed model, an application is conducted. The proposed model is applied to the Tanshui River Basin to forecast the typhoon rainfall. The results show that the proposed model can forecast more precisely than the model developed by the conventional neural network approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water-use efficiency (WUE) is a key parameter that measures the balance between carbon gain and water loss in an ecosystem. Achieving better understanding of how WUE responds to environmental drivers is critical for revealing ecohydrological processes and mechanisms, and for biophysical modelling to investigate the interactions between vegetation and the changing environment. Karst landforms cover similar to 10 % of the Earth's land surface; however, to date few studies have focused on the behaviours of WUE in karstic ecosystems. To fill these knowledge gaps, a two-year experiment was conducted to investigate the WUE and its drivers in a climax karst forest in southwestern China. Results showed that both the GPP (Gross Primary Production) and ET (evapotranspiration) showed exponential relationships to Ta (air temperature, P < 0.05), but linear relationships to Rn (net radiation, R-2 = 0.38 (GPP) and 0.78 (ET), P < 0.05) and VPD (water vapour pressure deficit, R-2 = 0.36 (GPP) and 0.28 (ET), P < 0.05), being quite different from those in other ecosystems. The reasons would be the different habits of the karstic plants, and the facts that the root zone water availability rarely dropped to low levels due to the frequent precipitation. The WUE, with the mean of 8.0 +/- 4.8 mg CO2 g(-1) H2O, exhibited negative relationships to VPD (R-2 = 0.23, P < 0.05), Rn (R-2 = 0.28, P < 0.05), and Ta (air temperature, R-2 = 0.42, P < 0.05), and a positive linear relationship to the Bowen ratio (R-2 = 0.17, P < 0.05). Besides these, results also showed that the effects of a specific driver (e.g., VPD) on WUE was affected obviously by other factors (e.g., Ta, Rn), indicating that whether a driver is important or not to WUE, depends strongly on the environmental conditions. As the WUE-response formulas are often used to investigate and model the interactions between vegetation and environment, these findings suggested that the modelers should caution the versatility of the WUE-response formulas.

AB Determination of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, and the water retention curve, theta(h), is of paramount importance to characterize the hydraulic behavior of the vadose zone. Given the van Genuchten hydraulic model, defined by the residual, theta(r), and saturated, theta(s), volumetric water content and the alpha and n parameters, this work presents a new laboratory procedure to estimate Ks, theta(s), n and alpha for a drainage process, alpha(dr), from the inverse analysis of successive drainage steady-states curves generated by a tension-gradient between the surface and the base of a soil column. To this end, a double disc system, one connected a bubbling tower and placed at the soil surface and the second one placed under the soil core, was employed. The second disc was connected to an air -vacuum system. The experiment presented two parts: a first 1D downward infiltration at saturation on a dry soil column, followed by successive drainage steps. During the drainage process, the tension of the upper and lower discs varied between 0 and-5 cm, and from-5 to-100 cm, respectively. The soil sorptivity, S, and theta(s) were calculated from the 1D transient infiltration measure, Ks was calculated by Darcy's law, alpha(dr) and n were optimized from the inverse analysis of the steady-state curves under tension-gradient and alpha for a wetting process, alpha(w), was calculated from previously obtained S, theta(s), K-s and n. Once K-s estimated, alpha(dr) and n were optimized by minimizing the Q = |h(b) -h(n)| objective function, where hb and hn are the experimental and calculated tensions at the base of the soil core. Given a alpha(dr) value, the optimimum n was computed as the value that provides a minimum Q. By repeating this process for a sequence of alpha(dr), different Q-isolines were obtained, one for each hb value, which crossing-point corresponded to the actual alpha(dr) and n values. The method was tested on 2.5 cm high columns of four different synthetic soils. Next, it was applied on an experimental sand column of 5 cm height and on 2.5 cm high columns filled with sieved loam, clay loam and clay soil. The estimated alpha(dr) and n were compared with corresponding values measured in the same soils with the pressure plate technique and alpha(w) was contrasted with the corresponding value calculated with an empirical hysteresis model. The method, which was fast (from 1 to 2 h) and easy to implement for small-scale experiments, was successfully applied to soil samples 2.5 cm high and allowed to explore a range of soil tensions from 0 to-100 cm. Overall, accurate estimates of theta(s), K-s, alpha(dr) and n were obtained in both synthetic and experimental soils. A significant relationship was also obtained between alpha(w) estimated from S and the corresponding value calculated from the hysteresis model.

AB The temperature dependence of capillary pressure-saturation relationships was measured for air-water and perchloroethylene-water systems in silica sand. Changes in capillary pressures, irreducible water phase saturations, and residual nonwetting saturations with temperature were determined. Relationships for temperature dependence of contact angle and interfacial tension were incorporated into the van Genuchten [1980] model and fitted to the data. Capillary pressures a constant degrees of saturation decreased as temperature increased. Hysteresis decreased, irreducible water saturations increased, and residual nonwetting saturations decreased as temperature increased. The magnitude of the change in capillary pressures could not be explained by the temperature dependence of wetting-nonwetting interfacial tensions alone. Derived parameters for the temperature dependence of the contact angle predicted an increase of contact angle of roughly 45 degrees-50 degrees for air-water and perchloroethylene systems with a temperature increase from 20 degrees to 80 degrees C, while literature studies suggest that contact angles should decrease with increasing temperature. It was concluded that the parametric relationship for temperature effects incorporated into the van Genuchten [1980] model fit the data well, but other effects in addition to changes in interfacial tension and contact angle played a role in the temperature dependence of capillary pressure-saturation relationships.

TI Non-Darcian groundwater flow in leaky aquifers
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A simplified method has been developed for solving leaky aquifer non-Darcian flow hydraulics. The principle of volumetric approach is combined with the confined-aquifer, time-dependent drawdown equation in an observation well. The groundwater flow in the leaky aquifer is assumed to obey a non-Darcian flow law of exponential type. The results are obtained in the form of type-curve expressions from which the necessary bundles of curves are drawn for a set of selective non-Darcian flow aquifer parameters. Although application of the methodology appears as rather limited but it provides a scientific contribution and extension of leaky aquifer theory towards nonlinear flow conditions. The methodology developed herein is applied to some actual field data from the eastern sedimentary basin in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

AB Hydrodynamic features of the confluence zone of large rivers are complicated because of their three-dimensional flow structure. The confluence between the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimo similar to es, characterised by black and white waters, respectively, ranks among the largest river junctions on Earth. An Entropy-based investigation was carried out to assess the discharge and analyse the 2D structure of velocity distribution for large river flows relying on monitoring of near-surface velocity only. The estimated flow data where compared with in-situ ADCP data gathered across some transects of the Negro and Solimo similar to es rivers during both low and relatively high flow conditions. Results are illustrated through some transects at the confluence zone, upstream and downstream of the zone and in the Careiro Channel. Comparisons highlight that the Entropy-based flow velocity in terms of depth-averaged velocity, cross-sectional mean flow velocity and vertical velocity distributions, starting from the measured surface velocity, is in agreement with those determined by the ADCP measurements, with an error in mean flow velocity and discharge lower than 15%. The research highlights the potential of the Entropy method to estimate the discharge and velocity in very large rivers just relying on near-surface velocities monitoring.

ID RADAR
AB Snow water equivalent of a snowpack can be estimated using ground-penetrating radar from the radar wave two-way travel time. However, such estimates often have low accuracy when the snowpack contains liquid water. If snow wetness is known, it is possible to take it into account in the estimates; it is therefore desirable to be able to determine snow wetness from already available radar data. Our approach is based on using radar wave attenuation, and it requires that the relationship between electrical conductivity and wetness of snow should be known. This relationship has been tentatively established in previous laboratory experiments, but only for a specific liquid water salinity and radar frequency. This article presents the results of new laboratory experiments conducted to investigate if and how this relationship is influenced by salinity. In each experiment, a certain amount of snow was melted and a known amount of salt (different for different experiments) was added to the water. Water salinity was measured, and the water was added step-wise to a one-meter thick snowpack, with radar measurements taken between additions of water. Our experiments have confirmed the earlier established linear relationship between electrical conductivity and wetness of snow, and they allow us to suggest that the influence of liquid water salinity on electrical conductivity is negligible when compared to the influence of liquid water content in snow.

AB Efforts to restore rivers are increasingly concerned with the social implications of landscape change. However, the fundamental issue of how people make sense of local riverine environments in the context of restoration remains poorly understood. Our research examined influences on perception among local residents 14 years after a restoration scheme on the River Dearne in the north of England. Human-landscape relationships emerging from semi-structured interviews with 16 local residents were analysed using an interpretive research framework. Nine recurring factors influenced perception among local residents: scenic beauty; the condition of riparian vegetation and of river channel morphology; opportunities to observe flora and fauna; cleanliness of the riverine environment; access available to the river; connections between the river and the surrounding landscape; disturbance and change in the familiarity of the landscape following restoration. These factors were not solely related to tangible outcomes of the restoration scheme, but were also influenced by history, memories, traditions and practices associated with the river. Critically, these factors also interacted rather than operating in isolation and two idealised perceptual frameworks were developed to map these interactions. Our research contributes to theoretical understanding of the relationships between humans and landscape change, whilst also considering how restoration practice may better reflect these relationships. The importance of a social dimension to the template of possibilities for restoring any given river emerges, underpinning place-based design and implementation of river restoration schemes.

AB Water reservoir operating rules are typically derived based on the assumption of streamflow stationarity, however, this assumption could be undermined by climate change. Adaptive reservoir operation is one of the most effective strategies to support water resources management under non-stationarity, yet until now, adaptive strategies considering non-stationarity across multiple time scales are rarely investigated. We propose an adaptive reservoir operation framework that incorporates streamflow non-stationarity across time scales simultaneously. Specifically, we first decompose the streamflow into four frequency categories to detect non-stationarity features through reservoir operation simulations. Next, we incorporate the non-stationarity information from each frequency category into adaptive reservoir operation by using Bayesian Model Averaging. We apply this framework to reservoir operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River and evaluate its effectiveness with streamflow simulated from 21 general circulation models (GCMs) for two greenhouse gases emission scenarios. We find that streamflow non-stationarity from all GCMs varies by future period and frequency category. The proposed Bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework can detect streamflow non-stationarity across all frequency categories and predominantly outperforms conventional adaptive strategies, especially in terms of firm power output. In general, firm output increases under the Bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases. The proposed framework offers a robust approach to identify adaptive strategies for reservoir operation to address streamflow non-stationarity.

ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL
AB A technique is presented for empirical and parametric estimation of an average event unit hydrograph response curve solely from measured streamflow data for use in rainfall-runoff models with a focus on modelling flow for natural resource management. As the technique does not require rainfall data, the unit hydrograph can be derived solely from streamflow data at a temporal resolution appropriate for the response of the catchment. The response curves derived for a number of stations show a power law relationship of decay in flow after peak that can be described using a three-parameter function. The approach is best suited to ephemeral streamflow regimes dominated by surface and near-surface runoff (quick-flow component) where flow events are well-separated and largely independent of each other. Analysis of the derived unit hydrograph for 28 quick-flow-dominated catchments illustrates the range of parameter values obtained in fitting the power law. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the Budyko framework, this partitioning is quantified through the. parameter. Previous studies have modeled the physical representation of.; however, the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between. and the variables that it represents has not been investigated. This study uses a geographically weighted regression model to identify spatial variations in the factors that control the water balance in 126 reference watersheds with minimal human disturbance and 765 non-reference watersheds in the continental United States. Results show that snowfall and forest coverage are important predictors of. in the reference watersheds. Relative cumulative moisture surplus, dam storage, and developed land in riparian areas are important predictors in non-reference watersheds. Climate is a primary control of the relative importance of forest coverage. The importance of forest coverage is greater in arid watersheds than in humid watersheds. Snowfall is more important than forest coverage in the Northeast and Midwest. This study demonstrates that dam construction and urban sprawl have a significant impact in non-reference watersheds. Dam storage is the most important predictor in 21% of the non-reference watersheds, and riparian developed land is more important in 13% of the non-reference watersheds. Overall, there are statistically significant relationships between climatic, physiographic, and human-related factors and the. parameter. The spatial variations in the relationship quantified in this study can help to improve regional watershed management.

AB Current global warming causes a change in atmospheric dynamics, with consequent variations in the rainfall regimes. Understanding the relationship between global climate patterns, global warming, and rainfall regimes is crucial for the creation of future scenarios and for the relative modification of water management. The aim of this study is to improve knowledge of the relationship between North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA), and Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) with the seasonal rainfalls in Tuscany, Italy. The study area occupies a strategic position since it lies in a transition zone between the wet area of northern Europe and the dry area of the northern coast of Africa. This research, based on a statistical correlation method and on linear models, is designed to understand the relationship between seasonal rainfalls and climate patterns. The results of this study demonstrate that the use of linear models can yield more information than traditional statistical corre-lations. The results show a decrease in rainfall in the warm period of the year, namely in the summer, when its expression is most visible. This phenomenon is ascribable to current global warming, which causes an increase in sea-surface temperatures. An increase in the Northern Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature and in the Mediterra-nean Sea Surface Temperature causes a reduction of the Iceland Low, with an extension of the Azores High.

AB Groundwaters of the Winnipeg Formation have been found to have Ba concentrations in excess of drinking groundwater guidelines over an area of several hundred square kilometers. Water samples are at or near barite saturation, however SO4 concentrations are exceedingly low. This inequality suggests that SO4 is being lost from the groundwater, allowing for a buildup of Ba in solution as barite saturation is maintained. The focus of this study is to investigate the relationship between Ba and SO4 and its application to anomalously high Ba concentrations found in the formation. These relationships are investigated through the use of transport modeling in PhreeqC. The model consists of the mixing two end-member waters that are found within the formation, reacting the mixed water with dissolved organic carbon, and transporting the newly mixed and reacted water through the formation.

AB Compound extremes have increasingly become the focus of research in recent years, due to the strong impact they have upon society and ecosystems. Few studies, however, address the role of teleconnection patterns in these compound extremes, and how the former can be used to predict the latter. The present study quantifies the changes observed in the monthly frequencies of Dry-Warm, Dry-Cold, Wet-Warm and Wet-Cold concurrent extremes in the Mediterranean basin during the 1951-2020 period, and assesses the effect of different regional, continental and oceanic teleconnections upon the frequency of such concurrent extremes. Results reveal a significant increase, especially, in dry-warm months in large areas of the Mediterranean basin, mainly in summer and spring, as well as a decrease in wet-cold extremes in these seasons. On the other hand, the positive phase of the Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) has a strong capacity to drive dry-warm months in the western Mediterranean basin, as well as wet-cold extremes in the southern-east part of the Mediterranean basin. This role becomes inverted during the negative phase of this teleconnection. Furthermore, due to its subtropical linkage, the positive phase of the East Atlantic (EA) oscillation also plays an important role in accounting for the occurrence of dry-warm months in most of the Mediterranean basin, especially in the west and the north. During its negative mode, the configuration of the EA dipole favours the occurrence of wet-cold months, especially in the north and western part of the basin. The East Atlantic/Western Russia oscillation proved to be highly capable of inferring the ocurrence of dry-warm and wet-cold events in the eastern Mediterranean. The other teleconnections analysed (the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), and the Scandinavian (SCAND) an Polar-Eurasia (POLEUR) oscillations) played a minor role in driving these monthly concurrent extremes. The results provided by the present paper are intended to guide future research addressing the potential of teleconnection patterns to drive the temporal variability of compound extremes.

AB As a tool for addressing problems of scale, we consider an evolving approach known as the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT), which has broad applicability to hydrology. We consider the case of modeling of two-fluid-phase flow in porous media, and we focus on issues of scale as they relate to various measures of pressure, capillary pressure, and state equations needed to produce solvable models. We apply TCAT to perform physics-based data assimilation to understand how the internal behavior influences the macroscale state of two-fluid porous medium systems. A microfluidic experimental method and a lattice Boltzmann simulation method are used to examine a key deficiency associated with standard approaches. In a hydrologic process such as evaporation, the water content will ultimately be reduced below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation determined from experiments. This is problematic since the derived closure relationships cannot predict the associated capillary pressures for these states. We demonstrate that the irreducible wetting-phase saturation is an artifact of the experimental design, caused by the fact that the boundary pressure difference does not approximate the true capillary pressure. Using averaging methods, we compute the true capillary pressure for fluid configurations at and below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation. Results of our analysis include a state function for the capillary pressure expressed as a function of fluid saturation and interfacial area.

AB Streamflow simulation and forecasts have been widely used in water resources management, particularly for flood and drought analysis and for the determination of optimal operational rules for reservoir systems used for water supply and energy production. Here we include climate information in a periodic-auto-regressive model in order to provide monthly streamflow forecasts for 54 hydropower sites in Brazil. Large scale climate information is included in the model through the use of climate indices obtained from the sea surface temperature field of the tropical Pacific and sub-tropical Atlantic oceans and the low-level zonal wind field over southeast Brazil. Correlation analysis of climate predictors and streamflow data show that the dependence of the latter on climate variability is seasonal and also a function of the lead time of the forecasts. A ridge regression framework is adopted in order to shrink parameter estimates and improve model outputs. The proposed model is compared with an ordinary linear regression based model with predictors selected by the BIC criterion and with the classical linear periodic-auto-regressive model (PAR), where no climate information is used. Cross-validated results show that the inclusion of climate indexes is able to improve forecast skills up to 3 months lead time. Higher skills are observed for reservoirs with large catchment areas.

AB In this study, we have obtained numerical solutions for non-Darcian flow to a well with the finite difference method on the basis of the Izbash equation, which states that the hydraulic gradient is a power function of the specific discharge. The comparisons between the numerical solutions and the Boltzmann solutions and linearization solutions have also been done in this study. The results indicated that the linearization solutions for both the infinitesimal-diameter well and the finite-diameter well agree very well with the numerical solution at late times, while the linearization method underestimates the dimensionless drawdown at early and moderate times. The Boltzmann method works well as an approximate analytical solution for the infinitesimal-diameter well. Significant differences have been found between the Boltzmann solution for a finite-diameter well and the numerical solution during the entire pumping period. The analysis of the numerical solution implies that all the type curves inside the well for different dimensionless non-Darcian conductivity k(D) values approach the same asymptotic value at early times, while a larger k(D) leads to a smaller drawdown inside the well at late times. A larger k(D) results in a larger drawdown in the aquifer at early times and a smaller drawdown in the aquifer at late times. Flow approaches steady-state earlier when k(D) is larger.

AB Understanding the hydraulics around injection and production wells in unconfined aquifers associated with rainwater and reclaimed water aquifer storage schemes is an issue of increasing importance. Much work has been done previously to understand the mathematics associated with Darcy's law in this context. However, groundwater flow velocities around injection and production wells are likely to be sufficiently large such as to induce significant non-Darcy effects. This article presents a mathematical analysis to look at Forchheimer's equation in the context of water injection and water production in unconfined aquifers. Three different approximate solutions are derived using quasi-steady-state assumptions and the method of matched asymptotic expansion. The resulting approximate solutions are shown to be accurate for a wide range of practical scenarios by comparison with a finite difference solution to the full problem of concern. The approximate solutions have led to an improved understanding of the flow dynamics. They can also be used as verification tools for future numerical models in this context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate methods of latent heat flux quantification are essential for water management and for use in hydrological and meteorological models. Currently the effect of small lakes in most numerical weather prediction modelling systems is either entirely ignored or crudely parameterized. In order to test methods for modelling hourly latent heat flux from small water bodies, this study compares results from several modelling approaches to values measured by the eddy covariance method at an agricultural reservoir in southeast Queensland, Australia. Mass transfer estimates of LE calculated using the theoretical mass transfer model and using the Tanny et al. (2008) and Sacks et al. (1994) bulk transfer coefficients showed the best relationship with measured values under a range of meteorological conditions. The theoretical model showed the strongest correlation with measured values, while the Tanny et al. (2008) and Sacks et al. (1994) models had regression equation slopes with the closest proximity to 1. Latent heat fluxes estimated using the Granger and Hedstrom (2011) evaporation model, that was specifically developed for use at small reservoirs, showed a poor relationship with measured values, particularly in stable atmospheric conditions. The 1-dimensional hydrodynamics model, DYRESM, was used to obtain predictions of hourly latent heat flux without the use of water surface temperature measurements. DYRESM estimates of latent heat flux showed a slightly worse relationship with measured values than those predicted using the traditional mass transfer models (which used measurements of water surface temperature). However, DYRESM performed considerably better than the Granger and Hedstrom (2011) model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nonlinear relationships across spatially-distributed irrigation, actual evapotranspiration and crop yield, and interactions between agriculture and ecology aggravate difficulties in water, land and fertilizer resources opti-mization. To address the above problems, this paper developed a framework of footprint families based multi -objective type-2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming (FFMOT2FRCCP). It integrated the multi -objective programming (MOP), footprint families, interval type-2 AHP (IT2AHP), type-2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming (T2FRCCP) with spatially-distributed water production functions. Spatially distributed irrigation-yield functions and irrigation-actual evapotranspiration functions were fitted simultaneously to simulate spatial heterogeneous yield considering nonlinear relationships across irrigation, actual evapotranspi-ration and yield. It overcomes disadvantages of traditional functions in neglecting spatially-distributed water transfers between irrigation and evapotranspiration. Interactive relationships between agricultural and ecolog-ical effects were measured by footprint families containing water, carbon ecological and energy footprint concurrently based on the life cycle approach. Besides, both water shortage risk and yield loss risk were quan-tified and controlled with consideration of their conduction machines. Moreover, weights across footprint families and risks were determined by the IT2AHP approach by taking compound uncertainties of subjectivities of mangers into account. In addition, uncertainties of the runoff were handled by T2FRCCP approach. The model was applied to Yingke irrigation district to verify its application. Resulted showed that (1) ecological footprint decreased, energy footprint, carbon footprint and risks enlarged when flow levels changed though its high, medium and low levels; (2) yield loss risk varied from 0 to 0.27 while water shortage risk changed from 0.13 to 0.32, and crop yield losses occurred after water shortage risk took place; (3) the actual evapotranspiration presented mismatching variations with yield because of their various irrigation thresholds. The results could offer insight in how to measure and handle nonlinear relationships amid distributed actual evapotranspiration and yield under various water allocation schemes. Besides, the results could provide optimal decisions giving consideration of agricultural and ecological balances for managers.

AB Understanding and modeling both flow and solute transport within heterogeneous soils, such as a macroporous soil, are of primary concern nowadays in tackling the problem of predicting water resources and soil contamination. Traditional conceptual approaches have proven inadequate for describing preferential solute transfer through macropores and the dependence of such transfer on macropore characteristics (continuity, tortuosity, hydraulic properties, etc.). The enhancement of preferential flow and nonreactive solute transfer through a cylindrical macropore in a sandy matrix has been studied under hydric conditions through laboratory column experiments. Numerical modeling based on the Darcy-Buckingham Law for both the macropore and matrix along with macropore-matrix system geometry is not able to generate an accurate fit. An additional modeling step has indicated that the preferential flow path zone must be considered as extending around the macropore. Such a result illustrates that the major effect of macropores may be much more significant than would be predicted through the typical, conceptual dual-permeability approaches and thus deserves further research.

AB As human activity and climate variability alter the movement of water through the environment the need to better understand hydrologic cycle responses to these changes has grown. A reasonable starting point for gaining such insight is studying changes in streamflow given the importance of streamflow as a source of renewable freshwater. Using a wavelet assisted method we analyzed trends in the magnitude of annual scale streamflow variability from 967 watersheds in the continental U.S. (CONUS) over a 70 year period (1940-2009). Decreased annual variability was the dominant pattern at the CONUS scale. Ecoregion scale results agreed with the CONUS pattern with the exception of two ecoregions closely divided between increases and decreases and one where increases dominated. A comparison of trends in reference and non-reference watersheds indicated that trend magnitudes in non-reference watersheds were significantly larger than those in reference watersheds. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models were used to study the relationship between watershed characteristics and the magnitude of trends in stream-flow. At the CONUS scale, the balance between precipitation and evaporative demand, and measures of geographic location were of high relative importance. Relationships between the magnitude of trends and watershed characteristics at the ecoregion scale exhibited differences from the CONUS results and substantial variability was observed among ecoregions. Additionally, the methodology used here has the potential to serve as a robust framework for top-down, data driven analyses of the relationships between changes in the hydrologic cycle and the spatial context within which those changes occur.

AB This paper proposes a domain decomposed finite element method (DDFEM) for groundwater flow velocity simulation, which can effectively and efficiently deal with arbitrarily oriented or intersected material interfaces in heterogeneous porous media. The main idea of this problem is to employ domain decompose technique to break the velocity problem down to subproblems by material interfaces, thereby achieving high accuracy at interface nodes and improving the velocity computation efficiency. By solving the global flow field by FEM before velocity computation, this method can capture the global information of the whole study region so as to ensure the subproblem solution accuracy by Yeh's model. After one subproblem has been solved, the DDFEM employs refraction law to obtain the Dirichlet boundary velocities of the adjacent subdomains. Numerical examples have been done to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Comparison between the DDFEM and two classical methods shows that the DDFEM can indeed save much computational cost, while achieving high accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Internal erosion phenomena are a major threat to all earthen structures, such as river levees and dams. Studying these phenomena has been limited because they occur concealed inside the material, which makes them difficult to observe and monitor. Non-destructive geophysical monitoring techniques are powerful tools that can provide insight into the processes involved. For this reason, a test rig has been specifically designed to conduct three-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography of soil specimens undergoing internal erosion due to seepage. Two suffusion tests were conducted where the erosion evolution has been monitored. The time-series of eroded mass weight were then used to correlate the changes in three-dimensional resistivity distribution to the porosity change in media by means of Archie's law. The results from the first suffusion test were used to calibrate Archie's model parameters. It was found that the resistivity variations were able to predict changes in the porous matrix structure. The data obtained from the second test were used to validate the model parameters and confirmed that the time-lapse three-dimensional inverted resistivity images were able to successfully quantify the global erosion rate.

DE permeability; distribution; uncertainty; variability; beta distribution;
   lognormal distribution
AB The permeability of a single hydrostratigraphic unit is associated with considerable uncertainty due to measurement errors and significant spatial variability. Historically this uncertainty is characterized by a lognormal distribution. This distribution is generally heavy tailed, so using this distribution to describe the permeability has the limitation that all positive values of permeability for a given hydrostratigraphic unit have positive (not zero) probability of occurrence. The beta distribution, with its bounded domain, is explored as an alternative to the lognormal distribution in describing the uncertainty of permeability.
   The lognormal distribution and the beta distribution are both fit to the historic data provided by Jan Law in 1944 that was used to generalize the statement that the uncertainty in the permeability follows a lognormal distribution. The lognormal distribution and the beta distribution are also fit to an extensive permeability data set taken from regions within the Dakota Sandstone that have been shown to represent a single hydrostratigraphic unit. The results of this curve fitting exercise indicate that the beta distribution is a viable alternative to the lognormal distribution to characterize the uncertainty in permeability.

AB Drainage and deformation of intercalated confining layers due to internal stress change (discharge/recharge cycle) in an aquifer-aquitard system not only can have great effects on the groundwater storage (GWS), but also can cause unsynchronized water level (WL) fluctuations. The phase relationship between GWS and WL is crucial for the accuracy and attribution of GWS changes. We identify the dominating episodic components of GWS and WL through the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) analysis and Harmonic analysis. First, we analyzed a generic aquifer-aquitard system using numerical simulations which showed that the dissipation of overpressure from the aquitard and flow from it is the inherent cause of a phase shift between the GWS and WL observations. Water released from confining layers with compaction time constant of zero (no-delay) to century time scale results in detected phase shift between total GWS and WL in the aquifer. Then, we analyzed the complex and varied phase relationship between GWS derived using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and measured WL time series in the subsiding North China Plain (NCP) aquifer. The spatially varied phase relationship between GWS and measured WL is reasonably related to varied land subsidence development features and may be related with the compaction time constant and thickness of the confining layers. Results of the generic numerical model and the NCP observations suggest that elastic/inelastic response need to be considered in the interpretation and correction of GWS changes for a compacted aquifer-aquitard system.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Reactive transport; Porosity; Permeability
AB Numerical programs for simulating flow and reactive transport in porous media is essential for predicting reservoir properties related to CO2 sequestration performance, subsurface storage and risk assessment. In this paper we solve the Navier Stokes' equation using finite difference method, on a simulated porous rock structure, to study the velocity distribution of fluid flowing through it under a constant pressure gradient. A reactive solute carried through the fluid is allowed to interact with the minerals in the rock. This chemical reaction dissolves the mineral which changes the rock structure thus affecting its flow properties. These changes of flow properties are studied with variation in reactive solute concentration and pressure field. The different mechanisms of dissolution responsible for the variation of flow properties for the different parameters is predicted. Before the onset of homogeneous dissolution, variation in porosity follows a power-law behaviour with change in permeability when the latter is scaled by the concentration of the reactive species. The simulation results are compared with available experimental data and found to give a reasonable match. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration was determined to be hydrological effect which induces suction. Evapotranspiration induced suction governs the slope stability, ground water recharge and runoff. This study focuses on suction induced in root zone of mix grass used in green infrastructure. Most of the previous studies focused on evapotranspiration induced suction less than 100 kPa measured using tensiometers. However, for investigating the drought condition, it is essential to obtain suction data greater than 100 kPa. It was noted that the response of plant parameters such as stomatal conductance and surface area were not considered holistically evapotranspiration induced suction. The main objective of this study is to investigate relationship among evapotranspiration induced suction, stomatal conductance and surface area for a mix grass species used in green infrastructure subjected to drought stress (corresponds to suction > 100 kPa). Stomatal conductance was observed to increase up to suction (6 +/- 1 kPa) corresponding to volumetric field capacity. Thereafter, large decrease (more than 90%) in stomatal conductance was found with an increase in suction. Stomatal conductance was found to be 0 at 2431 kPa (i.e., wilting point). Change in normalized surface areas of mix grass was found to be relatively low (within +/- 15%) with an increase in suction up to 138 kPa. However, beyond 138 kPa, it varied drastically (by 31-68%) with an increase in suction from 138 kPa to 3642 kPa. Two new relationships i.e., Stomatal conductance characteristic curve (SCCC) and surface area characteristic curve (SACC) were proposed. Therefore, the relationships developed in current study help to analyze the performance of green infrastructure accurately.

ID SELECTION; MODEL; DESIGN
AB In the present study a deterministic quantitative model based on graph theory has been developed for the better development and management of watershed. Graph theory is an integrative systems approach to consider and model structural components of watershed management system along with the interrelationships between them concurrently and integratively. The factors responsible for the development of watershed system are identified. The degree of interaction between one subsystem with others are determined. The eigenvalue formulation is used to take care the inconsistencies arises due to inaccurate judgement in the degree of interaction between the subsystems. In this model the visual analysis is done to abstract the information using the directed graph or digraph. Then the matrix model is developed for computer processing. Variable permanent function in the form of multinomial represents the watershed system uniquely and completely by an index value. Different terms of the multinomial represent all possible subsystems of integrated watershed management system and thus different solutions for watershed management, leading to optimum solution. This index value is used to compare the suitability of the watershed with different alternatives available for its development. So the graph theory analysis presents a powerful tool to generate the optimum solutions for the decision maker for benefit of local people living in the watershed as well as the stakeholders. The proposed methodology is also demonstrated by a suitable example and is applied to the ecosystem and environment subsystem of the lake Qionghai watershed in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the propagation dynamics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts and their spatial-temporal evolution is essential for monitoring and assessing groundwater drought risk. In this study, the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Groundwater Drought Index (GDI) were used for assessing meteorological and groundwater droughts, respectively, in the North China Plain (NCP). The Directed Information Transfer Index (DITI) was used to identify the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts. The verification results indicated good reliability of GRACE data for assessing drought events in the NCP. From the view of temporal variation, the SPEI1 was first decreased and then increased, and the minimum value was in 2011. The GDI was first increased and then decreased, and the maximum was in 2008. In terms of spatial distribution, the SPEI-1 significantly decreased in the central part of the NCP before 2011. The 2011-2020 period revealed an increasing trend in SPEI-1 in many parts of the NCP. According to the GDI results, an increasing trend was observed in the central and western parts of the NCP before 2008, and many parts of the study region revealed a decreasing trend in GDI during the 2008-2020 period. The propagation time of SPEI-1 to GDI was long in spring and winter and short in summer. The maximum DITI values ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 and the most spread time was about 18 to 24 months in the northern and southern parts of Hebei and the northern part of Henan province, covering 36.40% of the total surface area of the NCP. Regarding the drought sensitivity and propagation rate, the dominated distribution was in a pattern of high in the northern and low in southern parts of the NCP, with the rates of 38.44% and 34.17%, respectively.

AB Flooding is a significant threat to life and property in Hawaii. As climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in the tropics, characterizing the shifting patterns in magnitude, seasonality, and location of floods would improve our understanding of the consequences and better prepare us for future flood events. In this study, 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges across five major Hawaiian Islands were analyzed from 1970 to 2005. We estimated trends in the annual maximum daily rainfall (RFmax) and the annual peak flow (PFmax) using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope. Subsequently, we examined the association between PF(max )and rainfall. Then, we assessed temporal shifting by combining circular analysis with SeMs slope. The main identified trends showed decreases in RF max and PF max (67% and 61% of all gauges, respectively). The physiography of the Hawaiian islands (i.e., windward vs. leeward) has little contribution to both trends. In addition, PF max trend cannot be fully attributed to RFmax trend, and in many cases, RFmax and PF max did not occur coincidently. We also found the timing of RFmax and PFmax occurred in early wet season during the El Nino years and shifted even earlier from 1970 to 2005, likely due to the change of El Nino. These findings have implications for assessing flood risk. Our finding will aid watershed management and flood mitigation, and can increase resilience of downstream communities and near-shore environments.

ID QUESTION
AB The goal of the study is to strengthen the analytical purchase of the term water governance and improve the utility of the concept for describing and analyzing actual water distribution processes. We argue this is necessary as most writing on water governance is more concerned with promoting particular politically inspired agendas of what water governance should be than with understanding what it actually is. We believe that water governance at heart is about political choices as to where water should flow; about the norms, rules and laws on which such choices should be based; about who is best able or qualified to decide about this; and about the kind of societal future such choices support. We identify distributions-of water, voice and authority, and expertise-as the empirical anchor and entry-point of our conceptualization of water governance. This usefully allows foregrounding questions of equity in water governance discussions and provides the empirical foundation for a meaningful engagement with the politics of water governance.

TI Variable parameter McCarthy-Muskingum routing method considering lateral

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Hydrograph; Flood routing; Lateral flow; Parameter optimization
AB The fully mass conservative variable parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) method recently proposed by Perumal and Price (2013) for routing floods in channels and rivers without considering lateral flow is extended herein for accounting uniformly distributed lateral flow contribution along the reach. The proposed procedure is applied for studying flood wave movement in a 24.2 km river stretch between Rottweil and Oberndorf gauging stations of Neckar River in Germany wherein significant lateral flow contribution by intermediate catchment rainfall prevails during flood wave movement. The geometrical elements of the cross-sectional information of the considered routing river stretch without considering lateral flow are estimated using the Robust Parameter Estimation (ROPE) algorithm that allows for arriving at the best performing set of bed width and side slope of a trapezoidal section. The performance of the VPMM method is evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency criterion as the objective function to be maximized using the ROPE algorithm. The twenty-seven flood events in the calibration set are considered to identify the relationship between 'total rainfall' and 'total losses' as well as to optimize the geometric characteristics of the prismatic channel (width and slope of the trapezoidal section). Based on this analysis, a relationship between total rainfall and total loss of the intermediate catchment is obtained and then used to estimate the lateral flow in the reach. Assuming the lateral flow hydrograph is of the form of inflow hydrograph and using the total intervening catchment runoff estimated from the relationship, the uniformly distributed lateral flow rate q(L), at any instant of time is estimated for its use in the VPMM routing method. All the 27 flood events are simulated using this routing approach considering lateral flow along the reach. Many of these simulations are able to simulate the observed hydrographs very closely. The proposed approach of accounting lateral flow using the VPMM method is independently verified by routing flood hydrograph of 6 flood events which are not used in the total rainfall vs total loss relationship established for the intervening catchment of the studied river reach. Close reproduction of the outflow hydrographs of these independent events using the proposed VPMM method accounting for lateral flow demonstrate the practical utility of the method.

AB Some of the latest global paradigms in sustainable water governance revolve around ideas of promoting greater integration within policy implementation processes that impact on land and water. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), seen by many as a 'Sustainability Directive', reflects this trend, and places particular emphasis on building linkages between water management and land use planning. This paper presents the results of a research project that examined this integrative vision in a real world setting - the emerging relationship between the WFD's river basin management planning (RBMP) framework and the development planning (DP) system in Scotland. The project's approach draws from interpretive policy analysis, and the results are based on analyses of key policy documents, as well as in-depth interviews, primarily with land use planning staff from local authorities, as well as other relevant public agencies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The results show how an overarching political objective of 'increasing sustainable economic growth' is significantly affecting stakeholders' understandings of the RBMP-DP relationship, as well as their own roles and responsibilities within that relationship. This has created barriers to the deliberation and potential operationalisation of environmental limits to growth in the built environment, which may be skewing decision-making processes in a way that undermines the RBMP framework and its objectives of protecting and improving the water environment.

AB A major contaminant transport process in soils is hydrodynamic dispersion by affecting the spreading and arrival of surface-applied pollutants at underlying groundwater reservoirs. When a soil is unsaturated, hydrodynamic dispersion is very much affected by soil water saturation. Centimeter- and decimeter-scale column experiments were carried out to explore the effects of fluid saturation and particle size on the unsaturated solute dispersivity. Measured in-situ breakthrough curves were analyzed in terms of both classical advection-dispersion and dual-porosity (mobile-immobile) type transport equations. A clear non-monotonic relationship was found between the dispersivity and soil water saturation. The extent of non-monotonicity was more pronounced for a relatively coarse-textured sand compared to a finer sand. This finding has been reported rarely before; it explains some of the inconsistencies of saturation-dispersivity relationships in the literature.

TI DEMODULATION-REMODULATION REVISITED - THEORY AND APPLICATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In modeling periodic hydrologic series, the amplitudes and phase angles of the harmonics reflect the magnitudes and timing of the seasonal peaks.  Demodulation-remodulation captures the temporal variations in these stochastic parameters, thereby providing useful information and more accurate models than traditional Fourier series models.  Unfortunately, this technique has been neglected by hydrologic modelers.  In this paper, application of the technique to a synthetic series validates the theory.  The technique is then applied to the streamflow record of the Uda Walawe River which exhibits a strong bimodal annual pattern.  Fourteen models are developed, providing a comparison between moving average filters commonly used in demodulation studies, the Fourier filter used in Fourier series analysis, and composite models which incorporate both filters.  In addition, the development of a prototype forecasting filter demonstrates the viability of using demodulation-remodulation for forecasting.

AB Large-scale hydrological and water resource models (LHMs) require water storage and release schemes to represent flow regulation by reservoirs. Owing to a lack of observed reservoir operations, state-of-the-art LHMs deploy a generic reservoir scheme that may fail to represent local operating behaviors. Here we introduce a new dataset of bespoke water storage and release policies for 1,930 reservoirs of conterminous United States. The Inferred Storage Targets and Release Functions (ISTARF-CONUS) dataset relies on a new inventory of observed daily reservoir operations (ResOpsUS) to generate reservoir operating rules for 595 data-rich reservoirs. These functions are developed in a standardized form that allows for extrapolation of operating schemes to 1,335 data-scarce reservoirs-leading to the first inventory of empirically derived reservoir operating policies for all large CONUS reservoirs documented in the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD) database. Evaluation of the new scheme in daily simulations forced with observed inflow demonstrates substantial and robust improvement for both release and storage relative to the popular Hanasaki method. Performance of the extrapolation approach for data-scarce reservoirs is evaluated with leave-one-out validation and is shown to also offer modest gains on average over Hanasaki. ISTARF-CONUS may be readily adopted in any LHM featuring large reservoirs of the conterminous United States.

AB Numerical experiments have been carried out with a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model to study the impact of spatial variability in soil and land surface parameters on regional-scale water balance components. A statistical-dynamical approach has been used to account for the spatial variability of the selected parameters and to determine the seasonal evolution of the impact on the water budget. Point data are used to derive probability-density functions for the thickness of the permeable top soil layer, coefficients for the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves, the leaf area index and the minimum stomatal resistance. These distributions are incorporated in the model's mathematical framework in order to generate univariate distributions (sensitivity patterns) for evaporation, transpiration, total evaporation and runoff. The means of these univariate distributions of outputs yield catchment-scale averages. Next, the study obtains catchment-scale evaporation estimates by running simulations with aggregated parameters obtained as statistical descriptors of parameter distributions. The difference between the catchment-scale averages and values obtained with aggregated parameters describes the non-linear response of the model to spatial variability of the particular parameter. Finally, the study also investigates several effective parameters based on recently described hydrometeorological aggregation rules. Results show significant differences in sensitivity patterns between individual parameters and between seasons. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between stream discharge and the concentration of different solutes reflects the hydrological processes occurring in a catchment, but is also strongly affected by antecedent moisture conditions. In this study, the effects of antecedent conditions were examined for a small forested watershed near Montreal (Quebec) by comparing data from sequences of fall events for two years of contrasting antecedent moisture conditions. The relationship between discharge and stream water chemistry was also quantified using crosscorrelation analysis. Results show that concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, nitrate and calcium increased during storm events with dry antecedent conditions but that the relationships were weaker under wet conditions. For both years, concentrations of sulfate, silicon and sodium and the pH were negatively correlated with discharge (cross-correlations from -0.20 to -0.53). With dry antecedent conditions, there was a general decrease in the concentration of all solutes with time, whereas concentrations remained at about the same level under wet conditions. The concentration-discharge relationships for sulfate shifted frequently from higher concentrations during the rising limb to higher concentrations during the falling limb from one event to another as a result of changing antecedent conditions. Although the contrast in antecedent moisture conditions between the two years was moderate in comparison with that reported in other studies (25% dryer than average in 1995 and 12% wetter than average in 1996), the hydrochemistry of the stream was markedly different.

AB Arresting the recent observed warming of the earth's climate is a challenge requiring the reduction of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. One option for reducing emissions into the atmosphere is to capture and sequester the released carbon dioxide in geological formations. However, potential geological storage first requires a risk assessment of carbon dioxide escaping to overlying layers and back to the atmosphere through leakage pathways in the formation. This, in turn, requires an understanding of fluid flow through the leakage pathways. In this study, the effect of leakage pathways on the flow of a gravity current was investigated, using an analogue system, a Hele-Shaw cell. Fluid was introduced through the top edge of the cell and flowed out through one or more holes in its impermeable base. The height of the accumulated fluid above the base of the cell at various points along its length and the outflow rate of fluid through the holes was measured. This measurement was conducted with varying conditions of the location, number and strength of source as well as the location and number of holes. At steady state, the fluid motion was in accordance with Darcy's law for horizontal flow in a long thin current. In another set of experiments, in which inflow was stopped and the fluid was allowed to drain out of a single open hole, the outflow rate was in accordance with Darcy's law for one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction until the fluid height above the hole fell below a certain limit. This threshold height was found to be 1.3 cm, which was similar in magnitude to the length of the hole. A time series of photographs tracked the flow of colored dye. The photographs demonstrated that at steady state the fluid traveled for some distance beyond the hole before draining through it. This implies that contaminants may be transported in a formation even beyond an outlet before finally draining out through it. The photographs also documented the shape of the interface between the newly introduced dye and the ambient fluid in the cell. These shapes were found to be different in a cell placed horizontally versus one placed on an incline, suggesting that the geometry and flow conditions in a formation affecting the transport of an injected fluid. These findings may be used as a basis for predicting behavior of a fluid injected into a fractured formation in the subsurface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland vegetation requires water-logged conditions for peat-forming plant communities to survive. Changes in water regimes have been found to alter the soil environment and cause shifts in species composition. Occa-sionally, the spatial and chronological constraints in water table monitoring impede the correct evaluation of the status of these sensitive ecohydrological systems. Therefore, it is important to combine in situ and remote sensing methods to assess ecohydrological diversity over large areas of threatened peatland ecosystems. The present study assessed the relationship between hydrological indicators (the in situ water table fluctuations of 57 mea-surement wells and five study plots in the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons); botanical indicators (in situ species composition in three raised bog habitat types, namely, bog woodland, a semi-open raised bog, and an open raised bog); and spectral indices (NDVI - Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and NDWI - Normalised Difference Water Index, 2015-2020, Sentinel 2) for the evaluation of heterogeneous raised bog spatial patterns and tem-poral change. There were statistically significant relationships between vegetation and water table depth in different raised bog habitat types. Deeper water tables prevailed in woodland habitats (trees, green mosses, Rhododendron tomentosum) and vice versa in areas where open raised bog plants (Sphagnum) occupied the sur-face. Moderate relationships (r > |0.4|, p <.05) were detected between some of the botanical and hydrological indicators and spectral indices. The application of high-resolution remote sensing data may be useful for raised bog measurements, and changes in vegetation cover and related spectral indices may become hydroclimatic indicators.

AB This paper presents a new laboratory method to simultaneously estimate K-s and a and n parameters of the van Genuchten (1980) theta(h) from the inverse analysis of an upward infiltration curve measured in a 5-cm high soil column. The method was evaluated on synthetic 1D infiltration curves generated for a theoretical loamy sand, loam and clay soil. The influence of the soil initial condition on the inverse analysis was also studied. Next, an optimization method was presented and tested on eight theoretical soils (from loamy sand to clay). The method was subsequently applied to experimental curves measured on five sieved soils (from sand to clay) packed in 5-cm high and diameter cylinders. The K-s, alpha and n values estimated from the inverse analysis of the experimental curves were compared to those measured by Darcy and the pressure cell method (PC). The initial soil tension, h(i), which had an important influence on the optimization, was fixed to - 6.0.10(5) cm. The optimization method resulted robust and allowed accurate estimates of the actual hydraulic parameters. A close to one relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was observed between the theoretical a and n and the corresponding values obtained with the inverse analysis. Regarding to the experimental soils, significant relationships close to one were obtained between K-s and n (R-2 > 0.98) estimated from inverse analysis and those measured with Darcy and PC. A nonsignificant relationship with slope away from one was found for alpha.

AB Soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology, meteorology and agriculture. Soil moisture, and surface soil moisture in particular, is highly variable in space and time. Its spatial and temporal patterns in agricultural landscapes are affected by multiple natural (precipitation, soil, topography, etc.) and agro-economic (soil management, fertilization, etc.) factors, making it difficult to identify unequivocal cause and effect relationships between soil moisture and its driving variables. The goal of this study is to characterize and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of surface soil moisture (top 20 cm) in an intensively used agricultural landscape (1100 km(2) northern part of the Rur catchment, Western Germany) and to determine the dominant factors and underlying processes controlling these patterns. A second goal is to analyze the scaling behavior of surface soil moisture patterns in order to investigate how spatial scale affects spatial patterns. To achieve these goals, a dynamically coupled, process-based and spatially distributed ecohydrological model was used to analyze the key processes as well as their interactions and feedbacks. The model was validated for two growing seasons for the three main crops in the investigation area: Winter wheat, sugar beet, and maize. This yielded RMSE values for surface soil moisture between 1.8 and 7.8 vol.% and average RMSE values for all three crops of 0.27 kg m(-2) for total aboveground biomass and 0.93 for green LAI. Large deviations of measured and modeled soil moisture can be explained by a change of the infiltration properties towards the end of the growing season, especially in maize fields. The validated model was used to generate daily surface soil moisture maps, serving as a basis for an autocorrelation analysis of spatial patterns and scale. Outside of the growing season, surface soil moisture patterns at all spatial scales depend mainly upon soil properties. Within the main growing season, larger scale patterns that are induced by soil properties are superimposed by the small scale land use pattern and the resulting small scale variability of evapotranspiration. However, this influence decreases at larger spatial scales. Most precipitation events cause temporarily higher surface soil moisture autocorrelation lengths at all spatial scales for a short time even beyond the autocorrelation lengths induced by soil properties. The relation of daily spatial variance to the spatial scale of the analysis fits a power law scaling function, with negative values of the scaling exponent, indicating a decrease in spatial variability with increasing spatial resolution. High evapotranspiration rates cause an increase in the small scale soil moisture variability, thus leading to large negative values of the scaling exponent. Utilizing a multiple regression analysis, we found that 53% of the variance of the scaling exponent can be explained by a combination of an independent LAI parameter and the antecedent precipitation.

AB Freshwater ice affects several physical, chemical, and biological processes in cold regions. Its duration and break-up also has numerous economic implications ranging from transportation, to the occurrence and severity of ice-jam flooding. Recent evidence indicates a shortening of the freshwater-ice season over much of Canada with the reduction being mainly attributable to earlier break-ups. These trends match those in surface air temperature during the last 50 years. Several studies have shown significant relationships between Canadian temperature and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations (i.e. teleconnections) particularly, during the cold season. However, no investigations have analyzed relationships between several teleconnection indices and historical freshwater-ice durations over Canada. This paper examines the impacts of Et Niho/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern, the North Pacific (NP) index, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) on Canadian freshwater-ice break/freeze-up dates from 1950-1999. Composite and correlation analyses reveal strongest links between the Pacific-related PDO, PNA, NP, and ENSO indices and ice dates over western Canada. Lakes have stronger and more spatially coherent results than rivers, while break-up dates have higher correlations as compared to freeze-up. The NAO/AO results are less coherent with no discernible impacts over any region of the country. Results from this analysis improve the understanding of relationships between large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations and past freshwater-ice durations over Canada. They also provide insight into future regional changes to take and river ice given projected changes to teleconnection patterns. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The accurate estimation of "true" reservoir inflow is important for hydrological forecasting and efficient operation of reservoirs. However, reservoir inflow estimated using the conventional simple water balance method is not always accurate because the estimation is very sensitive to errors in reservoir water level observations and uncertainty in the stage-storage relationship. An analytical method (AM) and a method using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) are proposed to determine nonfluctuating reservoir inflow based on the concept of inflow continuity; that is, that inflow should not change much within a short time period. The AM is developed based on the simultaneous minimization of both the estimated reservoir water level error and the inflow variation. The EnKF, which is built on state equations (inflow continuity and water balance equations) and an observation equation (the reservoir stage-storage relationship), is used to update inflow states by assimilating water level observations. The two proposed methods are evaluated using a synthetic experiment with various conditions including water level observation error, reservoir stage-storage relationship error, and the influence of water surface slope. The AM outperforms the EnKF under all conditions. Case studies of the Gaobazhou and Danjiangkou Reservoirs in China demonstrate that both of the proposed methods can derive an hourly inflow without fluctuations. The results indicate that the AM and the EnKF method can improve reservoir inflow estimation compared with conventional methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Henry and Elder problems are once more numericatly studied using an efficient model based on the Network Simulation Method, which takes advantage of the powerful algorithms implemented in modern circuit simulation software. The network model of the volume element, which is directly deduced from the finite-difference differential equations of the spatially discretized governing equations, under the streamfunction formulation, is electrically connected to adjacent networks to conform the whole model of the medium to which the boundary conditions are added using adequate electrical devices. Coupling between equations is directly implemented in the model. Very few, simple rules are needed to design the model, which is run in a circuit simulation code to obtain the results with no added mathematical manipulations. Different versions of the Henry problem, as well. as the Elder problem, are simulated and the solutions are successfully compared with the analytical and numerical solutions of other authors or codes. A grid convergence study for the Henry problem was also carried out to determine the grid size with negligible numerical dispersion, while a similar study was carried out with the Elder problem in order to compare the patterns of the solution with those of other authors. Computing times are relatively small for this kind of problem. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A stochastic unsaturated flow theory and a numerical simulation model have been coupled in order to estimate the large-scale mean behavior of an unsaturated flow system in a spatially variable soil. On the basis of the theoretical developments of Mantoglou and Gelhar (1987a, b, c), the theory assumes that the local hydraulic soil properties are realizations of three-dimensional random fields, and it derives the large-scale flow structure by averaging the local governing flow equation over the ensemble. The resulting mean model representation is in the form of a partial differential equation, similar to the local flow equation. in which effective model parameters occur (e.g., effective hydraulic conductivity). Further, the theory predicts the variance (prediction error) of the capillary tension head due to the spatial variability of the local hydraulic soil properties. The governing unsaturated flow equation representing the mean system behavior is solved using a finite difference numerical solution technique. The effective parameters are evaluated from the stochastic theory formulas before entering them into the numerical solution for each iteration. The stochastic model is applied to a field site in Denmark, where information is available on the spatial variability of soil parameters and variables. Numerical simulations have been carried out, and predictions of the mean behavior and the variance of the capillary tension head and the soil moisture content have been compared to field observations. The stochastic model predicts the average system behavior reasonably well. Reasonable results are also obtained for the range of variation of the capillary tension head, despite the limited number of measurements and corresponding statistical inference issues. The stochastic model presented here seems to offer a rational framework for modeling large-scale unsaturated flow and estimating areal averages of soil-hydrological processes in spatially variable soils.

AB A novel one-step similarity approach for the regionalization of hydrological parameters has been developed. The method automatically associates model parameters (MP) with catchment descriptors (CD), using techniques based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM-B). The combination of the one-step approach with the automatic association reduces the problem of equifinality and avoids subjective predefinition of relationships between CDs and MPs. Further positive properties of the SOM-B are the feasibility to use discrete variables as CDs and the ability to capture interdependencies between MPs.
   The SOM-B was validated against a known one-step regionalization method which is based on linear transfer functions (LT-B). Furthermore the influence of different factors like combination CDs, or size of the SOM, on the regionalization performance of the SOM-B was analyzed. The hydrological model used for the evaluations was a modified version of the HBV-IWS, which simulates continuous hourly discharge series. The investigations were carried out in 41 catchments of the Aller-Leine river basin in Northern Germany. For the validation a spatial split-sampling in 12 donor and 29 validation catchments, as well as a temporal split-sampling were applied.
   The results showed that: (I) MPs regionalized with the SOM-B approach led to similar or slightly better model performance than with the LT-B method, (II) some hydrologically plausible relationships between MPs and CDs were adjusted automatically without any predefinition by the SOM-B, (III) the relationships between CDs and MPs were more transparent using the SOM-B approach, (IV) the sensitivity of different factors of the SOM-B on the performance was smaller than expected.

AB Traditional power generation operation of reservoir mainly considers the maximization of power generation and guarantees the stability of the power system. However, blindly considering power generation objectives may ignore its impact on the ecological environment and navigation. A multi-objective optimization operation model considering power generation, ecological and navigation objectives is established in this paper. In order to efficiently solve the model, a new Improved Multi-objective Moth-flame Optimization Algorithm based on R-domination (R-IMOMFO) has been proposed. In order to enhance the ability of Moth-flame Optimization Algorithm (MFO) to overcome falling into the local optimum, it is improved from three aspects: update formula, inspiration of moth linear flight path and flame population update strategy, called improved MFO (IMFO) algorithm. In order to distinguish these individuals who are not dominated by each other in Pareto domination, the R-domination is proposed in combination with reference points. To verify the performance of IMFO and R-domination separately, different evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective mechanisms are combined to generate five new algorithms. Five new algorithms and five state-of-the-art algorithms are tested on the benchmark functions and reservoir operation model. The test results show that the proposed R-IMOMFO algorithm has the ability to obtain a set of solution with good convergence and strong distribution in the optimization operation problem of cascade reservoirs. Finally, the relationships between the objectives of the operation model are explored by the set of solution obtained by R-IMOMFO and the reason for the relationships is analyzed. The operation results show that the ecological demand and navigation demand have obvious contradictory relationships.

AB The generation of equally likely realizations of transmissivity fields conditional to both transmissivity and piezometric data is achieved using an iterative technique that couples geostatistics and optimization. By conditioning to both transmissivity fields and piezometric data we mean that the transmissivity held generated honours the transmissivity data and that the solution to the how equation reproduces the measured piezometric heads. By equally likely realizations we mean that all realizations display the same patterns of spatial variability as observed in the field. as opposed to the transmissivity fields obtained by interpolation or by inverse modelling which are oversmooth, unrealistic. representations of the real field. In this regard, any realization could be the real but unknown transmissivity field. To achieve this goal, first a transmissivity field is generated conditional only to the transmissivity data, then the transmissivity field (and possibly the boundary conditions), are modified without destroying the spatial patterns of variability of transmissivity until the piezometric data are also honoured. The methodology is presented for steady-state flow in a confined two-dimensional aquifer. The details of the implementation are given for finite-differences solution over an aquifer discretized in square blocks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A flood hazard is one of the most common and destructive natural disasters. Flood risk reduction with non-engineering measures has become the primary goal for flood management. This paper proposes an approach to improve the flood control operation for cascade reservoirs by minimizing flood control risk. A framework of reservoir flood control operation coupled with risk assessment (RFCORA) and the corresponding RFCORA model are proposed to reduce risk. The model contains three sub-modules. A real-time reservoir flood control operation simulation module is developed, in which a flood discharge control chart is used to determine the flood magnitude, and flood release is obtained by operation rules. Entropy-weighted fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is applied to assess the risk level in the flood risk assessment module. Finally, the flood release is updated according to the developed outflow adjustment optimization module aimed at minimizing flood control risk by combing future inflow information. In addition, another model without outflow adjustment optimization is set to be a comparative experiment. The water system of the Upper Yellow River is selected as a case study to verify the model. The results show that the framework and RFCORA model developed in this paper can decrease the time duration in the highest risk level without increasing the maximum water level and maximum outflow of reservoirs. The approach proposed in this paper based on flood control operation and flood risk assessment can be extended to flood mitigation in other water systems in similar situations.

TI Economic, social and resource management factors influencing groundwater
   trade: Evidence from Victoria, Australia
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Groundwater trade; Groundwater management; Groundwater economics;
   Groundwater sociology; Victoria (Australia)
ID CHALLENGES
AB In Victoria, Australia, most groundwater resources are now fully allocated and opportunities for new groundwater development can only occur through trading of license entitlements. Groundwater usage has rarely exceeded 50% of the available licensed volume, even in the 2008/9 drought year, and 50 to 70% of individual license holders use less than 5% of their allocation each year. However, little groundwater trading is occurring at present.
   Interviews were conducted with groundwater license holders and water brokers to investigate why the Victorian groundwater trade market is underdeveloped. Responses show there is a complex mix of social, economic, institutional and technical reasons. Barriers to trade are influenced by the circumstances of each groundwater user, administrative process and resource management rules. Water brokers deal with few trades at low margins and noted unrealistic selling prices and administrative difficulties. Irrigators who have successfully traded identify that there are few participants in trading, technical appraisals are expensive and administrative requirements and fees are burdensome, especially when compared to surface water trading.
   Opportunities to facilitate trade include groundwater management plan refinement and improved information provision. Simplifying transaction processes and costs, demonstrating good resource stewardship and preventing third party impacts from trade could address some concerns raised by market participants. There are, however, numerous individual circumstances that inhibit groundwater trading, so it is unlikely that policy and process changes alone could increase usage rates without greater demand for groundwater or more favourable farming economic circumstances.

AB Termite mounds are traditionally presumed to be good indicators of groundwater in places they inhabit but this hypothesis is yet to be scientifically substantiated. To confirm this assertion, it is expected that termite mounds would have strong correlations with groundwater conditioning parameters (GCPs). In this study, termite mounds distribution covering an area of about 156 km(2) were mapped and their structural characteristics documented with the aim of examining their relationships with twelve (12) chosen GCPs. Other specific objectives were to identify specific mound types with affinity to groundwater and to produce a groundwater potential map of the study area. To achieve this, 12 GCPs including geology, drainage density, lineament density, lineament inter-section density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, plan curvature, static water level and groundwater level fluctuation were extracted from relevant sources. Frequency ratio (FR) and Spearman's rank correlation were used to find relationships and direction of such relationships. The result revealed a consistent agreement between FR and Spearman's rank correlation that tall (>= 1.8 m) and Cathedral designed mounds are good indicators of groundwater. Further, the groundwater potential map produced from the Random Forest (RF) model via Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) using best-first algorithm depicted an erratic nature of groundwater distribution in the study area. This was then classified using natural break into very-high, high, moderate, low and very low potential classes and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed an 86.5% validity of the model. About 75% of mapped termite mounds fell within the very-high to moderate potential classes thereby suggesting that although tall and cathedral mounds in particular showed good correlations with a number of GCPs, high mound density in a locality is also an indication of good groundwater potential.

AB Rainfall interception is an important factor in the hydrological cycle and it is a key variable in hydrological models, especially in the case of continuous distributed models. Interception models commonly use two types of parameters: meteorological and canopy parameters, where the latter depend on the type of vegetation and their phenological states. This means that a spatial-temporal description of the vegetation is required. In practice, the spatial-temporal patterns of vegetation phenology, especially in mountainous areas, make it difficult to quantitatively map and generate rainfall interception data to force continuous distributed hydrology models.
   In this paper, we present a simple method which integrates Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land products such as MODIS_NDVI (normal derive vegetation index) and MODIS_LAI (leaf area index) with a simple distributed interception model based on Rutter's model for mountain basins. Leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are estimated using a temporal series of MODIS_NDVI images, spectral vegetation indices, and spectral mixture analyses, respectively. The canopy storage capacity (S-max) is related to LAI using a simple empirical relationship S-max =f(center dot) log(1 + LAI) where f depends on the type of vegetation. In order to validate this relationship, published data was used and a good fit was found. However, the amount of available data is limited; hence, this approach is not well established and further research is needed in this field to confirm a robust relationship.
   Finally, this research explains and illustrates an approach to quantitatively assess spatial-temporal patterns of interception loss in mountainous areas with greater spatial variability in coverage vegetation. The study area is located in the north of Spain in which three mountains basins were selected: Miera, Pas, and Saja-Besaya. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The urban heat island (UHI) effect has traditionally been determined using ambient air temperatures or land surface temperatures derived from satellite observations. In this study, we used the subsurface temperature anomaly as an indicator in describing a relationship between land use characteristics and aquifer temperature changes in the shallow subsurface layers of three rapidly developing urban settings: the Kanto, Sendai and Chikushi plains in Japan. Information on land cover was derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired between 1999 and 2001. The supervised classification technique along with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to specify the urban degree for grid cells covering observation wells. Preliminary analysis of groundwater levels in different well locations revealed that vertical groundwater recharge is predominant in all study areas. A numerical model for subsurface heat transport employed with different groundwater recharge/discharge and ground surface warming rates indicated that ground surface warming has a significant effect on aquifer temperatures in shallow subsurface layers. The results show that the magnitude of aquifer temperature change is positively correlated with the degree of impervious area derived from the NDVI values (i.e., negatively correlated with the NDVI value with 0.5-0.7 degrees C warming for a 0.12 NDVI difference at a 20-m depth). The relationship between aquifer temperature changes and grid-averaged NDVI values was strongest at an area of approximately 99,225 m(2) (roughly equal to an area with a 175-m radius) and determination coefficient equal to 0.91 for the Kanto plain. As the average area is further increased, the relationship between the two variables gradually became weaker. According to results verified for the Sendai and Chikushi plains, the same relationship was achieved for areas no larger than 175 (+/- 15) m radius and a determination coefficient of 0.81, which is suggested as the operational spatial scale to determine the UHI effect on subsurface thermal regimes. As the necessity for adaptation measures to cope with urban thermal pollution is increasingly understood, the lateral extent of subsurface heat flow found in this study may be useful in urban planning and habitat restoration programs.

AB Economic pressures on natural resources have led to a modification of natural surface water patterns. This has affected the hydrologic cycle at a global scale with multiple environmental and socioeconomic implications. This study evaluates long-term trends in surface water occurrence and related climate variables in a large agricultural catchment of Australia to understand trends in evaporative water losses from open water bodies. Surface water detection was based on a supervised classification of Landsat images between 1988 and 2018 to obtain inundation and surface water frequencies across the catchment, which were compared with other surface water products. Climate trends were based on monthly SILO gridded datasets. Open water evaporation was estimated using the FAO56 methodology and compared with the Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) product. Evaporation trends were analysed using the Mann Kendall (MK) test and the Sen's slope (SS). Generally, open water frequencies showed significant negative trends, though these varied spatially. The number of dams, on the other hand, had an increasing trend. Temperatures are increasing in the catchment, while rainfall and relative humidity are decreasing, resulting in an overall positive trend for reference evapotranspiration (ETr) across 90% of the catchment. Even though ETr and evaporation per unit area of water show positive trends, lumped open water evaporation showed a negative trend, possibly associated with an average decrease in surface water frequencies. Annual evaporative losses averaged 201.9 GL, exceeding annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment. All the studied changes imply a loss of blue and green water in the catchment, and provide evidence of an overall intensification of the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change.

AB Accurate multi-step-ahead inflow forecasting during typhoon periods is extremely crucial for real-time reservoir flood control. We propose a spatio-temporal lumping of radar rainfall for modeling inflow forecasts to mitigate time-lag problems and improve forecasting accuracy. Spatial aggregation of radar cells is made based on the sub-catchment partitioning obtained from the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and then flood forecasting is made by the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models coupled with a 2-staged Gamma Test (2-GT) procedure that identifies the optimal non-trivial rainfall inputs. The Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan is used as a case study. The results show that the proposed methods can, in general, precisely make 1- to 4-hour-ahead forecasts and the lag time between predicted and observed flood peaks could be mitigated. The constructed ANFIS models with only two fuzzy if-then rules can effectively categorize inputs into two levels (i.e. high and low) and provide an insightful view (perspective) of the rainfall-runoff process, which demonstrate their capability in modeling the complex rainfall-runoff process. In addition, the confidence level of forecasts with acceptable error can reach as high as 97% at horizon t+1 and 77% at horizon t+4, respectively, which evidently promotes model reliability and leads to better decisions on real-time reservoir operation during typhoon events.

AB Local-scale spatial averaging of pore-scale advection-diffusion equations in porous media leads to advection-dispersion equations (ADEs). While often used to describe subsurface transport, ADEs may pose special problems in the context of diffusion theory. Standard diffusion theory applies only when characteristic coefficients, velocity, porosity, and dispersion tensor, are smooth functions of space. Subsurface porous-material properties, however, naturally exhibit spatial variability. Transitions between material types are often abrupt rather than smooth, such as sand in contact with clay. In such composite porous media, characteristic coefficients in spatially averaged transport equations may be discontinuous. Although commonly called on to model transport in these cases, standard diffusion theory does not apply. Herein we develop diffusion theory for ADEs of transport in porous media. Derivation of ADEs from probabilistic assumptions yields (1) necessary conditions for convergence of diffusion processes to ADEs, even when coefficients are discontinuous, and (2) general probabilistic definitions of physical quantities, velocity, and dispersion tensor. As examples of how the new theory can be applied to theoretical and numerical problems.of transport in porous media, we evaluate several random walk methods that have appeared in the water resources literature.

AB Surface- and subsurface-runoff processes on hillslopes are quite different in nature; nevertheless, the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) simulates runoff using only the surface-flow mechanism. In this study, the GIUH model was revised to consider both the surface- and subsurface-flow processes. Kinematic-wave approximation was used to estimate the mean value of the travel-time probability distributions for runoff in surface-flow regions and channels, and Darcy's law was adopted to estimate the runoff travel time in subsurface-flow regions. Based on the linear system assumption, the hydrologic response of a watershed is the superposition of the hydrologic responses resulting from the surface flow and subsurface flow of the watershed. The IUH can adequately reflect the variation of surface-flow roughness and hydraulic conductivity. An example watershed was selected to test the capability of the revised model. The simulated hydrographs obtained using the original and revised models were basically in good agreement with the observed hydrographs. However, significant improvement of the simulation was found in the recession limb of the simulated hydrograph because flood recession was dominated by the subsurface-flow process.

AB In this paper, we present a method to account for modeling uncertainties while regionalising model parameters. Linking model. parameters to physical catchment attributes is a popular approach that enables the application of a conceptual model to an ungauged site. The functional relationship can be derived either from the calibrated model. parameters (direct calibration method) or by calibrating the functional. function (regional. calibration method). Both of these approaches are explored through a case study involving TOPMODEL and a number of small- to medium-sized humid basins located in various geographic and climatic regions around the globe. The predictive performance of the functional relationship derived using the direct calibration method (e.g., multiple regression, artificial neural. network and partial least square regression) varied among the different schemes. However, the average of the model. parameters estimated from regionatisation schemes based on direct calibration is found to be a better surrogate. Even with the use of a parsimonious hydrological model and with posing model calibration as a multi-objective problem, the model. parameter uncertainty and its effect on model. prediction were observed to be high and varied among the basins. Therefore, to avoid the effect of model parameter uncertainty on regionalization results, a regional calibration method that skips direct calibration of the hydrological model was implemented. This method was improved in order to take into account multiple objective criteria white calibrating regional parameters. The predictive performance of the improved regional calibration method was found to be superior to the direct calibration method, indicating that the identifiability of model parameters has an apparent effect on deriving predictive models for regionalisation. However, the regional calibration method was unable to uniquely identify the regional relationship, and the modeling uncertainties quantified using Pareto optimal regional relationships were considerable.
   Regionalisation schemes that are based on direct calibration do not explicitly account for the modeling uncertainties.
   Therefore, to account for these uncertainties in model parameters and regionalisation schemes, methods based on regionalisation of vectors of model parameters (i.e. regionalizing the vectors of equally likely values of model parameters) and posterior probability distribution of model parameters (i.e. estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters at ungauged sites by linking the entries of model parameters' covariance matrix and the posterior mean of model parameter to the catchment attributes) are introduced. The uncertainties in model prediction as quantified from both methods closely followed the prediction uncertainties quantified from calibrated posterior probability distributions of model parameters. Moreover, though the prediction uncertainties associated with the regional calibration method as quantified from the Pareto optimal regional relationship were comparatively higher than those obtained from the direct calibration schemes, they were in close agreement with the prediction uncertainties quantified from the calibrated posterior probability distribution. The ensemble of simulated flows realized from the model parameters sampled from regionalized posterior probability distributions for five ungauged basins are also presented as validation of the proposed methodology.

AB In an ideal world, a few overall indicators of hydrologic alteration would adequately describe the degree of hydrologic alteration caused by various forms of river regulation. Currently over 170 hydrologic indicators have been developed to describe different components of flow regimes, including the widely used Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) that characterize the impact of river regulation on flow regimes in environmental flow studies. Many of these IHA indicators are intercorrelated, resulting in considerable information redundancy, which could lead to ineffective environmental flow management decisions. The objective of this research is to develop a small set of independent and representative hydrologic indicators that can best characterize hydrologic alteration caused by reservoirs and other forms of river regulation. Two sets of pre- and post-dam streamflow records are used: (1) based on artificial simulations of a wide range of reservoir release rules and (2) streamflow records for 189 gaging stations throughout the United States. Principal component analysis was used to address the intercorrelation among the IHA parameters. Results revealed that the recently introduced metrics termed ecodeficit and ecosurplus can provide a good overall representation of the degree of alteration of a streamflow time series. Across both datasets, 32 individual IHA statistics and several potential generalized indices, three indices based on the ecodeficit and ecosurplus explained the most variability associated with the ensemble of 32 IHA statistics.

   purging; Two phase pumping; Transition pumping period
ID WELL
AB A new method of groundwater sampling has recently been proposed, which involves two-phase well purging - a high-flow rate pumping phase followed by low flow rate purging and sampling. The high pumping rate yields a rapid well drawdown and enhances hydraulic gradients within the aquifer. After switching to a low pumping rate, the stressed flow field is maintained to prevent the water in the well casing from moving downwards to bias the collected samples. This study addresses two practical issues that are critical for applying such a sampling method: the determination of the pumping switch time and the transition time interval available for groundwater sampling. We use Theis and Papadopulos solutions to study the impact of wellbore storage on the correlation between switch time and transition time interval. By imposing critical conditions to the derived solutions, we suggest that the transition time interval is solely associated with the switch time. Results show that a later switch time yields a longer transition time interval. Theis solution provides an approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the transition time interval, which can be used as a simple approximate practical guideline. Results from Papadopulos solution confirm the linear relationship at late times and provide a more accurate relationship for early times by accounting for the well storage impact. A sensitivity analysis indicates that aquifers with smaller storativity under a higher pumping ratio will generate a longer transition time interval given the same switch time. Similarly, an earlier switch time is allowed given a predefined transition time interval. This study presents a guideline to determine reasonable switch time under various aquifer hydrogeologic conditions and estimate the ideal groundwater sampling window.

AB Advance forecast of water inrush can help ensure operational safety in underground engineering. In this study, a coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) model is developed to simulate the process of water inrush from collapse columns in coal mines with complex geological environments. Specifically, nonlinear fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media associated with the erosion and damage of collapse columns are considered. This numerical model is validated against water-inrush field data from two coal mines with regard to flow rate. Fluid pressure and temperature profiles over time are also investigated. There is a water pressure accumulation phenomenon in hidden collapse columns. Temperature is found to change more significantly than velocity in the early stages of water inrush. In addition, the spatial variation of temperature can be divided into three zones during the process of water inrush. According to the rules governing the spatio-temporal variation of temperature, a novel method utilizing a real-time monitoring temperature-dependent risk index (TRI) and a water inrush induced increasing temperature zone (WIT) is proposed to determine whether and where water inrushes will occur. This study demonstrates how this novel method can predict water inrush and overcome the main limitations in previous studies where temperature was used as a predictor. This method has the potential to be applied in practice to better understand the risks related to coal mine management and water inrush and thus improves mine safety.

AB We performed field experiments at a well-studied aquifer test site to evaluate the geophysical method of seismic cross-hole tomography for high-resolution aquifer characterization. We address the challenge of finding meaningful relationships between seismic velocity and hydraulic conductivity at the field scale for hydraulic conductivity estimation. The resolution of seismic cross-hole data is limited by inversion ambiguities and diffraction effects, which are not accounted for using conventional ray-based inversion algorithms for velocity reconstruction. We investigate the impact of diffraction effects on seismic velocity inversion and implications for hydraulic modelling. Our ray-based seismic tomograms correlate well with sedimentary cores and hydraulic conductivity togs allowing us to interpret a zone model with distinct geophysical/hydraulic zones. We use this zone model to constrain seismic inversions using two approaches for forward modelling: ray tracing (infinite-frequency approximation) and wavefield modelling at a realistic frequency, which accounts for diffraction. We show that using the common ray tracing approach, seismic velocities in low-velocity zones may be significantly overestimated. Based on the available data, we observe a negative linear relationship between logarithmic hydraulic conductivity and seismic velocity. This relationship is used to parameterize hydraulic models based on seismic velocity models. Computer simulations of advective contaminant transport demonstrate that their results are extremely sensitive to an accurate determination of seismic low-velocity zones. We conclude that seismic tomography is indeed very useful for high-resotution aquifer characterization. However, an inversion approach that accounts for diffraction effects, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure and additional well data should be applied for quantitative interpretations.

AB Understanding water and carbon fluxes over agroecosystem are fundamental for water resources management in arid areas. However, their dynamics and coupling at different temporal scales have not been well understood. Therefore, in this study, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) over irrigated maize field were monitored using eddy covariance system during two crop growing seasons in 2017 and 2018. The dynamics of NEE, ET and the resulted water use efficiency (WUE, defined as NEE/ET), and their responses to the meteorological and hydrological factors were investigated. At hourly scale, when ET increased at noon, NEE reached the plateau ahead of ET, which resulted in decreased WUE. The maize WUE changed during the growing season. Average daytime WUE at the heading stage was the largest: 9.52 and 8.57 g (CO2) kg(-1) (H2O) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was the primary driver controlling diurnal dynamics of NEE and ET in irrigated maize field, while the opposite effects of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on NEE and ET were identified. When the VPD increased from 0 to 3.3 kPa, the slope of the linear relationship between ET and PAR increased; whereas, the slope of the linear relationship between NEE and PAR decreased. At daily scale, the relationship between NEE and ET was generally linear with a slope of 8.59 g CO2 kg(-1) H2O, which could be attributed to their similar sensitivities in response to canopy conductance, PAR and soil water content. In addition, the effect of irrigation on WUE was different depending on the crop development stage and crop physiological activities. This study highlights that high VPD would decrease WUE of maize growing in irrigated agroecosystems in arid areas.

AB We consider a one-dimensional model of water reservoir, where the sediment is diffusing according to the Fourier law modified with the introduction of a derivative of fractional distributed orders as memory formalism. The fractional order is equivalent to a time-varying diffusivity and the distributed orders represent a variety of memory mechanisms to model a sediment with a varied distribution of grain sizes. Using the Laplace transform (LT), we find the solution in the case when the flux is constant at the source and is arbitrarily given at the output. Then, the time-domain solution is obtained by means of a numerical Fourier transform. We apply a one-dimensional simplified model, with the diffusion governed by two parameters, to the Quarto Nuovo (Italy) reservoir, where the flux of sediment at the output is obtained from observed data. It is found that the flux increases when one of the parameters defining the diffusion model, the pseudo-diffusivity, is increasing or when the other parameter defining the diffusion, the order of fractional differentiation, is decreasing. When the latter parameter is nil, one obtains the classic diffusion with maximum flux. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The specific energy depth relationship in open channels with parabolic cross-sections is analytically inverted. Two nondimensional expressions of the specific energy are considered, depending on the prescribed quantity (specific energy or alternate depth). The inversion of such functions consists of finding the roots of cubic and quartic equations. By solving a quartic equation for a given discharge and for each value of the specific energy, a subcritical depth and a supercritical depth are found analytically. In this case, two acceptable roots are recognized and two other roots are discarded, on the basis of their physical meaning. Moreover, by solving a cubic equation for a given discharge and for each value of the depth, the other corresponding alternate depth is found analytically. Then, one acceptable root is recognized and two other complex conjugate roots are discarded. Finally, different examples are presented, to show the efficiency of the proposed solutions. Such analytical solutions can be easily used in natural rivers and parabolic channels.

AB Lake bathymetry, which provides crucial information for water resource management, has been widely used in hydrological, ecological, and geomorphological studies. Restricted by the high cost of conventional full-covered lake field surveys and the large uncertainty of spatial prediction method that models lake underwater depths from the surrounding exposed terrains, the knowledge on lake bathymetry worldwide is scarce and inconsistent. This study aims to solve the problem by investigating how the optimized spatial prediction methods are developed by combining limited field survey data. Two methods, namely, the skeleton-based interpolation method that extends the exposed topography toward the lake underwater area with a constraint of field surveys, and the machine learning method (XGBoost) that establishes the decision rule between measured water depths and multiple geospatial variables to predict depths of unknown underwater areas, were developed and tested in twelve representative lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results suggest that both methods can provide acceptable estimations of underwater topography by comparing with measured data, with the mean R2 of 0.70 approximately. The overall performance of the machine learning method (XGBoost) is more reliable, with the biases less than 20% in water volume estimates for all lake cases. In comparison, the skeleton-based interpolation method outperforms lakes in long and narrow shapes. This study is expected to provide an efficient approach for modeling lake bathymetry and to improve the monitoring capacity of freshwater mass changes, especially for ungauged lakes in harsh environments.

AB We intensively investigated the composition and distribution of several major ions and stable isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18) in precipitation in 2008 and 2009 at three sites in the Shiyang River Basin of northwestern China. The goal was to provide basic data that would help us to understand the geochemical evolution and recharge sources of groundwater in the basin's Quaternary aquifer. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values for 75 precipitation samples ranged from +35.7 parts per thousand to -170.9 parts per thousand and from +4.6 parts per thousand to -23.3 parts per thousand, respectively. The relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 defined a well-constrained local meteoric line, which was nearly identical to the meteoric water line for northern China. The evaporation process in this dry region of northwestern China obviously altered the original relationship between rainfall delta H-2 and delta O-18, resulting in d-excess values <8 parts per thousand, as has been previously reported in many arid regions. The relationship between local temperature and precipitation delta O-18 was statistically significant based on monthly average delta O-18 values and air temperatures. Mean annual concentrations of SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ in mountain and desert areas were lower than those in most of China's cities. The majority of the rainfall samples had a Cl- concentration of 1.5-2.5 mg L-1, and the excess of Na+ over Cl-, combined with a strong excess of non-marine SO42- and the overall precipitation chemistry, indicates that some solutes were contributed from terrestrial sources during the air mass trajectory over land. These values will provide reliable rainfall input information that can be used in future groundwater recharge calculations in the study area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Topography plays a major role in determining the accuracy of flood inundation areas. However, many areas in the United States and around the world do not have access to high quality topographic data in the form of Digital Elevation Models (DEM). For such areas, an improved understanding of the effects of DEM properties such as horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy on flood inundation maps may eventually lead to improved flood inundation modeling and mapping. This study attempts to relate the errors arising from DEM properties such as spatial resolution and vertical accuracy to flood inundation maps, and then use this relationship to create improved flood inundation maps from coarser resolution DEMs with low accuracy. The results from the five stream reaches used in this study show that water surface elevations (WSE) along the stream and the flood inundation area have a linear relationship with both DEM resolution and accuracy. This linear relationship is then used to extrapolate the water surface elevations from coarser resolution DEMs to get water surface elevations corresponding to a finer resolution DEM. Application of this approach show that improved results can be obtained from flood modeling by using coarser and less accurate DEMs, including public domain datasets such as the National Elevation Dataset and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEMs. The improvement in the WSE and its application to obtain better flood inundation maps is dependent on the study reach characteristics such as land use, valley shape, reach length and width. Application of the approach presented in this study on more reaches may lead to development of guidelines for flood inundation mapping using coarser resolution and less accurate topographic datasets.

AB Sediment connectivity quantifies the intermediate processes between initial erosion and the corresponding sediment yield. However, fully capturing the variations in sediment connectivity at the event scale and revealing their impact on watershed sediment sources remains challenging. Herein, we established an event-based model to assess sediment connectivity by integrating runoff factors. The spatiotemporal variability of sediment con-nectivity was evaluated for 58 rainfall events in three heterogeneous watersheds. The degree of sediment con-nectivity served as an indicator to quantify the proportion of potential sediment transport from units to the watershed outlet, with 1 indicating that the eroded sediment can be fully connected and 0 indicating that it cannot be transported. Moreover, the controls of sediment connectivity on watershed sediment sources and yield were determined. Our results indicated that the watersheds with poor vegetation and dense gullies were char-acterized by high sediment connectivity during all the rainfall events. The connectivity degree was below 0.5 in approximately 80 % of the watershed area, suggesting that most of the eroded sediment was deposited. Rainfall amount and duration dominated the degree of connectivity of the distal hillslopes, while rainfall intensity exerted a primary control on the transport of sediments from riverbanks to the outlet. In addition, the increase of mismatched area between sediment connectivity and erosion resulted in the decrease of sediment yield. The interaction between sediment connectivity and erosion effectively explained the spatial patterns of sediment sources (p < 0.05). Our work confirmed that the coupled erosion model and sediment connectivity predicted the sediment yield accurately. The predictions for different watersheds portrayed that the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Willmott's agreement index were greater than 0.70 and 0.89, respectively. These findings revealed the role of sediment connectivity and are the critical basis to identify watershed-specific sediment management practices.

AB Double peak hydrographs are widespread phenomena but poorly understood mechanistically. In many cases, saturation-excess overland flow in the near-stream areas is assumed to control the initial peak, while the delayed peak is explained by subsurface flow in the soil or sediment cover or groundwater flow on fractured bedrock. Here we explore the mechanisms that control the generation of double peak hydro graphs in a forested headwater catchment. We made use of the extensive high-resolution hydrometric time series collected in the catchment to estimate catchment storage and causal linkages. We found that double peak hydrographs occurred only after a certain amount of catchment storage was exceeded. The amount of this storage threshold was consistent over a 3-year period. The non-linear relationship between storage and discharge led to hysteretic relationships between both variables, and these hysteretic relationships were different for the different hydrograph types (single or double peak hydro graphs). Discharge peaked before catchment storage during single peak hydrographs suggesting that single peaks were mainly generated by water quickly reaching the stream during precipitation pulses. It was catchment storage that peaked first during double peak hydrographs and consequently generated the delayed peak in the hydrograph. Our results also showed that double peak hydrographs were controlled in different proportions by contrasting landscape units (defined along a hillslope sequence). Hillslopes were connected to the stream at low discharge values, whereas the plateau dominated discharge generation when storage reached a certain threshold value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study we have examined the spatial and temporal variability of winter (DJF) streamflow over Romania as recorded at 46 hydrological stations over the period 1935-2010. An empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOFs) was employed to characterize the spatial variability of winter streamflow. The dominant mode captures in-phase variability of river flow anomalies over the entire country. The second mode is characterized by a north-south dipole, emphasizing the influence of topography over the streamflow variability. Both modes are related with large-scale atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature patterns. We show that the Arctic/North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic, East Atlantic/Western Russia and Scandinavian patterns control a significant part of the interannual winter streamflow variability as captured by these two modes. Moreover, we show that the winter streamflow is very sensitive to the influence of winter temperatures. Positive streamflow anomalies are recorded during warm winters, which are favorable to precipitation fallen as rain, while cold winters can favor snowy winters and frozen ground and hence reduced winter discharges.

AB Among various stream temperature models those based on nonlinear regression frequently attract attention due to their simplicity and small number of required variables. Among such approaches the logistic regression model developed twenty years ago for weekly data is still widely used in various scientific studies that require quick and simple calculation of stream water temperature. The model has been modified a number of times in recent years to capture the relationship between daily stream water temperatures, air temperatures and discharge. In this study, we propose further modifications of the logistic regression model that do not require any additional variables that may be hard to measure. The proposed models capture the relationship between the stream temperature and the declination of the Sun, the air temperature and the discharge from a number of recent observations. The proposed approaches are tested on six rivers located in diverse orographic conditions of temperate climate zones of Europe and USA. Although the proposed models remain very simple, their performances are competitive against the performances of more advanced semi-physical or data-driven models.

TI Structure-based framework for the design and risk assessment of

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Design; Risk assessment; Hydraulic structures; Water control; Damage;
   Offline reservoir; Multivariate probability distribution
ID RETURN PERIOD; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION
AB The design of hydraulic structures for water control is based on the principle of accepting that structures might fail to fulfill their intended purpose as consequence of extreme, yet rare events producing damages. Traditionally, structures are sized to resist to a "design event", i.e. a hyetograph or hydrograph associated to a fixed probability of occurrence. This implicitly assumes that the probability of structure failure equals that of the hydrological load, although unjustified under general conditions. Indeed, structure failure also depends on the failure mechanism - which is a characteristic of the specific structure and problem at hand - ruling the interaction between the hydrological load and the structure itself. To overcome the limitations of the hydrological design event approach, we provide here a general, consistent, "structure-based" risk framework, for design or risk assessment. The framework combines the multivariate statistical distribution of the hydrological process and the hydraulic response of the structure. Remarkably, it reduces the potential complexity of the problem to the statistical analysis of the univariate probability distribution of the damage, i.e. the consequence of structure failure. The approach is exemplified for an offline reservoir for flood mitigation, by adopting both a simplified routing model and a Monte Carlo procedure based on a detailed hydrodynamic simulation. Results demonstrate the potential of the framework, regardless of the accuracy of the modeling approach adopted for its implementation. Specifically, the framework allows disentangling the roles of the different design parameters involved, by providing clear indications for practitioners.

   OPTIMIZATION; RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; ERROR
AB Environmental modelling is complex, and models often require the calibration of several parameters that are not able to be directly evaluated from a physical quantity or field measurement. Multi-objective calibration has many advantages such as adding constraints in a poorly constrained problem or finding a compromise between different objectives by defining a set of optimal parameters. The caRamel optimizer has been developed to meet the requirement for an automatic calibration procedure that delivers not just one but a family of parameter sets that are optimal with regard to a multi-objective target. The idea behind caRamel is to rely on stochastic rules while also allowing more "local" mechanisms, such as the extrapolation along vectors in the parameter space. The caRamel algorithm is a hybrid of the multi-objective evolutionary annealing simplex (MEAS) method and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (epsilon-NSGA-II). It was initially developed for calibrating hydrological models but can be used for any environmental model. The caRamel algorithm is well adapted to complex modelling. The comparison with other optimizers in hydrological case studies (i.e. NSGA-II and MEAS) confirms the quality of the algorithm. An R package, caRamel, has been designed to easily implement this multi-objective algorithm optimizer in the R environment.

AB Coastal land reclamation can modify the original hydrological settings that control water salinity distribution. For low-permeability coastal lands reclaimed for agricultural use, there is an urgent need to understand the salinity distribution and evolution mechanism for a sustainable exploitation. In this study, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements at different temporal and spatial scales are combined with water stable isotope and hydrochemical analyses to investigate the distribution and evolution rules of underground salinity in a coastal reclamation zone of eastern China. The results show that the phreatic aquifer is dominated by highly saline water due to the flooding of seawater before reclamation. After being isolated from marine conditions, water salinity in the near-surface zone becomes highly variable caused by dilution effect of rainwater and salt accumulation effect driven by evaporation. Due to the low-permeability muddy flat geohydrological settings and intense evaporation, natural groundwater desalination is extremely slow and only temporarily occurs in the nearsurface zone. After long-term reclamation for agricultural use, the leaching effect of freshwater input from not only precipitation but also crop farming dominates and accelerates the desalination of the upper phreatic aquifer, leading to a desalting rate of 1.6 +/- 2.4 %/yr and an obvious downward migration of saline groundwater. Deeper confined aquifers are dominated by brackish or even fresh groundwater, which is minimally contaminated by upper saline water. Findings of this study provide a representative example of the salinity distribution and evolution characteristics in coastal agricultural lands reclaimed from low-permeability intertidal muddy flats.

AB In this study we analyse space-time variability of soil moisture data collected at 0-6, 0-12 and 0-20 cm depth over three hillslopes with contrasting steep relief and shallow soil depth in the Dolomites (central-eastern Italian Alps). The data have been collected during two summer seasons (2005 and 2006) with different precipitation distribution. Analysis of soil moisture data shows that different physical processes control the space-time distribution of soil moisture at the three soil depths, with a marked effect of dew on the 0-6 cm soil depth layer. The range of skewness values decreases markedly from the surface to deeper layers. More symmetric distributions, characterised by relatively low skewness, are found for mid-range soil moisture contents, while highly skewed distributions (generally with more log-normal shape) are found at dry and wet conditions. Scatter plots drawn for the whole data set and the analysis of the correlation coefficients suggest a good persistence of soil moisture with depth: the highest degree of correlation was observed between data collected at 0-12 and 0-20 cm.
   Examination of correlation between soil moisture fields and topographical attributes shows that, notwithstanding the steep relief and the humid conditions, terrain indices are relatively poor predictors of soil moisture spatial variability. The slope and the topographic wetness index, which are found here the best univariate spatial predictors of soil moisture, explains up to 42% of the time-averaged moisture spatial variation.
   A negative relationship between the soil moisture spatial mean and the corresponding spatial standard deviation is found for mean water contents exceeding 25-30%, while a transition to a positive relationship is observed with drier conditions. Overall, soil moisture variability shows the highest values at moderate moisture conditions (23-29%) and reduced values for wetter and drier conditions for all depths. A negative linear relationship between mean soil moisture content and the coefficient of variation was observed.
   A soil moisture dynamics model proved to successfully capture the soil moisture variability at the hillslope scale. The simulated time series of hillslope-averaged soil moisture are in good agreement with the observed ones. Moreover, the model reproduces consistently the observed relationships between soil moisture spatial mean and corresponding variability. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a new method for generating the sediment heterogeneity of alluvial deposits, based on a genesis model which mimics some of the hydraulic rules by which meandering or braided streams deposit or erode sediments. The new model is described and compared with other approaches, and is then applied to a 5.4 x 1.4 km(2) reach of the Aube River, upstream of Paris. The model is based on data obtained from a single cross-section of the alluvial plain, with 44 auger-holes along the 1.4 km stretch of the plain. As the model describes the sediment facies, we assign to each facies an assumed hydraulic conductivity. Flow and transport simulations are then made, with the commonly used code MODFLOW. In order to compare the results with simulations based on other descriptions of heterogeneous media, we then use classical geostatistical tools (indicator simulations) to generate alternative images of the same medium, based on the same initial data, and the same assumptions on the hydraulic conductivity of each facies. Finally, an equivalent uniform medium (obtained through permeability upscaling) is also generated. Comparing these three approaches on the basis of the flow and transport results, we show the intrinsic capacity of the new model to generate more realistic flow and transport processes in heterogeneous alluvial media, where permeability barriers and buried channels dominate the spatial distribution of heterogeneities.

AB The river-groundwater interaction is an important component of the hydrological cycle. This study develops an integrated river-GW model that uses a one-dimensional open channel flow model and a three-dimensional saturated GW flow model to describe the dynamic river-GW relationship at the basin scale, as well as groundwater flow and streamflow in arid regions. The model is tested with three cases, and the good agreement between the simulated and observed results demonstrates that the model can be used to simulate river-GW interactions. The integrated river-GW model is applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin and is calibrated using multi-source field data, including hydraulic heads from observation wells, streamfiow, and spring flow. The case studies in the Heihe River Basin find that the following: (1) the river-GW relationships vary seasonally and spatially and depend on many factors, such as the river flow and GW uses; (2) in the middle reaches, the annual mean river-groundwater flux exchange from Yinluoxia to the Heihe Bridge is approximately 17% of the mean streamfiow and increases to more than 49% from the Heihe Bridge to Zhengyixia; and (3) after the implementation of,the water reallocation plan in 2000, the river-GW relationship in some reaches changed from a gaining stream to a losing stream due to the increase of GW abstraction. These findings suggest that GW pumpage should be controlled rationally and demonstrate that the integrated river-GW model can be used to analyse the temporal spatial trends of river-groundwater interaction in arid regions.

AB In this paper we suggest to innovatively use scaling laws and more specifically Universal Multifractals (UM) to analyse simulated surface runoff and compare the retrieved scaling features with the rainfall ones. The methodology is tested on a 3 km(2) semi-urbanised with a steep slope study area located in the Paris area along the Bievre River. First Multi-Hydro, a fully distributed model is validated on this catchment for four rainfall events measured with the help of a C-band radar. The uncertainty associated with small scale unmeasured rainfall, i.e. occurring below the 1 km x 1 km x 5 min observation scale, is quantified with the help of stochastic downscaled rainfall fields. It is rather significant for simulated flow and more limited on overland water depth for these rainfall events. Overland depth is found to exhibit a scaling behaviour over small scales (10 m-80 m) which can be related to fractal features of the sewer network. No direct and obvious dependency between the overland depth multifractal features (quality of the scaling and UM parameters) and the rainfall ones was found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
ID ACIDIFICATION; GROUNDWATER; CATCHMENT; MODELS; WATER
AB Continuously monitored stream water conductivity and pH from the Hafren and Hore streams at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, is examined. Large inputs of rainwater of high conductivity can be traced to the stream. For events producing low flows (less than about 1 mm h-1), the chemistry of the rainfall is not observed in the stream; for high flow events the rainfall chemistry influences not only the immediate stream response but also the conductivity-flow relationship in subsequent smaller storms. The data indicate that a strong differentiation of water types is present, even after the catchment has been inundated, and that evapotranspiration and dry deposition are important factors in the maintenance of conductivity gradients within the catchment. Comparison of the acidity (pH/Acid Neutralisation Capacity) with the conductivity shows that the acidity in the rainfall is removed by the catchment soils: whereas the rainfall conductivity may affect the stream conductivity directly there is no corresponding relationship for acidity. Rapid chemical reactions, such as ion exchange, control stream acidity but do not affect the conductivity of the stream waters to the same extent.

AB [1] We use complex conductivity measurements to predict the hydraulic conductivity (K) of unconsolidated materials. The samples include natural sediments and artificial sand/clay mixtures. We apply the Borner et al. [1996] model, which is based on the Kozeny-Carman equation and incorporates electrical estimates of formation factor (F) and specific surface area per unit volume-to-porosity ratio (S-por), from the real (sigma') and imaginary (sigma") conductivity components respectively. We find that K correlates with sigma" but shows no correlation with F, which we attribute to the wide range in grain size for these materials. The Borner model appears primarily dependent on the K - sigma" relation. The relationship between sigma" and S-por is nonlinear and appears to depend upon material type. Further examination shows that sigma" is well correlated with effective grain size (d(10)) and is relatively independent of the material type. We propose a simple Hazen-type equation in which the effective grain size is estimated from sigma". This simple model provides order of magnitude estimates of K for a range of unconsolidated sediments.

But yet, the flood risk brought by forecast uncertainties transfers between the reservoirs and propagates from upstream to downstream, which is crucial for flood water utilization but is rarely investigated. To address this issue, this study proposes a FLWL optimal control framework, which consists of three modules: the FLWL upper bound derivation module, the flood risk analysis module, and the optimal FLWL decision-making module. The first module is to derive the upper bound relationship of the flood limited water level (FLWL), i.e., the specific substitution relationship of storage, for the parallel reservoirs coupling the capacity-constrained pre-release method and the aggregation-decomposition method. In the second module, the method to calculate the flood risk of the reservoirs and downstream caused by rainfall and runoff forecast uncertainties based on the total probability formula is proposed. In the third module, the transmission and propagation of flood risks in the parallel reservoir system under different rainfall grades are quantified, based on which the optimal FLWLs are determined. The implication in the Qinghe-Chaihe parallel reservoir system located in Northeast China shows that FLWL in Qinghe Reservoir and Chaihe Reservoir can be raised to 129.5 m from 127 m and 108 m from 104 m, respectively. Controlling the FLWL at any point in the safety domain can improve both flood water utilization and flood control benefits. However, the flood risk nonlinearly transfers between the parallel reservoirs and nonlinearly propagates from the upstream to the downstream. Based on this relationship, the optimal FLWLs of the reservoirs under different decision preferences are recommended.

AB Fiber-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing, when combined with the Single-probe Heat-pulse technique can measure soil moisture (theta) across spatial scales. The key limitation of this system is in obtaining the relationship between soil thermal conductivity (lambda) and theta for a specific field. Using the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site, this study tested a new methodology to account for the spatial variability in the lambda-theta relationship using a Gaussian processes model. The resulting accurate theta measurements (RMSE = 0.03 m(3)m(-3)) were used to characterize the spatial variability of theta across scales and to develop an empirical equation that can correct for the changes in the theta spatial variability observed at different spatial resolutions. In addition, the number of required samples to accurately characterize theta and its variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated. These findings provide key information to scale soil moisture from centimeters to hun-dreds of meters for process understanding.

AB Soil hydraulic properties, including soil water retention, control various terrestrial hydrological processes such as infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration. Measuring and monitoring these properties at large scales is chal-lenging. Therefore, over the past decade, remote sensing has been investigated as a promising tool for large-scale mapping of soil hydraulic properties. Nonetheless, a solid physical relationship between soil hydraulic and spectral properties is still lacking. To close this knowledge gap, this study introduces a novel physical-empirical model that to our best knowledge for the first time connects the soil water retention curve (SWRC) to soil spectral reflectance. The new model has been developed based on the hypothesis that the capillary and adsorbed water components of the SWRC exhibit vastly different optical properties due to their distinct distribution within the soil porous system. The model was validated using soil water retention and reflectance measurements of 21 soils, vastly differing in physical and hydraulic properties. The model provides not only a new and accurate soil moisture-reflectance functional relationship, but also a potential means for retrieval of the soil water retention curve from spectral reflectance in the shortwave infrared domain.

AB Under the double pressure of ecological vulnerability and economic development, natural resources and ecological environment have become the key constraints to the development of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). This paper proposed a theoretical framework for the relationship between water-energy-food (WEF) and poverty. An improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector were used to evaluate the spatio-temporal coupling between WEF and poverty and its influencing factors in YRB. The results suggest that the levels of coupling coordination increase to different degrees in YRB and its provinces from 2000 to 2019, and the coupling types are characterized by pyramidal-shaped distribution. The regions of YRB are divided into four development types: water-driven type, energy-driven type, food-driven type, and economy-driven type. Spatially, a dominant factor zone is formed with a multi-polar core. Furthermore, some practical suggestions are put forward to promote the effective utilization of water resources and high-quality development according to specific regional situations in YRB. This study will promote coupling coordination and high-quality development in YRB, providing a reference for the coordination of the human-land relationship and regional sustainable development.

AB With the current concern over climate change, descriptions of how rainfall patterns are changing over time can be useful. Observations of daily rainfall data over the last few decades provide information on these trends. Generalized linear models are typically used to model patterns in the occurrence and intensity of rainfall. These models describe rainfall patterns for an average year but are more limited when describing long-term trends, particularly when these are potentially non-linear. Generalized additive models (GAMS) provide a framework for modelling non-linear relationships by fitting smooth functions to the data. This paper describes how GAMS can extend the flexibility of models to describe seasonal patterns and long-term trends in the occurrence and intensity of daily rainfall using data from Mauritius from 1962 to 2001. Smoothed estimates from the models provide useful graphical descriptions of changing rainfall patterns over the last 40 years at this location. GAMS are particularly helpful when exploring non-linear relationships in the data. Care is needed to ensure the choice of smooth functions is appropriate for the data and modelling objectives.

AB The basic principles are derived of steady momentum dissipation during laminar boundary-layer flow in macroporous soils. The principles lead to a flux law and to geometrical measures of the flow paths. The theory of kinematic waves evolves, and the shock fronts are routed with the method of characteristics. The approach is applied to TDR soil moisture readings at depths 0.15, 0.35 and 0.55 m in a soil under meadow during an infiltration experiment (rate and duration of sprinkling were 2.78 x 10(-5) m s(-1) and 4500 s, respectively). Momentum dissipation during flow within the soil profile is independent of momentum added to the soil surface by sprinkling. Specific momentum dissipation per unit depth in the soil profile was about 0.02 kg m(-2) s(-1), with a tendency to increase with depth.

AB Spring discharge often responds to rainfall with a rapid increase followed by a slower recession, and the mode of recession is often exponential-like. We propose a new model of the response of spring discharge to rainfall based on the square law for turbulent conduit flow. The new non-exponential model is compared against the exponential model under specific constraints. A hydrograph of St. Marks River in Florida is used to illustrate that when the change in "sinkhole head" (defined as the hydraulic head at the upstream end of the karst conduit connected to the spring) is relatively small, the solution of the new model is close to that of the exponential model, which extends the validity and application of the exponential solution. When the change in sinkhole head is very large, the solutions from the two models clearly differ from each other. Limitations of the non-exponential model are analyzed by simulation of a hydrograph observed downstream of Wakulla Springs. It is concluded that both solutions are applicable when spring response is smaller than or comparable to the base flow, but are nonphysical when the response is much larger than the base discharge.

AB The SWIFT2D surface-water flow and transport code, which solves the St Venant equations in two dimensions, was coupled with the SEAWAT variable-density ground-water code to represent hydrologic processes in coastal wetlands and adjacent estuaries. A sequentially coupled time-lagged approach was implemented, based on a variable-density form of Darcy's Law, to couple the surface and subsurface systems. The integrated code also represents the advective transport of salt mass between the surface and subsurface. The integrated code was applied to the southern Everglades of Florida to quantify flow and salinity patterns and to evaluate effects of hydrologic processes. Model results confirm several important observations about the coastal wetland: (1) the coastal embankment separating the wetland from the estuary is overtopped only during tropical storms, (2) leakage between the surface and subsurface is locally important in the wetland, but submarine ground-water discharge does not contribute large quantities of freshwater to the estuary, and (3) coastal wetland salinities increase to near seawater values during the dry season, and the wetland flushes each year with the onset of the wet season.

AB A method to estimate rainfall from radar data for post-event analysis of flash-flood events has been developed within the EC-funded HYDRATE project It follows a pragmatic approach including careful analysis of the observation conditions for the radar system(s) available for the considered case Clutter and beam blockage are characterised by dry-weather observations and simulations based on a digital terrain model of the region of interest The vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) is either inferred from radar data if volume scanning data are available or simply defined using basic meteorological parameters (idealised VPR) Such information is then used to produce correction factor maps for each elevation angle to correct for range-dependent errors In a second step an effective Z-R relationship is optimised to remove the bias over the hit region Due to limited data availability the optimisation is carried out with reference to raingauge rain amounts measured at the event time scale Sensitivity tests performed with two well-documented rain events show that a number of Z = aR(b) relationships organised along hyperbolic curves in the (a and b) parameter space lead to optimum assessment results in terms of the Nash coefficient between the radar and raingauge estimates A refined analysis of these equifinality patterns shows that the total additive conditional bias" can be used to discriminate between the Nash coefficient equifinal solutions We observe that the optimisation results are sensitive to the VPR description and also that the Z-R optimisation procedure can largely compensate for range-dependent errors although this shifts the optimal coefficients in the parameter space The time-scale dependency of the equifinality patterns is significant however near-optimal Z-R relationships can be obtained at all time scales from the event time step optimisation (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Total organic carbon (TOC) is an important feature of water quality in Fenno-Scandia's till catchments. In this study we estimated the contribution of headwater streams to downstream TOC, tested the hypothesis that TOC-concentration decreases downstream and explored mechanisms for the observed patterns. The drainage network of a boreal catchment (66 sites) in northern Sweden, with subcatchment sizes 0.1178 km(2), was sampled in August 2002. In the headwaters there was a large variation in TOC-concentration (4-66 mg l(-1)) as well as other chemical parameters and specific discharge (0.13-8.21 s(-1) km(-2)). Further downstream there was less variation in both chemistry and specific discharge. Both flow and chemistry stabilized at catchment areas larger than 5 km2. No clear indication of in-stream processing effects on downstream TOC was observed, though there was TOC loss at takes and some stream junctions. To test whether the observed downstream decrease is different than that expected from conservative mixing along the stream network, we used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate downstream conservative mixing. The observed spatial variability was higher than the simulated, indicating that landscape-scale patterns are more than conservative mixing of random inputs. While the importance of in-stream processes that after TOC- concentrations cannot be ruled out, and loci of TOC loss do exist, we propose that headwater/ downstream patterns in TOC, and related parameters depend largely on the mosaic of landscape elements (mires, takes and forest) together with specific discharge.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall has always been a great challenge, and the impacts of climate change further complicate this issue. The present study employs the concepts of complex networks to study the spatial connections in rainfall, with emphasis on climate change and rainfall scaling. Rainfall outputs (during 1961-1990) from a regional climate model (i.e. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that downscaled the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF ERA-40 reanalyses) over Southeast Asia are studied, and data corresponding to eight different temporal scales (6-hr, 12-hr, daily, 2-day, 4-day, weekly, biweekly, and monthly) are analyzed. Two network-based methods are applied to examine the connections in rainfall: clustering coefficient (a measure of the network's local density) and degree distribution (a measure of the network's spread). The influence of rainfall correlation threshold (T) on spatial connections is also investigated by considering seven different threshold levels (ranging from 0.5 to 0.8). The results indicate that: (1) rainfall networks corresponding to much coarser temporal scales exhibit properties similar to that of small-world networks, regardless of the threshold; (2) rainfall networks corresponding to much finer temporal scales may be classified as either small-world networks or scale-free networks, depending upon the threshold; and (3) rainfall spatial connections exhibit a transition phase at intermediate temporal scales, especially at high thresholds. These results suggest that the most appropriate model for studying spatial connections may often be different at different temporal scales, and that a combination of small-world and scale-free network models might be more appropriate for rainfall upscaling/downscaling across all scales, in the strict sense of scale-invariance. The results also suggest that spatial connections in the studied rainfall networks in Southeast Asia are weak, especially when more stringent conditions are imposed (i.e. when T is very high), except at the monthly scale.

AB Reservoir operations are increasingly being asked to consider environmental flow, which is needed to sustain a healthy river ecosystem. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) is a tool that is used widely to describe environmental flow regimes, but few studies have explicitly included its parameters in multi-objective reservoir operation models. With the goal of incorporating detailed environmental flow requirements into reservoir operations, this study proposes a two-objective reservoir operation model that includes explicit IHA constraints. A series of formulae is developed to calculate IHA parameters without using a loop or conditional statement, which allows operators to manage environmental flow directly. An experimental operation of the Jinghong reservoir in the upstream portion of the Mekong Basin is conducted to apply the method. The economic objective is defined by hydropower production (HP), while the environmental flow objective is represented by a weighted aggregate eco-index (ED based on IHA parameters. Five scenarios with different objective functions and constraints are compared, and the results show that the scenario with "HP-EI" as its objective achieved optimal benefits for both indices. Hard EI and explicit IHA constraints led to significant loss of HP that can be attributed to variations of inflow. To make this model more convenient for practical use, operation rule curves are regressed from the optimized results of the model. Finally, policy implications of the operation with economic and environmental objectives and some limitations are discussed. The quantification method of IHA parameters provides significant reference value for reservoir environmental operation issues.

AB Two recent studies have suggested that neural network modelling offers no worthwhile improvements in comparison to the application of weighted linear transfer functions for capturing the non-linear nature of hydrological relationships. The potential of an artificial neural network to perform simple non-linear hydrological transformations under controlled conditions is examined in this paper. Eight neural network models were developed: four full or partial emulations of a recognised non-linear hydrological rainfall-runoff model; four solutions developed on an identical set of inputs and a calculated runoff coefficient output. The use of different input combinations enabled the competencies of solutions developed on a reduced number of parameters to be assessed. The selected hydrological model had a limited number of inputs and contained no temporal component. The modelling process was based on a set of random inputs that had a uniform distribution and spanned a modest range of possibilities. The initial cloning operations permitted a direct comparison to be performed with the equation-based relationship. It also provided more general information about the power of a neural network to replicate mathematical equations and model modest non-linear relationships. The second group of experiments explored a different relationship that is of hydrological interest; the target surface contained a stronger set of non-linear properties and was more challenging. Linear modelling comparisons were performed against traditional least squares multiple linear regression solutions developed on identical datasets. The reported results demonstrate that neural networks are capable of modelling nonlinear hydrological processes and are therefore appropriate tools for hydrological modelling.

AB The paper presents certain exact solutions describing the vertical movement of a water pulse through a semi-infinite unsaturated porous column. The saturation-based form of the Richards' equation is used with special power law relative-permeability functions. Both capillary and gravity effects are taken into account. Three exact solutions are derived corresponding to three relative-permeability functions, linear, quadratic and cubic. The Richards' equation is nonlinear for the three cases. The solutions are obtained by applying a general similarity transformation. They are explicit in space and time variables and do not contain any approximation. They describe the evolution of the water saturation in the vertical column and they can be used to predict the post-infiltration movement of a finite quantity of water. Exact expressions of the masses of water leaving a given depth are also derived for the three cases. We analyze the effect of relative-permeability and capillary pressure. The proposed solutions are also useful for checking numerical schemes. One of the exact solutions is used to validate numerical solution obtained from an arbitrary initial condition. Results show that the numerical solution converges to the exact solution for large times. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Proglacial discharge is controlled by the geometry of the glacial drainage network and by meltwater processes. The glacial drainage systems of some alpine glaciers have been characterised using a model based on a proglacial discharge analysis. In this paper, we apply high frequency systemic analysis to data collected from the Baounet Glacier (French Alps) during two successive ablation seasons. Our approach is based on an analysis of the evolution of daily recession curves during the ablation period. The observed data are fitted by a single <beta >-coefficient dependant recession law. Changes in <beta > are compared to variations in the daily discharge amplitude and the time tag between air temperature and proglacial discharge. The changes in the <beta > values do not appear to be related to changes in the time tag and the amplitude of the daily discharge. There were significant variations in the <beta >-coefficient during the two ablation periods studied here even if there was no time tag or the daily discharge amplitude change. High values of <beta > correspond to high drainage velocities; therefore increases in <beta > values can be used as an indicator of the evolution of the glacier's internal drainage network.

AB Evaporation in shallow soil has a great influence on the properties of surface soil. Therefore, under evaporation conditions, research on the rule and mechanism of heat-water-salt migration in surface soil has great significance for engineering geology and environmental science. In this study, with full consideration of the initial water content, salt content, atmospheric temperature, and groundwater supply, a series of indoor evaporation tests were performed on shallow saline soil to observe the heat-water-salt migration process. In addition, before and after the evaporation test, the soil microstructure at different depths was observed and analysed to explore the influence of heat-water-salt migration on the soil. The results show that during the evaporation process, salt carried by water migrates in the soil column, and the water-vapour phase transition causes salt accumulation, which also leads to the electrical conductivity (EC) profile showing a V-shape, and the salt content in the middle of the soil column is lower than that in the end. In addition, high atmospheric temperature significantly reduces the surface water content but alleviates salt accumulation. Under the condition of groundwater supplementation, the salt accumulation in the soil column surface is rapid. By observing the microstructure, it can be seen that a flocculent structure exists in the soil before evaporation. After evaporation, the surface microstructure changes significantly, and pores and salt crystals can be observed. The results provide a reference for understanding heat water-salt transport in arid areas.

AB The stable hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature, Rayleigh distillation processes, and moisture transport history. However, on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous. We collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the Armenian Highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on delta D and delta O-18 and relationship to broader climatic conditions. These data are coupled with HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path. Multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between delta D and delta O-18 and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site. Along with temperature, the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of Northern Hemisphere midlatitude westerlies, is significant (p < 0.05) for both delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation. This correlation between NAO and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby GNIP stations from 2008 to 2015. Negative NAO phases are associated with weakened westerlies, which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the Mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the Armenian Highlands, whereas positive NAO phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the Black Sea. This relationship is most significant (p < 0.001) during the winter and spring months (December to May). These data demonstrate that paleo-archives of SD and delta O-18 in the Armenian Highlands could serve as a tool to measure changes in the NAO in the past, particularly when coupled with independent measurements of temperature.

AB This article describes the Participatory Action Research (PAR) methodology used to trial and evaluate a suite of planning tools to improve the engagement process for statutory water planning in Australia, and assesses its value and limitations in the Australian context. We argue that the strength of this method is its consistency with a social learning and adaptive management approach.
   We owe the success of this research approach to five key factors: a high degree of access to the project setting; clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities between researchers and participants; considerable effort spent building and maintaining informal networks and relationships; sensitivity to the relationship between 'insiders' (the participants or owners of the issue i.e. government and community) and 'outsiders' (the research project team); and continual review of project planning and willingness to adapt timeframes and processes to suit the situation. The value and challenges of Participatory Action Research are discussed with key lessons emerging for improving its practice, as well as the transferability of this knowledge to engagement practice for water planning.

AB CO2 breakthrough pressure plays an important role in the capacity, safety and caprock evaluation of CO2 geosequestration. Many laboratory experiments have been put forward to investigate the breakthrough pressure and some functional relationships are proposed. Meanwhile, some numerical simulation theories on two-phase flow have also been presented by scholars. However, up to now, no numerical simulation method for CO2 break-through pressure has been put forward. In this study, a numerical method based on step-by-step method that can be used to predict CO2 breakthrough pressure in rock core is proposed. We use COMSOL Multiphysics, a numerical simulation software for multiple physical fields, to investigate the effects of initial water saturations in rock core on CO2 breakthrough pressure. The simulation results show that the breakthrough time of CO2 are 17, 21, 37.5, 65 and 70 h, and the breakthrough pressures of CO2 are 1.9, 2.2, 3.3, 5.1 and 5.4 MPa for initial water saturations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1, respectively. Moreover, both breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation of rock core. Based on the comparison with the published experimental data, it is proved that the breakthrough pressure data of CO2 in this numerical simulation is reasonable. Meanwhile, sensitivity studies are conducted on interfacial tensions (20, 25 and 30 mN/m) in CO2-H2O system and m (0.3, 0.4 and 0.5)/1(1.4, 1.7 and 2) values in van Genuchten (VG) model. The results show that, (1) under the condition of high saturation, the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious; low interfacial tension in CO2-H2O system has an adverse impact on CO2 breakthrough, the higher the interfacial tension, the lower the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of CO2. (2) Under the condition of high saturations, the influence of parameters m and 1 in VG model on CO2 breakthrough will be more obvious; at the same saturation, the greater the m/l parameters, the greater the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of CO2. This study provides numerical information for further studies of comprehensive and more complex numerical simulations on CO2 breakthrough pressure in rock core, CO2 geo-sequestration as well as the caprock evaluation.

AB Long-term data from a hydrological monitoring station and remotely-sensed satellite images were used to explore the effects of runoff and suspended sediment load on evolution of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) from 1983 to 2011. During this period, an average runoff of 18 x 10(9) m(3) yr(-1) and an average sediment load of 341 x 10(6) t yr(-1) flowed through the delta lobes into the sea. The runoff and sediment load exhibited downward trends with time, along with large inter-annual fluctuations. Three stages were evident in the data. From 1983 to the late 1990s, the Yellow River experienced progressively severe droughts which reduced both runoff and sediment load to its delta lobe. The delta nevertheless grew to a peak area of about 3950 km(2) in 2000. From 2000 to 2003, the YRD area decreased. Meanwhile, the operation of the dam at Xiaolangdi and changes in water consumption driven by a new regulatory framework helped stabilize the runoff. Although the sediment load continued to decline, partly due to sediment check dams along the middle Yellow River and the reduced sediment carrying capacity of the river, the YRD area nevertheless increased between 2003 and 2011. The variations in runoff and sediment load directly influenced changes to the plan-form area, shoreline migration, and morphology of the YRD. From 1983 to 2011, the net land area of the delta increased by 248 km(2), its coastline extended by 36.45 km, and its shape became increasingly irregular due to the emergence of its delta lobes. In 1996, an artificial diversion altered the position of the main delta lobe from Qingshuigou to Qing 8. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the YRD would have required average sediment loads of about 441 x 10(6) t yr(-1) before 1996 and 159 x 10(6) t yr(-1) after 1996 to maintain equilibrium.

AB Thoroughly understanding the security of water, energy and food (WEF) and the factors that influence them is essential for sustainable development management in any region. This study proposed a new analytical framework for WEF security evaluation in both individual sectors and the whole system, using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and four dimensions of security indicators: availability, self-sufficiency, productivity and accessibility. The internal relationships among the three sectors and the main factors influencing WEF security were analysed by Spearman's rank correlation and radar graphs, respectively. The five countries in Central Asia (CA), which are experiencing WEF crises and facing great challenges in achieving their sustainable development goals (SDGs), were chosen as a case study in this paper. Our results showed that Kazakhstan attained the highest WEF security level, followed by Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan; Tajikistan exhibited the lowest security level from 2000 to 2014. Three types of internal relationships among the three sectors were identified: synergies, trade-offs and unclassified. The unclassified relationship type accounted for the largest share of 54% in CA, suggesting great potential for synergetic improvement among the three sectors. Approaches for improving the country WEF security based on our research are as follows: Kazakhstan should prioritize food allocation and supply, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan should increase energy and food production and raise the supply level and usage efficiency of water and food, Turkmenistan should increase the available water resources and food production and improve the supply level and usage efficiency of water and energy, and Uzbekistan should both increase the available amount and enhance the WEF management performance.

AB This paper assesses the implications of climate and anthropic pressures on short to long-term changes in water resources in a Mediterranean karst using wavelet analysis. This approach was tested on 38-year (1974-2011) hydrogeological time series recorded at the Lez spring (South France), which is exploited for water supply. Firstly, we investigated inter-relationships in the frequency domain by cross-correlation across multiresolution levels. Our results showed that rainfall and spring discharge are highly correlated in the high frequency domain which reflects the hydrogeological response during flood events of typical highly karstified systems. Pumping and groundwater level are correlated in a lower frequency domain, illustrating seasonal to multi-year relationships. Secondly, continuous wavelet transform was applied to characterize the temporal variability of the inter-relationships involved. On the contrary to examples of "non-managed" karst aquifers in the literature, our results showed that the 10-year rainfall component was attenuate in the discharge signal. We assume that the reason is that the storage variations are strongly affected by pumping. This interesting result shows that possible long-term impacts of rainfall variability due to climate change may be masked by a high pumping rate. We showed also that despite an increase of the pumping rate from the 1980s, the stress on the groundwater resource does not increase from year to year. The present pumping strategy does not affect the drawdown in the long term, avoiding an over-exploitation of the aquifer. Finally, this study highlights the effectiveness of wavelet analysis in characterizing the response variability of karst systems where the hydrogeological regime is modified by pumping.

AB The relationship between stream water DOC concentrations and soil organic C pools was investigated at a range of spatial scales in subcatchments of the River Dee system in north-east Scotland. Catchment percentage peat cover and soil C pools, calculated using local, national and international soils databases, were related to mean DOC concentrations in streams draining small- (<5 km(2)), medium- (12-38 km(2)) and large-scale (56-150 km(2)) catchments. The results show that, whilst soil C pool is a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration at all three scales, the strongest relationships were found in the small-scale catchments. In addition, in both the small- and large-scale catchments, percentage peat cover was as a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration as catchment soil C pool. The data also showed that, for a given soil C pool, streams draining lowland (< 700 m) catchments had higher DOC concentrations than those draining upland (> 700 m) catchments, suggesting that disturbance and land use may have a small effect on DOC concentration. Our results therefore suggest that the relationship between stream water DOC concentration and catchment soil C pools exists at a range of spatial scales and this relationship appears to be sufficiently robust to be used to predict the effects of changes in catchment soil C storage on stream water DOC concentration.

TI Rain viewed as relaxational events

ID SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM
AB By following an analogy to earthquakes, we demonstrate how, from the point of view of energy flow through an open system, rain is analogous to many other relaxational processes in Nature. Defining rain events as the basic entities of the phenomenon, we show that the number density of rain events per year is inversely proportional to the released water column raised to the power 1.4. This is the rain-equivalent of the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. The event durations and the waiting times between events are also characterized by scaling regions, where no typical time scale exists. The Hurst exponent of the rain intensity signal H = 0.76 > 0.5. It is valid in the temporal range from minutes up to the full duration of the signal of half a year. All of our findings are consistent with the concept of self-organized criticality, which refers to the tendency of slowly driven non-equilibrium systems to evolve into a state of scale free behaviour. We note that self-organized criticality may offer an alternative to the chaos theoretic perspective on the subject of rain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glacier mass balance (MB) and runoff relationship is poorly explored in the Himalaya due to limited in-situ data. A simplified glacio-hydrological model is used to reconstruct the long-term MB and runoff on Dokriani Bamak Glacier (DBG) in the Monsoon regime and Chhota Shigri Glacier (CSG) catchments in the Alpine regime of the Himalaya. Since 1950, DBG and CSG show limited mass wastage with mean annual glacier-wide MB of -0.09 +/- 0.35 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.12 +/- 0.28 m w.e. a(-1), respectively. The mean annual catchment-wide runoff are also almost similar 0.13 +/- 0.01 106 m(3) a(-1) and 0.14 +/- 0.01 106 m(3) a(-1) from DBG and CSG catchments, respectively over 1950-2020. Available in-situ short-term MB and runoff data from eight glacierized catchments do not show any significant MB-runoff relationship, except for CSG. The long-term modelled MB and runoff data on both DBG and CSG catchments suggest that the higher catchment-wide runoff corresponds to more negative MB, and vice versa. This is in contrast to the previously suggested MB-runoff relationship on DBG catchment. Present detailed analysis also indicates that the hydrology of the DBG catchment is mainly dominated by the summer precipi-tation, while in CSG catchment, it is mainly controlled by the glacier-wide annual MB. In dry years, the corre-sponding negative annual MB on both the glaciers provides additional glacier-degraded runoff to the catchment streams that can be as high as 13% and 38% of total runoff on DBG and CSG catchments, respectively.

AB Chaos theory is integrated with Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) engine as a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting. This is to be referred to as Chaos-MGGP and its performance is tested using daily historic flow time series at four gauging stations in two countries with a mix of both intermittent and perennial rivers. Three models are developed: (i) Local Prediction Model (LPM); (ii) standalone MGGP; and (iii) Chaos-MGGP, where the first two models serve as the benchmark for comparison purposes. The Phase-Space Reconstruction (PSR) parameters of delay time and embedding dimension form the dominant input signals derived from original time series using chaos theory and these are transferred to Chaos-MGGP. The paper develops a procedure to identify global optimum values of the PSR parameters for the construction of a regression-type prediction model to implement the Chaos-MGGP model. The inter-comparison of the results at the selected four gauging stations shows that the Chaos-MGGP model provides more accurate forecasts than those of stand-alone MGGP or LPM models.

AB Although the constitutive relationship of relative permeability as a function of saturation has been examined extensively in soil science and petroleum engineering, there is little information about this relationship for many systems encountered at hazardous waste sites. This lack of data has led to the use of estimation methods for relative permeability without verifying that they are indeed applicable to systems representative of hazardous waste sites. To assess the accuracy of methods commonly used for the prediction of two-phase relative permeabilities, drainage and imbibition relative permeabilities were measured for several organic liquid-water systems. A comparison of these measurements with estimates generated with five common methods showed that these methods are limited in their predictive capabilities. They estimated the relative permeability to the aqueous phase well, but failed to predict the low permeability to the organic liquid. For the relative permeability to the organic liquid to reach the predicted value of unity at the residual aqueous phase saturation, the effective permeabilities must be normalized by the permeability measured in the presence of residual water. The common estimation techniques make no provision for hysteresis. Since the aqueous phase showed little hysteresis, these estimations methods can be applied to both drainage and imbibition processes for this phase. However, the organic liquid phase showed hysteresis, and thus these techniques may only be appropriately applied to drainage for the nonwetting phase.

AB Understanding variations in soil moisture and soil water potential is important for describing hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. An intensive field campaign to measure soil moisture, soil water potential, and rainfall events was performed at many locations and depths to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of hydrometric measurements along steep hillslopes. Soil moisture and soil water tension analysis showed seasonally distinctive features in statistics and probability distributions. The relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension was explored to characterize seasonal and spatial variations. The recession slopes of soil moisture at several given points of the relationship were also seasonally different. The Brooks and Corey model and the van Genuchten model were used to estimate parameters for the measured data to explain the spatial and seasonal variations. Soil water storage analysis not only indicated that lateral flow tends to be abundant at greater depths but also revealed a seasonal trend in development of subsurface flow in the downslope direction. The combined impact of topography and vegetation determined the seasonal differences in hydrometric responses along the hillslope locations.

AB This paper describes a flexible prototype negotiation support system (NSS), to be used in a participatory context, based on the negotiation setting that was suggested by Turkey: bilateral negotiations between Turkey and Iraq, annual analysis, the assumption that Iraq and Syria have no inherent water rights, differences in water entitlements or needs are neglected, analysis restricted to the Tigris-Euphrates basin, current irrigation technologies in Turkey and Iraq, and negotiations on water quantity and quality that account for national dam construction plans. The analysis is based on all principles of the 1997 UN Convention that are recognised by Turkey: net benefits defined at a basin level, equitable use, non-significant harm, maintenance of water quality. The goal is to achieve a balance of interests among the parties that combines analysis of the quantity and quality of water and the net benefits. The negotiation outcomes arise from simulated dynamic interactions between the parties. We demonstrate an application of the NSS based on plausible and reasonable, but tentative, data to provide insights into water allocation rules, side-payments, water requirements of the two parties, and cooperation. Allocations should meet Iraqi non-significant harm and equitable use constraints and allocate the remaining water to Turkey for agricultural use in the feasible negotiation scenario, whereas allocations should meet Turkish maximum agricultural water demands and allocate the remaining water to Iraq for agricultural use in the unlikely cooperation scenario.

AB A hydroeconomic optimization approach is used to guide water management in a Chinese river basin with the objectives of meeting water quantity and water quality constraints, in line with the China 2011 No. 1 Policy Document and 2015 Ten-point Water Plan. The proposed modeling framework couples water quantity and water quality management and minimizes the total costs over a planning period assuming stochastic future runoff. The outcome includes cost-optimal reservoir releases, groundwater pumping, water allocation, wastewater treatments and water curtailments. The optimization model uses a variant of stochastic dynamic programming known as the water value method. Nonlinearity arising from the water quality constraints is handled with an effective hybrid method combining genetic algorithms and linear programming. Untreated pollutant loads are represented by biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and the resulting minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is computed with the Streeter-Phelps equation and constrained to match Chinese water quality targets. The baseline water scarcity and operational costs are estimated to 15.6 billion CNY/year. Compliance to water quality grade Ill causes a relatively low increase to 16.4 billion CNY/year. Dilution plays an important role and increases the share of surface water allocations to users situated furthest downstream in the system. The modeling framework generates decision rules that result in the economically efficient strategy for complying with both water quantity and water quality constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB A denitrifying bioreactor is a system where a carbon substrate (commonly woodchips) is used to reduce nitrate concentration in water flow. For many years, water flow through woodchips has been assumed laminar without proper validation. The main objective of this study was to validate Darcy's laminar flow assumption for woodchips. For this purpose, we conducted both constant head laboratory column experiments and field evaluation of a denitrification bed. Laboratory results revealed that Darcy's law does not apply for the majority of the hydraulic gradients forcing flow through fresh and old woodchip media. However, Forchheimer's equation adequately described the flow pattern using a quadratic equation. Statistical analysis showed that old woodchips (excavated from a denitrification bed) had significantly lower intrinsic permeability than fresh woodchips. We determined Forchheimer's and Darcy's in-situ coefficients, and used them to predict flow rate in a denitrification bed. Model evaluation statistics showed better flow rate prediction with Forchheimer's than Darcy's equation when compared with the measured flow rate. In conclusion, the linear flow assumption was inadequate for describing water flow through woodchips in a denitrification bed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a novel analytical approach that provides a simple, integrated tool for assessing the effects of hydroclimatically-driven flow regime variations on fish habitat. Average habitat quality metrics can be predicted effectively by an analytical equation. This is the result of the integration of two functions describing (a) the flow regime (the frequency distribution of discharge) and (b) the relationship between discharge and habitat quality. We applied this approach as a "proof of concept" to a simple model of velocity thresholds for juvenile salmon fry. The flow regime was described by a gamma distribution with physically meaningful parameters derived using a mechanistic-stochastic approach that explicitly links the flow regime to hydro-meteorological conditions and catchment wetness. Under different flow conditions, habitat quality was estimated using hydraulic habitat models. An empirical analytical function was then used to describe the relationship between specific discharge and habitat quality. Six river channel reaches characterized by different bed geometry and morphology were investigated. Four reaches are located in the Girnock burn, a natural upland river in the North of Scotland, while the remaining two reaches are located in the River Lyon in the central Highlands of Scotland that is heavily regulated for hydropower production. Results show that the stochastic model and the analytical function applied, each containing three parameters, successfully described Girnock (in both dry and wet years) and Lyon (naturalised) flow regimes and captured the relationship between available habitat and specific discharge reasonably well. For each site we obtained heat maps linking climatic and landscape features to bi-monthly average available habitat. These maps can provide clear generalised insights into the potential effects of hydroclimatic variations on metrics of fish habitat and have potential for wider applications using more complex habitat model.

AB Multiple variables from simulated climate fields are widely used in hydrological and ecological models and climate impact assessments, yet the importance of multivariate climate relationships is not widely recognised. This study evaluates climatic outputs from the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3) in the southern boreal forests of western Canada, by comparing the simulated multivariate relationships with those observed at three representative forest sites. Monthly mean data for five near-surface climate variables (net radiation RN, air temperature TA, relative humidity RH, wind speed WS and surface pressure P) are analysed and compared using visual inspection, hypothesis testing and principal component analysis. The projections of the 1st and 2nd principal components, which explain about 75% of the variation in the data, show remarkable similarities in the observations from the three forest sites (with some subtle differences between the evergreen and deciduous plant functional types), but some broad differences between the observations and model outputs. The model reproduces the observed relationships among RN, TA and P, but not between RH or WS and the other variables. In particular, RH is strongly and negatively related to TA and RN in the forest observations but independent in the model outputs; RH is negatively related to WS in the observations but positively related in the model output; and P is uncoupled from the other variables in the observations but negatively related to RH and WS in the model output. The broad scope of the differences indicates a divergence of process representation at large time and space scales. We explore possible reasons for the observed discrepancies, which indicate some limitations in using climate model outputs directly to drive hydrological models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A quasi-linear theory is presented for the geostatistical solution to the inverse problem. The archetypal problem is to estimate the log transmissivity function from observations of head and log transmissivity at selected locations. The unknown is parameterized as a realization of a random field, and the estimation problem is solved in two phases: structural analysis, where the random field is characterized, followed by estimation of the log transmissivity conditional on all observations. The proposed method generalizes the linear approach of Kitanidis and Vomvoris (1983). The generalized method is superior to the linear method in cases of large contrast in formation properties but informative measurements, i.e., there are enough observations that the variance of estimation error of the log transmissivity is small. The methodology deals rigorously with unknown drift coefficients and yields estimates of covariance parameters that are unbiased and grid independent. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated through an example that includes structural analysis, determination of best estimates, and conditional simulations.

ID STABILITY; FLUCTUATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL
AB In the context of changing environment, and specifically a possible climate change, a river flow regime type turns from being a merely general, average, descriptive characteristic to a tool for monitoring changes in Bow seasonality both in time and space. Utilization of river Bow regimes as a diagnostic tool for the output of climate models and in flow sensitivity studies demands an objective grouping of Bow series into regime types. A hierarchical aggregation of monthly Bow series into flow regime types, satisfying chosen discriminating criteria, is effectively performed by means of minimization of an entropy-based objective function. This function is based on the concept of an 'information loss' resulting from such an aggregation and describes the difference between the series aggregated into one group, i.e. inaccuracy of aggregation. The main advantage of the approach, operating on river flow series for individual years (and not only on long-term means), is its ability to consider also the temporal regularity of the seasonal flow patterns, neglected, as a rule, in other approaches. Meanwhile, both flow volumes and seasonal patterns of Bow are sensitive to climate fluctuations. A strict formulation of the 'stopping rules' in the hierarchical flow regime grouping, directly related to the aggregation principles, is suggested. The approach allows different formulations of criteria for discriminating flow regime types. It is illustrated on a regional river flow sample for Scandinavia for two different formulations of discriminating criteria. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) such as humic substances are key to understanding the aquatic environment in catchments, because they, containing a large number of phenolic and carboxylic acid groups, adsorb many kinds of inorganic materials and also affect nutrition and carbon transport in catchments. To understand the detailed DOC dynamics, we conducted hydrological observations at mountainous headwater catchments dominated by different vegetation types (planted evergreen coniferous forest of 1.29 ha and natural deciduous broadleaf forest of 1.28 ha). The relationship between DOC concentrations and fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid-like materials (F-FAM) were positively correlated in both catchments but different between soil extracts, baseflow, and near surface flow represented by biomat flow. The ratios of change in F-FAM to that in DOC concentration (F-FAM/DOC) were higher in the baseflow (about 6 in both catchments) and lower in the soil extracts (about 4.5 in both catchments, respectively). However, the relationship in stormflow was distributed between the trends of baseflow and soil extracts. The higher F-FAM/DOC in baseflow may thus indicate that DOC (and FAM) in groundwater discharge mainly contributed to the stream flow, and the stormflow mainly reflect subsurface flow through soil during most rainstorms. In contrast, a high F-FAM/DOC ratio (>6) appeared in the stormflow of both catchments especially during large storms of short duration and high intensity following a dry antecedent period. The F-FAM/DOC in biomat flow developing distinctly in the coniferous catchment was high (about 6.5). Thus, rapid shallow subsurface flow through the biomat or near-surface of slopes might explain the unique transport dynamics of DOC and FAM in stormflows with the high F-FAM/DOC ratio. These results imply that the DOC and FAM relationship responds variably depending on both the distribution of soil organic matter and rainwater flow paths in steep slopes as well as on storm size and characteristics.

AB Multiphase flow driven by gravity and capillary forces occurs in various applications pertaining to aquifers, the vadoze zone and hydrocarbon reservoirs. In particular, these processes have been under investigation for modeling CO2 migration in geosequestration applications. Solving such multiscale problems can be extremely computationally demanding and therefore upscaling is often employed. However, a recent study by Rabinovich and Cheng, 2020 showed that implementation of conventional upscaling methods fails to reproduce fine-grid simulations of gravity-capilary driven flow. This work presents a new upscaling method based on an effective property formula for permeability (k), power law averaging in the capillary limit for relative permeability, and an optimization approach for capillary pressure (P-c). The new method is tested on various example cases and coarse-grid simulations are shown to match fine-grid ones with sufficient accuracy. The challenge of upscaling the flows is found to be related to entry pressure trapping and the optimization upscaled P-c is shown to have a unique structure allowing to model the trapping. The method is global, requiring a fine-grid simulation for calibration of the optimized parameters. However, we show that the method reduces computational time dramatically if calibrated parameters are used in cases in which the fine-grid solution is unknown, such as for varying k realizations.

AB In this paper a methodology for the stochastic management of groundwater quality problems is presented, which can be used to provide agricultural advisory services. A stochastic algorithm to solve the coupled flow and mass transport inverse problem is combined with a stochastic management approach to develop methods for integrating uncertainty; thus obtaining more reliable policies on groundwater nitrate pollution control from agriculture. The stochastic inverse model allows identifying non-Gaussian parameters and reducing uncertainty in heterogeneous aquifers by constraining stochastic simulations to data. The management model determines the spatial and temporal distribution of fertilizer application rates that maximizes net benefits in agriculture constrained by quality requirements in groundwater at various control sites. The quality constraints can be taken, for instance, by those given by water laws such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Furthermore, the methodology allows providing the trade-off between higher economic returns and reliability in meeting the environmental standards. Therefore, this new technology can help stakeholders in the decision-making process under an uncertainty environment. The methodology has been successfully applied to a 2D synthetic aquifer, where an uncertainty assessment has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulation techniques. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB When a foundation pit is under hydraulic connection with surrounding environment, foundation pit dewatering usually incurs a series of environmental problems such as ground settlement. Recent studies reveal that the greatest settlement induced by dewatering sometimes appears in deep aquifer but sometimes appears at ground surface. This indicates that the location of the greatest settlement (LoGS) due to dewatering is uncertain. To reveal the evolution law of LoGS subject to groundwater drawdown during dewatering, a fluid-solid coupling numerical model was established based on a practical dewatering test inside a foundation pit. Measured and computed distributions of ground settlement and groundwater drawdown around the foundation pit were compared. Further, extensive numerical simulations were conducted to clarify the evolution of LoGS under different dewatering conditions. If the dewatered aquifer is of strong hydraulic connection with the overlying aquifers, the dewatering-induced maximum settlement will initially appear at the top of the dewatered aquifer but quickly shift upward to the ground surface. If a poor hydraulic connectivity exists between them, the maximum settlement will always stay at the top of the dewatered aquifer. However, regardless of the hydraulic conditions in strata, a good agreement always exists between LoGS and the zero-drawdown location above the dewatered aquifer.

AB A semi-analytical solution is developed for drawdown of transient confined-unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer. The proposed solution considers the aquifer anisotropy and the drainage from the unsaturated zone above the water table in the transient unconfined region. Based on the work by Moench (1995), the parameter of gamma related to vertical hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, specific yield and a delayed coefficient is introduced to investigate the delayed responses of flow behaviours, i.e., drawdown and development of the transient unconfined region. The results indicate that the flow behaviours simulations by the proposed solution are identical to that by Visual-MODFLOW Flex and finite difference method. The drawdown delayed responses occur in the early and intermediate segments, and disappear at the late segment during the transient confined-unconfined conversion. The increasing of the vertical hydraulic conductivity and the delayed coefficient can decrease the drawdown and limit the development of transient unconfined region, thus, and postpone the time of transient confined-unconfined conversion in a radial distance. The release of water by gravity storage nearby the piezometer surface is quick, resulting in an obvious log-log S-shaped drawdown-time curve. As buried depth increases, the effect of artesian storage is more pronounced. This paper provides much-needed insights of drawdown delayed response during the confined-unconfined conversion.

AB Hydrologic extremes often lead to droughts and floods that adversely affect the socio-economic development. Change in the characteristics and causes of hydrologic extremes due to climate variability and climate change poses a challenge for its reliable prediction. We propose a time-varying approach to capture such temporal changes, often gradual, in hydrologic extremes through temporal networks (a series of network structures). Graphical Modelling (GM) based networks are developed through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to deal with the complexity between the causal variables and extreme events. A demonstration of the proposed time-varying approach is shown for 1-month and 3-month ahead hydrological drought prediction in terms of Standardized Streamflow Anomaly Index (SSAI), at basin scale, that has notably changed in the recent years in terms of its frequency and severity. The frequency and severity of below-normal flow events has increased, particularly during the monsoon season (high flow months). We hypothesize that time-varying cause-effect relationship is important to capture such gradual change in the characteristics of hydrologic extremes. The results indicate that SSAI values for the low flow months are strongly associated with streamflow whereas for the high flow months the dominant predictors are rainfall, precipitable water and relative humidity. Furthermore, the cause-effect relationship between hydroclimatic variables and extreme events needs to be updated every 2 years for high flow and 3 years for low flow months. The proposed model very well captures the above and below-normal flow events and can be used as a remedial measure to handle similar cases through a proper assessment of time-varying cause-effect relationship between hydroclimatic variables and extreme events.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID PERFORMANCE; WHEEL
AB Erosion and hillslope surface/subsurface hydrology studies are in need of temporal measurement of flow rates, where sediment-laden runoff normally presents. A new method/sensor capable of taking automatic measurements of sediment-laden runoff flow rates is presented. Mechanical, structures, hydraulic backgrounds and computational principles of the suggested sensor are discussed in details. Theoretical-analysis of surface hydraulic formed the basis for formulating a function for calibration of the sensor to clear water flow. A functional relationship was derived for adjustment of flow rates of sediment-laden water. Calibration experiments validated the hydraulic relationship between the flow rate of clear water and the sensor's outputs. The adjustment function of flow rate produced highly accurate measurements of sediment-laden runoff. Applications of the newly-developed flow senor to a laboratory watershed exposed to rainfall evens of both constant and variable intensities demonstrate that the sensor is highly accurate and capable of taking continuous measurements of the transient hydrographic processes of runoff. The accuracy and reliability of the flow device with tabor and time saving advantages will be useful in hillslope monitoring for research and other purposes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over 90% of Malawi's electricity generation and irrigation depend on Lake Malawi outflows into the Shire River. Recent lake level declines have raised concerns over future climate change impacts, including the risk of no outflows if the Lake Malawi Outflow Threshold (LMOT) is passed. Addressing calls for model co-production, we iteratively engage stakeholders in data collection, and eliciting local system insights and management priorities, to inform the development of a Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model for the Lake Malawi Shire River Basin. We use a simple model setup and manual calibration to allow for data sparsity and limited documentation of historical management decisions. The model satisfactorily captures limited observed streamflow patterns of Lake Malawi tributaries and lake level variations for the period 1960-2009, however, small errors in lake level simulation significantly affect simulation of monthly outflows. The riparian countries, Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique contribute approximately 55%, 41% and 4% respectively to lake inflows (1960-2009 average). Forced with 29 bias-corrected global climate model projections (2021-2050) and assuming no change in current operating rules of key infrastructure, the WEAP model simulates wide-ranging changes. These include much higher lake levels that would cause downstream floods, and much lower lake levels, including 11 projections that fall below the LMOT. Both outcomes would have major implications for downstream hydropower and irrigation. Future water management plans require identification and evaluation of strategies that can address multi-year shifts in lake levels and the uncertainty inherent in future climate and hydrological model outputs.

AB delta(18)O data were used to test a two-end-member hydrologic mixing model previously published for an area of lowland rainforest in Costa Rica. The model distinguishes interbasin groundwater transfer from locally-recharged groundwater. The model was originally based on data for chloride (Cl) and other major ions and is fully consistent with new Cl data presented here. The mixing model was used to generate five predictions concerning delta(18)O at 13 groundwater and surface water sampling sites, on the premise that the model would be supported if delta(18)O data agreed with the predictions. Overall, the delta(18)O data are consistent with the predictions, giving reasonably clear support for 3 of the 5, and neither clearly supporting nor ruling out the other 2. The large intra-site temporal variability in delta(18)O precludes conclusive confirmation of the latter two predictions. This variability also affects the results of mixing calculations to quantify the proportions of each end member in water samples representing mixtures of the end members. Mixing calculations based on delta(18)O give different results and much higher uncertainties than those based on Cl. For delta(18)O data, intra-site variability is large relative to the difference between the two end member waters, leading to large uncertainty in delta(18)O-based mixing calculations. In this case, Cl appears to be the superior tracer for interbasin groundwater transfer, mainly because intra-site variability in Cl is small relative to the large Cl difference between end members.

AB Simultaneous variations in weather and climate over widely separated regions are commonly known as "hydroclimatic teleconnections". Rainfall and runoff patterns, over continents, are found to be significantly teleconnected, with large-scale circulation patterns, through such hydroclimatic teleconnections. Though such teleconnections exist in nature, it is very difficult to model them, due to their inherent complexity.
   Statistical techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools gain popularity in modeling hydroclimatic teleconnection, based on their ability, in capturing the complicated relationship between the predictors (e.g. sea surface temperatures) and predictand (e.g., rainfall). Genetic Programming is such an AI tool, which is capable of capturing nonlinear relationship, between predictor and predictand, due to its flexible functional structure. In the present study, gridded multi-site weekly rainfall is predicted from El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) indices, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and lag rainfall at grid points, over the catchment, using Genetic Programming.
   The predicted rainfall is further used in a Genetic Programming model to predict streamflows. The model is applied for weekly forecasting of streamflow in Mahanadi River, India, and satisfactory performance is observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pluvial erosion process is significantly affected by tempo-spatial patterns of flood flows. However, despite their importance, only a few studies have investigated the sediment flow behavior that is driven by different flood regimes. The study aims to investigate the effect of intra-event-based flood regimes on the dynamics of sediment exports at Tuanshangou catchment, a typical agricultural catchment (unmanaged) in the hilly loess region on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Measurements of 193 flood events and 158 sediment-producing events were collected from Tuanshangou station between 1961 and 1969. The combined methods of hierarchical clustering approach, discriminant analysis and One-Way ANOVA were used to classify the flood events in terms of their event-based flood characteristics, including flood duration, peak discharge, and event flood runoff depth. The 193 flood events were classified into five regimes, and the mean statistical features of each regime significantly differed. Regime A includes flood events with the shortest duration (76 min), minimum flood crest (0.045 m s(-1)), least runoff depth (0.2 mm), and highest frequency. Regime B includes flood events with a medium duration (274 min), medium flood crest (0.206 m s(-1)), and minor runoff depth (0.7 mm). Regime C includes flood events with the longest duration (822 min), medium flood crest (0.236 m s(-1)), and medium runoff depth (1.7 mm). Regime D includes flood events with a medium duration (239 min), large flood crest (4.21 m s(-1)), and large runoff depth (10 mm). Regime E includes flood events with a medium duration (304 min), maximum flood crest (8.62 m s(-1)), and largest runoff depth (25.9 mm). The sediment yield by different flood regimes is ranked as follows: Regime E > Regime D > Regime B > Regime C > Regime A. In terms of event-based average and maximum suspended sediment concentration, these regimes are ordered as follows: Regime E > Regime D > Regime C > Regime B > Regime A. Regimes D and E produce the most runoff volume and the largest amount of sediments, which indicates that these regimes must be at the focus of runoff regulation to control the sediments. Given that the event flood runoff depth remains constant, the sediment yield by different flood regimes is regulated to varying degrees by altering the event-based runoff-sediment relationship. Compared with Regime A, the average decrease rates in the area-specific sediment yield for Regimes B, C, and D are 33%, 78%, and 62%, respectively. The regulative effect of the flood regime conversion on sediment export can be described with several variables that indicate the depth-specific characteristics of individual flood events. Flood regimes indicate the runoff erosivity dynamics and the runoff energy dissipation rates in eroding soil and delivering sediments. Therefore, the flood-regime-dependent sediment flow behavior differs across all regimes. Overall, the predominated controlling factors that influence the final sediment export are regime based. Empirical regime-based runoff-sediment relationships were established via multiple stepwise regressions. The suspended sediment concentration that is driven by different flood regimes can be described by the power function or logarithmic-linear function of runoff-related Variables, including instantaneous discharge, runoff erosive power, and event-based flow variability. The regressive equations can explain the major driving forces behind the suspended sediment concentration dynamics.
   This study highlights the potentials of runoff self-regulation in controlling soil erosion and sediment delivery. The results may provide some evidence for flood regime classification, improve the overall evaluation of the sediment reduction benefits of the runoff regulation system, enrich runoff regulation theory, and improve the runoff control at the catchment scale.

AB Available high quality precipitation datasets generally cover only recent periods. To extend these datasets back in time is challenging due to historically lower rain gauge network density or poorer remote sensing. In this study, a Bayesian joint probability method is presented to extend the temporal coverage of high quality precipitation datasets by calibrating reanalysis estimates. Relationships between precipitation estimates from a high quality dataset and precipitation estimates from a reanalysis dataset are established by using data from the overlapping period of the two datasets. The relationships are then used to calibrate reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available. Rain gauge observations are also used to enhance the calibration. The method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution as the high quality dataset, corrects bias, and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset. The calibrated estimates generated are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty. The method is applied to the Han River basin in China, using the CMPA high quality dataset and the ERA-interim reanalysis dataset. The method is shown to be highly effective in improving the quality of ERA-Interim.

AB There is growing evidence that the seasonal climate of northern extratropical regions can be predicted with lead times of several months. This paper examines the seasonal predictability of summer hydrometeorological conditions (air temperatures, precipitation, soil moisture status and naturalised river flows) for the River Thames basin using significant lagged relationships to wintertime sea surface temperatures (SSTs), sea-ice extent, and atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Atlantic and Tropics since 1946. Stepwise regression on untransformed and lognormal responses reveal strong summertime forcing of air temperatures and precipitation by SSTs; of precipitation and soil moisture by sea-ice extent; and of temperatures, soil moisture and river flow by pressure anomalies over the Barents/Greenland Sea. Not surprisingly, wintertime soil moisture status and river flows were also important endogenous predictors of summer conditions. All seasonal models possessed greater skill than climatology, with levels of explained variance between 13 and 79% when tested using data not used for model calibration. Asymmetry in the most promising predictor-response relationship can also be exploited via compositing techniques. This enables probabilistic forecasting of summer river flows given certain weather patterns in the North Atlantic. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of unsaturated flow often require an assessment of the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K(u)) and moisture content (theta). Measured K(u)-theta relationships for a well-sorted sandy soil were obtained using the instantaneous profile method during snowmelt recharge. These values are compared with estimates from three approaches: the Campbell equation, a modified version of the Campbell model that considers residual water, and the rate of isotopic tracer displacement during infiltration. The modified Campbell model provided the best fit to the observed data, although all three methods overpredicted K(u). The isotopic tracer method overestimated observed K(u) values by 2.6-4.5 times. This may reflect the role of macropores upon hydraulic conductivities during infiltration, since the tracer method is employed during recharge, while the instantaneous profile method is generally used during drainage periods when macropores are nonconductive. Whereas K(u) estimates derived from empirical approaches such as the Campbell model may be valid during conditions of drainage, the isotopic tracer model appears to provide more realistic conductivity values during infiltration. The latter method also provides a direct means of estimating the immobile fraction of total soil water.

AB Understanding the relationship between trunk sap flow and tree diameter is crucial for tree-stand transpiration upscaling and sap flow measurement strategy design, because of well-known tree-to-tree variations in sap flow metrics. However, whether and how this relationship will vary intra-and inter-annually, and the underlying mechanisms, are still poorly understood. We measured the sap flow of 126 trees throughout a six-year experi-ment (2016-2021) in a temperate poplar (Populus tomentosa) forest with five irrigation management regimes. Simultaneously, we also monitored meteorological factors, leaf area indices, and soil water contents. There was a great variability of both sap flux (SF) and sap flux density (SFD) across trees, and this variability tended to be larger in older stands. Patterns of the relationships between SF, SFD, and diameter at breast height (DBH) changed markedly from year to year. A nonlinear positive correlation (P < 0.001) between SF and DBH was found, except in 2016 when canopy closure did not occur. In contrast, no correlations between SFD and DBH were observed in most years, but their correlations became positive and linear in two wet years (2018, 2021) (P < 0.05). The power (Q) of DBH to explain tree-to-tree sap flow variations exhibited enormous change on both intra-and inter-annual scales, underpinned by different mechanisms. The potential transpiration demand of trees mainly determined the intra-annual variation of Q, but its effect depended on stand development, whereas the environmental water supply mostly controlled the inter-annual variation of Q. Based on these results, we provide some recommendations on sap flow measurement and stand transpiration estimation for pure tree plantations in water-limited regions. Our findings should assist the accurate prediction of stand water use in plantation forests of both poplar and other tree species.

ID CONFLICT; WATER; METHODOLOGY
AB Large scale urbanization has resulted in greater withdrawals of shared waters and this withdrawal has been largely dependent on the hegemony of the riparian's. The last few decades has seen the upward surge of many countries in terms of development as well as hegemony. Existing structures of established water sharing framework typically evaluate only parameters related to historic water use such as historic water demand and supply, contribution to flow, and hydrology. Water conflicts and cooperation is affected by various issues related with development and hegemony. Characterization and quantification of development and hegemony parameters is a very complex process. This paper establishes a novel approach to predict river basins at risk; the approach addresses the issue of water conflict and cooperation within a methodologically more rigorous predictive framework. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique is used in this paper to undertake the risk assessment of international transboundary rivers. In this paper the fuzzy domain of risk consists of two fuzzy sets - hegemony and development, indices of which are developed with the help of fuzzy synthetic evaluation techniques. Then the compositional rule-base is framed to ascertain the fuzzy risk. This fuzzy risk can be further used to prioritize all the international river basins which can help in the identification of potentially high risk basins. Risk identification of international river basins is not only scientifically valuable, but also practically highly useful. Identifying those basins that are likely to be particularly prone to conflict or cooperation is of high interest to policy makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continued climate variability, population growth, and rising food prices present ongoing challenges for achieving food and water security in poor countries that lack adequate water infrastructure. Undeveloped storage infrastructure presents a special challenge in northern Afghanistan, where food security is undermined by highly variable water supplies, inefficient water allocation rules, and a damaged irrigation system due three decades of war and conflict. Little peer-reviewed research to date has analyzed the economic benefits of water storage capacity expansions as a mechanism to sustain food security over long periods of variable climate and growing food demands needed to feed growing populations. This paper develops and applies an integrated water resources management framework that analyzes impacts of storage capacity expansions for sustaining farm income and food security in the face of highly fluctuating water supplies. Findings illustrate that in Afghanistan's Balkh Basin, total farm income and food security from crop irrigation increase, but at a declining rate as water storage capacity increases from zero to an amount equal to six times the basin's long term water supply. Total farm income increases by 21%, 41%, and 42% for small, medium, and large reservoir capacity, respectively, compared to the existing irrigation system unassisted by reservoir storage capacity. Results provide a framework to target water infrastructure investments that improve food security for river basins in the world's dry regions with low existing storage capacity that face ongoing climate variability and increased demands for food security for growing populations.

   hydraulics; Aquifer test; Pumping test
ID FLOW; FLUIDS
AB The radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are fundamental concepts in hydrogeology with various uses in well hydraulics and aquifer testing. However, numerous definitions have been given of these radii, which have often been equated while they are fundamentally different. Here radius of influence is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which the influence of pumping is significant. On the other hand, radius of investigation is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence on drawdown at the well. The exact meaning of the term significant is open to interpretation and, consequently, various operational definitions (i.e., definitions that enable quantification) have been given of radius of influence and radius of investigation. We comprehensively review these definitions and corresponding estimation methods, and discuss the relevance of each definition in view of different potential uses. We also propose new definitions that are more adapted to several applications. Next, we quantitatively compare the various definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation. The results show that while remaining of the same order of magnitude, the radii are significantly affected by the choice of operational definition and associated parameters. As a rule of thumb, the radius of investigation is half of the radius of influence. We eventually propose a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition of radius of influence or radius of investigation depending on the objective.

AB Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available.

DE Kinematic wave; Dam break flood; Flood propagation; Non-uniform valley
ID SIMULATION; OVERLAND; MODEL; FLOW; LAKE
AB In non-uniform valleys, dam-break flood waves can be significantly affected by downstream variations in river width, slope, and roughness. To model these effects, we derive new analytical solutions to the kinematic wave equation, applicable to rating curves in the power law form and hydrographs of generic shape as long as they produce a single shock at the wave front. New results are first obtained for uniform channels, using the Gauss-Green theorem applied to characteristic-bounded regions of the (x, t) plane. The results are then extended to non-uniform valleys, using a change of variable that homogenizes river properties by rescaling the distance coordinate. The solutions are illustrated and validated for idealized cases, then applied to three historical dam failures: the 2008 breaching failure of the Tangjiashan landslide dam, the 1976 piping failure of Teton Dam, and the 1959 sudden failure of Malpasset Dam. In spite of the much reduced computational cost and data requirements, the results agree well with the field data and with more elaborate simulations. They also clarify how both river and hydrograph properties affect flood propagation and attenuation.

AB The ease of access to media resources and computational power has recently generated interest in using visionbased approaches for hydraulic monitoring. A key challenge for non-intrusive, image-based hydrology measurement methods is incorporating different hydraulic variables as prior knowledge with image information. We propose a photogrammetry-based method called L1-Diffusion derived from the convection-diffusion equation commonly used in hydrodynamics with an additional regularization term to estimate the fluid motion field in the image plane, from which the free surface velocity can be further obtained using the photogrammetric projection relationship between the image plane and world coordinates. The inverse problem is used to discuss the relationship between the widely used space-time image velocimetry (STIV) and the proposed L1-Diffusion. To validate the proposed method, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images as well as in-situ acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) experiments were carried out. Based on comparison results with the ADCP measurement and vision-based flow field estimation, the newly proposed L1-Diffusion algorithm can accurately and efficiently estimate the free surface velocity of a river from the image sequences in a variety of scenarios.

AB This study considers the flow of water in ice-covered compound channels with straight trapezoidal cross-sections. For describing the lateral distribution of depth-averaged streamwise velocity in aforementioned channels, a modified analytical model, which incorporates the influences of channel bed friction, ice cover resistance, lateral shear turbulence and secondary currents, is derived by the Shiono and Knight method and a two-layer hypothesis. Then the analytical model is applied to straight compound channels with full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice. The modeled results of the two cases, which employ appropriate boundary conditions, indicate good predictions for the transverse distribution of depth-averaged streamwise velocity when compared with captured experimental results. Subsequently, the intensities and rotational directions of secondary flows and the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity effect are exhaustively discussed, finding that the intensities of secondary flows in the main channel domain for the two cases present opposite changing laws as flow depth increases, and the signs of secondary flow coefficients are verified to be consistent with experimental observations. The theoretical approach used herein can supply some guidance for investigating the flow characteristics of ice-covered channels.

ID APPROXIMATION
AB Effective lead-time stream flow forecast is one of the key aspects of successful water resources management in and regions. In this research, we present new data-driven models based on Statistical Learning Theory that were used to forecast flows at two time scales: seasonal flow volumes and hourly stream flows. The models, known as Support Vector Machines, are learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a Kernel induced higher dimensional feature space, and are trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory. They are based on a principle that aims at minimizing the generalized model error (risk), rather than just the mean square error over a training set. Due to Mercer's condition on the kernels the corresponding optimization problems are convex and hence have no local minima. Empirical results from these models showed a promising performance in solving site-specific, real-time water resources management problems. Stream flow was forecasted using local-climatological data and requiring far less input than physical models. In addition, seasonal flow volume predictions were improved by incorporating atmospheric circulation indicators. Specifically, use of the North-Pacific Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) improved flow volume predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB Interception loss from a multi-species, deciduous, broad-leaved secondary forest in Japan was derived from gross rainfall, throughfall, and stemflow. The seasonal changes in the canopy structure were expressed using the leaf area index, which ranged from 1.65 to 4.31. In addition, the relationship between leaf area index (LAI) and relative light index (RLI) was examined using the Beer-Lambert equation. We established that RLI was associated with the canopy cover fraction. The relationships between throughfall, stemflow, and interception loss and gross rainfall were approximated by a linear regression equation for the growing and dormant seasons. Spatial variability in throughfall could be estimated from the relationship between the ratios of throughfall and RLI or LAI measured at many points, and had a high coefficient of variation. For stemflow, the regression coefficient and constant were strongly related to the diameter at breast height and were approximated by exponential equations. The differences in interception loss between seasons were small despite the distinct differences in LAI (the percentages of the total gross rainfall were 17.6 and 14.3% in the growing and dormant seasons, respectively). The revised Gash model was used to estimate interception loss more precisely by dividing the calculation period into (i) the entire study period, (ii) the growing and dormant seasons, and (iii) 3-month periods. The estimated interception loss was over- and underestimated by 7.8% for (i), 1.4% for (ii), and -2.2% for (iii). Regarding the parameters in revised Gash model, the canopy storage capacity varied with changes in LAI, and the evaporation rate was related not only to meteorological conditions, but also to the canopy structure in terms of aerodynamic resistance. 0 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB On the edge of sedimentary basins, burial of geological layers can involve the formation of confined karst aquifers. In some cases, relationships between confined and unconfined karst aquifers can exist and imply an increased difficulty in delineating contributive areas of karst system outlets with accuracy. This work aims to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to highlight groundwater exchanges between multilayered karst aquifers feeding a single spring.
   Toulon Springs, located in western France, provides the opportunity to study relationships between two multilayered karst aquifers. Hydrograph and chemograph analysis coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) are used to evaluate groundwater-flow origins on the northern edge of a sedimentary basin. Natural hydrodynamic responses (baseflow recession analysis, auto-cross correlation function) show an important volume of water located in a saturated zone of the Toulon karst system. Significant contrasts in water quality as a function of the hydrological regime (flood, recession, and baseflow regime) and comparison with shallow and deep water show the participation of a deep aquifer supporting the flow of Toulon Springs.

AB Long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land. Missing data due to equipment malfunction and other challenges have limited conclusions that can be made about annual flow and thus nutrient loads from field studies, including assessments of the effect of controlled drainage. Water table depth data may be available during gaps in flow data, providing a basis for filling missing drain flow data; therefore, the overall goal of this study was to examine the potential to estimate drain flow using water table observations. The objectives were to evaluate how the shape of the relationship between drain flow and water table height above drain varies depending on the soil hydraulic conductivity profile, to quantify how well the Hooghoudt equation represented the water table-drain flow relationship in five years of measured data at the Davis Purdue Agricultural Center (DPAC), and to determine the impact of controlled drainage on drain flow using the filled dataset. The shape of the drain flow-water table height relationship was found to depend on the selected hydraulic conductivity profile. Estimated drain flow using the Hooghoudt equation with measured water table height for both free draining and controlled periods compared well to observed flow with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values above 0.7 and 0.8 for calibration and validation periods, respectively. Using this method, together with linear regression for the remaining gaps, a long-term drain flow record for a controlled drainage experiment at the DPAC was used to evaluate the impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow. In the controlled drainage sites, annual flow was 14-49% lower than free drainage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Constraining temporal and spatial variability in water stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) is requested for interpreting proxy records of paleoclimate/paleoaltimetry. The southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) receives large amounts of precipitation in both summer (JJAS) and spring (MAM) and this makes it different from most other parts of the TP where annual precipitation concentrates only in summer. However, our knowledge of controls on precipitation and surface runoff generation in this region is still far from sufficient. In this study, the delta O-18 and delta D of precipitation and stream waters across the southeastern TP were analyzed to investigate moisture sources and empirical isotope-elevation relationships. Herein, seasonal precipitation patterns, moisture trajectories and precipitation isotopes suggest this region is seasonally dominated by the monsoon in summer and the southerlies (from the Bay of Bengal) or a mix of southerlies and westerlies in spring. Spatially, vertical variations in precipitation seasonality exert profound influences on isotopic variability for stream waters. Larger contributions of spring precipitation (with higher delta O-18 and d-excess (d-excess = delta D-8 delta O-18) compared to summer precipitation) vs. summer precipitation in the surface runoff generation at lower elevations account for the uncommon altitudinal decrease in streamwater d-excess. Such a cause also contributes to the slightly greater vertical lapse rates of streamwater delta O-18 (-0.28 to -0.48 parts per thousand/100 m) relative to the Himalayan front. In addition, although a robust delta O-18 elevation relationship is demonstrated based upon our measured and other published data on a broad spatial scale (over a 5200 m elevation range), this relationship is found to deviate from the empirical/theoretical pattern in the Himalayan front, which is also caused by the substantial spring precipitation in the southeastern TP. It is suggested that long-term changes in delta O-18 or delta D of paleowater in this region actually represent both changes in past regional elevations and contributions of summer vs. spring atmospheric circulations.

AB Shallow saturated subsurface flow is a dominant runoff mechanism on hillslopes of headwater catchments under humid temperate climate. Its timing and magnitude is significantly affected by the presence of preferential pathways. Reliable prediction of runoff from hillslope soils under such conditions remains a challenge.
   In this study, a quantitative relationship between rainfall, stormflow, and leakage to bedrock for hill slopes, where lateral preferential runoff represents a dominant part of the overall response, was sought. Combined effects of temporal rainfall distribution and initial hillslope saturation (antecedent moisture conditions) on stormflow, leakage to bedrock, and overall water balance were evaluated by conducting simulations with synthetic rainfall episodes.
   A two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to analyze hydrological processes at an experimental hillslope site located in a small forested headwater catchment.
   Long-term seasonal simulations with natural rainfall indicated that leakage to bedrock occurred mostly as saturated flow during major runoff events. The amount of rainfall needed to initiate stormflow appeared as a dynamic hillslope property, depending on temporal rainfall distribution, initial hillslope storage, and the spatial distribution of soil water within the hillslope. No single valued rainfall threshold responsible for triggering stormflow was found. Rainfall-stormflow as well as rainfall-leakage relationships were found highly nonlinear for low initial hillslope saturations. Temporal rainfall distribution affected the amount of rainfall necessary to initiate stormflow more than it did the amounts of stormflow or leakage to bedrock. In spite of a simple hillslope geometry with constant slope and parallel soil-atmosphere and soil-bedrock interfaces considered in the analysis, the applied model predicted a hysteretic behavior of storage-discharge relationship.
   The results showed a mutual interplay of components of hillslope water balance exposing a nonlinear character of the hillslope response. The study provided a quantitatively coherent insight in the hydraulic functioning of hillslopes where preferential flow constitutes a dominant part of stormflow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We disentangle the relationships between streamflow and large-scale atmospheric circulation in Central Europe (CE), an area affected by climatic influences from different origins (Atlantic, Mediterranean and Continental) and characterized by diverse topography and flow regimes. Our literature review examines in detail the links between mean, high and low flows in CE and large-scale circulation patterns, with focus on two closely related phenomena, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western-zonal circulation (WC). For both patterns, significant relations, consistent between different studies, are found for large parts of CE. The strongest links are found for the winter season, forming a dipole-like pattern with positive relationships with streamflow north of the Alps and the Carpathians for both indices and negative relationships for the NAO in the south. An influence of winter NAO is also detected in the amplitude and timing of snowmelt flows later in the year. Discharge in CE has further been linked to other large-scale climatic modes such as the Scandinavia pattern (SCA), the East Atlantic/West Russian pattern (EA/WR), the El Niflo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and synoptic weather patterns such as the Vb weather regime. Different mechanisms suggested in the literature to modulate links between streamflow and the NAO are combined with topographical characteristics of the target area in order to explain the divergent NAO/WC influence on streamflow in different parts of CE. In particular, a precipitation mechanism seems to regulate winter flows in North-Western Germany, an area with short duration of snow cover and with rainfall-generated floods. The precipitation mechanism is also likely in Southern CE, where correlations between the NAO and temperature are low. Finally, in the rest of the study area (Northern CE, Alpine region), a joint precipitation-snow mechanism influences floods not only in winter, but also in the spring/snowmelt period, providing some possibilities for flood forecasting.

AB Despite their importance to the natural environment, wetlands worldwide face drastic degradation from changes in land use and climatic patterns. To help preservation efforts and guide conservation strategies, a clear understanding of the dynamic relationship between coupled hydrology and vegetation systems in wetlands, and their responses to engineering works and climate change, is needed. An ecohydrological model was developed in this study to address this issue. The model combines a hydrology component based on the Richards' equation for characterizing variably saturated groundwater flow, with a vegetation component described by Lotka-Volterra equations tailored for plant growth. Vegetation is represented by two characteristic wetland herbaceous plant types which differ in their flood and drought resistances. Validation of the model on a study site in the Everglades demonstrated the capability of the model in capturing field-measured water table and transpiration dynamics. The model was next applied on a section of the Nee Soon swamp forest, a tropical wetland in Singapore, for studying the impact of possible drainage works on the groundwater hydrology and native vegetation. Drainage of 10 m downstream of the wetland resulted in a localized zone of influence within half a kilometer from the drainage site with significant adverse impacts on groundwater and biomass levels, indicating a strong need for conservation. Simulated water table-plant biomass relationships demonstrated the capability of the model in capturing the time-lag in biomass response to water table changes. To test the significance of taking plant growth into consideration, the performance of the model was compared to one that substituted the vegetation component with a pre-specified evapotranspiration rate. Unlike its revised counterpart, the original ecohydrological model explicitly accounted for the drainage-induced plant biomass decrease and translated the resulting reduced transpiration toll back to the groundwater hydrology for a more accurate soil water balance. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first development of an ecohydrological model for wetland ecosystems that characterizes the coupled relationship between variably-saturated groundwater flow and plant growth dynamics.

AB The formation of urban coastal flooding is mainly ruled by the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge. This study aims to advance the understanding of coastal urban flood mechanism by developing an integrated modeling and multivariate analysis framework, which involves a hydrologic model (Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)), as the core model, coupled with a coastal hydrodynamic model (Delft3D). The uncertainty associated with the flood depth prediction by integrated models is analyzed using the multivariate Gaussian Copula. The performance of the integrated modeling framework is evaluated for the Chittagong City of Bangladesh, which has experienced extreme and frequent coastal urban floods. Results from modeling indicate that changes in the tidal phase of coastal urban flooding alter the flood's duration and depth. The intensity of compound flooding is higher for the co-occurrence of rainfall and surge peaks than the occurrence of both events in succession. The average flood duration and depth can be increased by about 2.5 h and 0.24 m, respectively, during compound events. When the storm surge occurs during the transition phase, between high/low tides (2-4 h before peak low/high tide), the duration of flood extends due to longer surge duration (4-4.5 h). Finally, the multivariate Gaussian Copula model adjusts the integrated modeling outputs and enhances the skill to predict the inundation depth by 4.6-24.3%. The findings of this study are critical for a better understanding of coastal urban flood processes and enhancing the informed decision-making for emergency management and planning in low-lying coastal regions.

AB An ensemble-based Gaussian mixture (GM) filtering framework is studied in this paper in term of its dependence on the choice of the clustering method to construct the GM. In this approach, a number of particles sampled from the posterior distribution are first integrated forward with the dynamical model for forecasting. A GM representation of the forecast distribution is then constructed from the forecast particles. Once an observation becomes available, the forecast GM is updated according to Bayes' rule. This leads to (i) a Kalman filter-like update of the particles, and (ii) a Particle filter-like update of their weights, generalizing the ensemble Kalman filter update to non-Gaussian distributions. We focus on investigating the impact of the clustering strategy on the behavior of the filter. Three different clustering methods for constructing the prior GM are considered: (i) a standard kernel density estimation, (ii) clustering with a specified mixture component size, and (iii) adaptive clustering (with a variable GM size). Numerical experiments are performed using a two-dimensional reactive contaminant transport model in which the contaminant concentration and the heterogenous hydraulic conductivity fields are estimated within a confined aquifer using solute concentration data. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the GM filter is sensitive to the choice of the GM model. In particular, increasing the size of the GM does not necessarily result in improved performances. In this respect, the best results are obtained with the proposed adaptive clustering scheme.

AB Daily stochastic streamflow simulation is widely used for the design of reservoirs, evaluation of reservoir operation rules, and risk evaluation of operation of water resources systems. The major difficulties and challenges of daily streamflow are that there are 365 days that need to be simulated, which entails much more calculation than does monthly streamflow simulation. Since lag-2 auto-correlation is usually large, the lag-2 correlations should be considered. This paper therefore proposes a copula-based method for daily stochastic streamflow simulation. The contribution and novelty of this paper are that: (a) the proposed method can consider lag-2 correlations, compared with the currently used copula based method; (b) the conditional copulas are used to build high dimensional copulas, which make calculations easier; and (c) the method can be used for daily streamflow simulation because of the simplified model structure and effective parameter estimation method. Seven gauging stations on the upper Yangtze River and Pearl River in China were selected as case studies. Results demonstrated that the proposed method preserved the basic statistics (including mean daily flow, standard deviation, and coefficient of skewness) of observed data of each day well. Comparison with the currently used seasonal autoregressive model (SAR(2)) and bivariate copula-based method considering lag-1 autocorrelation indicated that the proposed method produced smaller relative errors and was better overall. Therefore, the proposed method can be regarded as an effective way for stochastic daily streamflow simulation, and can be used for the design of reservoirs and risk analysis of water resources systems.

AB The relationship of sorptivity S and macroscopic capillary length lambda(c) is explored. Sorptivity is the proportionality constant between cumulative intake, expressed as a length, and the square root of time for sorption into an unsaturated soil. The capillary length is defined as the integral of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with respect to matric potential normalized by the difference between the conductivity at the two limits of integration. The approximation b = lambda(c)(theta(wet) - theta(dry)(K(wet - K(dry)S-2 was found previously to have bounds of 0.5 and pi/4, with 0.55 as a good overall approximation. Those results were for two diffusivity functions, an exponential D = D0 exp (B-theta) and for D = D0(theta(b) - theta)-2. We now extend the investigation to four additional cases, two for which S and lambda(c) are analytical and two described by the empirical hydraulic functions of Brooks and Corey (1964) and by van Genuchten (1980). The representative value b = 0.55 was found to be generally correct. For those functions with a finite D value at the wettest value, a refinement from the 0.55 value is offered. The results are believed of value for future parameter estimation problems, including two previous applications related to time of ponding and disk infiltrometers.

AB Reservoirs and dams are vital human-built infrastructures that play essential roles in flood control, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, navigation, and other functions. The realization of those functions requires efficient reservoir operation, and the effective controls on the outflow from a reservoir or dam. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of streamflow forecasts, reservoir operation planning and scheduling approaches. In this study, three AI models, namely, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) technique, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed to simulate reservoir operation at monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, using approximately 30 years of historical reservoir operation records. This study aims to summarize the influence of the parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to reservoir operation simulation. The results show the following: (1) for the BP neural network and LSTM model, the effects of the number of maximum iterations on model performance should be prioritized; for the SVR model, the simulation performance is directly related to the selection of the kernel function, and sigmoid and RBF kernel functions should be prioritized; (2) the BP neural network and SVR are suitable for the model to learn the operation rules of a reservoir from a small amount of data; and (3) the LSTM model is able to effectively reduce the time consumption and memory storage required by other AI models, and demonstrate good capability in simulating low-flow conditions and the outflow curve for the peak operation period.

AB The projected frequent occurrences of extreme flood events will cause significant losses to crops and will threaten food security. To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood.characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses.

AB In this study the water draining from a mixed land use catchment of 16 km(2) in NW Spain was monitored over a 5-year period (2004/2005-2008/2009) to determine the temporal variability in phosphorus (P) transport, to examine the P fluxes and controlling factors, and to analyse the relationships between discharge and P (PP: particulate phosphorus and DP: dissolved phosphorus) at event scale. A total of 132 runoff events was analysed, providing an extensive dataset on P values under different hydrological conditions. Mean annual P export from the catchment amounted to 184 kg equivalent to 11.5 kg km(-2), a value relatively lower than those obtained in other mixed land use catchment. The PP accounted for 74% of the total phosphorus (TP). The intra- and inter-annual variability in P transport was high due to the fact that most of P was discharged during a short-time period: 35% of PP load and 19% of DP load occurred in only 2% of the time. Runoff events contributed to 68% of P exported during the period of study. A high variability in P transport during different runoff events was observed. Phosphorus export increased with the magnitude of runoff events and rainfall amount, suggesting that these could be the key factors controlling P yield. Erosion was also an important driving force behind P export in the catchment. The relationships between PP and DP and discharge resulted in different hysteresis patterns. The relationship PP-discharge was mainly characterised by clockwise behaviour, linked to sediment in the surface runoff, while DP-discharge was predominately anticlockwise due to transport in subsurface flow, showing different pathways of transport between PP and DP.

AB Time series of hydrological and geochemical signals at two karst springs, located in the Dolomiti del Brenta region, near Trento, Italy, are used to infer how karst catchments work internally to generate runoff. The data analyzed include precipitation, spring flow and electric conductivity of the spring water. All the signals show the signature of multifractality but with different intermittency and non-stationarity. In particular, precipitation and spring flow are shown to have nearly the same degree of nonstationarity and intermittency, while electric conductivity, which mimics the travel time distribution of water in the karst system, is less intermittent and smoother than both spring flow and precipitations. We found that spring flow can be obtained from precipitation through fractional convolution with a power law transfer function. An important result of our study is that the probability distribution of travel times is inconsistent with the advection dispersion equation, while it supports the anomalous transport model. This result is in line with what was observed by Painter et al. [Geophys. Res. Lett. 29 (2002) 21.1] for transport in fractured rocks. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A streamflow hydrograph recession curve expresses the theoretical relationship between aquifer structure and groundwater outflow to a stream channel. That theoretical relationship is often portrayed empirically using a recession plot defined as a plot of ln(-dQ/dt) versus ln(Q), where Q is streamflow discharge. Such hydrograph recession plots are commonly used to estimate recession parameters, aquifer properties and for evaluating alternative hydrologic hypotheses. We introduce a comprehensive and objective approach to analyze baseflow recessions with innovations including the use of quantile regression, efficient and objective numerical estimation of dQ/dt, inclusion of groundwater withdrawals, and incorporation of seasonal effects. We document that these innovations when all combined, lead to significant improvements, over previous studies, in our ability to discern the theoretical behavior of stream aquifer systems. A case study reveals that our methodology enables us to reject the simple linear reservoir hypothesis of stream aquifer interactions for watersheds in New Jersey and results in improved correlations between low flow statistics and aquifer properties for those same watersheds.

AB The Bhetagad watershed in Kumaon Hills of Central Himalaya represents for hydro-meteorological conditions of the middle mountains over the Hindu Kush Himalayas. This study was conducted to assess the runoff, soil loss and subsequent nutrient losses from different prominent land uses in the Bhetagad watershed of Central Himalayas. Four experimental natural plots each of 20 m length and 5 m width were delineated on four most common land covers viz, pine forests, tea plantation, rainfed agricultural and degraded lands. Monthly values of runoff, soil loss and nutrient loss, for four successive years (1998-2001), from these land uses were quantified following standard methodologies. The annual runoff in these plots ranged between 51 and 3593 m(3)/ha while the annual soil loss varied between 0.06 and 5.47 tonnes/ha during the entire study period. The loss of organic matter was found to be maximum in plot having pine forest followed by plot having tea plantation as the land cover. Annual loss of total N (6.24 kg/ha), total P (3.88 kg/ha) and total K (5.98 kg/ha), per unit loss of soil (tonnes/ha), was maximum from the plot having rainfed agricultural crop as the land cover. The loss of total N ranged between 0.30 and 21.27 kg/ha, total P ranged between 0.14 and 9.42 kg/ha, total K ranged from 0.12 to 11.31 kg/ha whereas organic matter loss varied between 3.65 and 255.16 kg/ha, from different experimental plots. The findings will lead towards devising better conservation/management options for mountain land use systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While many studies have described linkages between large-scale climate phenomena and precipitation and streamflow, fewer studies explicitly address the climatic modulations at sub-regional scales. This study quantifies statistically the temporal variability in precipitation and streamflow at a regional scale in the semi-arid area of South Texas associated with three climate indices: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Results show that ENSO and PDO strongly modulate rainfall during the cold season and, to various extents, streamflow during the cold and warm seasons. In addition, this study shows that in South Texas streamflow is consistently below normal (i.e. means) while precipitation slightly increases during AMO-warm. To different extents, the Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies show stronger influences on the climate of South Texas when coupled. Droughts are more correlated with La Nina events but these events play a secondary role during PDO-cold. Although the PDO-cold phase is the dominant driver of droughts in this area, our analyses also show that the coupled effect of the PDO-cold/AMO-warm phases significantly increases the intensity of drought conditions to a degree similar to the PDO-cold/La Nina coupled effect. Given its stronger response to climate anomalies, streamflow offers a more effective tool for predicting climate variability impacts on South Texas water resources when compared to precipitation.

TI Groundwater pumping in head-controlled coastal systems: The role of

AB The current study explores quantitatively the impact of lateral impermeable boundaries on groundwater pumping in head-controlled coastal systems, based on the potential theory and the image-well superposition method. We compare the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate among three scenarios that assume (SI) an infinite domain width and a finite domain length, (S2) a finite domain width and length, and (SS) an infinite domain width and length. Focusing exclusively on boundary effects, the upstream freshwater discharge is assumed the same for all scenarios, regardless of the variation in domain size. It is found that the impact from both inland and lateral boundaries could play a significant role on the interface toe location and maximum pumping rate (defined as the maximum allowable pumping rate that will not lead to pumping saltwater), depending on sizes of domain length and width. Since the impacts of inland fixed-head boundary and lateral impermeable boundaries are contrary on the maximum interface toe location (defined as the farthest inland point of the interface toe under pumping condition) and maximum pumping rate, they can be offset under certain critical conditions such that the results of the two quantitative indictors (i.e. the maximum interface toe location and maximum pumping rate) in S2 are close to those in SS. In particular, a linear equation is derived to reflect the relationship between the domain width and length under such critical conditions and expressed as L* = 0.87W(*) + 0.62 (W-* > I or L-* > 1.5), in which W-* and L-* are the domain width and length normalized by the distance between the coastline and pumping well. When I: > 0.87W(*) + 0.62, the impact from lateral overcomes that from inland, producing a larger maximum interface toe location and a lower maximum pumping rate than those in SS. When L-* < 0.87W(*) + 0.62, by contrast, the impact from inland exceeds that from lateral and hence, resulting in a smaller maximum interface toe location and a higher maximum pumping rate. It is expected that the results developed in the current study could support the design of numerical models and 3D laboratory experiments as well as the assessment of domain size impact on pumping in head-controlled coastal groundwater systems.

AB Within the framework of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment carried out in Niger during the rainy season of 1992, measurements of fluxes defining the vegetation-atmosphere interaction were conducted over a millet field, for a period of nearly 2 months. These measurements comprised continuous recording of solar radiation, atmospheric carbon dioxide fluxes using the eddy correlation technique, and sap flow through millet plants. Based on biometric measurements of the millet plants comprising height, spacing and leaf area index, the solar radiation is converted to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR). The coupling between the three parameters is examined in pairs. The diurnal and seasonal variations are analysed in relation to plant development. A strong linear relationship between aPAR and carbon dioxide assimilation can be established from the measurements, giving a quantum yield of 0.03 mol CO2 mol(-1) quanta. A comparison between CO2 flux and transpiration shows that this relationship is affected by the water vapour pressure deficit of the atmosphere, but corresponds to the results found for other drought-tolerant C-4 crops.

AB Dew, as an important contribution of non-rainfall water (NRW), is found to be an important hydrological component for ecosystem water stress alleviation and further ecosystem functions maintenance during rainless seasons. The North China Plain (NCP) is facing severe water shortage mainly due to intensive agricultural irrigation. However, few studies have examined the variations and controlling mechanism of dew in the typical croplands predisposed to drought. Here, seasonal variation in dew was examined during growing period in a wheat and maize rotation cropland in the NCP over 3 years (2008-2010), based on the eddy-covariance measurements of latent heat flux (LE) during nighttime, and the ecosystem drought was defined to occur when the relative extractable water content (REW) in the soil dropped below 0.4. Results showed that annual (from April to September) mean dew amount for this cropland was 7.61 +/- 0.02 mm, accounting for 2.5 % of precipitation (PPT), and the annual mean dew amount during drought period was 3.11 mm, accounting for 3.4 % of PPT. Seasonal variation in dew was mainly regulated by relative humidity (RH) and surface stomatal conductance (gs), furthermore, dew was influenced by gs and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during the wheat growing period, and by gs during maize growing period. 51.1 %-72.0 % of drought events occurred during wheat growing season. Compared to maize growing season with higher nocturnal evapotranspiration (ETN), the higher frequency of dew occurrence during wheat growing season had reduced the ETN amount. Drought timing, duration, and degree together influenced dew amount. Long-term drought (e.g. >1-month drought) would induce an increase of dew amount after drought period. Our findings clarified the temporal dynamics in dew across different crop growing periods (such as wheat and maize); and contribute to the sustainable utilization of non-rainfall water (especially dew) in cropland in the context of extreme climate (such as droughts) in the future.

AB [1] The results of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) and Stokes simulations and two-dimensional local cubic law (LCL) simulations of fluid flow through single rough-walled fractures are presented. Synthetic rough-walled fractures were created by combining random fields of aperture and the mean wall topography or midsurface, which quantifies undulation about the fracture plane. A finite volume formulation of the LCL that incorporates geometric corrections for fracture undulation is presented. Simulations of fluid flow through planar fractures with sinusoidal variation in aperture were compared to published results. The rough-walled fracture simulations demonstrated that the total flow rates predicted by the corrected LCL were within 10% of those predicted by the Stokes equations for all the fractures examined in this work. Differences between the NS and Stokes simulations clearly demonstrated that inertial forces can significantly influence the internal flow field within a fracture and the total flow rate across a fracture. By limiting the total flow rate differences between the NS and Stokes simulations, constraints for three kinematic parameters were determined. For all the fractures presented in this work, the corrected LCL was determined to be an acceptable approximation to the NS equations, provided that the kinematic and geometric constraints were met.

AB Levels of nitrate in Malta's groundwater are high. Median concentrations in the main sea-level aquifers of Malta and Gozo are 14 and 10 mg NO3-N L-1, respectively, and even higher in the younger groundwaters of the perched aquifers on Malta (37 mg NO3-N L-1). The wide variations in groundwater nitrate concentration are not due to denitrification, as N-15/N-14 and O-18/O-16 analyses of 47 samples from the three aquifer types found clear evidence for this process in only one sample. 90% of the groundwater nitrate samples had delta O-18 values in the range +3.1 to +6.1 parts per thousand which correspond exactly to those expected for nitrate formed by microbial processes in the presence of Maltese surficial waters (delta O-18 of H2O typically -5.3 to -4.3 parts per thousand). The delta N-15 values of these groundwater nitrate samples, +7.7 to +11.77 parts per thousand were compared with those of a wide variety of potential nitrate sources in Malta (fertilizers, sewage, manure and soils). The closest correspondence was found for the organic N in cultivated soils (+6.0 to +11.2 parts per thousand). These relatively high delta N-15 values for soils may reflect greater fluxes of N from soils with a low C/N ratio and a long history of cultivation. While the isotope data support soil nitrification as the source for nitrate in the groundwaters, they do not rule out direct leaching of manure-derived nitrate as a source.

AB Streams on uniformly rainforest-covered, but lithologically very diverse Barro Colorado Island in central Panamd show remarkable differences in their runoff response to rainfall. This lithological diversity is reflected in equally diverse soilscapes, and our objective was to test the hypothesis that contrasting runoff responses derive from soilscape features that control the generation of overland flow. We determined the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of two neighboring, but hydrologically contrasting catchments (Lutz Creek with a flashy and Conrad Trail with a delayed response to rainfall), and quantified the spatial and temporal frequency of overland flow occurrence. The median K-s values at a depth of 12.5 cm are large enough to rule out Hortonian overland flow, but a marked decrease in K-s in Lutz Creek catchment at 30 cm suggests the formation of a perched water table and the generation saturation overland flow; the decrease in K-s in the Conrad Trail catchment is more gradual, and a perched water table is expected to form only at depths below 50 cm. In Lutz Creek, overland flow was generated frequently in time and space and regardless of topographic position, including near the interfluve, with very low thresholds of storm magnitude, duration, intensity and antecedent wetness, whereas in Conrad Trail, overland flow was generated much less frequently and then only locally. We conclude that soilscape features and microtopography are important controls of overland flow generation in these catchments. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that overland flow and forests are not a priori a contradiction in terms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern Australia (i.e. the Manning River catchment) and analyzed climate-hydrology relationships. For this evaluation, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall-runoff relationships of the catchment. Statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models (GCMs) under RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Manning River catchment. Our results showed that the XAJ model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall-runoff relationships with an R-2 >= 0.94 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency >= 0.92. The median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021-2060 and an increase for the period 2061-2100. Annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly, while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future. Our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall, with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature. An increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 GCMs suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future. A trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern Australia. These results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern Australia.

AB The European Court of Justice has ruled that the Nitrates Directive places an obligation on EU member states to designate the catchments of eutrophic waters as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs), where agriculture is a significant source of nitrate pollution. Recently, the European Commission has indicated that NVZs should be designated when agriculture can be shown to contribute more than 20% of the overall nitrate loading to those waters. Two methods have been used to identify catchments in Northern Ireland, where this condition is met. The first method employs a GIS to predict diffuse losses of nitrate from agricultural land to surface waters based on livestock data and a leaching factor to apportion the annual fertiliser usage and manure between all major catchments. The second method is based on export coefficient modelling. In the first method, allowances for denitrification losses, together with inputs of N from the atmosphere and domestic sewage to surface waters, were made to apportion the total nitrate load to each major river and thus determine if the catchment satisfied the 20% criterion to be designated as a NVZ. Both methods were validated against existing river monitoring data and offered a level of prediction that provides adequate information for a preliminary screening of those catchments to be targeted for designation. Apart from the River Lagan catchment, which includes the city of Belfast and where agriculture only contributed about 8.5% to the nitrate load, the agricultural contribution in the remaining catchments ranged from 33 to 86%. This implies that, if eutrophication is present in the latter surface waters, most of Northern Ireland should be designated a NVZ. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CULTIVATED CATCHMENTS; CONCENTRATED FLOW; RILL EROSION; SOIL
AB In areas of intensive agriculture, e,g, 'Pays de Caux' in France, which was the study area, field observations have shown that runoff directions were modified by agricultural activities. In order to account for factors responsible for modifications of the runoff direction (roughness, tillage direction and agricultural patterns, e,g, dead furrow or dirt tracks), we constructed a discriminant function based on field observations, This function enables us to decide whether flow direction for slopes of up to 15% was imposed by slope direction or tillage direction. It can be applied to any location, provided there are known roughness, known slope intensity, known aspect and known tillage azimuth.
   In order to examine the effects of these agricultural activities at the catchment scale, we compared two models by analysing the same hydrological variables: the area contributing to runoff and the flow network. The first model (Topo) was built according to the runoff direction derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The second model (Tillage) was constructed by combining information from the DEM, and information from rules based on field observations or resulting from statistical analysis.
   For 23 basic catchments, the result of the comparison between the two models (Topo and Tillage) showed that a major part of the catchments and the drainage network was affected by modifications related to the introduction of man-made agricultural factors. For example, for 20 of 23 catchments, the runoff flows over more than 50% of the surface of such areas were produced along the direction imposed by tillage, The introduction of tillage effect brings about modifications of both the shape and size of catchments, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI A governing equation for fluid flow in rough fractures
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID DEFORMABLE ROCK FRACTURE; PERMEABILITY; TRANSPORT; PRESSURE
AB Fluid flow in a rock fracture bounded by two irregular surfaces is complex even under a laminar how regime. The major factor causing deviation of predicted fracture flow behavior from the ideal parallel plate theory is the nature of nonparallel and nonsmooth geometry of fracture surfaces. Important questions on the validity of the cubic law and the Reynolds equation for complicated fracture geometries have been studied by many researchers. The general conclusion from these efforts is that the cubic law is valid provided that an appropriate average aperture can be defined. Many average apertures have been proposed, and for some cases, some work better than others. Nonetheless, to date, these efforts have not converged to form a unified definition on the fracture aperture needed in the cubic law, which stimulates the current effort to develop a general governing equation for fracture flow from a fundamental consideration. In this study, a governing equation stemming from the principle of mass conservation and the assumption that the cubic law holds locally is derived for incompressible laminar fluid flow in irregular fractures under steady state conditions. The equation is formulated in both local and global coordinates and explicitly incorporates two vectorial variables of fracture geometry: true aperture and tortuosity. Under the assumption of small variations in both tortuosity and aperture, the governing equation can be reduced to the Reynolds equation. Two examples are provided to show the importance and generality of the new governing equation in both local and global coordinate systems. In a simple fracture with two nonsmooth and nonparallel surfaces, the error in permeability estimation can be induced using the Reynolds equation with the apparent aperture and can reach 10% for a 25 degrees inclination between the fracture surfaces. In a fracture with sinusoidal surfaces, the traditional method can cause significant errors in both permeability and pressure calculation.

AB Accurate prediction of water level is a challenging task in high sediment load reaches because of complicated flood-sediment routing mechanisms and fluctuating reach terrain. We propose a hybrid machine learning framework to predict the water level and validate the framework in five representative high sediment load reaches of the Lower Yellow River (LYR) in China. This framework can automatically generate ensemble prediction models for different flood-sediment scenarios by integrating clustering, classification, and regression models. We compared the proposed framework with two benchmark frameworks and evaluated performances using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The results demonstrated the following: (1) The water level cannot be accurately predicted (NSE < 0.50 in the testing period) using only upstream discharge and sediment load because of the fluctuating reach terrain. Model performance is significantly improved (NSE > 0.85) by adding the time factor in model development. (2) The proposed frame-work can successfully identify different flood-sediment combinations with a high classification accuracy of 98% by adopting K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) classification models. (3) The proposed framework can provide reliable water level prediction for flood early warming in the LYR with an average NSE of 0.83 and 0.89 in the training and testing periods, respectively. It outperformed traditional single and rule-based model frameworks in all reaches with different degrees of improvement between 3% and 13%. The best performance indicated that the proposed framework can take advantages of different types of machine learning models and could provide reliable prediction for flood mitigation in high sediment load reaches.

AB A horseshoe vortex (HV) system is formed around a bed-mounted circular cylinder in overland water flowing past the cylinder; however, the effect of bed roughness on HV still lacks clear recognition. The present study experimentally investigated the characteristics of HV upstream of a bed-mounted circular cylinder in a flume, where sand of four grain sizes was glued to the flume bed to produce the bed roughness. A particle image velocimetry system was mounted on the flume to facilitate a high-resolution (63 pixel/mm) observation of a flow field. A total of 28 cases with flow depths varying from 0.39 to 1.09 cm and cylinder Reynolds numbers (R-eD) varying from 2700 to 5800 were selected to evaluate the effects of the bed roughness on HV in overland flow conditions. Measurements were then conducted on the upstream flow of a cylinder in the symmetry plane. Bed roughness significantly affected HV, in turn destroying the three vortices. Subsequently, time-averaged primary HV features on the three beds with lower roughness levels were analyzed in terms of the separation point, location, radius, and swirling strength. With an increase in the bed roughness, the separation point moved toward the cylinder, and the primary HV moved toward a free surface; however, the effect on the streamwise location was nonsignificant. A positive relationship was observed between the radius of the primary HV and the bed roughness, whereas a negative relationship was observed between the swirling strength and bed roughness. For beds with the highest roughness levels, all vortices were destroyed, and there was no clear HV topology in the time average sense. Finally, the motion process of the HV was summarized as showing an increase in the bed roughness. The present study investigated HV features with different bed roughness levels and has the potential to enhance our theoretical understanding of the relationship between HV kinematic characteristics and the bed roughness.

AB In the present study, a BIOPLUME III simulation model is coupled with a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)-based model for optimal design of in situ groundwater bioremediation system, considering preferences of stakeholders. Ministry of Energy (MOE), Department of Environment (DOE), and National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) are three stakeholders in the groundwater bioremediation problem in Iran. Based on the preferences of these stakeholders, the multi-objective optimization model tries to minimize: (1) cost; (2) sum of contaminant concentrations that violate standard; (3) contaminant plume fragmentation. The NSGA-II multi-objective optimization method gives Pareto-optimal solutions. A compromised solution is determined using fallback bargaining with impasse to achieve a consensus among the stakeholders. In this study, two different approaches are investigated and compared based on two different domains for locations of injection and extraction wells. At the first approach, a limited number of predefined locations is considered according to previous similar studies. At the second approach, all possible points in study area are investigated to find optimal locations, arrangement, and flow rate of injection and extraction wells. Involvement of the stakeholders, investigating all possible points instead of a limited number of locations for wells, and minimizing the contaminant plume fragmentation during bioremediation are new innovations in this research. Besides, the simulation period is divided into smaller time intervals for more efficient optimization. Image processing toolbox in MATLAB((R)) software is utilized for calculation of the third objective function. In comparison with previous studies, cost is reduced using the proposed methodology. Dispersion of the contaminant plume is reduced in both presented approaches using the third objective function. Considering all possible points in the study area for determining the optimal locations of the wells in the second approach leads to more desirable results, i.e. decreasing the contaminant concentrations to a standard level and 20% to 40% cost reduction.

AB Hydraulic interference pumping tests remain a valuable method for obtaining information on underground flows at a scale compatible with the operation of a reservoir. Combining a dual-medium model with the inversion of interference testing data in fractured rocks is very recent, probably because the model is ruled by very contrasted sensitivities to its main parameters. It is shown that an accurate and stable inversion requires a specific procedure based on re-scaled sensitivities to parameters. Both homogeneous and fractal dual media have been inverted on two sets of data obtained from the fractured limestone of the experimental site in Poitiers (France). The first data set can be homogenized with both homogeneous and fractal approaches, yielding almost constant hydraulic parameters or only weak statistical variations beyond experienced distances of 200 M. The second data set collected in a site perturbed by forced flows from the first campaign shows preferential flow paths with a piston-like propagation of the pressure depletion. Only the fractal dual medium is able to partly homogenize the hydrodynamic behavior. Surprisingly, the hydraulic conductivity is constant but the dimensioning constants of the capacity parameters continue to decrease with the size of the system. Thus, the intrinsic decrease of parameters with the size of the system in the fractal approach is not sufficient to mimic the scale effects recorded by interference tests. Superimposition of piston-like effects onto dual media shall. be further investigated to better account for the influence of scarce flow paths with very high velocities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Mann-Kendall non-parametric test for trend is used to explore the trend behaviour of nine measures of the timing of runoff. The relationship between trends in timing measures and trends in meteorological variables are investigated using partial correlation analysis. The relationships between six climate indices and trends in the timing measures are also examined. The analysis is conducted for 26 streamflow gauging stations from three sub-watersheds of the Mackenzie River Basin in northern Canada. The results reveal that for several of the timing measures, many more trends are identified than can be expected to occur by chance. The spring freshet is observed to be occurring earlier with this timing shift appearing particularly strong in headwater catchments. Based on the partial correlation analysis, it is plausible to attribute some of the observed trends to trends in meteorological variables. Timing of runoff is affected by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the North Pacific (NP) index and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) but not by the Et Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Arctic Oscillation (AO).

AB From published runoff measurements in catchments with a wide range of climatic conditions it is found that long-term mean annual runoff (R) can be closely fitted (r(2) = 0.94) to measured climatic data by R = P * exp(-PET/P), where P is the mean annual precipitation and PET is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration (in mm) calculated via the Holland equation, PET = 1.2 x 10(10) * exp(-4620/Tk), which is solely a function of the mean annual temperature in Kelvin, Tk. Application of the chain rule for partial differentiation to the combined equations gives the following equation for estimating the change in runoff due to changes in P and Tk:
   dR = exp(-PET/P) * [1 + PET/P] * dP - [5544 x 10(10) * exp(-PET/P) * exp(-4620/Tk) * Tk(-2)] * dTk
   By setting dR equal to zero, this equation can be used to estimate the increase in P required to maintain constant runoff for a small increase in T. It can also be used to estimate the decrease in runoff in a scenario with constant precipitation and increased temperature. it is shown herein that predictions of annual runoff changes for various climate change scenarios based on this simple model compare favorably with those based on more complex, calibrated hydrological models, as well as with those based on long-term historical observations of runoff and climate change. Application of the equation above also indicates that the IPCC projections for climate change under the A1B emissions scenario may underestimate the area of North America that is likely to suffer decreases in runoff.

AB This study compares the relative importance of global temperature change and local moisture deficit in influ-encing the frequency of hot extremes on a global scale. For the first time, the wavelet decomposed GRACE terrestrial water storage is applied in examining the relationship between soil moisture (0) and the number of hot days in the hottest month (NHD). It reveals stronger 0-NHD relationships over larger areas than the selected commonly used soil moisture proxies (i.e., standardised precipitation index and a GLDAS model-derived prod-uct). During 1985-2015, local moisture deficit played a more important role in influencing hot extreme oc-currences in the regions with relatively flat topography, thick soil and where inter-annual rainfall variability is large. They cover an area 1.6 times larger than the areas (e.g., mountain ranges, deserts) where the global temperature change has posed a stronger influence. Under a continuing increase of greenhouse gas forcing, global actions in reducing emissions will support combating the expansion of hot extremes. However, this study shows that necessary attention should also be directed to mitigating the moisture deficit exacerbating hot ex-tremes, e. g., through regional adaptive land management.

AB This paper presents an assessment of the relationship between near-surface soil moisture (SM) and SM at other depths in the root zone under three different land uses: irrigated corn, rainfed corn and grass. This research addresses the question whether or not near-surface SM can be used reliably to predict plant available root zone SM and SM at other depths. For this study, a realistic soil-water energy balance process model is applied to three locations in Nebraska representing an east-to-west hydroclimatic gradient in the Great Plains. The applications were completed from 1982 through to 1999 at a daily time scale. The simulated SM climatologies are developed for the root zone as a whole and for the five layers of the soil profile to a depth of 1.2 m.
   Over all, the relationship between near-surface SM (0-2.5 cm) and plant available root zone SM is not strong. This applies to all land uses and for all locations. For example, r estimates range from 0.02 to 0.33 for this relationship. Results for nearsurface SM and SM of several depths suggest improvement in r estimates. For example, these estimates range from -0.19 to 0.69 for all land uses and locations. It was clear that r estimates are the highest (0.49-0.69) between near-surface and the second layer (2.5-30.5 cm) of the root zone. The strength of this type of relationship rapidly declines for deeper depths. Cross-correlation estimates also suggest that at various time-lags the strength of the relationship between near-surface SM and plant available SM is not strong. The strength of the relationship between SM modulation of the near surface and second layer over various time-lags slightly improves over no lags. The results suggest that use of near-surface SM for estimating SM at 2.5-30 cm is most promising. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Interphase mass transfer in variable aperture fractures occurs in many problems where two immiscible fluids are present, such as dissolution of dense nonaqueous phase liquids into groundwater, dissolution of CO(2) in deep saline aquifers, and evaporation of trapped water by flowing gas during natural gas production. Typically, one fluid is entrapped by capillary forces and resides in immobilized regions whose distribution and geometry are controlled by the relative influence of capillary, gravitational, and viscous forces within the fracture. For the case of fractures bounded by a low porosity/permeability matrix, interphase mass transfer occurs predominantly owing to diffusive/advective transport from the entrapped phase interface into the phase flowing through the fracture. We explore the relative influence of the initial entrapped phase geometry and mean flowing phase velocities on the dissolution of the entrapped phase. Our systematic simulations use a percolation-based model of phase invasion and depth-averaged models of flow, transport, and mass transfer. The invasion model provides a physically based distribution of entrapped phase within the fracture and the mass transfer model implicitly calculates interphase mass transfer from discrete regions of entrapped phase without the need for empirical mass transfer relationships. Results demonstrate behavior across a wide range of initial entrapped phase distributions, with entrapped phase saturations ranging from zero to near the percolation threshold. Interfacial area evolves with a near-linear dependence on entrapped phase saturation during dissolution in each simulation, and fracture-scale intrinsic mass transfer rate coefficients exhibit a nonlinear dependence on Peclet number and a negligible dependence on entrapped phase saturation. These observations provide a basis for the development of constitutive relationships that quantify interphase mass transfer in variable aperture fractures as a function of entrapped phase saturation and flow rate; coarse-grid dissolution simulations using these constitutive relationships demonstrate good agreement with results from the high-resolution mechanistic simulations.

AB Debris flow occurrence is generally forecasted by means of empirical rainfall depth-duration thresholds based on raingauge observations. Rainfall estimation errors related to the sparse nature of raingauge data are enhanced in case of convective rainfall events characterized by limited spatial extent. Such errors have been shown to cause underestimation of the rainfall thresholds and, thus, less efficient forecasts of debris flows occurrence. This work examines the spatial organization of debris flows-triggering rainfall around the debris flow initiation points using high-resolution, carefully corrected radar data for a set of short duration (<30 h) storm events occurred in the eastern Italian Alps.
   On average, triggering rainfall presents a local peak corresponding to the debris flow initiation point, with rain depth at 5 km (10 km) distance being on average around 70% (40%) of rain depth observed at the debris flow initiation points. The peak is consistently enhanced for events characterized by short durations and causes a systematic underestimation of the rainfall depth-duration thresholds when rainfall is measured away from the debris flow initiation points.
   We develop an analytical framework that exploits the general characteristics of the spatial rainfall organization to predict the systematic underestimation of the depth-duration thresholds when rainfall is sampled away from the initiation points. Predictions obtained based on this analytical framework are assessed using a Monte Carlo sampling technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The identification and verification of ecohydrologic flow indicators has found new support as the importance of ecological flow regimes is recognized in modern water resources management, particularly in river restoration and reservoir management. An ecohydrologic indicator system reflecting the unique characteristics of Taiwan's water resources and hydrology has been developed, the Taiwan ecohydrological indicator system (TEIS). A major challenge for the water resources community is using the TEIS to provide environmental flow rules that improve existing water resources management. This paper examines data from the extensive network of flow monitoring stations in Taiwan using TEIS statistics to define and refine environmental flow options in Taiwan. Multivariate statistical methods were used to examine TEIS statistics for 102 stations representing the geographic and land use diversity of Taiwan. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed high multicollinearity between the TEIS statistics. Watersheds were separated into upper and lower-watershed locations. An analysis of variance indicated significant differences between upstream, more natural, and downstream, more developed, locations in the same basin with hydrologic indicator redundancy in flow change and magnitude statistics. Issues of multicollinearity were examined using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the first three components related to general flow and high/low flow statistics, frequency and time statistics, and quantity statistics. These principle components would explain about 85% of the total variation. A major conclusion is that managers must be aware of differences among basins, as well as differences within basins that will require careful selection of management procedures to achieve needed flow regimes.

AB The major bottlenecks of existing algorithms to estimate the spatially distributed surface energy balance in composite terrain by means of remote sensing data are briefly summarised. The relationship between visible and thermal infrared spectral radiances of areas with a sufficiently large hydrological contrast (dry and wet land surface types, vegetative cover is not essential) constitute the basis for the formulation of the new Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). The new algorithm (i) estimates the spatial variation of most essential hydro-meteorological parameters empirically, (ii) requires only field information on short wave atmospheric transmittance, surface temperature and vegetation height, (iii) does not involve numerical simulation models, (iv) calculates the fluxes independently from land cover and (v) can handle thermal infrared images at resolutions between a few meters to a few kilometers. The empirical relationships are adjusted to different geographical regions and time of image acquisition. Actual satellite data is inserted in the derivation of the regression coefficients. Part 2 deals with the validation of SEBAL. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science BV. All rights reserved.

AB Water demand for hydropower production has been increasing along with a growing awareness of the importance of preserving riparian ecosystems and their biodiversity. Some Cantons in Switzerland have begun replacing the inadequate concept of Minimum Flow Requirement (MFR) with a dynamic one, by continuously releasing a percentage of the total inflow.
   In this work, we evaluate both ecological and economical benefits of dynamic release policies within a diverted river reach in the Swiss Canton of Graubunden. We compare such policies to another one that generates inflow-dependent variable releases as a result of an economic competition between traditional (e.g., hydropower) and non-traditional (e.g., environment) water uses (Perona et al., 2013). We propose to compute flow statistics from different release polices by using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (Richter et al., 1996; Richter et al., 1997). Then, we aggregate the hydrological differences from the natural flow regime as a proxy for assessing environmental benefits and we look at the mean of the ratio of the allocated net flows between environment and hydropower as a suitable engineering parameter to represent their relative value. Eventually all the simulated release policies find an economical significance explained by marginal utility functions.
   We show that dynamic redistribution policies can perform better than MFR-like ones. Moreover, by introducing the concept of inflow-dependent water allocation, both economic and ecological indicators can be further improved, without necessarily implying higher installation costs.
   This method aims to provide a simple but effective step towards eco-sustainability in the growing market of mini hydropower plants, where MFR-rules are still widespread. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the issue of using scintillometry in conjunction with a simple aggregation scheme to derive area-averaged sensible and latent heat fluxes over a small watershed in Niamey, Niger (Wankama catchment). Data collected in the context of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) program has been used to test the proposed approach. For this purpose, a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) was set up over heterogeneous surface transect of about 3.2 km spanning three vegetation types.
   The comparison between scintillometer-based estimates of area-averaged sensible heat fluxes and those measured by a network of the classical eddy covariance (EC) devices showed good agreement. with a relative error of about 20% (R-2 = 0.85, RMSD = 22 W m(-2), and SEE = 21.39 W m(-2)). This is a good result considering the contrast in terms of the footprint scales associated with the two devices, which is amplified by the heterogeneity of the catchment. The results also showed that using the LAS-derived values of area-average sensible heat flux in conjunction with a simple aggregation rule to estimate area-average available energy led to a reasonable prediction of area-averaged latent heat flux (R-2 = 0.75, RMSD = 64 W m(-2) and SEE = 50 W m(-2)), when compared to those measured using the EC network. This is of interest since the LAS can potentially be used to validate estimates of surface fluxes, based on the meso-scale model, as well as those estimated using coarse-scale remote sensing-based algorithm.

AB Hillslope threshold response to storm rainfall is poorly understood. Basic questions regarding the type, location, and flow dynamics of lateral, subsurface flow remain unanswered, even at our most intensively studied field sites. Here we apply a forensic approach where we combined irrigation and excavation experiments at the well studied Maimai hillslope to determine the typology and morphology of the primary lateral subsurface flowpaths, and the control of bedrock permeability and topography on these flowpaths. The experiments showed that downslope flow is concentrated at the soil bedrock interface, with flowpath locations controlled by small features in the bedrock topography. Lateral subsurface flow is characterized by high velocities, several orders of magnitude greater than predicted by Darcy's Law using measured hydraulic conductivities at the site. We found the bedrock to be moderately permeable, and showed that vertical percolation of water into the bedrock is a potentially large component of the hillslope water balance. Our results suggest that it is the properties of the bedrock (topography and permeability) that control subsurface flow at Maimai, and the soil profile plays a less significant role than previously thought. A companion paper incorporates these findings into a conceptual model of hydrological processes at the site to explore the generalities of whole-hillslope threshold response to storm rainfall.

AB Knowledge of the spatial-temporal variability of soil water content (SWC) is critical for understanding a range of hydrological processes. In this study, the spatial variance and temporal stability of SWC were investigated in a cropland-shelterbelt-desert site at the oasis-desert ecotone in the middle of the Heihe River Basin, China. The SWC was measured on 65 occasions to a depth of 2.8 mat 45 locations during two growing seasons from 2012 to 2013. The standard deviation of the SWC versus the mean SWC exhibited a convex upward relationship in the shelterbelt with the greatest spatial variation at the SWC of around 22.0%, whereas a linearly increasing relationship was observed for the cropland, desert, and land use pattern. The standard deviation of the relative difference was positively linearly correlated with the SWC (p < 0.05) for the land use pattern, whereas such a relationship was not found in the three land use types. The spatial pattern of the SWC was more time stable for the land use pattern, followed by desert, shelterbelt, and cropland. The spatial pattern of SWC changed dramatically among different soil layers. The locations representing the mean SWC varied with the depth, and no location could represent the whole soil profile due to different soil texture, root distribution and irrigation management. The representative locations of each soil layer could be used to estimate the mean SWC well. The statistics of temporal stability of the SWC could be presented equally well with a low frequency of observation (30-day interval) as with a high frequency (5-day interval). Sampling frequency had little effect on the selection of the representative locations of the field mean SWC. This study provides useful information for designing the optimal strategy for sampling SWC at the oasis-desert ecotone in the arid inland river basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential use of a low-cost single polarization X-band weather radar, verified by a disdrometer and a dense rain gauge network, installed as a supporting tool for hydrological applications and for monitoring the urban area of Palermo (Italy). Moreover, this study focuses on studying the temporal variability of the Z-R relation for Mediterranean areas. The radar device is provided with an automatic operational ground-clutter filter developed by the producer. Attention has been paid to the development of blending procedures between radar measurements and other auxiliary instruments and to their suitability for both meteorological and hydrological applications. A general scheme enveloping these procedures and achieving the combination of data retrieved from the weather radar, the optical disdrometer, and the rain gauge network distributed within the monitored area has been designed.
   The first step of the procedure consists in the calibration of the radar equation by comparing the match between the radar raw data and the disdrometer reflectivity. The second step is the calibration of the Z-R relationship based on the retrieval of parameters that optimize the transformation of disdrometer reflectivity into rainfall intensity, starting from the disdrometer rainfall intensity measurements. The Z-R calibration has been applied to the disdrometer measurements retrieved during a 1 year observation period, after a preliminary segmentation into separated rainfall events. This analysis allows for the characterization of the variability of the Z-R relationship from event to event, deriving some considerations about its predictability as well. Results obtained from this analysis provide a geographical specific record, for the Mediterranean area, for the study of the spatial variability of the Z-R relationship. Finally, the set of operational procedures also includes a correction procedure of radar estimates based on rain gauge data.
   Each application has been evaluated with reference to its suitability in supporting proper monitoring usage, with emphasis on the readiness of observations, and hydrological modelling, where the robustness of the quantitative estimates is focused. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil desertification and salinization are common in arid and semi-arid regions, and can result in roads being buried by quicksand or corroded by salts. Therefore, it is important to investigate the salt transportation under evaporation in these regions. To analyze the transport law of moisture, heat, gas, and salt in unsaturated saline soil, a series of evaporation tests were conducted. Based on these tests, the novel mass and energy conservation equations suitable for medium transfer in unsaturated saline soil were then developed. In the model, the non-equilibrium phase process between the liquid water and vapor was considered. Meanwhile, the convective heat transfer caused by small temperature difference between the liquid pore water and soil grains was also considered. Validation of the model was illustrated by comparisons between the simulation and experimental results. It is found that the evaporation of pore water is accompanied by the precipitation of solute. The vapor condensation at low temperature zone can dilute the solute concentration. In addition, the permeability of surface has significant effect on the moisture-heat-gas-salt migration. The novel model can effectively describe the moisture-heat-gas-salt interaction process and reveal the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid under the evaporation of pore water.

AB Decision-makers in urban water systems have long searched for robust runoff management alternatives that can resist deviations from the performance for which they were designed. In this study, with the development of a new comprehensive framework consisting of Many-Objective Robust Decision-Making (MORDM) and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), robust alternatives for the implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) practices are presented under future climate change. The proposed methodology has been applied to District 10 of the Tehran municipality, located in the central part of Tehran, Iran. In the first step, the perfor-mances of General Circulation Models (GCMs) in predicting rainfall in the base period (1986-2005) were compared, and MPI-ESM-LR was selected as the best model for predicting rainfall in the future period (2021-2040). In the next step, by developing the SWMM hydrological model, runoff quality and quantity were simulated under RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. By coupling SWMM with the NSGA-II multi-objective evolutionary algo-rithm and specifying objective functions, the most optimal LIDs implementation scenarios were produced. Then, well-characterized uncertainties were changed into deep uncertainties, and the robustness of each design alternative was quantified using two robustness assessment methods. Finally, system vulnerabilities were discovered using the patient rule induction method (PRIM) and classification and regression tree (CART). This study showed that scenarios with a higher percentage of LIDs are more robust against deep uncertainties. Using different RCP scenarios also revealed that methodological selection of future climate scenarios can affect the robustness of candidate alternatives. Implementing SWMM-MORDM enables decision-makers to effectively generate runoff management scenarios and visually evaluate their robustness against deep uncertainties.

AB Soil water is a major driving force for plant community succession in semi-arid area. Many studies have focused on the relationships of species diversity-productivity, but few studies have paid attentions to the effects of soil water content heterogeneity on the plant species diversity in the semi-arid loess regions. To determine relationship of soil water content heterogeneity and plant community structure properties a semi-arid steppe on the Loess Plateau, we conducted a gradient analysis of soil water content variation and above- and below-ground properties of plant communities. Results showed that community coverage, above- and below-ground biomass were significantly and positively related to the surface soil water contents (0-5 cm). Plant diversity (Shannon index and Richness index) were closely correlated to soil water content at the soil depth of 0-10 cm. But plant height, litter biomass and root/shoot ratio were not related to soil water content. These results showed that there is an positive interaction effects for plant diversity and soil water content in the semi-arid grassland communities. Our observations indicate that change of plant species diversity is also an important community responses to soil water content heterogeneity in the semi-arid grassland ecosystem.

AB Depression storage can be a significant storage element on a watershed surface, accounting for the retention of much water. Over the past decade, many models were developed to derive landscape features. However, relatively little is known about the impact of changing the spatial and/or temporal resolutions on subsequent features. In this paper, the surface topography was measured with the aid of a laser scanner with millimeter-resolution. Emphasis was laid on quantifying the effect of changing spatial resolution upon geometric properties of depressional storages. Digital mapping allowed the visualization of the location and topology of potential water surfaces and the manner in which water might move from one depression to another. From the pond analysis and associated spatial mapping, it became clear that most geometric characteristics relating to size and spatial location of depression storage, including area, volume and depth, are scale dependent. The relationship between the contributing area of each depression and the surface area of the same depression at each pour depth was established, and the organization inherent in such relationship was explored. Furthermore, it was found that these geometric objects may best be described by resorting to fractal geometry, a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales.

AB With the fast growing progress of computer technologies, spatial information on watersheds such as flow direction, watershed boundaries and the drainage network can be automatically calculated or extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM). The stubborn problem that depressions exist in DEMs has been frequently encountered while extracting the spatial information of terrain. Several filling-up methods have been proposed for solving depressions. However, their suitability for large-scale flat areas is inadequate. This study proposes a depression watershed method coupled with the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEEs) theory to determine the optimal outlet and calculate the flow direction in depressions. Three processing procedures are used to derive the depressionless, flow direction: (1) calculating the incipient flow direction; (2) establishing the depression watershed by tracing the upstream drainage area and determining the depression outlet using PROMETHEE theory; (3) calculating the depressionless flow direction. The developed method was used to delineate the Shihmen Reservoir watershed located in Northern Taiwan. The results show that the depression watershed method can effectively solve the shortcomings such as depression outlet differentiating and looped flow direction between depressions. The suitability of the proposed approach was verified. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to quantify and predict discharge and nutrient export patterns from agricultural catchments is confounded by the effects of antecedent hydrologic conditions (AHC) in upland areas. This paper examines the impacts of AHC on storm hydrologic response and nutrient export for 59 events measured over a 2-year period (year-round). Event-related discharge and nutrient (nitrate, phosphate) export were highly temporally variable. Runoff ratios ranged from 0 to 0.99 over the study period, with the lowest median runoff ratios being observed during the summer and early autumn period and the highest median runoff ratios being observed in March following snowmelt. Runoff ratios were positively correlated with AHC indices such as pre-event stream discharge (1-day) and antecedent (14-day) stream discharge although strong predictive relationships could not be generated (p > 0.01). In general, runoff ratios increased throughout successive events as AHC became wetter; however trends observed among suites of events with having similar AHC did not produce similar patterns of hydrologic or nutrient export response, which clearly demonstrates the non-linear responses to variable AHC in the watershed. Basin nitrate (NO3-), total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) export varied with AHC in the basin, and flow-weighted mean nutrient concentrations (FWMC) ranged considerably (mean, range: 8, 1-18 mg L-1 NO3-N; 18, 3-161 mu g L-1 SRP; 75, 15-274 mu g L-1 TP). Nutrient export increased with successive events when the basin was on a wetting trend, but decreased with successive events when the basin was on an overall drying trend. These patterns were linked to peak water table position during events and timing of fertilizer application. Overall, this work demonstrates that watershed hydrologic and nutrient export responses to precipitation and AHC are complex and cannot be predicted using simple linear relationships. This study also demonstrates the need to collect larger data sets when examining relationships between watershed hydrologic and nutrient export response. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface and subsurface flows interact at different spatial and temporal scales through the development of saturated areas occurring when the aquifer reaches the surface. While this interaction exerts a strong control in the partitioning of water between base flow, seepage flow and overland flow, its quantification remains a challenge. Here, we propose a novel modeling approach based on two equivalent hillslopes to capture spatial and temporal variabilities of the main processes. We calibrate their subsurface hydraulic properties based on the temporal dynamics of stream discharge. The model is tested on two pilot catchments located in Brittany (France). For both catchments, the model is successfully calibrated on 40 years of stream discharge data. The results demonstrate that contrasted hydraulic properties are required, with: (1) a relatively low conductive hillslope (conductivities between 3x10(-8) m/s and 2x10(-6) m/s) enhancing overland flows during recharge periods while also sustaining low flows in the late recession period through slow aquifer discharge, and (2) a highly diffusive hillslope (diffusivity between 5x10(-3) m(2)/s and 3x10(-1) m(2)/s) dominantly shaping the event-to seasonal-scale streamflow recession behavior. The strong contrast of the two hillslopes reveals the fundamental role of heterogeneity in controlling groundwater storage-discharge functions, ruling out any homogeneous equivalent at the catchment scale. Low flows appear to be a non-obvious combination of the contributions of the two hill slopes, the less diffusive hillslope catching up to the more conductive one by the end of the low flow period. Catchment-scale responses integrate complex interactions between recharge, groundwater and overland flows through the volume of subsurface storage and the extent of the saturated area.

AB There are surprisingly few studies in humid temperate forests which provide reliable evidence that soil permeability is enhanced under forests. This work addresses this research gap through a detailed investigation of permeability on a hillslope in the Eddleston Catchment, Scottish Borders UK, to evaluate the impact of land cover, superficial geology and soil types on permeability using measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) supported by detailed topsoil profile descriptions and counting of roots with diameters >2 mm. K-fs was measured at depth 0.04-0.15 m using a constant head well permeameter across four paired landcover sites of adjacent tree and intensely grazed grassland. The measured tree types were: 500-year-old mixed woodland; 180-year-old mixed woodland; 45-year-old Pinus sylvestris plantation; and 180-year-old Salix caprea woodland. The respective paired grids of trees and grassland were compared on similar soil texture and topography.
   This study highlights the significant impact of broadleaf woodland at a hillslope scale on K-fs in comparison to grassland areas: median K-fs values under 180-year-old S. caprea woodland (8 mm h(-1)), 180-year-old mixed woodland (119 mm h(-1)) and 500-year-old broadleaf woodland (174 mm h(-1)) were found to be respectively 8, 6 and 5 times higher than neighbouring grazed grassland areas on the same superficial geology. Further statistical analysis indicates that such K-fs enhancement is associated with the presence of coarse roots (>2 mm diameter) creating conduits for preferential flow and a deeper organic layer in the topsoil profile under woodlands. By contrast the P. sylvestris forest had only slightly higher (42 mm h(-1)), but not statistically different K-fs values, when compared to adjacent pasture (35 mm h(-1)). In the grassland areas, in the absence of course roots, the superficial geology was dominant in accounting for differences in 4, with the alluvium floodplain having a significantly lower median K-fs (1 mm h(-1)) than surrounding hillslope sites, which had a range of median K-fs from 21 to 39 mm h(-1).
   The data were used to infer areas of runoff generation by comparing K-fs values with modelled 15 min maximum intensity duration rainfall with a 1 in 10 year return period. Infiltration prevailed in the 180- and 500-year-old mixed and broadleaf woodland, whereas some grassland areas and the floodplain were inferred to generate overland flow. The significantly higher K-fs under broadleaf mature forests suggests that planting broadleaf woodlands on hillslopes in clusters or as shelterbelts within grasslands would provide areas of increased capacity for rainfall infiltration and arrest runoff generation during flood-producing storm events.

AB Prediction using neural networks is applied in various fields, including hydrology and water resource manage-ment. In the learning process, an optimizer is used to determine the relationship (weights and biases) between the input and output data to lower the value of the loss function. Existing optimizers rely absolutely on the relationship that are initially generated and have the probability to converge to a local optimum. Additionally, since there is no structure for storing information about the previously generated correlation, there is a proba-bility that the optimal weights and biases could not be found even when learning proceeds. It is necessary to apply a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that can consider both global/local search and has a structure that can store the previously generated solution. In this study, a new optimizer was combined with a harmony search (HS), to improve existing optimizers. To test the performance of the improved multi-layer perceptron using the new optimizer (IMLP), the runoff of the Dorim stream in Seoul was predicted. The rainfall and the discharge of pump stations were constructed as input data, and data preprocessing was performed by normalization and correlation coefficients. The IMLP showed improved accuracy and could be used to manage urban streams.

AB Understanding the recharge process and its relationship with rainfall is of critical importance to the management of groundwater systems and enormous effort has been made to estimate the amount and process of recharge by infiltration using precipitation data. In the present research, in-situ lysimeter experiments and numerical simulations were used to study the relationships between rainfall and recharge by infiltration at different groundwater depths. Four lysimeters, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 5 m deep, were installed in the field to measure the infiltration recharge rates under conditions of fixed water tables at the bottoms of the soil columns. Annual infiltration recharges at different groundwater depths were obtained through the lysimeter measurements. The effect of rainfall pattern and annual rainfall distribution on infiltration recharge was simulated at various groundwater depths using a numerical model based on soil-water dynamics, and comparisons of the simulated and observed recharges showed very good agreement. Relationships between rainfall and infiltration recharge at different groundwater depths were investigated using the lysimeter measurements and computer simulations. Groundwater systems were classified into three categories, i.e. shallow water table, intermediate water table, and deep water table, based on the relationship between rainfall and infiltration recharge at different groundwater depths.

AB Informational entropy can be used to elucidate some important relationships between precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and discharge over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Entropy does not suffer from any a priori assumptions of linearity or distributional characteristics. In a study of the Southeastern United States, entropy and mutual information were used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables over spatial scales from a few hundred to several thousand km(2) and temporal scales from days to months. Two distinct ET data sets were compared- one based on a highly parameterized energy budget approach and the other based on a complex iterative solution and a modified Penman method. It was found that there was a considerable difference in uncertainty between the two methods and that, although they each contained some amount of explanatory information regarding streamflow the more complex approach contained the most shared information. Further, it was found that streamflow entropy, or uncertainty, increased with drainage area, indicating that larger basins have more uncertainty to be reduced, in that more information can possibly be gained through the knowledge of other variables. However, the knowledge of ET reduces a greater proportion of uncertainty in smaller basins (< 1500 km(2)), while larger basins have more unexplained variability.

AB The primary objective of this study was to investigate the cause of the transition break in the scaling relationship graph of peak discharge vs. drainage area. Watershed geomorphologic and hydrological data from eleven nested watersheds in the Komarovka River Basin in Russia were collected for analysis. A series of numerical experiments were conducted using a digital elevation model and a geomorphology-based runoff model to investigate the variation of the upstream drainage areas and peak discharges at specified sampling locations on the stream network. The results indicated that when a large tributary flowed into the mainstream, an abrupt increase in the drainage area was observed in the graph of drainage area vs. distance to mainstream outlet. The reason is that the drainage area of the tributary relative to the drainage area of the mainstream at the location which the tributary joins in is large. The abrupt change corresponded to the transition break shown in the graph of peak discharge vs. drainage area, which was an indication of the scaling relationship transferring from linearity to nonlinearity. The cause of the transition break had been verified by using hydrological records obtained from the Komarovka River Basin and successfully simulated by applying the geomorphology-based runoff model.

AB This paper discusses the results of numerical analysis of dispersion of passive solutes in two-dimensional heterogeneous porous formations. Statistics of flow and transport variables, the accuracy and the role of approximations implicit in existing first-order theories, and the convergence of computational results are investigated. The results suggest that quite different rates of convergence with Monte Carlo runs hold for different spatial moments and that over 1000 realizations are required to stabilize second moments even for relatively mild heterogeneity (sigma(Y)2 < 1.6). This has implications for the extent of the spatial domain for single-realization numerical studies of the same type. A comparison of the variance of plumes with the results of linear theories (0.05 < sigma(Y)2 < 1.6) shows an unexpectedly broad validity field for the theoretical solution obtained from a suitable linearization of flow and transport. Reformulation of the same problem linearizing in tum the flow or the transport equations shows opposite deviations from the linear theory. The interesting consequence is that the errors induced by linearizations in the flow or the transport equations have different signs, and their effects on the moments of dispersing plumes are compensating, thereby yielding consistent formulations. Unexpected features of the statistics of probability distributions of longitudinal and transverse velocities and travel times are also computed and discussed.

AB The assessment of flow regime alterations is fundamental in understanding the potential impact of reservoirs and other water infrastructures on aquatic ecosystems and biota. Previously used methods to classify flow regimes have not captured temporal changes between unregulated and regulated flow regimes at individual stations. In this study, a combination of hierarchical classification and trend analysis was used to assess spatial and temporal flow regime alterations in the Huai River Basin, China. Two categories of flow regime indices were selected to characterize the impacts of reservoir and sluice regulation, including the basic flow indices for mean variation, and the cumulative variation indices for long-term alteration.
   The overall impact of reservoirs and sluices on flow regime included the decrease of high flow magnitudes but the increase of low flow magnitudes through time. Moreover, on average, the flow variability, and the high and low flow frequencies were reduced, while their durations were increased. Reservoirs had a greater impact on flow regimes than sluices. The flow regimes at 18 of 30 stations were altered significantly from a pre-regulation condition and were divided into three main types of alteration corresponding to operational rules of reservoirs and sluices. From a management perspective, water projects in China should address the environmental flow requirements of the rivers, particularly in terms of the hydrologic indices affected mostly by reservoirs and sluices. This study will promote the application of flow regime classification and river restoration in highly regulated basins in China. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In Jiaozhou Bay, there are four wetland types, including sandy beaches, mud flats, tidal marshes, and estuarine intertidal zones. Four typical transects representing each of the wetland types were selected to investigate the flow dynamics, seawater-groundwater exchange and nutrients carried by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Based on field measurements of groundwater heads and salinity along each transect, the SGD averaged over the observation period was estimated using generalized Darcy's law. The SGD along the four transects ranges from 3.6 x 10(-3) to 7.6 cm/d with the maximum occurring at the sandy beach. The SGD rate has a good correlation with the hydraulic conductivities of the wetland sediments. There is a positive correlation between the ratio of NO3-N/DIN and SGD rates. The SGDassociated nutrient output rate ranges from 3.3 x 10(-2) to 9.5 mmol/m(2)/d for DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen), and from 6.2 x 10(-5) to 1.8 x 10(-2) mmol/m(2)/d for DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus). Compared to the nutrients delivered by the river, nutrients carried by SGD provide a more important source for the phosphate-limited environment to plankton in Jiaozhou Bay. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Kriging have both been used for hydraulic head simulation. In this study, the two methodologies were combined in order to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of hydraulic head in a study area. In order to achieve that, a fuzzy logic inference system can also be used. Different ANN architectures and variogram models were tested, together with the use or not of a fuzzy logic system. The developed algorithm was implemented and applied for predicting, spatially and temporally, the hydraulic head in an area located in Bavaria, Germany. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using leave one out cross validation and various performance indicators were derived. The best results were achieved by using ANNs with two hidden layers, with the use of the fuzzy logic system and by utilizing the power-law variogram. The results obtained from this procedure can be characterized as favorable, since the RMSE of the method is in the order of magnitude of 10(-2) m. Therefore this method can be used successfully in aquifers where geological characteristics are obscure, but a variety of other, easily accessible data, such as meteorological data can be easily found.

ID LOGNORMAL-DISTRIBUTION MODEL; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; POROUS-MEDIA;

AB The critical path analysis (CPA) of Ambegaokar et al. [1971] suggests that transport in random systems with a broad enough distribution of conductances is dominated by a controlling conductance of a critical magnitude. The present short, yet systematic, study provides a test of the applicability of the CPA to determine the relationship between two different transport properties of three-dimensional pore networks. Two characteristic transport properties are examined: viscous (hydraulic) permeability and electrical conductivity, and the three-dimensional pore networks are represented by diluted simple-cubic lattices of different average coordination numbers and broadness of a positively skewed pore size distribution. The prediction of the critical path analysis is good for small coordination numbers as the flow is largely through resistances in series and it diverges from the correct permeability-electrical conductivity relationship as the coordination number increases, especially for moderate broadness of the pore size distribution. The critical path analysis is also applicable to the relationships between other transport properties, for example, molecular and Knudsen diffusivities, and also to various pore shapes, other then cylindrical and slit-shaped, referred to in this study.

AB Floods, landslides and debris flows are natural events that occur all over the world and are often induced by extreme rainfall conditions. Several extreme events occurred in Slovenia (Europe) in the last 25 years that caused 18 casualties and approximately 500 million Euros of economic loss. The intensity-duration frequency (IDF) relationship was constructed using the Frank copula function for several rainfall stations using high-resolution rainfall data with an average subsample length of 34 years. The empirical rainfall threshold curves were also evaluated for selected extreme events. Post-event analyses showed that rainfall characteristics triggering flash floods and landslides are different. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the inter-event time definition (IETD) and subsample definition methodology can have a significant influence on the position of rainfall events in the intensity-duration space, the constructed IDF curves and on the relationship between the empirical rainfall threshold curves and the IDF curves constructed using the copula approach. Furthermore, a combination of several empirical rainfall thresholds with an appropriate high-density rainfall measurement network can be used as part of the early warning system of the initiation of landslides and debris flows. However, different rainfall threshold curves should be used for lowland and mountainous areas in Slovenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precipitation regionalization deals with an investigation of the seasonally and its temporal variability and is useful for a wide variety of applications in hydro-meteorology. The d homogeneous regions can be used as a basis for transforming the information from gauged to ungauged sites and can reduce the uncertainty in estimating the seasonal characteristics of precipitation across India. Despite several studies stressing the importance of seasonality and temporal variability to the environment, there is a lack of studies on accounting for temporal variability in regionalization. Precipitation regionalization must account for both the precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability at multiple time-scales to extract the seasonally of a region representing coherent local and inter-annual variability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a framework for precipitation regionalization, considering both precipitation magnitude and its temporal variability. High resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) gridded daily precipitation time series over the period 1901-2013 from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was used for the evaluation of the framework. First, the historical daily time series was transformed into multiple time scales, i.e., annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales. Entropy-based standardized variability index was used to measure the inter-annual variability of precipitation at each time scale. Regionalization of grid points was performed using self-organizing maps, an artificial neural network. Ten distinct regions were identified that can be tied back to two general categories, such as climate characteristics and physical characteristics. Coupling of the self-organizing map with standardized variability index reveals unique seasonal distribution of precipitation for each region. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a new emerging pattern across Central India. Consideration of temporal variability plays an insignificant role in the shape, size and stability of south-central India, south-eastern coastlines, and Konkan Coast. Intriguingly, separate Rain-belt and Rain-shadow Western Himalayas are formed due to the difference in topography and seasonal characteristics of precipitation. The temporal evolution of clusters unravels a significant change in the occurrence of the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across the north-western region; a significant increase in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1940s across western India, and decrease in the 50th percentile monsoon after the 1980s in the north-central Region.

ID ONE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSPORT; AQUIFERS; EQUATION; DECAY
AB An analytic solution is derived for the one-dimensional equations governing the transport of a tracer in a heterogeneous porous medium subject to rate-limited adsorption with a linear equilibrium isotherm, and also subject to decay. The kinetics of solute adsorption is given by a first-order rate law. The medium is semi-infinite, and periodic boundary conditions are imposed at the inlet boundary. Both Dirichlet-type and flux-type boundary conditions are examined. The heterogeneity arises from the assumption of a scale-dependent dispersion coefficient that increases exponentially as a function of distance up to some constant limiting value. Solutions are given in terms of hypergeometric functions, and comparisons are made with the corresponding problem in a homogeneous medium with a constant dispersion. The one-dimensional model gives information about how adsorption and decay effects can interact with heterogeneities in the medium. For example, when both adsorption and decay are present, the amplitude of waves in a homogeneous medium can exceed that in a heterogeneous medium, even though the latter has smaller dispersivity. In addition, because the input is periodic, breakthrough curves measured downstream have both an amplitude and phase shift; measurement of the latter may give additional information for determining medium characteristics.

AB Geochemical data deduced from groundwater and vein calcite were used to quantify groundwater recharge and interbasin flow rates in the Tule Desert (southeastern Nevada). C-14 age gradients below the water table suggest recharge rates of 1-2 mm/yr which correspond to a sustainable yield of 5 x 10(-4) km(3)/yr to 1 x 10(-3) km(3)/yr. Uncertainties in the applied effective porosity value and increasing horizontal interbasin flow components at greater depths may bias these estimates low compared to those previously reported using the water budget method. The deviation of the groundwater 8180 time-series pattern for the Pleistocene-Holocene transition from that of the Devils Hole vein calcite (which is considered a proxy for local climate change) allows interbasin flow rates of northerly derived groundwater to be estimated. The constrained rates (75.0-120 m/yr) are slightly higher than those previously calculated using Darcy's Law, but translate into hydraulic conductivity values strikingly similar to those obtained from pump tests. Data further indicate that production wells located closer to the western mountainous margin will be producing mainly from locally derived mountain-system recharge whereas wells located closer to the eastern margin are more influenced by older, regionally derived carbonate groundwater.

AB An approach for modelling surface/subsurface flow and transport in a fully integrated way is presented. The diffusive wave approximation used to model runoff is formulated as a nonlinear Darcy law and coupled with the Richards equation for variably saturated flow. The water dynamics in the three physical domains, land surface, vadose zone and saturated zone, is described through a single Richards type equation with domain-dependent parameters. This approach naturally provides pressure and fluxes continuity along land surface. An advective-diffusive transport equation is incorporated in the model in order to follow and identify pre-event and event water. This multi-domain Richards equation is solved with a mixed hybrid finite element formulation. The time discretization is implicit and the nonlinear equations are solved within a sequential iterative Picard scheme. This model can describe both infiltration excess or saturation excess runoff. In order to assess this modelling approach, several classical validation, verification and application test cases are presented. For overland flow solely, the model is compared to an analytical solution and to commonly used hydrological models. The integrated model is then validated with a sandbox laboratory experiment. Finally, the dynamic response of a saturated contributing area at the toe of a 3D virtual hillslope is simulated to illustrate the applicability of the model to 3D situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ID DEPOSITION; ATTRACTORS; SYSTEMS; EROSION; VIEW
AB Debris flows (especially those of high-density or high viscosity) usually appear in the form of surge sequence. Each debris flow event consists of tens or hundreds of surges. A debris flow is thus equal to a surge series which is expected to feature the intrinsic properties. Statistics of observation data indicates that different events have the similar distributions in parameters such as velocity, flow depth, discharge, runoff, and time interval, which can be considered as the signs of an underlying dynamics. But there are currently difficulties in extracting the dynamics from the surge series. This paper is concerned with the temporal variations of surge series based on observation data in the last forty years in Jiangjia Gully (JJG) The temporal process of a surge series is characterized by the accumulative curve of the interval time. A surge series is found to be dominated by the peak discharge in that the peak discharge determines the exponent of the distribution. Moreover, the average discharge evolves with surge progress and finally decays in a power-law form. It follows that a surge series behaves as a whole which requires a unified dynamical framework to encompass all the appearances. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new methodological approach in the analysis of the influence of the North Atlantic circulation on the flood magnitude of the Tagus River, the largest Atlantic draining river of the Iberian Peninsula. This methodology is based on Correspondence Analysis viewed as a qualitative regression tool. A daily scale database (sea level atmospheric pressure, river discharge, rainfall) was used for this study. The selected streamflow station, Vila Velha de Road() (Portugal, near the Spanish border), holds the longest continuous daily river discharge register of the Iberian Peninsula (over 160 years, since 1852). The annual maximum flood magnitudes were classified into seven categories according to their specific recurrence intervals (T). The qualitative regression approach was used to relate annual peak flood occurrence with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index mode (positive or negative) registered, during the preceding 40 days (divided in 8 successive 5-day periods). Large floods (categories 1-2 of T> 50 years and category 3, T-25-50 years) were found to be associated with a very high frequency of the negative NAO mode during the initial 20-25 days (within a total 40 days period length) before de flood peak. The lack of significant association of these flood categories with a predominant NAO mode during the immediately preceding 15 days, prior to the flood, suggest a time lag of 15 days before the peak. Minor flooding (category 7, T < 2 years) show a high degree of association with the presence of a positive NAO mode during the previous 20-25 days. The analysis of flood response under natural and dam-regulated regimes (before and after the construction of dams ca 1960) revealed no changes in the behaviour of major floods (responding to a period of 25 days with a dominant negative NAO index mode). Moderate flooding of category 4 (T: 10-25 years), that during the pre-dam construction period were linked to the existence of an initial 5-15 days of negative NAO mode, were not documented during the post-dam period, probably due to flood peak discharge attenuation by reservoirs. The clear climatic control (rainfall accumulation and number of persisting NAO negative mode days) in the onset of flood category 3 (T: 25-50 years) was also statistically blurred during the post-dam period, due to the effective role of dam operation in flood management during wet winters. This dam management effect does not seem to mask the meteorologically related largest flood magnitude events (T> 50 years), indicating that catastrophic events will likely occur under the NAO negative daily and seasonal patterns defined in this work. The robustness of the model was assessed by the phenomenological analysis of misdassified Flood/NAO events. Results also indicate that flood management practises may benefit from improved climate scenarios and forecasting of the NAO index. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Yangtze River estuary and its surrounding seas have had the highest degree of eutrophication in China. Xiangshan Bay, located at the southern bank of the Yangtze River, is not immune from eutrophication, leading to the water quality below the control requirements for marine functional zoning. Clarifying the nutrient criteria is essential to alleviate eutmphication in Xiangshan Bay. We used a generalized Pareto distribution-based peaks over threshold model to analyze 2006-2018 survey data. Through calculation, inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria in Xiangshan Bay at the five percentile are 0.443 mg/L and 0.025 mg/L, respectively. Additionally, we also obtained the corresponding confidence intervals. Rationality and sensitivity analyses of the calculation results proved the methods used in this study to be rational and reliable, providing a basis for subsequent monitoring and assessment of nutrient salts in bays.

AB Sociohydrology has advanced understandings of water related phenomena by conceptualizing changes in hydrological flows and risks as the result of the interplay between water and society. However, social power and the heterogeneity of human societies, which are crucial to unravel the feedback mechanisms underlying human-water systems, have not been sufficiently considered. In response, this paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach that draws on political ecology perspectives to combine sociohydrological insights with analyses of social power and of the ways in which different social groups distinctively interact with water systems. We draw on empirical evidence of Cape Town's water insecurity before and during the prolonged drought (2015-2017) that escalated into a severe water crisis, also known as Day Zero. The study integrates times series of reservoir storage and water consumption with 40 interviews and focus group discussions to firstly retrace the historical legacy of Colonial rules, Apartheid and, more recently, neoliberal policies. Within this human-water system, we show how Cape Town's political legacy has encouraged unsustainable levels of water consumption amongst the (white) elite and tolerated chronic water insecurity amongst (black) informal dwellers. This uneven geography of water insecurity is also discernible in the unequal experiences of drought and water resilience trajectories of diverse social groups across Cape Town. We conclude that accounting for social power and inequalities can advance sociohydrology by identifying those mechanisms (within society) that determine what water is secured and what human-water interactions and dynamics will be sustained over time. Furthermore, by engaging with social power, sociohydrology can play a significant role in informing policies that reduce inequalities in water access and unsustainable water use.

TI A locally adaptive kernel regression method for facies delineation

DE Stochastic groundwater hydrology; Geological facies reconstruction;
   Geostatistics; Solute transport
ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Facies delineation is defined as the separation of geological units with distinct intrinsic characteristics (grain size, hydraulic conductivity, mineralogical composition). A major challenge in this area stems from the fact that only a few scattered pieces of hydrogeological information are available to delineate geological facies. Several methods to delineate facies are available in the literature, ranging from those based only on existing hard data, to those including secondary data or external knowledge about sedimentological patterns. This paper describes a methodology to use kernel regression methods as an effective tool for facies delineation. The method uses both the spatial and the actual sampled values to produce, for each individual hard data point, a locally adaptive steering kernel function, self-adjusting the principal directions of the local anisotropic kernels to the direction of highest local spatial correlation. The method is shown to outperform the nearest neighbor classification method in a number of synthetic aquifers whenever the available number of hard data is small and randomly distributed in space. In the case of exhaustive sampling, the steering kernel regression method converges to the true solution. Simulations ran in a suite of synthetic examples are used to explore the selection of kernel parameters in typical field settings. It is shown that, in practice, a rule of thumb can be used to obtain suboptimal results. The performance of the method is demonstrated to significantly improve when external information regarding fades proportions is incorporated. Remarkably, the method allows for a reasonable reconstruction of the fades connectivity patterns, shown in terms of breakthrough curves performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water quality is a sensitive topic of worldwide concern that is defined by a series of physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most. Therefore, the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological, physical and chemical indicators. In this investigation, the following variables were evaluated: Temperature, pH, transparency, turbidity, nitrates, orthophosphates, phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, solar radiation, dissolved oxygen and microcystins. These determined water quality at the sample sites, Gamboa and Paraiso. The results obtained through the application of a two-way multivariate analysis method called HJ-Biplot reflect variables relationships of chemical, physical and biological compositions. Furthermore, results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons. Cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables: pH, transparency, chlorophyll a, oxygen and temperature. On the other hand, cluster 2 comprises the following variables: nitrate, orthophosphates, turbidity and P-total. They are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season, and that, in turn, can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets, specifically, for water quality monitoring network.

AB Speleothems are increasingly used as an archive of past climate but some of the proxy signals encoded in these deposits reflect hydrological characteristics of the karst aquifer (and not necessarily climate variability) A central aspect in karst hydrology is the time required for the rainwater to reach the point of discharge in a cave e g the tip of the stalactite One promising approach in determining this residence time is drip-water dating by tritium (H-3) In contrast to traditional tritium dating we do not refer directly to tritium concentrations in precipitation as input function but to an infiltration-weighted annual mean of the rainwater values Using concentration differences between this infiltration-weighted mean and the drip water an age is calculated from the radioactive decay law assuming piston flow
   The approach was tested in three adjacent caves in northwestern Germany which were monitored for about two years All of the studied drip sites yielded drip water ages between 2 and 4 years with uncertainties on the order of 1 year These results were confirmed at several drip sites by oxygen isotope data which show rather constant values with insignificant intra-annual variability Attempts to apply the H-3-He-3 method resulted in comparable ages despite several complicating factors (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Reservoir flood control operation is an important and effective measure for avoiding or reducing flood disasters. Considering that reservoir operation is a control process that essentially manages the spillway gates to increase or decrease the amount of released water, this paper focuses on studying the reservoir flood control operation which considers spillway gate scheduling. Minimizing the peak outflow from the reservoir is adopted as the optimization objective to protect downstream areas from flood disasters. In addition to the conventional reservoir constraints, the operation constraints of individual spillway gates and the influence of the reservoir forebay water level and opening degree on the gates' discharge capacity are also well considered to obtain precise scheduling. The nonlinear factors, especially the objective function in the form of maximin, the three-dimensional water discharge curves, and the rules for the opening and closing sequence of the spillway gates, are linearized through several strategies. The original nonlinear and non-convex model is then converted into a standard mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The results for the real-world case study indicate that: 1) the proposed model is believed to be computationally efficient with a calculation time of about 30 min; 2) for the flood events with return periods of 10 years and 100 years, the flood peaks are reduced from 4160 m3/s to 3681 m3/s and from 11007 m3/s to 9293 m3/s, representing decreases of 11.5 % and 15.6 %, respectively. The outflow curves become more stable, demonstrating that the flood control pressure on the downstream had been relieved after optimization; 3) the proposed model can produce more realistic and executable flood control operation scheduling compared with the conventional optimization model without considering spillway gate scheduling. These research findings can provide an effective reference for both the operators of reservoirs and researchers in the field of reservoir flood control operation.

AB High-pressure packer test (HPPT) is an enhanced constant head packer test for characterizing the permeability of fractured rocks under high-pressure groundwater flow conditions. The interpretation of the HPPT data, however, remains difficult due to the transition of flow conditions in the conducting structures and the hydraulic fracturing-induced permeability enhancement in the tested rocks. In this study, a number of HPPTs were performed in the sedimentary and intrusive rocks located at 450 m depth in central Hainan Island. The obtained Q-P curves were divided into a laminar flow phase (I), a non-Darcy flow phase (II), and a hydraulic fracturing phase (III). The critical Reynolds number for the deviation of flow from linearity into phase II was 25-66. The flow of phase III occurred in sparsely to moderately fractured rocks, and was absent at the test intervals of perfect or poor intactness. The threshold fluid pressure between phases II and III was correlated with RQD and the confining stress. An Izbash's law-based analytical model was employed to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of the tested rocks in different flow conditions. It was demonstrated that the estimated hydraulic conductivity values in phases I and II are basically the same, and are weakly dependent on the injection fluid pressure, but it becomes strongly pressure dependent as a result of hydraulic fracturing in phase III. The hydraulic conductivity at different test intervals of a borehole is remarkably enhanced at highly fractured zone or contact zone, but within a rock unit of weak heterogeneity, it decreases with the increase of depth.

AB Application of soil erosion models requires accurate estimation of model parameters under different environmental conditions. The purpose of this study was to propose a new approach based on rill geometry to determine accurate values of the H, F and J parameters of the Hairsine-Rose model under infiltration conditions. H is the fractional area covered with deposited sediments; F is the fractional stream power effective in entrainment and re-entrainment; J is a measure of erodibility, i.e. the amount of energy required to remove a kilogram of the soil. Different stream powers ranging from 0.09 to 0.77 W m(-2) were generated in preformed rills in three soils. Using rill morphology measurements and sediment feedback relationship, transport capacity (T-c) was determined under steady-state conditions and the detachment capacity (D-c) was derived at the upslope end of the flume. The results showed that sediment concentration at the transport limit depends on the slope gradient as well as the particle size distribution. The value of H was related to the ratio of D-c/T-c and decreased with increasing stream power. The result indicated that the ratio of D-c/T-c decreased with stream power, due to faster increase of T-c than of D-c with stream power. A good fitness (R-2 = 0.94) relationship was found between the H values obtained by the ratio of q(s)/T-c versus the predicted values through the feedback relationship. Depending on soil type, the average F value varied between 0.123 and 0.174 and the average values of J for the soils varied between 0.038 and 0.231 J kg(-1). The soil containing larger aggregates showed higher values of F and vise versa. At lower stream powers, F showed greater variability, and approached to a relatively stable value of 0.1 at stream powers higher than about 0.6 W m(-2). The behavior of F was attributed to infiltration and the subsequent decrease of stream power and increases of settling velocity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to assess fully the spatio-temporal dependence dimensions of inflow across two adjacent and parallel basins and among different time steps through Causality. This is addressed from the perspective of Causal Reasoning, supported by Bayesian modelling, under a novel framework named Bayesian Causal Modelling (BCM). This is applied, through a "concept-proof", to the Jucar River Basin (the second largest basin of Eastern Spain, characterized by long and severe drought conditions). In this "concept-proof" a double goal is evaluated; first dedicated to a lumped analysis of dependence and second a specific one over dry periods focused on time-horizon of the Jucar basin typical drought (3 years). These challenges comprise the development of two fully connected Bayesian Networks (BNs), one for each challenge populated/trained from historical-inflow records. BNs were designed at a season-scale and consequently, time was upscaled and grouped into Irrigation and Non-Irrigation periods, according to Jucar River Basin Authority operational practices. Results achieved showed that BCM framework satisfactorily captured the spatio-temporal dependencies of systems. Furthermore, BCM is able to answer to some key questions over interdependencies between adjacent and parallel subbasins. Those questions may comprise, the amount of spatial dependences among time series, the temporarily conditionality among subbasins and the spatio-temporal dependence among basins. This provides a relevant insight on the intrinsic spatio-temporal dependence structure of inflow time series in complex basins systems. This approach could be very valuable for water resources planning and management, due to its application power for predicting extreme events (e.g. droughts) as well as improving and optimizing the reservoirs operation rules.

AB Delivering useful hydrological forecasts is critical for urban and agricultural water management, hydropower generation, flood protection and management, drought mitigation and alleviation, and river basin planning and management, among others. In this work, we present and appraise a new simple and flexible methodology for hydrological time series forecasting. This methodology relies on (a) at least two individual forecasting methods and (b) the median combiner of forecasts. The appraisal is made by using a big dataset consisted of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately 600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26 variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five afore-mentioned methods. The new methodology is identified as well-performing in the long run, especially when more than two individual forecasting methods are combined within its framework. Moreover, the possibility of case-informed integrations of diverse hydrological forecasting methods within systematic frameworks is algorithmically investigated and discussed. The related investigations encompass linear regression analyses, which aim at finding interpretable relationships between the values of a representative forecasting performance metric and the values of selected river flow statistics. We find only loose (but not negligible) relationships between the formed variable sets. These relationships could be exploited for improving (to some extent) future forecasting applications. The results of our big data forecasting experiment are lastly exploited for characterizing -in relative terms- one-year ahead river flow predictability. We believe that our findings have both practical and theoretical implications.

AB Despite the importance of understanding and quantifying the microstructure of porous networks in diverse geologic settings, the effects of the specific surface area and porosity on the key structural parameters of the networks have not been fully understood. We performed cube-counting fractal dimension (D-cc) and lacunarity analyses of 3D porous networks of model sands and configurational entropy analysis of 2D cross sections of model sands using random packing simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) micro-imaging. We established relationships among porosity, specific surface area, structural parameters (D-cc and lacunarity), and the corresponding macroscopic properties (configurational entropy and permeability). The D-cc of the 3D porous networks increases with increasing specific surface area at a constant porosity and with increasing porosity at a constant specific surface area. Predictive relationships correlating D-cc, specific surface area, and porosity were also obtained. The lacunarity at the minimum box size decreases with increasing porosity, and that at the intermediate box size (similar to 0.469 mm in the current model sands) was reproduced well with specific surface area. The maximum configurational entropy increases with increasing porosity, and the entropy length of the pores decreases with increasing specific surface area and was used to calculate the average connectivity among the pores. The correlation among porosity, specific surface area, and permeability is consistent with the prediction from the Kozeny-Carman equation. From the relationship between the permeability and the D-cc of pores, the permeability can be expressed as a function of the D-cc of pores and porosity. The current methods and these newly identified correlations among structural parameters and properties provide improved insights into the nature of porous media and have useful geophysical and hydrological implications for elasticity and shear viscosity of complex composites of rock, glasses, melt, and fluids as well as transport behavior of ground water.

AB Generalized complementary functions, which describe the relationship between the ratio of actual evaporation over the Penman potential evaporation (E/E-pen) and the proportion of the radiation term in E-pen (E-rad/E-pen) have not been widely used at annual time scales. In this study, the generalized nonlinear advection-aridity function (GNAA) and sigmoid generalized complementary function (SGCF) were evaluated for annual evaporation estimation with calibrated parameters in the Loess Plateau of China. For all 15 catchments, the lowest values of annual E-rad/E-pen were found to be much larger than zero, and the annual E/E-pen increased approximately linearly with annual E-rad/E-pen. This complementary evaporation relationship at an annual timescale differs from those at daily timescales, and requires different parameterizations of the GNAA and SGCF. For the GNAA, parameter c, which is often set to zero for daily time scales, need to be well calibrated with available data. For the SGCF, the upper and lower limits of E-rad/E-pen must be constrained. After calibration, both the SGCF and GNAA performed well at estimating annual evaporation. In addition, the calibrated Priestley-Taylor coefficient from the SGCF was found to be closer to the widely accepted value (1.26) than that determined from the GNAA.

AB In the case of increasingly serious river pollution worldwide, aeration in channels is an effective way to solve water pollution. However, traditional aeration research is aimed mainly at nonvegetated channels, and there is relatively little research in vegetated channels. Aeration contributes to the absorption of pollutants by vegeta-tion, so studying the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen in vegetated channels is of great significance. This paper innovatively studies the variation law and formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in vegetated channels through an experiment and theoretical analysis. Through flume experiments, this study examines the bubble size and oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities and establishes a formula to simulate the oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities. The results show that vegetation has little effect on bubble diameter, and the main effect on bubble diameter is the aeration rate. The existence of vegetation significantly increases the mass transfer of oxygen, and the higher the vegetation density is, the greater the oxygen transfer coefficient transfer is. At the same time, a formula predicting the oxygen transfer coefficient is proven, and the simulation results are good, in which the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9535 and the mean absolute error (MAE) reached 0.0857. This study provides a theoretical basis for the selection and layout of aeration systems in vegetated channels.

AB Accurate identification of the origin of groundwater samples is not always possible in complex multilayered aquifers. This poses a major difficulty for a reliable interpretation of geochemical results. The problem is especially severe when the information on the tubewells design is hard to obtain. This paper shows a supervised classification method based on the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique to identify the layer from where groundwater samples were extracted. The classification rules were based on the major ion composition of the samples. We applied this method to the Campo de Cartagena multi-layer aquifer system, in southeastern Spain. A large amount of hydrogeochemical data was available, but only a limited fraction of the sampled tubewells included a reliable determination of the borehole design and, consequently, of the aquifer layer being exploited. Added difficulty was the very similar compositions of water samples extracted from different aquifer layers. Moreover, not all groundwater samples included the same geochemical variables. Despite of the difficulty of such a background, the Random Forest classification reached accuracies over 90%. These results were much better than the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Decision Trees (CART) supervised classification methods. From a total of 1549 samples, 805 proceeded from one unique identified aquifer, 409 proceeded from a possible blend of waters from several aquifers and 335 were of unknown origin. Only 468 of the 805 unique-aquifer samples included all the chemical variables needed to calibrate and validate the models. Finally, 107 of the groundwater samples of unknown origin could be classified. Most unclassified samples did not feature a complete dataset. The uncertainty on the identification of training samples was taken in account to enhance the model. Most of the samples that could not be identified had an incomplete dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Variations in sediment yield are controlled by many variables that operate at different scales. The relationships between sediment yield and its influencing factors at multiple time scales are still unclear since the underlying processes overlap at diverse scales. The objective of this study was to use multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reveal scale-specific controls on sediment yield. Annual sediment yield and its five influencing factors including runoff, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and NDVI were collected from 1982 to 2015 from six typical karst watersheds in southwest China. Using MEMD, the different scales of controls on sediment yield were determined by decomposing the data into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues. Sediment yield was found to be significantly correlated with its potential controlling factors at two or more scales for each watershed, although no significant correlations were observed between sediment yield and some of the influencing factors at the observation scales. The factors controlling sediment yield were found to be scale-specific and varied by watershed, and some factors controlling sediment yield were more deterministic at longer time scales. The scale-specific controlling factors at a particular scale or residue were able to predict sediment yield at each scale (IMF) or residue. Furthermore, sediment yield at the observation scale was predicted by summing up all the IMFs and the residues derived from the factor components at equivalent scales. Runoff and precipitation were the major predictors for sediment yield in all watersheds except in the Hongshui watershed where the temperature and NDVI were the major explanatory variables that predicted overall sediment yield. The predictions of overall sediment yield using MEMD were better (R-2 ranges from 0.81 to 0.92) than the predictions of sediment yield made using the original data (R-2 ranges from 0.32 to 0.78). This suggests that the complex relationships between sediment yield and associated factors are not captured by single scale (observation scale) analysis. This study shows that MEMD may be a useful tool for revealing the scale-dependent relationships between sediment yield and its controlling factors in karst water-sheds.

AB The source region of the Yangtze River located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is very sensitive to climate change. The impact of climate change on the source region of the Yangtze River has been detected from multi-aspect, but limited research has been conducted on the hydropower impact of important water system, especially for the Yalong River, which is the longest tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and rich in hydropower reserves with a value of approximately 33.72 million kilowatts. In this study, we performed statistical down scaling of 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models and used the Bayesian weighted ensemble method to analyze the Yalong River basin. The interdecadal climate characteristics of the region were analyzed and drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model coupled with reservoir operation module to obtain the spatiotemporal changes in water-energy resources in the future. The results showed the precipitation in the Yalong River basin showed an increasing trend (12.38 mm/10a, 25.65 mm/10a) under the shared socioeconomic pathways 2-4.5(SSP2-4.5) and socioeconomic pathways 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenarios. Coupled with reservoir operation rules, the excess water during the wet season could be transferred to the dry season. Even so, it was estimated the overall power generation of the basin would be reduced by 4% to 6% compared to the baseline period. This change will largely affect the energy of Chongqing and Sichuan Provinces, which rely heavily on the Yalong River for hydropower generation.

AB A detailed examination of the relationship between synoptic patterns and the oxygen isotopic composition (delta(18)O) of rainfall is made using a 5-year long dataset of daily-event based rainfall samples from Tasmania, southern Australia. Rainfall delta(18)O varies inversely with rainfall amount and has only a weak relationship with site surface temperature. Events with extreme rainfall and delta(18)O values were identified from monthly anomalies. The synoptic patterns for these events were averaged using NCEP/DOE reanalyses-2 mean sea-level pressure data to define the major atmospheric circulation features. Large amounts of rainfall with low delta(18)O values occur when mid-latitude Southern Ocean low pressure systems pass close to the southeast of Tasmania in a circulation pattern with a strong meridional component. By contrast, small amounts of rainfall with high delta(18)O values occur when the centre of these mid-latitude cyclonic systems pass much further south of Tasmania. In the latter, only the distal limits of the fronts associated with these low pressure systems cross Tasmania and airflow has a stronger zonal component. In addition, synoptic patterns causing advection of air from lower latitudes towards Tasmania may raise the delta(18)O value of precipitation. Oxygen isotope records from southern Australia should not be interpreted exclusively as proxies for temperature changes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Flow behavior in a dual fracture network
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE fractured reservoir; pumping tests; pressure transient response; dual
   porosity behavior; heterogeneity; connectivity
AB A model that incorporates a pseudo-random process controlled by mechanical rules of fracturing is used to generate 3D orthogonal joint networks in tabular stratified aquifers. The results presented here assume that two sets of fractures, each with different conductivities, coexist. This is the case in many aquifers or petroleum reservoirs that contain sets of fractures with distinct hydraulic properties related to each direction of fracturing. Constant rate pump-tests from partially penetrating wells are simulated in synthetic networks. The transient head response is analyzed using the type curve approach and plots, as a function of time, of pressure propagation in the synthetic network are shown. The hydrodynamic response can result in a pressure transient that is similar to a dual-porosity behavior, even though such an assumption was not made a priori. We show in this paper that this dual porosity like flow behavior is, in fact, related to the major role of the network connectivity, especially around the well, and to the aperture contrast between the different families of fractures that especially affects the earlier hydrodynamic response. Flow characteristics that may be interpreted as a dual porosity flow behavior are thus related to a lateral heterogeneity (large fracture or small fault). Accordingly, when a dual porosity model matches well test data, the resulting reservoir parameters can be erroneous because of the model assumptions basis that are not necessarily verified. Finally, it is shown both on simulated data and well test data that such confusion in the interpretation of the flow behavior can easily occur. Well test data from a single well must therefore be used cautiously to assess the flow properties of fractured reservoirs with lateral heterogeneities such as large fractures or small faults.

AB Due to the great difficulty of monitoring surface and underground runoff and sediment yield directly, the surface and underground hydrological processes associated with soil leakage loss in karst trough valleys remain unknown. The objective of this study was to analyse the role of the rock dip angle in the water and soil leakage loss processes, to assess the characteristics of surface and underground runoff and soil erosion and to investigate their conversion relationships using rainfall experiments. The results showed the following. i) At a steep rock dip angle (60 degrees), the underground runoff yield had a shorter stabilization time than the surface runoff yield and that the underground runoff coefficient of the dip slope exceeded 0.5. ii) The surface sediment yield could be divided into the suspended load and the bed load and the underground sediment yield included only the suspended load. On the anti-dip slope, the surface erosion modulus was 0.83-2.50 times the underground erosion modulus. iii) The surface and underground cumulative runoff was linearly correlated with the cumulative sediment yield. The rock dip angle had a significant quadratic relationship with the surface and underground runoff and sediment yield. These results improve the understanding of the surface-underground runoff and soil erosion processes and have significance for preventing water and soil leakage loss on the slopes of karst trough valleys.

AB Hydrology is central to the formation, growth and utilisation of peat soils. However, peat presents a difficult medium in which to measure hydrologic properties, due to its soft structure and high water content. The von Post scale is a widely used measure of the extent of decomposition of peat, which can be applied in the field or the laboratory without specialised equipment. von Post decomposition has been shown to correlate with hydraulic conductivity. However, it is a categorical and subjective measure of decomposition. Technological advances now enable peat chemistry to be described quantitatively and objectively. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is now routinely used to describe peat chemistry, and the capability of this technique has been extended by the development of the molecular mixing model (MMM). The MMM predicts the molecular composition of organic material from the spectral information provided by C-13 NMR. We found significant relationships between the hydrologic properties hydraulic conductivity and water yield and peat chemistry as described by C-13 NMR and the MMM. These relationships have potential application in all fields where the hydrologic properties of peat soils are of interest (i.e. peat mining, peatland restoration, catchment management) and also in modelling of peatland development and responses to climate change.

AB The North American Monsoon (NAM) system controls the warm season climate over much of southwestern North America. In this semi-arid environment, understanding the regional behavior of the hydroclimatology and its associated modes of variability is critically important to effectively predicting and managing perpetually stressed regional water resources. Equally as important is understanding the relationships through which warm season precipitation is converted into streamflow. This work explores the hydroclimatology of northwestern Mexico, i.e. the core region of the NAM, by (a) presenting a thorough review of recent hydroclimatic investigations from the region and (b) developing a detailed hydroclimatology of 15, unregulated, headwater basins along the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains in western Mexico. The present work is distinct from previous studies as it focuses on the intra-seasonal evolution of rainfall-runoff relationships, and contrasts the sub-regional behavior of the rainfall-runoff response. It is found that there is substantial sub-regional coherence in the hydrological response to monsoon precipitation. Three physically plausible regions emerge from a rotated Principal Components Analysis of streamflow and basin-averaged precipitation. Mouth-to-mouth streamflow persistence, rainfall-runoff correlation scores and runoff coefficient values demonstrate regional coherence and are generally consistent with what is currently known about subregional aspects of NAM precipitation character.

AB We present a distributed-order fractional diffusion-wave equation (dofDWE) to describe radial groundwater flow to or from a well, and three sets of solutions of the dofDWE for flow from a well for aquifer tests: one for pumping tests, and two for slug tests. The dofDWE is featured by two temporal orders of fractional derivatives, beta(1) and beta(2), which characterise small and large pores, respectively. By fitting the approximate solutions of the dofDWE to data from slug tests in the field, we determined the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-e, transmissivity, T-f, and the order of fractional derivatives, beta(2) in one test and beta(2) and beta(1) in the second test. We found that the patterns of groundwater flow from a well during the slug tests at this site belong to the class of sub-diffusion with beta(2) < 1 and beta(1) < 1 using both the short-time and large-time solutions. We introduce the concept of the critical time to link Ke as a function of beta(2) and beta(2). The importance of the orders of fractional derivatives is obvious in the approximate solutions: for short time slug tests only the parameter beta(2) for flow in large pores is present while for long time slug tests the parameters beta(2) and beta(1) are present indicating both large and small pores are functioning.

AB It was found that groundwater can be fluctuated by a variety of disturbances. For instance, seismic activity inducing the dilatation of earth can disturb groundwater level fluctuation as observed in groundwater wells. In this research, spectral analysis in the frequency domain was used to quantitatively evaluate coherence between groundwater head fluctuations and the ground motions recorded in Taiwan from a distant earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in northern Honshu, Japan with magnitude of 9. The relationship between groundwater fluctuations and the decomposed ground motions of Rayleigh waves are clearly identified. By analyzing autospectral density, cross-spectral density, and resultant coherence for the seismograms and groundwater head, it was found that the Rayleigh waves dominated the groundwater fluctuations at period of about 21-32 s for six pair of groundwater and seismograms of broadband distributed around Taiwan; fluctuations of groundwater are highly coherent with the radial and vertical components of ground motions. Our analysis also shows the time from event to station for Rayleigh waves ranged from 780 to 900 s approximately. Wave parameter for seismic event to station of groundwater and seismograms were also identified as 3.0-3.5 km/s and 64-110 km for wave velocity and wave length, respectively. The relationship of groundwater fluctuations and ground motions induced by seismic activity become feasible to assess using spectral analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have analyzed relationships between environmental factors (physiographic, climatic, geological, geographic and land use) and extreme minimum flow characteristics. We have defined 18 hydrological variables on the annual minimum flow series according to the "natural flow regime" paradigm. Application of the principal component analysis (PCA) to these 18 variables allowed us to extract five principal components, each associated with a fundamental characteristic (magnitude-frequency, timing, inter-annual variability of magnitude and timing, shape of distribution curve) of the annual minimum flows. The analysis of indices and values of the loading of the five PC revealed a spatial difference in the annual minimum flow characteristics between stations on the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada). South shore stations are generally characterized by lower magnitude, later timing, and sharper inter-annual variability of magnitude and timing of the annual minimum flows than those on the north shore.
   The analysis of correlations (simple correlation and canonical correlation) between the five hydrological PC and the seven environmental PC, also extracted by means of the PCA, revealed that the spatial difference between the annual minimum flow characteristics observed between the north and the south shore stations is mainly due to precipitation (climatic factor) based on a highly complex relationship, which mainly involves the timing of annual minimum flows.

AB Mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated in the simulation of heat transport in porous media, e.g., by using zero or the default value in simulators, or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value. However, large amounts of water usually injected in groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems may increase the groundwater flow velocity much faster than natural flow and thus change the importance of mechanical dispersion in heat transport. In this study, to investigate the effects of water injection on the flow field, thermal dispersion coefficient, and associated heat transport process, a laboratory experiment using two different heat sources as tracers was performed at various background flow velocities (Re < 0.52). The analysis results from analytical and numerical models indicate that injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients, especially near the injection well, and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity. This result was also found in the field-based modeling results, but the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects was larger. In particular, thermal dispersivity on a field scale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as GWHP systems, it is necessary to evaluate site-specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments.

AB A comprehensive set of experiments was carried out to investigate the effect of the fractal architecture of granular aggregates on the free-fall acceleration through a still water column. Test aggregates were first generated numerically with a method that allowed to control the fractal dimension d and, next, three stochastic replicates were lithographically fabricated for each of six values of d ranging between 1.9 and 2.7. The recorded position, velocity and acceleration served to analyze their dynamics in the Reynolds and Galilei number space, and to calculate the momentum rate of change and the intensity of drag (viscous and impact) and inertial forces (added mass and Basset-Bousinnesq). Analysis of these forces highlighted a strong dependence on d; additionally, integration of these forces in the particle momentum equation allowed to identify an additional resistance R-x that showed a strong correlation with d. A correlation analysis of R-x with various scaling laws combining velocity and acceleration suggested that R-x could be described by a nonlinear drag force and a force intermediate between drag and inertia. It was therefore concluded that irregular granular fractal aggregates accelerating in water are subject to highly complex and nonlinear hydrodynamic effects caused by surface roughness and volume porosity, and that these effects have tight connection with the internal and external fractal characteristics of the aggregates.

AB Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) of river-aquifer systems are known to affect water flow, but the quantitative influences of lateral HEFs and the riparian zone's hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution on stream fluxes remain obscure under varying hydrologic conditions. To fill this knowledge gap, this study proposed a physical based, distributed domain, coupled (open channel and groundwater) flow model (DDCM) to quantify the effect of lateral HEFs on hydrograph characteristics, including especially the peak discharge and tailing decay which are practically important. Numerical experiments showed that (1) the interaction between the lateral HEFs and river hydrodynamics reduced the peak discharge and flood flow rates, (2) a heterogeneous K field of the riparian zone generated multi-rate HEFs (which then changed flow response) represented by the hydrographs with various declining rates (varying from exponential to power-law), significantly expanding the flow process, and (3) the probability density function of K also affected the tailing and peak of the hydrograph. A preliminary test showed that the DDCM captured the overall pattern of hydrographs observed from a catchment in the Wadi Ahin West, Oman. This study, therefore, provided a model-based quantification of the mechanisms and factors of the lateral HEFs affecting the hydrograph pattern in flood events, and further applications are needed to test the applicability of the DDCM in capturing real-world hydrographs affected by the lateral HEFs.

AB Climate change has emerged as a vital issue for hydropower management in the future. General circulation model (GCM)-informed climate is commonly applied to assess the impact of climate change on hydropower. However, the effect of GCM credibility on hydropower robustness has been rarely explored. One objective of this study is to seek valuable and robust policies, and the other is to evaluate the effects of GCM credibility on hy-dropower robustness based on the pre-optimized operating policies. A multi-objective robust optimization approach is first proposed to design operating policies by coupling stochastic simulation, heuristic parameterized policy search, and robust optimization. The GCM credibility is then evaluated based on multi-criteria ranking scores, and the hydropower robustness is illustrated by stepwise culling the lowest credible GCMs. The climate -induced impacts on hydropower robustness rely on an ensemble of 18 GCMs under three representative con-centration pathways in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and 17 GCMs under three shared socioeconomic pathways in CMIP6. The Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs in Upper Yellow River Basin are selected as a case study. The results show that (1) the proposed stochastic approach outperforms the deter-ministic approach regarding hydropower generation and firm output where the mean annual hydropower generation of stochastic operation is improved by -0.50-19.53% compared to deterministic operation, indicating that the operating rules derived using historical stochastic inflows can adapt flexibly to future inflow changes than that using deterministic inflow. (2) CMIP6 maintains a more robust performance than CMIP5 with higher satisficing measures and lower regret measures. (3) Hydropower robustness tends to be higher when considering credibility and will be lower with time due to increasing uncertainty. Ignorance of GCM credibility may lead to biased climate change adaptation decisions.

AB The inverse relationship between water and sediment is hindering the regulation of sediment in silt-laden rivers. Under natural conditions and insufficient water flow, sediment deposits along river channels, resulting in the accumulation of suspended river sediments above the ground level on both sides of the river. Then, during flooding, dam collapse and overflow can easily occur, threatening the life of residents in floodplain. The operation of upstream reservoirs to maximise the sediment transport capacity of downstream rivers into the sea is deemed the best strategy for the management of silt-laden rivers. However, as incoming water and sediment form a dynamic system, optimising the operation mode of reservoirs has become the most severe challenge in the field. This study proposes a method to remodel the water-sediment relationship of natural rivers by optimising the reservoir operation. First, data were collected and analysed to investigate sediment transport in the downstream river channel and the response relationship between erosion-deposition. Then, an empirical equation for calculating the desired incoming sediment was derived, and the threshold for sedimentary transport balance in the lower reach of silt-laden rivers was determined through mathematical modelling. Finally, the reservoir operation mode was optimised within the threshold range to study the discharge process of the reservoir with the highest sediment transport efficiency downstream. The Yellow River in China exhibits the highest sediment concentration worldwide and was used as a case study to verify the practicability of the proposed method. The critical threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower Yellow River was determined to be 250 million tons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improved the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Moreover, it reduced the siltation of the XiaoLangDi Reservoir and the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The XiaoLangDi Reservoir can be jointly operated with the Guxian Reservoir, which is under construction and is expected to maintain the bankfull discharge of the lower reaches of the Yellow River at 4000 m(3) for a long time. The optimisation process described in this study can be used to improve the management of silt-laden rivers.

AB A two-dimensional lattice gas-cellular automaton fluid model with long-range interactions (Appert and Zaleski, 1990) is used to simulate saturated and unsaturated water infiltration in porous media.  Water and gas within the porous medium are simulated by applying the dense and the light phase, respectively, of the cellular automaton fluid.  Various wetting properties can be modeled when adjusting the corresponding solid-liquid interactions.  The lattice gas rules include a gravity force step to allow buoyancy-driven flow.  The model handles with ease complex geometries of the solid, and an algorithm for generating random porous media is presented.  The results of four types of simulation experiments are presented:  (1) We verified Poiseuille's law for steady and saturated flow between two parallel plates.  (2) We analyzed transient water infiltration between two parallel plates of varying degrees of saturation and various apertures.  (3) Philip's infiltration equation was adequately simulated in an unsaturated porous medium.  (4) Infiltration into an aggregated medium containing one vertical parallel crack was simulated.  Further applications of this lattice gas method for studying unsaturated flow in porous media are discussed.

AB Fractures in rock mass are the main flow paths and introduce as a most important attribute in rock mass hydraulic behavior. The non-linear fluid flow through rock fractures was studied in this paper. Computational domain of an artificial three-dimensional fracture is generated and used for CFD simulations. Both laminar and turbulent flow simulations were performed for a wide range of flow rates. Also, a new non-linear fluid flow formulation was developed on the basis of some geometrical and kinematical assumptions for fracture and fluid flow, respectively. Based on comparison between simulation results and developed formulation, a new geometrical model has been proposed for non-linear fluid flow through rough fractures, which suggests a polynomial expression, like Forchheimer law, to describe the dependence of pressure drop on flow rate. Finally, this model has been evaluated with experimental results of a fracture with different geometries. The results show that the predicted pressure drop for turbulent flow simulation was roughly 3-17% more than those for laminar one at the Reynolds number of 4.5-89.5, respectively. Moreover, a good accuracy was found between the proposed model and turbulent flow simulation results. These findings may prove useful for computational studies of flows through real rock fractures, or inclusions in simulators for large-scale flow in fractured rocks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper introduces a new concept for mapping hydraulic transmissivity from temporal concentration data collected in multiple tracer tests. Based on convolutional neural network, the principle uses an encoder-decoder architecture with multiple neural layers to establish a relationship between the concentration data and the transmissivity field. This relationship is established in two phases with two networks. The first network is designated and trained to reconstruct a transmissivity field using data from a single tracer test. To improve the reconstruction quality, the second network then performs a joint interpretation for multiple tracer tests, which reprocesses all the transmissivity resulted from the first network for each individual tracer test. Both networks are trained by synthetic data, where the transmissivity models are generated with a Gaussian variogram and its properties are considered as prior information on the aquifer heterogeneity. Tracer tests are derived numerically by solving the forward problem to obtain the corresponding concentration data that feed the training. The trained networks accurately map the transmissivity fields, of which the accuracy relies on the volume and nature of the heterogeneities of training models, as well as the number of piezometers used to monitor the concentration changes. Reconstruction quality, on the other hand, is less influenced by data noise. Effective training requires a large dataset, but the time required for dataset generation is only on the order of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in a conventional inversion, while the trained network performs inference instantly.

AB This study proposes an evolutionary fuzzy inference model that combines a fuzzy inference model, genetic programming (GP), and a genetic algorithm (GA) to forecast flood stages during typhoons. The number of fuzzy inference rules in the proposed approach is based on the number of typhoon flood events. The consequent part of the rule was formed by constructing GP models that depict the rainfall-stage relationship of a specific flood event, whereas the GA was used to search the parameters of the fuzzy membership functions in the premise part of the rule. This study uses the proposed event-based evolutionary fuzzy inference model to forecast the typhoon flood stages of Wu River in Taiwan. Forecasting results based on stage hydrographs and performance indices verify the forecasting ability of the proposed model. This study also identifies the weights of triggered fuzzy rules during the fuzzy inference process, showing that a fuzzy rule is triggered according to the characteristics of the flood event that forms the rule. Moreover, physical explanation of the proposed evolutionary fuzzy inference model was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall erosivity is an index that describes the power of rainfall to cause soil erosion and it is used around the world for assessing and predicting soil loss on agricultural lands. Erosivity can be represented in terms of both rainfall momentum and kinetic energy, both calculated per unit time and area. Contrasting results on the representativeness of these two variables are available: some authors stated that momentum and kinetic energy are practically interchangeable in soil loss estimation while other found that kinetic energy is the most suitable expression of rainfall erosivity. The direct and continuous measurements of momentum and kinetic energy by a disdrometer allow also to establish a relationship with rainfall intensity at the study site.
   At first in this paper a comparison between the momentum-rainfall intensity relationships measured at Palermo and El Teularet by an optical disdrometer is presented. For a fixed rainfall intensity the measurements showed that the rainfall momentum values measured at the two experimental sites are not coincident. However both datasets presented a threshold value of rainfall intensity over which the rainfall momentum assumes a quasi-constant value. Then the reliability of a theoretically deduced relationship, linking momentum, rainfall intensity and median volume diameter, is positively verified using measured raindrop size distributions. An analysis to assess which variable, momentum or kinetic energy per unit area and time, is the best predictor of erosivity in Italy and Spain was also carried out. This investigation highlighted that the rainfall kinetic energy per unit area and time can be substituted by rainfall momentum as index for estimating the rainfall erosivity, and this result does not depend on the site where precipitation occurs.
   Finally, rainfall intensity measurements and soil loss data collected from the bare plots equipped at Sparacia experimental area were used to verify the reliability of some rainfall erosivity indices and their ability to distinguish the type of involved soil erosion processes.

AB The prairie region of Canada and the United States is characterized by millions of small depressions of glacial origin called prairie potholes. The transfer of surface runoff in this landscape is mainly through a "fill and spill" mechanism among neighboring potholes. While non-contributing areas, that is small internally drained basins, are common on this landscape, during wet periods these areas can become hydrologically connected to larger regional drainage systems. Accurate prediction of prairie surface runoff generation and streamflow thus requires realistic representation of the dynamic threshold-mediated nature of these contributing areas. This paper presents a new prairie surface runoff generation algorithm for land surface schemes and large scale hydrological models that conceptualizes a hydrologic unit as a combination of variable and interacting storage elements. The proposed surface runoff generation algorithm uses a probability density function to represent the spatial variation of pothole storages and assumes a unique relationship between storage and the fractional contributing area for runoff (and hence amount of direct runoff generated) within a grid cell. In this paper the parameters that define this relationship are obtained by calibration against streamflow. The model was compared to an existing hydrology-land surface scheme (HLSS) applied to a typical Canadian prairie catchment, the Assiniboine River. The existing configuration is based on the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and WATROF (a physically-based overland and interflow scheme). The new configuration consists of CLASS coupled with the new PDMROF model. Results showed that the proposed surface runoff generation algorithm performed better at simulating streamflow, and appears to capture the dynamic nature of contributing areas in an effective and parsimonious manner. A pilot evaluation based on 1 m LiDAR data from a small (10 km(2)) experimental area suggests that the shape of the modeled storage-contributing area relationship is broadly consistent with that inferred from terrain analysis, under certain simplifying assumptions. The direct identification of storage-runoff parameters from terrain analysis is an outstanding challenge, and a promising area for future research. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water markets are well known for improving the efficient use and reallocation of water, and the southern-connected Murray-Darling Basin water market is recognised as the most advanced water market globally. In recent years, the market has matured considerably with new water ownership and trading strategies emerging, along with increased participation from non-landholders (i.e. environmental water holders and financial investors, such as pure traders and superannuation companies). This study draws on a quantitative survey of 1000 southern Basin irrigators plus qualitative interviews with 63 water experts from banks, environmental water holders, investors/agri-corporates, financial investors, property evaluators and water brokers to illustrate the different water ownership and trading strategies employed. Findings suggest that many stakeholders, including non-landholders, prefer to own most of their water needs in higher security water entitlements and use temporary trade to mitigate water supply shortfalls. However, some own no water entitlements (or land) at all, while financial investors and large agri-corporates are more likely to use/supply highly sophisticated temporary trading products, such as water forwards and parking contracts. In addition to the need to reinforce the fundamentals of water institutions in the Murray-Darling Basin (i.e. robust accounting of water extraction and use, and continual monitoring, compliance and enforcement of water extraction), we suggest three major reform areas: 1) data reform: improving the quality and availability of trade and water data plus standardised water market and water forwards terminology; 2) rules and regulation reform: increased transparency of trade and allocation/carry-over restrictions plus increased water market regulation and enforcement; and 3) new water market institutional development: a central exchange and clearing house.

AB Is the energy equation for gradually-varied flow the best approximation for the free surface profile computations in river flows? Determination of flood inundation in rivers and natural waterways is based on the hydraulic computation of flow profiles. This is usually done using energy-based gradually-varied flow models, like HEC-RAS, that adopts a vertical division method for discharge prediction in compound channel sections. However, this discharge prediction method is not so accurate in the context of advancements over the last three decades. This paper firstly presents a study of the impact of discharge prediction on the gradually-varied flow computations by comparing thirteen different methods for compound channels, where both energy and momentum equations are applied. The discharge, velocity distribution coefficients, specific energy, momentum and flow profiles are determined. After the study of gradually-varied flow predictions, a new theory is developed to produce higher-order energy and momentum equations for rapidly-varied flow in compound channels. These generalized equations enable to describe the flow profiles with more generality than the gradually-varied flow computations. As an outcome, results of gradually-varied flow provide realistic conclusions for computations of flow in compound channels, showing that momentum-based models are in general more accurate; whereas the new theory developed for rapidly-varied flow opens a new research direction, so far not investigated in flows through compound channels.

AB Soil pores are known as an effective medium for water, air, and chemical movement. However, quantifying pore structures and their relationship to the detachment of undisturbed soil by concentrated flow is not fully understood. The objectives of this study were to quantify 3D aggregate microstructures using synchrotron-based high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-mu CT) under wetting and drying cycles and to investigate the effects of pore characteristics on the detachment of undisturbed soil by simulating concentrated flow. The detachment rates (D-r) of undisturbed topsoil samples, which were subjected to a pretreatment of zero to eleven wetting and drying cycles, were measured in a 3.8-m-long, 0.2-m-wide hydraulic flume under unitary flow shear stresses (tau = 14.49 Pa); 3-5 mm aggregates were collected from the pretreatment soils, which were subjected to zero, five, and eleven wetting and drying cycles and were scanned at a 3.7 mu m voxel-resolution for reconstructing three-dimensional microtomography images. The relationships among pore characteristics and D-r were analyzed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results indicated that D-r and the aggregate microstructure changed significantly after the wetting and drying cycles. Dr was closely associated with the pore characteristics. The pore characteristics, such as a >100 mu m porosity, total porosity, fraction of regular pores, 30-75 mu m porosity, fraction of elongated pores, and fraction of irregular pores, were identified as the primary parameters that control the D-r. The pore characteristics and clay content could account for as much as 68.2% of the variation in D-r. D-r was significantly and positively related to a >100 mu m porosity, total porosity, and fraction of elongated pores. Thus, soil fragmentation depended on microcracks that formed during the wetting and drying cycles and on the geometrical characteristics of the pores or cracks. The results from this study provide a quantitative evaluation of the relationships between pore characteristics and the detachment of undisturbed soil by simulated concentrated flow. A further understanding of the effect of topsoil microstructure on water erosion and quantitative information for assessing and modeling erosion processes was obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The optimal allocation of water resources is a critical means of resolving the supply-demand paradox. To optimize the allocation of regional water resources, an Interval Numeral-Hierarchical Planning Model (INHPM) was established to integrate unconventional water resources into the water resource allocation system while simultaneously considering the interests of decision makers at different levels and the uncertainty in a water resource allocation system. The INHPM directs conventional and unconventional water supply departments to achieve coordinated development through the objective function of the synergy degree. The theory of synergy and the theory of information entropy serve as the theoretical foundations for the objective function of the synergy degree. In addition, the interval number was introduced to allow the INHPM to address uncertainty in a water resource allocation system. The hierarchical planning model served as the primary framework for assisting decision makers in minimizing conflicts of interest among various stakeholders in a water allocation system. In this paper, the Interval Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (IMOGA) was established to solve the INHPM, as opposed to the previous method of transforming the uncertainty model into a certainty model and solving it (IMOGA-INHPM). Finally, using the optimal allocation of conventional and unconventional water resources in Ordos, Northwest China, as an example, the results and comparison analysis of a case study demonstrate the IMOGA-practicability INHPM's and efficiency.

AB Stemflow was monitored on event-basis in an undisturbed open tropical rainforest with a large number of palm trees located in the southwestern Amazon basin of Brazil We estimated stemflow of 24 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) over 5 cm and of 16 juvenile and eight aborescent babassu palms (Orbignya phalerata Mart) To obtain within-event stemflow variability we monitored stemflow of one additional aborescent babassu palm with a tipping-bucket rain gauge at 5-min Intervals Total stemflow of the forest accounted for 80 +/- 1 8% (S E) of incident rainfall and reached the forest floor over an area corresponding to the total basal area that sums up to only 0 3% of the plot area The most influential predictive variables for stemflow generation were DBH and rainfall amount The stemflow parameter funneling ratio which is normalized for DBH and rainfall amount was particularly useful to highlight the relevance of small trees (DBH <= 10 cm) for stemflow general ion Small trees and babassu palms had significantly higher funneling ratios than larger trees (median funneling ratios 15-27 and 1-2 respectively) The maximum 5-min stemflow intensity (1232 mm h(-1)) was 15-fold that of rainfall High funneling ratios of small trees and babassu palms suggest that high stemflow intensities are the rule rather than the exception Therefore we expect small trees and babassu palms to influence hydrologic processes as subsurface flow saturation overland flow or groundwater recharge Consequently stemflow studies should Include all DBH classes and species with exceptionally high funneling ratios For modeling purposes stemflow should be estimated and not just assumed if study sites have a large number of palms or of small trees (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB A model for drainage networks and their associated landscapes has been developed. This model is based on the minimum energy dissipation principle and an empirical relationship s similar to Q(alpha) between the slope s of each link in a channel network and the mean annual discharge Q that flows through it. The model was studied using six different values for the exponent alpha. The surfaces of these minimum energy dissipation drainage networks appear to be more complex than simple self-affine fractals. The drainage basins in these optimal drainage networks have power law size (area) distributions with a universal exponent, which is independent of the value of alpha. For the minimum energy dissipation drainage networks obtained using a particular value for a, the basin shapes are similar to each other. An empirical relationship has also been found to relate the basins' ''length-width'' ratio to the value of alpha.

AB This paper presents an efficient method to analyze the aquifer response to periodic forcing. A complex transformation is used to change the time-dependent linear aquifer model into an equivalent time-independent problem of a complex function (referred to as the "complex amplitude" hereafter). The magnitude of the complex amplitude represents the amplitude of the sinusoidal fluctuation of the groundwater level, and the argument of the complex amplitude, the phase shift of the fluctuation. Different iterative methods can be used to obtain the numerical solution. A semi-analytical numerical solution of the groundwater level, which is numerical for the spatial variables and analytical for the time variable, can be obtained by implementing a simple inverse complex transform to the complex amplitude. The advantages of the time-independent method include ruling out of initial conditions, direct outputs of the amplitude and phase shift of different sinusoidal components of the water level fluctuations. On the contrary, the numerical solutions of the time-dependent model need further computational efforts for the analyses of the amplitudes and phase shifts of different sinusoidal components, and have to consider an initial condition whose impacts on the periodicity have to be eliminated by running sufficiently great number of tidal circles. A case study at an unconfined aquifer formed by fill materials near Lam Chau Island, Hong Kong SAR, PR China shows the applicability of the semi-numerical solution to analyze tide-induced watertable fluctuations. The aquifer parameters were estimated by minimizing a least-squares objective function to fit the complex amplitude of semidiurnal and diurnal components of the observed water level fluctuations. Compared with the parameter estimations of some of the previous analytical solutions, the numerical method gives not only better fitting to the water level observations, but also more aquifer parameters.

AB The Representative Elementary Watershed (REW) approach proposed by Reggiani et al. (1998, 1999) represents an attempt to develop a scale adaptable modeling framework for the hydrological research community. Tian et al. (2006) extended the original REW theory for cold regions through explicit treatment of energy balance equations to incorporate associated cold regions processes, such as snow and glacier melting/accumulation, and soil freezing/thawing. However, constitutive relationships for the cold regions processes needed to complete these new balance equations have been left unspecified in this derivation. In this paper we propose a set of closure schemes for cold regions processes within the extended framework. An energy balance method is proposed to close the balance equations of melting/accumulation processes as well as the widely-used and conceptual degree-day method, whereas the closure schemes for soil freezing and thawing are based on the maximum unfrozen-water content model. The proposed closure schemes are coupled to the previously derived balance equations and implemented within the Thermodynamic Watershed Hydrological Model (THModel, Tian, 2006) and then applied to the headwaters of the Urumqi River in Western China. The results of the 5-year calibration and 3-year validation analyses show that THModel can indeed simulate runoff processes in this glacier and snow-dominated catchment reasonably well, which shows the prospects of the REW approach and the developed closure schemes for cold regions processes.

AB This study aims to clarify groundwater and stream water flow systems in the Geum River basin, Korea, which is an area with a crystalline basement using delta O-18, delta H-2, and H-3. Stable isotopes of precipitation showed clear differences between dry and rainy seasons due to the Asian monsoon. Groundwater and stream water samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons in three hydrographic zones of the upper, middle, and lower zones. The contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge based on deuterium excess was 71-89%, far exceeding the amount fraction of the season in total precipitation. Stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water showed little seasonal variation, and indicated the dominance of high-altitude recharge in the upper zone. Groundwater with lower H-3 was mainly observed in that area, indicating a contribution of intermediate flow with a longer residence time. In contrast, stream water and some groundwater samples in the lower zone showed seasonal variability and signatures of 10-20% evaporation in their stable isotopic composition. The H-3 content of groundwater in the lower zone was high, indicating that the local flow system is dominant. These regional features also influenced the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation, dry season precipitation, and local recharge with evaporation signature, as estimated from delta O-18 and deuterium excess values, and H-3 in groundwater. Stream water from lower-order streams of the river had stable isotopic compositions similar to those in the upper zone, indicating a considerable contribution of groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas to the lower reach of the river. These results have implications for sustainable management of water resources in the basin during predicted changes in water usage and precipitation patterns due to climate change, as well as in regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions.

AB The use of green roofs to help mitigate storm water contributions to urban flooding has been gaining popularity but is hindered by the limited data on the performance of such roofs with regard to storm water runoff mitigation. The underlying issue stems from the inherent complexity of modeling subsurface multiphase flow. Modeling of this phenomena requires calculating the contributions of substrate microstructure characteristics, the influence of the wetting and non-wetting phases upon each other, and the effect of the microstructure on the wetting phase. Previously we have observed how the microstructure can affect detention, however the quantification of this relationship is still missing. In the present paper we present numerical simulations of wetting phase infiltration of a thin monodisperse packed bed in order to understand and quantify the impact of microstructure geometry on storm water infiltration of a green roof substrate. For a slightly hydrophilic case, (theta = 821, we find that a dominant mechanism underlying this relationship is the microstructure-induced dynamic behavior of the capillary pressure. We determine that at larger packing ratios (ratio of packed bed depth to particle size), the influence of hydraulic head diminishes and behaves conversely for thinner layers, particularly when larger pores are present. Indeed, thin beds composed of large particles can exhibit high flow velocities that in turn affect the capillary pressure within the substrate. We observe that the capillary pressure can shift from negative values denoting capillary suction to positive ones which cause valve-like blocking effects on the flow; dependent upon the flow velocity as determined by the microstructure. In particular, we find that the capillary pressure depends on the value of the pore-scale gravity-induced flow velocity, quantified through a characteristic Capillary number. The provided quantification of this relationship can be invaluable from a design perspective to understand the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of flow rates prior to testing substrate candidates. In addition, a comparison of the behavior of the dynamic component of capillary pressure to other works is undertaken. Flow homogeneity is also found to be linked to the flow velocity, and consequently to the microstructure.

AB Hydropower production is altering the Mekong River basin's riverine ecosystems, which contain the world's largest inland fishery and provide food security and livelihoods to millions of people. The basin's hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from similar to 2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to similar to 20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.

AB This contribution provides a review of the most recent wavelet applications in the field of earth sciences and is devoted to introducing and illustrating new wavelet analysis methods in the field of hydrology. Wavelet analysis remains unknown in the field of hydrology even though it clearly overcomes the well-known limits of the classical Fourier analysis. New wavelet-based tools are proposed to hydrologists in order to make wavelet analysis more attractive. First, a multiresolution continuous wavelet analysis method is shown to significantly improve the determination of the temporal-scale structure of a given signal. Second, the concept of wavelet entropy in both continuous and multiresolution frameworks is introduced allowing for an estimation of the temporal evolution of a given hydrological or climatologic signal's complexity. New insights in the scale-dependence of the relationship are exposed by introducing wavelet cross-correlation and wavelet coherence. Continuous wavelet cross-correlation provides a time-scale distribution of the correlation between two signals, whereas continuous wavelet coherence provides a qualitative estimator of the temporal evolution of the degree of linearity of the relationship between two signals on a given scale. These methods are applied to four large river runoffs and two global climatic indexes in a companion paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL; TIME
AB One hundred years chronological water level fluctuations for Chapala Lake, a shallow tropical lake in west Mexico, as well as their relationships with air temperature fluctuations, precipitation and Lerma River discharge are examined in this study. It is shown, that these relationships were strongly revealed in the last 1997-98 El Nino, which caused anomalous air temperature and evaporation increase throughout Western Mexico territory and, as a consequence, I m downturn of the Chapala lake level since January till June, 1998. To investigate 1997-1998 El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO 1997-98) AVHRR-NOAA satellite image analysis of the Chapala Lake surface water temperature (LCST) was performed. These images provide a temperature database for 1996-99 (38 months). Analysis of annual and seasonal LCST fluctuations was carried out using monthly averages for this period. Time series analysis on the LCST data suggest that seasonal surface temperature variations may be almost completely obscured by the annual harmonic. In 1998 the temperature pattern was altered due to the El Nino 1997-98 episode. In winter the water surface temperature was on average almost 1 degreesC lower than the temperature values registered in 1996. However, for the summer and autumn of 1998, such temperatures were 1.5 degrees? higher in comparison with the reference year of 1996. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Riparian zones are considered potential hotspots of denitrification because they allow for the confluence of necessary electron acceptors (nitrate) and donors (carbon) via hydrologic flowpaths in low oxygen (reducing) conditions. While riparian areas have received considerable research attention, other soils prone to saturation have similar physicochemical characteristics but are less frequently studied. We quantified in situ denitrification rates in the shallow saturated zone, a dynamic portion of the landscape, across a range of hydroperiodicities, i.e., frequencies and durations of saturated conditions, as characterized by a topographic index in a small mixed land-use headwater catchment in central New York State. We found a strong positive relationship between topographic index and denitrification, indicating that the highest rates of denitrification occur in the relatively small portion of the landscape prone to saturation. We used the resulting relationship to distribute denitrification rates across the catchment and estimate denitrification fluxes from the shallow saturated zone. While the highest rates of denitrification were observed in wetter portions of the landscape, including riparian zones, we found that the shallow saturated zone beneath drier upland soils contributed to a larger portion of whole-catchment denitrification due to a larger areal extent. A topographic index-denitrification model is a promising and simple tool that allows for scaling of in situ denitrification rates across the landscape and provides insight into the spatial organization of denitrification at the catchment scale.

AB This study analyzed the relationships between groundwater specific capacity (SPC) and its related hydrological factors to assess the sensitivity of each factor and map the regional groundwater potential for the area of Pohang City, Korea, using a geographic information system (GIS) and a probability model. All related factors including topography, geology, lineament, and soil data were collected and entered into a spatial database. SPC data were collected from well locations, and SPC values of >= 6.25 m(3)/d/m, corresponding to a yield of 500 m(3)/d, were input to a spatial database. SPC data were then randomly selected in a 66/34 ratio to train and validate the model. A frequency-ratio model and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the relationships between SPC and its related factors and the importance of SPC-related factors. Sensitivity analysis allows for comparison of the combined effects of all factors except for one. The validation of the groundwater potential map overlain by all factors showed 77.78% accuracy. In the sensitivity analysis, the best accuracy was obtained by omitting ground elevation data (78.64%), and the worst accuracy resulted when soil texture was not included (76.64%). The results show that soil texture had the greatest effect on the groundwater potential and ground elevation had the least effect. Such information and the maps generated from it can be applied to groundwater management and groundwater resource exploration. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between the color (measured with Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper sensors in bands 1, 2, and 3) of St. Lawrence River (SLR) water and water levels (in SLR and Lake Ontario) was first analyzed, followed by the analysis of the relationship between water levels and four climate indices for the period from 1984 to 2009. Although there is a statistically significant relationship between these first two variables, this link depends on the strength of two factors: the type of color (band) and inflows from tributaries. Bands 1 (blue) and 2 (green) were negatively correlated with water levels. This correlation, however, is spatially influenced by water inflows from tributaries. Band 3 (red) showed no significant correlation with either water level. Over the same period, water levels were negatively correlated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation index. Results suggest that the color of waters in the SLR may be used as an indicator to monitor environmental and climate changes in its watershed.

ID AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; BASEFLOW RECESSION; PHOSPHORUS; STRATEGIES
AB Automated sample collection for water quality research and evaluation generally is performed by simple time-paced or flow-weighted sampling protocols. However, samples collected on strict time-paced or flow-weighted schemes may not adequately capture all elements of storm event hydrographs (i.e., rise, peak, and recession). This can result in inadequate information for calculating chemical mass flux over storm events. In this research, an algorithm was developed to guide automated sampling of hydrographs based on storm-specific information. A key element of the new "hydrograph-specific sampling scheme" is the use of a hydrograph recession model for predicting the hydrograph recession curve, during which flow-paced intervals are calculated for scheduling the remaining samples. The algorithm was tested at a tile drained Midwest agricultural site where real-time flow data were processed by a programmable datalogger that in turn activated an automated sampler at the appropriate sampling times to collect a total of twenty samples during each storm event independent of the number of sequential hydrographs generated. The utility of the algorithm was successfully tested with hydrograph data collected at both a tile drain and agricultural ditch, suggesting the potential for general applicability of the method. This sampling methodology is flexible in that the logic can be adapted for use with any hydrograph recession model; however, in this case a power law equation proved to be the most practical model.

TI On the viscosity of natural hyper-saline solutions and its importance:

AB The relationship between the density, temperature and viscosity of hypersaline solutions, both natural and synthetic, is explored. An empirical equation of the density viscosity relationship as a function of temperature was developed for the Dead Sea brine and its dilutions. The viscosity levels of the Dead Sea brine (density of 1.24.10(3) kg/m(3); viscosity of 3.6 mPa s at 20 degrees C) and of the more extremely saline natural brine (density of 1.37.10(3) kg/m(3)) were found to be similar to 3 and similar to 10 times greater than that of fresh water, respectively. The combined effect of the above changes in viscosity and density on the hydraulic conductivity is reduction by a factor of 3-7. The chemical composition significantly affects the viscosity of brines with similar densities, whereby solutions with a higher Mg/Na ratio have higher viscosity. This explains the extremely high viscosity of the Dead Sea and related Mg-rich brines in comparison with the much lower values of NaCl and KCl brines with similar density. Possible impacts of the results include reduced settling velocity of grains in hypersaline viscous brines and changing hydraulic dynamics at the freshwater saltwater and the vicinity of sinkholes.

AB Three models are developed for the estimation of water quality mean values at ungauged sites. The first model is based on artificial neural networks (ANN), the second model is based on ensemble ANN (EANN) and the third model is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and EANN. The ANN and EANN models are developed to establish the functional relationship between water quality mean values and basin attributes. In the CCA-based EANN model, CCA is used to form a canonical attributes space using data from gauged sites. Then, an EANN is applied to identify the functional relationships between water quality mean values and the attributes in the CCA space. Four water quality variables are selected as output of these models. Variable selection is based on principal component analysis. The water quality variables which showed the highest loading factors in the first four components are selected. The three models are applied to 50 subcatchments in the Nile Delta, Egypt. A jackknife validation procedure is used to evaluate the performance of the three models. The results show that the EANN model provides better generalization ability than the ANN. However, the CCA-based EANN model performed better than the other two models in terms of prediction accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Real world reservoir operations are usually not fully automatic based on computer models; instead, reservoir operators conduct the operations based on their experiences, professional justification, as well as modeling support. In this paper, we propose a human-machine interactive method, namely Real-time Optimization Model Enhanced by Data Assimilation (ROMEDA) tested with simple but reasonable rules for direct interaction between operators and a computer model for reservoirs which have complex storage and stage relations (e.g. long and narrow reservoirs). ROMEDA couples 1) an optimization model to search for optimal releases, 2) a reservoir storage-stage simulation and data assimilation schedule to update the storage based on real-time reservoir stage observations, and 3) reservoir operators' choices based on the optimization model solutions, as well as their experiences, knowledge, and behaviors. For every time period and based on the updated storage, ROMEDA provides optimal releases as recommendations and adopts actual releases made by operators. ROMEDA does not assume that operators strictly accept the recommendations, and the storage will be updated based on the actual release at each time period via a data assimilation procedure, which plays a key linkage between human and machine in ROMEDA. Via a case study on-channel reservoir, it is found that for both small and large flood events, ROMEDA, which integrates the advantages of both machine and human, shows better performance on flood risk mitigation and water use (hydropower) benefit than the case with historical operation records (HOR) or optimization with single/multi-objective. ROMEDA is one of the first attempts of a human-machine interactive method for online use of an optimization model for real-time reservoir operation based on integrated modeling, observation, and operators' choice.

AB This paper presents a set of fractional Boussinesq equations (fBEs) for groundwater flow in confined and unconfined aquifers and demonstrates the application of one of the fBEs for groundwater discharges known as recession curves. The fBEs are formulated with two-term distributed fractional orders in time and symmetrical fractional derivatives (SFD) in space applicable to both confined and unconfined aquifers. The SFD in theory consists of the forward fractional derivative (FFD) and the backward fractional derivative (BFD). The FFD represents the forward movement of water along the direction of mainstream flow while the BFD accounts for the backward motion of water in the direction opposite to the mainstream flow. The backward flow at the pore level can be referred to as the micro-scale backwater effect. The analogue of the backwater effect on a micro-scale using the BFD coincides with the wandering processes based on the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) theory which results in the fractional governing equation. With the analytical solutions of the fBE for given initial and boundary conditions of the first type for a finite depth, a set of formulae for groundwater recession has been derived using approximate solutions of the fBE. The examples of the applications of the recession curves are graphically illustrated and the effects of the orders of fractional derivatives on the geometry of the flow curves examined.

AB Soil and water conservation practices are increasingly being considered for curbing non-point source pollution from agricultural land. Several studies have demonstrated that stream power is a simple and good predictor of soil detachment and transport and can be used to predict the effect of soil and water conservation practices on soil loss. Our objective was, therefore, to develop a simple water erosion simulation model that is physically based on stream power, handles vegetation in terms of contact cover, and considers the settling velocity characteristics of the eroding sediment. The model assumes that rill flow can occur on hillslope segments with net erosion, but on segments with net deposition sheet flow is assumed. Input parameters include the depositability of the soil, rill shape, rill density, net precipitation, and an empirical power function describing the decrease of sediment concentration with vegetative cover increase. The model was evaluated by comparison of predicted and observed relationships between sediment concentration, slope, and vegetative residue cover in two experimental studies using simulated rainfall: one that involved erosion plots with various uniform slopes and levels of vegetative cover, and another that involved the observation of soil movement on mechanically shaped concave, uniform, and convex slopes with negligible vegetation. Without calibration, the model appeared to represent soil erosion relationships observed in these studies and is simple enough to be included in grid-based variable source hydrology models.

AB Overland flow is often only a few millimetres deep. Consequently, the potential for raindrop impact to affect flow hydraulics and sediment transport is high. Furthermore, the relative importance of rainfall impact is highest for shallow low-energy flows on low slopes. In such flows net sediment deposition may occur. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to study sediment deposition in the presence of rainfall over a range of hydraulic conditions. In order to investigate the impact of raindrops on sediment deposition by overland flow, these experimental data were compared to the experimental data collected in the absence of raindrop impact. Comparison of the experimental data shows that raindrop impact retards the flow velocity and has a clear positive effect on sediment delivery. Under rainfall significantly more coarse sediment is transported over areas of net sediment deposition. Subsequently, the experimental results are used to evaluate a multi-class net deposition theory, describing sediment transport and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition in the presence of both raindrop impact and flow-driven processes. The multi-class theory is calibrated using part of the experimental data. Evaluation of the model predictions using the other part of the data shows that the optimised model is able to accurately predict sediment delivery and sediment sorting over areas of net deposition.

AB This study derived the Flood-Inducing-Rainfall (FIR) and Flood-Inducing-Runoff (FIRO) for urban flood warning. For this, we derived a relationship between the watershed time of concentration and accumulated rainfall depth for 261 flood events at 239 watersheds of Seoul with areas between 0.5 and 6.8 km(2) during the years 2010 and 2011, based on 10-minute 1 beta x 1 km radar-gauge composite rainfall field. This relationship was further categorized by discrete ranges of the proportion of the flooded area in the watershed (FP) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the rainfall time series. Then, minimum possible rainfall intensity calculated for each of the classified depth-duration relationship was determined as FIR for the specified range of FP and CV. A similar methodology was applied to derive FIRO, which used runoff depths that were estimated using the NRCS Curve Number method. We found that the FIR and FIRO varied between 37-62 and 10-41 mm/h, respectively. FIR and FIRO increase with an increase in FP, suggesting that greater rainfall causes larger flooded area. As rainfall CV increases, FIR and FIRO decrease, suggesting that the temporally concentrated rainfall requires less rainfall to cause the flood. A flood warning system that checks the accumulated rainfall at each of the 239 Seoul watersheds every 10 min was developed to verify the FIR and FIRO against the 21 flood events that occurred between 2012 and 2015. When flooding was tolerated on 5 percent of the watershed area, the ratios of hit, miss, and false alarm of the warning system based on the accumulated rainfall was 44.2, 9.5, and 55.8%, respectively. The ratios of hit, miss, and false alarm of the warning system based on the runoff was 66.7, 4.7, and 33.3% respectively. The flood warning system based on gauge-only or radar-only data gives approximately 3 times as much false warnings compared with the system based on radar-gauge composite data. Also, the warning system that does not consider rainfall temporal variability gave approximately twice as much false warnings as the system that considered temporal variability.

AB The magnitude of sediment yield following forest timber harvest is controlled by increases in both sediment supply and streamflow. Since the relation between sediment transport and streamflow typically follows a power law, small increases in streamflow may translate into large increases in sediment transport. Interpreting the geomorphic effects of streamflow increases is confounded by the fact that timber harvest influences both the hydrologic regime and sediment supply of a watershed simultaneously, making it difficult to isolate the streamflow effect alone. Here we report on a novel approach to this problem using long-term data from two paired catchments located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. We use observed streamflow from the treated (clearcut) and control watersheds to reconstruct a natural streamflow time series for the treated watershed, one that represents streamflow response in conditions prior to harvest. We combine this reconstructed natural streamflow time series with observed relations between streamflow and sediment transport to quantify the background sediment yield and disentangle the relative effects of changes in hydrology and sediment supply. Results indicate that while increases in streamflow can account for modest increases in sediment transport, this is dwarfed by the increased supply of sediment that accompanies most timber harvest. These results have broad relevance to forest timber harvest and fuel management practices worldwide and can be used to constrain or set bounds on likely effects of more modest (i.e., thinning) techniques.

AB To understand the sediment delivery variation for a Himalayan Glacier (Gangotri Glacier, Garhwal Himalayas) and to determine its relationship with discharge and air temperature, suspended sediment samples and discharge data were collected near the glacier snout (4000 m) for four melt seasons during the period 2000-2003. These data were used to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC, suspended sediment load (SSL), sediment yield and erosion rate in the glacier melt stream (Bhagirathi). The monthly distribution of suspended sediment and its variability from year to year have been examined. Mean monthly SSC for May, June, July, August, September and October were found to be 1942, 2063, 3658, 2551, 734 and 136 mg l(-1), respectively. Maximum SSC in meltwater was observed in July followed by August. It was found that the cumulative percentage delivery of SSC precedes discharge throughout the melt season. Mean monthly total SSL for May, June, July, August, September and October during the study period was found to be 149, 423, 1220, 746, 143 and 5 X 103 ton, respectively. The strong variability is found in SSL (C-v = 1.1) than SSC (C-v=0.8) because computation of SSL includes both discharge (C-v=0.6) and SSC. Delivery response of SSL in terms of percentage of total load is less in the early part of the melt season than in the later stage in comparison to that of discharge. This may be due to the fact that in the beginning of the melt season low melt rate conditions prevails and thus, the low discharge velocity could not flush out stored glacial sediment. It has been observed that 59-64% of the sediment passed through the channel by the time 50% of the total discharge passed. The average suspended sediment yield for the whole melt season from the study area was estimated to be about 4834 ton km(-2) and corresponding erosion rate was 1.8 mm. The relationship between mean monthly SSC and discharge (R-2 = 0.99) is much better than the daily SSC and discharge (R-2=0.40) because variability of both parameters is averaged-out on monthly scale. Mean monthly SSC and mean monthly SSL provide a good exponential relationship with mean monthly air temperature. These results are relevant for planning and management of water resources in the high altitude areas and for designing hydropower projects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERMAFROST; GROUNDWATER; HYDROLOGY; THAW
AB Due to polar amplification of climate change, high latitudes are warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world. This warming leads to permafrost thawing, which increases the thickness of the overlying active layer and modifies the subsurface hydrologic regime of the draining watershed, therefore affecting baseflow to surface water and modifying recession characteristics. The active layer thickening and the subsurface flow modification are assumed to be linearly correlated. The objective of this study is to test this assumption by quantifying the correlation between the temporal evolution of hydrologic parameters (recession slope and initial recession outflow) and 11 controlling factors (all linked to surface, subsurface and climatic conditions) for 336 Arctic catchments from 1970 to 2000. Contrary to previous studies, we demonstrate a clear decrease in recession slope and initial recession outflow over 1970-2000 for a majority of catchments at any significance level. We explain this result by identifying high topography and low permafrost extent as controlling factors that complexify the relationship between trends in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution. The study goes further by identifying the mechanisms behind the complexification of the relationship: permafrost-extent loss, hydrologic-connectivity increase, flow-path-diversity increase, contributing drainage area multiplication. The novel aspect of the study lay behind the large number of studied catchments and the large range of controlling factors tested.

AB The stage-discharge relationship or rating curve at a river cross-section is a fundamental technique in hydrology employed for determining discharge from catchments. While river cross-sections are inherently variable, it generally takes quite some time for a change in cross-section to occur. Thus, where good quality data on stage and discharge are available, a stable and representative rating curve may be established. However, all too often, the natural variability is aggravated by data errors of human origin. These measurement errors occur because the routine of periodic flow measurement may be undertaken by ill-trained personnel. Such errors resulting from this practice may lead to erroneous estimates of available water resources. This study discusses the derivation of a single rating curve for the Okavango River at Mohembo from measurements containing errors and outliers. It uses data transformation procedures, regression techniques and removal of outliers to derive a useful rating curve from suspect data. Finally, it investigates the possibility of fitting a stochastic model to the discharge series. The results suggest that it may be possible to estimate missing data with an ARIMA model.

AB Usually, networks of daily rainfall raingauges have a higher spatial cover than tippet bucket raingauges networks. Consequently, it would be of high interest to make use of daily rainfall information to asses IDF curves for unobserved locations. The present work proposes achieving this goal by using the assumption of simple scaling invariance. Indeed, series observed over sufficiently long periods for 10 tippet bucket raingauge, allowed us to test the hypothesis of simple scaling of annual maximum rainfall intensities in northern Tunisia. This assumption, combined with Gumbel model of maximum rainfall intensities allowed us to develop a methodology to estimate IDF curves from the daily rainfall totals. In fact, a regionalization formula which involves the percentile 9094 of the annual maximum daily rainfall was developed and validated. This regionalization formula applied to daily data of 25 rainfall stations in the sub area of Tunis region, combined with the assumption of simple scaling has enabled us to develop Intensity Duration Area Frequency (IDAF) curves for Tunis area.

AB Five modeling strategies are employed to analyze water level time series of six lakes with different physical characteristics such as shape, size, altitude and range of variations. The models comprise chaos theory, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - treated for seasonality and hence SARIMA, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Each is formulated on a different premise with different underlying assumptions. Chaos theory is elaborated in a greater detail as it is customary to identify the existence of chaotic signals by a number of techniques (e.g. average mutual information and false nearest neighbors) and future values are predicted using the Nonlinear Local Prediction (NLP) technique. This paper takes a critical view of past inter-comparison studies seeking a superior performance, against which it is reported that (i) the performances of all five modeling strategies vary from good to poor, hampering the recommendation of a clear-cut predictive model; (ii) the performances of the datasets of two cases are consistently better with all five modeling strategies; (iii) in other cases, their performances are poor but the results can still be fit-for-purpose; (iv) the simultaneous good performances of NLP and SARIMA pull their underlying assumptions to different ends, which cannot be reconciled. A number of arguments are presented including the culture of pluralism, according to which the various modeling strategies facilitate an insight into the data from different vantages.

ID SLOPING AQUIFER; CONSTANT RECHARGE; CAPE-COD; GROUNDWATER
AB We consider the response of a deep unconfined horizontal aquifer to steady, annual, and monthly recharge. A groundwater divide and a zero head reservoir constrain the aquifer, so that sinusoidal monthly and aperiodic annual recharge fluctuations create transient specific discharge near the reservoir and an unsteady water table elevation inland. One existing and two new long-term data sets from the Plymouth-Carver Aquifer in southeastern Massachusetts calibrate and confirm hydraulic properties in a set of analytical models. [Geohydrology and simulated groundwater flow, 1992] data and a new power law for tritiugenic helium to tritium ratios calibrate the steady recharge that drives the classical parabolic model of steady hydraulics [Applied Hydrogeology, 2001]. Observed water table and gradient fluctuations calibrate the transient recharge models. In the latter regard. monitoring wells within I km of Buttermilk Bay exhibit appreciable specific discharge and reduced water table fluctuations. We apply [Trans Am Geophys Union 32(1951)238] periodic model to the monthly hydraulics and a recharge convolution integral [J Hydrol 126(1991)315] to annual flow. An infiltration fraction of 0.79 and a consumptive use coefficient of 1.08 x 10(-s) m/s degreesC relate recharge to precipitation and daylight weighted temperature across all three time scales. Errors associated with this recharge relation decrease with increasing time scale. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new laboratory dataset on the moisture-pressure relationship above a dispersive groundwater wave in a two-dimensional vertical unconfined sand flume aquifer driven by simple harmonic forcing. A total of five experiments were conducted in which all experimental parameters were kept constant except for the oscillation period, which ranged from 268 s to 2449 s between tests. Moisture content and suction head sensor pairings were co-located at two locations in the unsaturated zone both approximately 0.2 m above the mean watertable elevation and respectively 0.3 m and 0.75 m from the driving head boundary. For all oscillation periods except for the shortest (T = 268 s), the formation of a hysteretic moisture-pressure scanning loop was observed. Consistent with the decay of the saturated zone groundwater wave, the size of the observed moisture-pressure scanning loops decayed with increasing distance landward and the decay rate is larger for the shorter oscillation periods. At the shortest period (T = 268 s), the observed moisture-pressure relationship was observed to be non hysteretic but with a capillary capacity that differs from that of the static equilibrium wetting and drying curves. This finding is consistent with observations from existing one-dimensional vertical sand column experiments. The relative damping of the moisture content with distance landward is higher than that for the suction head consistent with the fact that transmission of pressure through a porous medium occurs more readily than mass transfer. This is further supported by the fact that observed phase lags for the unsaturated zone variables (i.e. suction head and moisture content) relative to the driving head are greater than the saturated zone variables (i.e. piezometric head). Harmonic analysis of the data reveals no observable generation of higher harmonics in either moisture or pressure despite the strongly nonl-inear relationship between the two. In addition, a phase lag of moisture content relative to the suction head was observed indicating that the response time of the moisture content to watertable motion is greater than that of the pore water pressure. The observed moisture-pressure dynamics are qualitatively reproduced using a hysteretic Richards' equation model. However, quantitative differences exist which are likely to be due to previous findings that demonstrated that the Richards' equation model is unable to accurately reproduce the observed watertable wave dispersion, particularly at shorter period oscillations.

AB The relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 in precipitation at a site, known as the local meteoric water line (LMWL), is normally defined using an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR). However, it has been argued that this form of minimisation is more appropriate when a predictive model is being developed (and there are no measurement errors associated with the independent variable) and that orthogonal regression, also known as major axis regression (MA), or reduced major axis regression (RMA) may be better suited when a relationship is being sought between two variables which are related by underlying physical processes.
   The slope of the LMWLs for the GNIP data is examined using the three linear regressions, and the corresponding precipitation weighted regressions. The MA and RMA regressions generally produced larger slopes, with the largest differences for oceanic islands and coastal sites. The difference between the various methods was the least for continental sites. In all considered cases, both for the standard and precipitation weighted regressions, the slope produced by RMA was in between those determined by OLSR and MA, with OLSR producing the smaller slope. Further, the results of both RMA and precipitation weighted RMA were less sensitive to the removal of outliers and values with high leverage statistic.
   The results indicate that when a good linear relationship exists between delta H-2 and delta O-18, all considered regressions result in a close fit. When the values are distributed within circles or ellipses on the delta O-18-delta H-2 bivariate plot, as would appear in coastal and oceanic sites from first stage rainout, care needs to be taken as to which regression is utilised. However, in some of these cases, it appears the precipitation weighted MA (and in some cases MA) produces large slopes. In these cases the average Root Mean Sum of Squared Error (rmSSE(av)) value of the fit can be used as a guide of the suitability of the MA and PWMA for each site. Where the slope of the PWRMA was significantly different to the slope of the OLSR regression (22% of sites; dominated by coastal, island and Mediterranean locations), we believe PWRMA is more suitable.

AB Previous studies show that the flow velocity profile is S-shaped for low submergence flows in gravel bed streams. As a consequence, the power or logarithmic flow resistance equations cannot be theoretically deduced for a low submergence flow. In this study, the mixing layer analogy, in an accurate and innovative way, is applied to express the flow resistance in gravel-bed streams. Laboratory experiments over 12 uniform gravel-bed runs, the relative submerged height ranging from 2.6 to 4.6, are used to determine the physical rationality and accuracy of the analogy that statistical flow turbulent properties are closer to typical values in the mixing layer than in the surface layer. The key parameters of shear strength L-s applied by an incomplete self-similarity analysis for the dimensionless groups and difference coefficient C-u defined as the ratio of velocity at the reference level to shear velocity deduced by the simplified Darcy-Forchheimer-Brinkman equation are expressed and tested using experimental data. The new approach is further underpinned by using 104 field measured reaches located in 40 different natural streams, which adds to the more widely-ranged field data with the relative submerged height ranging from 0.9 to 20. The analysis shows that the flow layer subdivisions theoretical approach, based on the multivariable mixing layer analogy and optimized Katul law characterized by the lowest Root-Mean Square Error, relative error, and closest-1 Nash-Sutcliffe Index, has potential in future research.

AB The development of run-of-river hydropower requires the flow duration curve (FDC) to estimate the electricity production. As obtaining an FDC based on gauging station streamflow requires significant cost and time (i.e., more than several years), it is important to predict the FDC in the absence of streamflow data. An analytical probabilistic model of streamflow dynamics (p(Q) model) can calculate the FDC, which requires several rainfall and runoff recession parameters. To estimate the recession parameters in the absence of discharge data, we selected two approaches: the geomorphic recession flow model (GRFM) and geological recession approach (GRA). The GRFM and GRA associate the river network and geology, respectively, with runoff recession features. This study aims to comprehend the characteristics of the GRFM and GRA employed in the p(Q) model by targeting 57 basins throughout Japan. We found different performance trends between the GRFM and GRA that corresponded to specific basin characteristics. While the GRFM performed well in high precipitation basins, the GRA performed well in basins with abundant unconfined groundwater contributions. These results agree with the features in the derivations of the GRFM and GRA. In addition, we found a complementary relationship between the GRFM and GRA based on the baseflow index (BFI), which suggests that the complementary relationship is one method to improve the performance of the p(Q) model in the absence of streamflow data.

AB In this paper we present a semi-parametric multivariate gap-filling model for tower-based measurement of latent heat flux (LE). Two statistical techniques, the principal component analysis (PCA) and a nonlinear interpolation approach were integrated into this LE gap-filling model. The PCA was first used to resolve the multicollinearity relationships among various environmental variables, including radiation, soil moisture deficit, leaf area index, wind speed, etc. Two nonlinear interpolation methods, multiple regressions (MRS) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) were examined with random selected flux gaps for both clear sky and nighttime/cloudy data to incorporate into this LE gap-filling model. Experimental results indicated that the KNN interpolation approach is able to provide consistent LE estimations while MRS presents over estimations during nighttime/cloudy. Rather than using empirical regression parameters, the KNN approach resolves the nonlinear relationship between the gap-filled LE flux and principal components with adaptive K values under different atmospheric states. The developed LE gap-filling model (PCA with KNN) works with a RMSE of 2.4 W m(-2) (similar to 0.09 mm day(-1)) at a weekly time scale by adding 40% artificial flux gaps into original dataset. Annual evapotranspiration at this study site were estimated at 736 mm (1803 MJ) and 728 mm (1785 MJ) for year 2008 and 2009, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) provides more than 50 % of freshwater for the Yellow River. Recent research reveals continuous climatic wetting and vegetation greening over the UYRB in a warming future, but future hydrological drought changes remain unclear due to complex interactions between climate change, land cover change and reservoir operations. Here we project hydrological drought changes at different global warming levels and quantify contributions from each driving factor. The Conjunctive Surface-Subsurface Process eco-hydrological model is coupled with a reservoir module, and the new CSSPv2 + Reservoir model is used to perform future projections driven by bias-corrected meteorological forcings from 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. The CSSPv2 + Reservoir model simulates monthly streamflow over the UYRB reasonably well with a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.75. The increasing precipitation during dry seasons reduces hydrological drought duration by 9 %/12 %/19 % at the 1.5 degrees C/2.0 degrees C/4.0 degrees C warming level, while its impact on drought severity is limited. The dramatic increase of leaf area index at the 4.0 degrees C warming level robustly exacerbates hydrological drought severity to 28 % by intensifying evapotranspiration. The reservoir operation, designed to reduce seasonality in monthly releases to ensure stable hydropower generation, further decreases drought duration, but increases drought frequency and severity to 63 %/48 %/108 % and 9 %/11 %/32 % at the 1.5 degrees C/2.0 degrees C/4.0 degrees C warming levels respectively. A mitigated operation rule which stores less water during wet seasons, however, can reduce hydrological drought severity and duration significantly. Thus, future reservoir operations should pay more attention to the trade-off between hydropower generation and hydrological drought mitigation.

AB In recent years, uncertainties in climate change have made the allocation of waste load a severe challenge. This research develops a new model framework integrating a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) for hydrological simulation of the river basin, Borg many-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA) for optimization, and a software for many-objective robust decision making (OpenMORDM) to minimize these uncertainties and identifying the most robust waste load allocation plans resisting the impact of system uncertainties. This framework has been applied to the Golgol River basin, Iran, which is the main source of the Ilam dam water supply. In this study, first, temperature and precipitation were predicted in 2080-2099. Then, The SWAT model was used to simulate runoff and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Afterward, by specifying the objective functions, the Borg MOEA produced the most optimal waste load allocation scenarios in the driest month of the future (August), So that the amount of BOD in the dam reservoir remains less than 5 mg/L. In the next step, the robustness of the solutions analyzed using OpenMORDM. Then, the results were analyzed using the patient rule induction method (PRIM) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods to identify the system vulnerability domains and minimizing false positives. Through the analysis, four climate scenarios have been used to explain how the methodological selection of them affects the resulting candidate planning solutions. The results indicated that individual design selections from the water managers or researchers could influence the efficacy of the model framework, which in turn results in failure of the most robust waste-load allocation strategies under future climate change.

AB Lakes and reservoirs affect the timing and magnitude of streamflow, and are therefore essential hydrological model components, especially in the context of global flood forecasting. However, the parameterization of lake and reservoir routines on a global scale is subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of information on lake hydrographic characteristics and reservoir operating rules. In this study we estimated the effect of lakes and reservoirs on global daily streamflow simulations of a spatially distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. We applied state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for selected catchments to examine the effect of uncertain lake and reservoir parameterization on model performance. Streamflow observations from 390 catchments around the globe and multiple performance measures were used to assess model performance.
   Results indicate a considerable geographical variability in the lake and reservoir effects on the stream flow simulation. Nash -Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling -Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics improved for 65% and.38% of catchments respectively, with median skill score values of 0.16 and 0.2 while scores deteriorated for 28% and 52% of the catchments, with median values -0.09 and -0.16, respectively. The effect of reservoirs on extreme high flows was substantial and widespread in the global domain, while the effect of lakes was spatially limited to a few catchments. As indicated by global sensitivity analysis, parameter uncertainty substantially affected uncertainty of model performance. Reservoir parameters often contributed to this uncertainty, although the effect varied widely among catchments. The effect of reservoir parameters on model performance diminished with distance downstream of reservoirs in favor of other parameters, notably groundwater-related parameters and channel Manning's roughness coefficient. This study underscores the importance of accounting for lakes and, especially, reservoirs and using appropriate parameterization in large-scale hydrological simulations. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Many processes in the Earth's crust are controlled by the chemical and physical interactions between fluids and geological media where the lattice is usually characterised by a heterogeneous permeability, intrinsic rock permeability and fault networks. Dissolution/precipitation of rock minerals and chemical transport can alter the rock properties. which leads to a change in the flow characteristics and alteration of the geological media with time. In this article, we propose a novel method for modelling heterogeneous reactive transport with a feedback between the flow and chemical alterations. To model fluid flow, we use a modified lattice Boltzmann scheme which facilitates the incorporation of complex boundary conditions and enables us to examine flow in heterogeneous media. In addition, the local update rules of this scheme allow the code to be parallelised on multiple processors. We have coupled transport of chemical species and reactive flow to this scheme using a solution to the advection-diffusion equation. Experimentally derived dissolution/precipitation rates are used to calculate rates of interaction between minerals and the fluids with which they are in contact. Laboratory scale passive and reactive flow-cell experiments from the literature have been used to test and validate the accuracy of the transport of the chemical species in a heterogeneous porous medium. We have also examined the output of our scheme for water-rock interactions in a quartzofeldspathic lithology for relatively long periods of geological time. We have focused on quartz and feldspar reactive flow with associated secondary clay minerals, as these are some of the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust. In all cases, the numerical results agree well with the experimental results from our numerical scheme. The scheme also reproduces alteration of a quartzofeldspathic lithology over geological time periods, consistent with other numerical work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The research presents a multisite annual streamflow generation model that combines the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), for determining the temporal structure, with copulas, for modelling the spatial dependence joint distributions. The performance of the GLM-Copula model was verified by comparing its ability to preserve historical features and simulate drought events with the multivariate auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model and the copula autoregressive (COPAR) model. The statistical measures adopted for the models' performance evaluation include summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and skewness coefficient), temporal and spatial correlation, simulation of drought conditions (maximum number of years under drought condition) and copula entropy as a nonlinear measure of total association. The combined GLM-Copula model's main advantages are that (i) it does not require data normalization; ii) it allows the modelling of the dependence structures with different probability functions; and (iii) it is capable of representing non-conventional parsimonious autocorrelation functions. The ability of the GLM-Copula approach to preserve the summary statistics from the historical data was similar to both benchmark models. However, the GLM-Copula was considerably better in reproducing the longest drought duration that was underestimated by the ARMA model and was better in reproducing the copula entropy than both benchmark models. The approach is proposed in its simplest form but can be easily upgraded by combining GLMs with numerical data or extended to predict future streamflow with the incorporation of exogenous climate variables that affect streamflow. The proposed model may be useful in future studies/applications where data normalization jeopardizes the replication of data or/and in drought dependent stochastic applications, like the definition of optimal operation rules of a perennial reservoir system or long-term hydropower dispatch.

AB Floods are generally considered to be the most common natural disaster worldwide. Climate change and human activity are two key driving factors of flood formation, and it is difficult to determine how to quantitatively detect their relative impacts on flood susceptibility. As an important non-engineering measure of preventing floods and reducing losses, flood susceptibility assessment is a synthetic task that involves many factors. In this study, the flood susceptibility in Guangdong Province, China, was assessed based on a cloud model. The relative impacts of climate change and human activity on flood susceptibility were also quantitatively investigated from the spatial perspective. The results prove that the cloud model is a feasible, reasonable, and effective method for flood susceptibility assessment. Approximately 40% of the studied areas have changed their flood susceptibility level since 1985 due to the comprehensive impacts of climate change and human activity, of which about 56.3% converted from a low to high level, and 43.7% from a high to low level. About 35.7% of the areas changed their susceptibility level due to climate change, of which 55.8% converted from a low to high level and 44.2% from a high to low level. In contrast, only 9.8% of the areas changed the susceptibility level due to human activity, of which 57.2% converted from a low to high level and 42.8% from a high to low level. Generally, from the spatial perspective, climate change has a larger impact on flood susceptibility than human activity. This study aims to provide a novel idea to quantitatively detect the relative impacts of climate change and human activity on flood susceptibility from spatial perspective; the findings of this study are also expected to enhance the understanding on distribution rule of flood susceptibility in Guangdong Province and are conducive to taking targeted measures to reduce the flood risk.

AB Conflicting approaches to water governance at multiple scales within large international river basins may have detrimental effects on the productivity of water resources and consequently the economic activities of the basin. In the Indus River Basin, local scale water productivity decisions are affected by international and intra-national scale water governance. Water availability and productivity is modulated by the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and within Pakistan by the agreements governing water allocation between and within provinces. Much of the literature on governance at multiple scales in the Indus basin, and others, has employed qualitative methods of institutional analysis. This paper extends that approach with quantitative modeling of surface water allocation rules at multiple scales and the consequent economic impact on water use and productivity in the Indus River of Pakistan. The effects of the existing water allocation mechanisms on the ability to adapt to possible future climate conditions are examined. The study is conducted using the Indus Basin Model Revised - Multi-Year (IBMR-MY), a hydro-agro-economic model of the Indus River within Pakistan that simulates river and canal flows, groundwater pumping, water use and economic activities with a distributed, partial equilibrium model of the local scale agro-economic activities in the basin. Results suggest that without changes in response to changing conditions, the current governance mechanisms impede the provinces' ability to adapt to changing climate conditions, in ways that are significant, inflicting economic costs under both high and low flow conditions. However surface water allocation between the provinces does not appear to hinder adaptation. The greatest gains for economic water allocation are achieved at the sub-provincial level. The results imply that adaptive mechanisms for water allocation that allow response to changing climate conditions within provinces may be a promising adaptive response in the Indus Basin.

TI Dynamic control of flood limited water level for reservoir operation by
   considering inflow uncertainty
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Reservoir operation; Flood limited water level; Dynamic control; Flood
   forecasting; Inflow uncertainty; Risk analysis
ID RULES
AB According to the Chinese Flood Control Act, reservoir water levels generally are not allowed to exceed the flood limited water level (FLWL) during flood season in order to offer adequate storage for flood prevention. However, the operation rules based on the current FLWL have neglected meteorological and real-time flood forecasting information and give too much priority to low probability floods. For floodwater utilization, dynamic control of reservoir FLWL is a valuable and effective methodology to compromise between flood control and conservation for reservoir operation during the flood season. The dynamic control bound is a fundamental key element for implementing reservoir FLWL dynamic control operation. In this paper, a dynamic control operation model that considers inflow uncertainty, i.e. the inflow forecasting error and uncertainty of the flood hydrograph shape is proposed and developed. The model consists of three modules: the first one is a pre-release module, which is used to estimate the upper boundary of dynamic control bound on basis of inflow forecasting results; the second one is a refill operation module, which is used to retain recession flood, and the third one is a risk analysis module, which is used to assess flood risk. The acceptable flood control operation risk constraints and quantificational analysis methods are given, and the dynamic control bound of reservoir FLWL is estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation. The China's three gorges reservoir (TGR) is selected as a case study. A multiple-input single-output linear systematic model is chosen for inflow forecasting of the TGR, and the future inflows are derived from gauged records by assuming that the inflow forecasting error follows a normal distribution. The application results show that the dynamic control of reservoir FLWL can effectively increase hydropower generation and the floodwater utilization rate without increasing flood control risk.

AB A new numerical scheme has been proposed by Ross [Ross, P.J., 2003. Modeling soil water and solute transport-fast, simplified numerical solutions. Agronomy Journal 95, 1352-1361] to solve the ID Richards' equation [Richards, L.A., 1931. Capillary conduction of liquids through porous medium. Physics 1, 318-333]. This non-iterative solution uses the description of soil properties proposed by Brooks and Corey [Brooks, R.H., Corey, A.T., 1964. Hydraulic properties of porous media. Colorado State University, Fort Collins]. It allows the derivation of an analytical expression for the Kirchhoff potential used in the calculation of water fluxes. The degree of saturation is used as the dependent variable when the soil is unsaturated and the Kirchhoff potential is used in case of saturation. A space and time discretisation scheme leads to a tridiagonal set of linear equations that is solved non-iteratively. We propose in this paper an extensive test of this numerical method, evaluated only on a single case by Ross. The tests are conducted in two steps. First, the solution is assessed against two analytical solutions. The first one [Basha, H.A., 1999. Multidimensional linearized nonsteady infiltration with prescribed boundary conditions at the soil surface. Water Resources Research 35(l), 75-93] provides the water content profile when simplified soil characteristics such as the exponential law of Gardner [Gardner, W.R., 1958. Some steady-state solutions of the unsaturated moisture flow equations with application to evaporation from a water table. Soil Science 85, 228-232] are used. The Ross solution is compared to this solution on eight different soils that were fitted to this law. Analytical solution with the Brooks and Corey models is not available at the moment for the moisture profile but some exist for cumulative infiltration. Therefore, the second analytical solution, used in this study, is the one developed by Parlange et al. [Parlange, J.-Y., Haverkamp, R., Touma, J., 1985. Infiltration under ponded conditions: 1. Optimal analytical solution and comparison with experimental observations. Soil Science 139(4), 305-311] and Haverkamp et al. [Haverkamp, R., Parlange, J.-Y., Starr, J.L., Schmitz, G., Fuentes, C., 1990. Infiltration under ponded conditions: 3. A predictive equation based on physical parameters. Soil Science 149(5), 292-300]. The various parameters of this solution are written for the Brooks and Corey models and the cumulative infiltration calculated by the Ross solution is compared to this analytical solution.
   The second part of the test is a comparison with a reference model: the SiSPAT (Simple Soil Plant Atmosphere Transfer) model, which provides a reference iterative solution of the soil water flow equation. A wide range of simulations is performed, with various soil types (homogeneous or not), various climate forcing and several initial conditions. It allows the comparison of various variables such as deep drainage, soil moisture profile, surface ponding, and evaporation under non-uniform initial moisture content and time varying climate forcing.
   We show that the model provides robust and accurate solutions as compared with the analytical solutions and with the SiSPAT model. This study also shows that a finer discretization than the one proposed by Ross is necessary close to the soil surface to accurately model the cumulative infiltration, especially for clayey soils.

DE Phosphorus; Chemical speciation; Biogeochemical processes; Maowei Sea
AB Phosphorus (P) is an important biogenic element that limits algal growth, and influences primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling of other biogenic elements in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Surface water samples were collected along the salinity gradients from the western and eastern flanks of the Maowei Sea (MWS) during July 2018 for measurements of different P species, including dissolved nitrogen and silicate. Total dissolved P (TDP) dominated the total P (TP) accounting for 64.9 +/- 9.7% of TP, possibly due to relatively less suspended particulate matter (<100 mg/L). Among the dissolved P species, dissolved organic P (DOP) was more abundant (DOP/TDP = 58.1 +/- 20%) than dissolved inorganic P (DIP). Considering the entire dataset, the average DIP concentration (1.53 +/- 0.83 mu M) was lower to medium range, while DOP was relatively higher, compared to other estuaries and coastal waters bodies worldwide. Particulate P was mainly present as particulate inorganic P (PIP), which accounted for 68.5 +/- 9.0% of the total particulate P (TPP). The behavior of different P species along the salinity gradients indicated that their concentrations were dominantly influenced by riverine inputs and biogeochemical processes. Intensive mariculture activities in the MWS may have also contributed to elevated DOP compared to other coastal marine systems worldwide. Apart from similar sources of input and cycling processes, the stoichiometric relationship between DIP, dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and dissolved silicate (DSi) suggested that P is potentially limiting, while Si may co-limit primary productivity. The latitudinal distribution of different P species indicated that strong transformations existed between the particulate and dissolved P phases along the salinity gradients. The negative relationship between P partitioning coefficient [log(Kd)] and salinity, and with suspended particulate matter (log[SPM]) suggested that strong particle reactivity and probable competition between dissolved P with other anions for adsorption sites influenced the partitioning of P species in surface water. Additionally, the end-member binary model showed that similar to 1.24-1.55 mu M of DIP may have been removed through biological uptake. In summary, this study shows that the dynamic changes in the concentrations, spatial distribution, and transformation process of different P species between dissolved and particulate phases can effectively reveal the sources of P and understand the internal relationship between the biogeochemical cycling of P, stoichiometric status, and eutrophication.

ID DYNAMIC CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; FLOW; INFILTRATION;
   DRAINAGE
AB In recent years, more studies have been focusing on the transient behaviors of the movement of soil water and changes in matric potential, which require the measurement of the rapid changes in matric potential or capillary pressure. Because of the delayed response, the value of the matric potential measured using a tensiometer may not precisely reflect the actual matric potential during a transient condition. We performed a series of experiments to analyze the effect of grain size, effective saturation, and the hydraulic conductivities of ceramic cup and porous media on the response time of a tensiometer. The outcomes suggested that a decrease of hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic cup significantly increases the response time. Moreover, the response time measured under unsaturated conditions did not follow an ideal exponential decay. This finding was consistent with the existing theories, based on which, we proposed three models to describe the time-varied response function. These models were applied to correct the measured manic potential for dynamic water retention curve (WRC), and the findings were compared with those of other existing methods used for measuring the matric potential. We found that the incorporation of the theory of response time significantly reduced the discrepancy between the matric potential measured using two ceramic cups with different response times during dynamic drainage. We concluded that the delayed response of a tensiometer can have a significant effect on the measurement of the transient matric potential or capillary pressure and can be corrected using response time equations.

AB The flow of water in a finite soil layer is analyzed with gravity, extending an earlier non-gravitational theory. Analytical approximations are obtained to predict the outflow at the lower surface when the potentials at the upper and lower surfaces are fixed. The accuracy of the predictions is checked by comparison with numerical simulations. The solution should be of importance to infer soil properties from outflow measurements in laboratory experiments. The time when outflow first begins and the steady state flow rate are especially useful for that purpose.

AB Water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world. Water rights trading (WRT) and carbon emissions trading (CET) can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development. However, the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water-carbon nexus between sectors. To explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of WRT and CET, this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture, industry, and forestry sectors (AIFSs) to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations. Four cities in the Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) in southern China were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of WRT and CET. The results indicated that There is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the DRB on the choice of AIFS strategy, which in turn leads to better WRT that promotes the mutual coupling of AIFS strategies. In addition, strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system, and multiple markets enable AIFS to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game. Furthermore, AIFS' behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations, which has implications for us as we guide the development of WRT and CET.

AB Residence Times in aquifers result from their internal structure, from the hydrodynamic transport processes and from the recharge conditions to which they are exposed. Beyond the already known residence time distributions (RTD) for either constant aquifer thickness and/or uniform recharge, we investigate the effect of both distributed aquifer thickness and distributed recharge. We develop a semi-analytical approximation of the RTD for generic trapezoidal aquifers exposed to linearly-variable recharges. The solution is derived for a homogeneous 2D cross-sectional aquifer in steady-state conditions following the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption according to which the vertical head gradients are much smaller than the horizontal head gradients. Close agreement with 2D numerical simulations demonstrates the relevance of the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption to estimate RTDs as long as the aquifer thickness remains an order of magnitude smaller than the aquifer length. At equivalent aquifer volume, geometrical structure and recharge conditions result in non-trivial and complex RTD shapes that may be uniform, Gamma-like, power-law-like shapes as well as any intermediary shapes. The variety of RTD shapes encountered show the need to systematically include the aquifer structure and recharge conditions in the assessment of RTDs and for their subsequent use for problematics related to water quality. The semi-analytical approximation can be further used in a variety of aquifer systems in complement with other existing solutions as a Lumped Parameter Model for RTDs.

AB This study develops a general analytical model for describing transient drawdown distribution induced by pumping at a finite-radius well in a radial two-zone confined aquifer of finite areal extent with Robin-type condition at both inner and outer boundaries. This model is also applicable to heat conduction problems for a composite hollow cylinder on the basis of the analogy between heat flow and groundwater flow. The time-domain solution of the model is derived by the methods of Laplace transform, Bromwich integral, and residue theorem. This new solution can reduce to the solution for constant-head test (CHT) or constant-rate test (CRT) problem by specifying appropriate coefficients at the Robin inner boundary condition. The solution describing the flow rate across the wellbore due to CHT is further developed by applying Darcy's law to the new solution. In addition, steady-state solutions for both CHT and CRT are also developed based on the approximation for Bessel functions with very small argument values. Many existing solutions for transient flow in homogeneous or two-zone finite aquifers with Dirichlet or no-flow condition at the outer boundary are shown to be special cases of the present solution. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis is also performed to investigate the behaviors of the wellbore flow due to CHT and the aquifer drawdown induced by CRT in response to the change in each of aquifer parameters.

AB This study presents a method of predicting the soil water retention curve (SWRC) of a soil using a set of measured SWRC data from a soil with the same texture but different initial void ratio. The relationships of the volumetric water contents and the matric suctions between two samples with different initial void ratios are established. An adjustment parameter (beta) is introduced to express the relationships between the matric suctions of two soil samples. The parameter beta is a function of the initial void ratio, matric suction or volumetric water content. The function can take different forms, resulting in different predictive models. The optimal predictive models of beta are determined for coarse-grained and fine-grained soils using the Bayesian method. The optimal models of beta are validated by comparing the estimated matric suction and measured data. The comparisons show that the proposed method produces more accurate SWRCs than do other models for both coarse-grained and fine-grained soils. Furthermore, the influence of the model parameters of beta on the predicted matric suction and SWRC is evaluated using Latin Hypercube sampling. An uncertainty analysis shows that the reliability of the predicted SWRC decreases with decreasing water content in fine-grained soils, and the initial void ratio has no apparent influence on the reliability of the predicted SWRCs in coarse-grained and fine-grained soils.

AB In large alluvial river courses where bank failure is prominent, seepage erosion may be a significant contributor that is often overlooked. Seepage erosion typically occurs simultaneously with fluvial erosion and other mass failure processes during the recession period of hydrographs. In this study, a functional relationship between seepage erosion rate and its controlling variables was developed using lysimeter experiments. This experimental relationship was used to formulate a mathematical seepage model that predicts the daily seepage erosion rate for a composite river bank. Soils collected from the Brahmaputra River banks were repacked in lysimeters with horizontal stratification similar to the actual bank stratification. A total of 71 lysimeter experiments were conducted with various combinations of the controlling variables. The results indicate that the seepage gradient has a dominating effect on the time taken in developing undercuts that lead to the bank collapse. Increase in the number of silt layers in the bank profile increased the time to collapse significantly. In situ bank erosion measurements were taken to validate the performance of a bank erosion model for the middle reaches of the Brahmaputra River in India. The model predictions of seepage erosion rate showed a close agreement with the in situ bank retreat measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory and small-scale field observations have yielded fundamental insights into the causes of nitrate pollution. Detection of downstream, off-site impacts of nitrate pollution reveals its effects. However, there is a gulf in our knowledge and practice that prevents the expertise gained at the small-scale from contributing to a sound scientific basis for planning at the catchment scale. Many modellers may thus rely on simple empirical models when simulating nitrate pollution at the catchment scale as these models can reflect their judgments and uncertainties. Other modellers struggle to apply physically-based, distributed models within complex, three-dimensional heterogeneous landscapes, inducing equifinality and predictive uncertainty problems. One way for planners and scientists to advance is to create scale appropriate modelling techniques, which can call upon a range of model types [including complex physically-based, quasi-physical, semi-distributed models and lumped Minimum Information Requirement (MIR) models]. This paper argues that the modeller must use the appropriate model type, at the appropriate scale, in order to best understand nitrate losses observed at that scale. When simulating at the catchment scale, the modeller must accept that there are processes that are not fully understood and cannot be modelled with accuracy, yet the modeller must still produce decision support tools that are capable of solving real world problems, despite inherent model uncertainty. Thus, this paper will show, through a fully worked example, how hydrological flow paths and nitrate pollution sources can be simulated at the catchment scale by first, reflecting our understanding of the physical world and second paying full respect to catchment scale issues and uncertainty problems. The River Great Ouse (1400 kin 2) case study is a typical intense arable region of the UK, where the available data sources are by no means perfect, but where nitrate policy must still be implemented. Thus, physically-based model simulations, simple MIR models, GIS data sources and 'expert' knowledge are brought together to create a simple, applied modelling toolkit to simulate nitrate pollution and support catchment policies that reduce the loss of nitrate to rivers.

AB Statistical models have been widely used in soil science, hydrogeology and geotechnical engineering to predict the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils. However, no effective method is available yet for the determination of the associated model parameters such as the tortuosity factor q. Considering the analogy between water flow and electrical current flow in a porous medium, in this study, we proposed to improve the predictive capability of statistical models by determining the tortuosity factor q using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements. We first developed a theoretical hydraulic-electrical conductivity (K-EC) relationship for unsaturated soils based on the bundle of capillary tubes model. This K-EC relationship was then used to form a new unsaturated soil EC model, which was verified using published experimental data. The tortuosity factor q can then be determined by fitting the new EC model to soil EC measurements. Experimental data of six soils were used to test the effectiveness of this method and it was shown that the prediction was significantly improved when compared with the one using the commonly suggested value q = 0.5. The associated root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) between measurements and predictions is only 0.28 when q is obtained by using our proposed method. In contrast, the RMSD is 0.97 when q is simply assumed as 0.5. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aquifers constitute the main freshwater supply of oceanic islands. Maintaining groundwater quantity and quality is of critical concern as demographic and climatic changes place additional pressures on already fragile water resources systems. Islands with heterogeneous volcanic aquifers pose additional difficulties in assessing their water resources. This work proposes an approach for improving the hydrogeological characterization of heterogeneous volcanic aquifer systems by making use of recession coefficients from deep water gallery discharge. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, hydrographs and recession curves from groundwater discharge of 30 water galleries on La Palma (Canary Islands) were evaluated. This analysis allowed us to obtain the main hydrogeological parameters of a volcanic aquifer system, in terms of hydraulic diffusivity. A Maillet-Boussinesq model with an exponential decay law was adopted, according to field observations of drainage discharge. The alpha coefficients of recession values ranged between 10(-3) and 4.10(-4) day(-1) and showed significant spatial correlation with insular geology. Additionally, hydraulic diffusivity values of island hydrogeological domains were obtained from recession coefficients using the Rorabaugh-Singh method. Weighted storage coefficients for volcanic materials were in the range of 3% to 7%, with an average transmissivity in the range of 15 to 150 m2.day(-1). The methodology proposed has demonstrated its usefulness in coping with local uncertainty in hydraulic characterization of insular aquifers associated with volcanic heterogeneity. This is an improvement compared to standard pumping tests, thus providing hydraulic parameters prior to numerical analysis for water management planning.

AB Few studies have been conducted to determine the empirical relationship between peak discharge and spatial scale within a single river basin. Only one study has determined this empirical relationship during single rainfall-runoff events. The study was conducted on the Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) in Mississippi and shows that during single events peak discharge Q(A) and drainage area A are correlated as Q(A) = alpha A(0) and that alpha and theta change between events. These observations are the first of their kind and to understand them from a physical standpoint we examined streamflow and rainfall data from 148 events in the basin.
   A time series of excess rainfall was estimated for each event in GCEW by assuming that a threshold infiltration rate partitions rainfall into infiltration and runoff. We evaluated this threshold iteratively using conservation of mass as a criterion and found that threshold values are consistent physically with independent measurements of near-surface soil moisture. We then estimated the excess rainfall duration for each event and placed events into groups of different durations. For many groups, data show that a is linearly related to excess rainfall depth (r) over cap (d) and that the event-to-event variability in Q(A) is controlled mainly by variability in alpha through changes in (r) over cap (d). The exponent theta appears to be independent Of (r) over cap (d) for all groups, but mean values of theta tend to increase as the duration increases from group to group. This later result provides the first observational support for past theoretical results, all of which have been obtained under idealized conditions. Moreover, this result provides an avenue for predicting peak discharges at multiple spatial scales in the basin. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzed the seasonal dynamics of runoff-contributing areas in a small Mediterranean catchment (Can Vita catchment, 0.56 km(2)). The aim was to provide a more detailed spatially distributed picture of the behavior of the catchment which, would help explain the high spatio-temporal variability of its hydrological response. Contributing areas for runoff were mapped during eight field surveys performed under varied hydrological conditions. Low permeable bare areas were recognised as classic source areas for infiltration excess runoff, and two types of saturated areas prone to saturation excess runoff were identified: A-type areas, linked to groundwater rising to the surface, and B-type areas, associated with saturation restricted to the upper soil profile. The amplitude of the seasonal variation in these saturated areas was similar to the amplitude found in more humid catchments, even if their decrease was more marked under dry conditions. In the Can Vita catchment, terraced topography promoted, however, more scattered saturation patterns than those usually described. A linear relationship between the extent of saturated areas and baseflow discharge was found; the relationship with the position of the water table was also direct, when saturated areas linked to groundwater rising dominated the saturation pattern. Using very simple methodology, a tentative quantification of the contribution of precipitation on saturated areas to storm-flow was performed, improving the overall understanding of the Can Vita Mediterranean catchment.

AB Information on base flow availability and/or contributions is needed to develop water quantity and water quality management strategies. Base flow availability varies over space and time in a region due to climate, topography, landscape, and geological characteristics. In this study, base flow index (BFI) (base flow/total stream flow) was estimated from daily streamflow records using a recursive digital filter method and interpolated to produce a raster grid map for the conterminous United States. When compared for validation, BFI estimated by recursive digital filter method showed good agreement overall with the USGS smoothed minima BFI method. Estimated base flow index and volume were analyzed, with Hydrological Landscape Regions (HLRs) developed for the United States to identify the mean hydrologic flow response within HLR. They were also used to determine relationships with hydro-geologic descriptive variables and used for defining the HLRs based on Pearson's correlation table and a stepwise multiple regression. These descriptive variables used in defining the HLRs include relief, effective rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and percentage of sand. The regression results indicated that relief and percentage of sand were highly correlated to base flow index, and the amount of base flow volume can be related to gradient and the amount of effective rainfall. The regression results also suggested that the descriptive variables used in constructing the HLR can be used to define mean values of shallow ground water flow within the regions. Further testing is needed to ascertain if such relationships could be used to define flow within an HLR. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident salar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 km(2) in the northwestern USA, for 1 year, including a detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C, with biases of +0.1 degrees C and -0.1 degrees C, respectively. MAE for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps.

AB The spatial and size distribution of sediment deposited from short periods of overland flow due to the effect of a simulated grass buffer strip was measured for low slopes of 1.6, 3.4 and 5.1%. These data were analysed so as to critically evaluate two alternative models of the process of re-entrainment of recently deposited sediment. A model of re-entrainment, previously thought to be appropriate only for a steady-state or equilibrium situation, was found to give better agreement with experiments than did a model previously used in the literature on this subject.

AB A systematic method has been proposed to estimate the two-phase flow properties of horizontal fractures under normal deformation condition. Based on Gaussian aperture distributions and the assumption of local parallel plate model, a simple model was obtained in closed form to predict the capillary pressure-saturation relationships for both wetting and non-wetting phases. Three conceptual models were also developed to characterize the relative permeability behaviors. In order to investigate the effect of normal deformation on two-phase flow properties, the normal deformation could be represented with the maximum void space closure on the basis of penetration model. A rigorous successive random addition (SRA) method was used to generate the aperture-based fractures and a numerical approach based on invasion percolation (IP) model was employed to model capillary-dominated displacements between wetting and non-wetting phases. The proposed models were partially verified by a laboratory dataset and numerical calculations without consideration of deformation. Under large normal deformations, it was found that the macroscopic model is in better agreement with simulated observations. The simulation results demonstrated that the two-phase flow properties including the relationships between capillary pressure, relative permeability and saturation, phase interference, phase structures, residual-saturation-rated parameters and tortuosity factor, were highly sensitive to the spatial correlation of aperture distribution and normal deformation.

AB We employ a non-decimated wavelet decomposition to analyse inter-annual variations of the North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO) indices and relationship of these variations with both the Eddy kinetic energy contents (K-E) in the atmosphere of Northern mid-latitudes and the precipitation in the different regions of Ukraine during July 1960-February 2003. Major advantage of using this tool is to isolate short- and long-term components of fluctuations. Such analysis allows revealing basic periodic behaviours for the NAO indices such as the 4-8-year and the natural change of dominant phase. The main results can be posed as follows. The most essential relationship between the NAO index and K-E content is found for the low frequency variations with the periods of 4-8 and 8-16 years, at that if the NAO phase tends to abrupt changes then the impact of these changes on the K-E content is more significant than for the durational dominance of certain phase. The largest coefficients of correlation for the NAO index and Ukrainian precipitation are stated for the periodicities of 2-4 and 4-8 years; the former is caused by the synoptic-scale activity forced by the NAO while the former is conditioned by the air-mass processes in the warm season.

AB In this paper, groundwater circulation well (GCW) was as used to remediate contaminant in low-permeability lens in aquifer, and a theoretical framework was constructed to describe the contaminant removal process in low-permeability lens driven by a GCW. In this theoretical framework, the evolution process of contaminant removal rate in low-permeability lens is summarized in a sequence of evolution stages in which several critical states and conditions are defined. Using oxytetracycline (OTC) as a representative contaminant, a finite-element numerical model based on COMSOL Multiphysics is established considering adsorption and biodegradation of the secondary contamination of groundwater. The theory is verified, and the parameter sensitivity analysis of the theory prioritize different factors influencing the contaminant removal process. The results are summarized as follows. The evolution process of contaminant removal rate driven by advection, hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption includes four stages (initial stage, rising stage, falling stage and complete removal stage), and the evolution process of contaminant removal rate driven by biodegradation includes three stages (initial stage, falling stage and complete removal stage). The evolution paths of contaminant removal dominated by adsorption or biodegradation in the first stage were established, and they were divided into four categories (one-stage, two -stage, three-stage and four-stage evolution paths), totaling 22 evolution paths. Four evolution stages dominated by advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, adsorption and biodegradation were defined, and the critical states and conditions were defined. The influences of hydrodynamic parameters and solute transport parameters on evo-lution stage and critical moment are analyzed in details.

AB The Nierji Basin, in the north-east of China, is one of the most important basins in the joint operation of the entire Songhua River, containing a major reservoir used for flood control. It is necessary to forecast the flow of the basin during periods of flood accurately and with the maximum lead time possible. This paper presents a flood forecasting system, using the Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) modeling approach and Kalman Filter data assimilation for flood forecasting in the data limited Nierji Reservoir Basin (NIRB). Examples are given of the application of the DBM methodology using both single input (rainfall or upstream flow) and multiple input (rainfalls and upstream flow) to forecast the downstream discharge for different sub-basins. Model identification uses the simplified recursive instrumental variable (SRIV) algorithm, which is robust to noise in the observation data. The application is novel in its use of stochastic optimisation to define rain gauge weights and identify the power law nonlinearity. It is also the first application of the DBM methodology to flood forecasting in China. Using the methodology allows the forecasting with lead times of 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, 5-day with 98%, 97%, 96%, 96% and 93% forecast coefficient of determination respectively, which is sufficient for the regulation of the reservoirs in the basin.

AB In field studies of solute transport, transient storage within lateral cavities and other stream features generates breakthrough curves (BTCs) with pronounced and persistent skewness. Current solute transport theory requires that the coefficient of skewness (CSK) decrease over time because the system eventually reaches Fickian conditions. However, published data show that CSK is constant in time. To aid development of solute transport theory that explains field observations, we quantify the effect of lateral cavities on solute transport under non-Fickian and Fickian conditions. Six hydrodynamics models were developed: one with no lateral cavities, three with lateral cavities in series, and two with lateral cavities in parallel. Results reveal that lateral cavities in series have longer tails and smaller peak concentrations compared to lateral cavities in parallel. Lateral cavities in series cause greater dispersion and require larger distances to reach Fickian conditions (x(Fick)) compared to lateral cavities in parallel. Cavity configuration has a greater influence on longitudinal dispersion and X-Fick than the number of cavities present. CSK changes with monitoring location and maximum CSK (= 10-20) near lateral cavities is higher than empirical estimates (approximate to 1.18). We postulate that adding more transient storage zones would increase channel complexity and yield closer results between simulated and empirical CSK, and testing this hypothesis warrants future research. Finally, while current models can obtain good fits to measured BTCs by parameterizing mass exchange rates and volume ratios, these parameters do not adequately describe the fundamental fluid mechanics driving exchange.

AB Coupled modelling of surface and subsurface systems is a valuable tool for quantifying surface water-groundwater interactions. In the present paper, the 3-D non-steady state Navier-Stokes equations, after Reynolds averaging and with the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution, are for the first time coupled to the 3-D saturated groundwater flow equations in an Integrated suRface watEr-groundwater modEl (IRENE). A finite-difference method is used for the solution of the governing equations of IRENE. A semi-implicit scheme is used for the discretisation of the surface water flow equations and a fully implicit scheme for the discretisation of the groundwater flow equations. The two sets of equations are coupled at the common interface of the surface water and groundwater bodies, where water exchange takes place, using Darcy's law. A new approach is proposed for the solution of the coupled surface water and groundwater equations in a simultaneous manner, in such a fashion that gives computational efficiency at low computational cost. IRENE is verified against three analytical solutions of surface water-groundwater interaction, which are chosen so that different components of the model can be tested. The model closely reproduces the results of the analytical solutions and can therefore be used for analysing and predicting surface water-groundwater interactions in real-world cases.

AB A primary source of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Black Creek aquifer of South Carolina is carbon dioxide produced by microbially mediated oxidation of sedimentary organic matter. Groundwater chemistry data indicate, however, that the available mass of inorganic electron acceptors (oxygen, Fe(III), and sulfate) and observed methane production is inadequate to account for observed CO2 production. Although sulfate concentrations are low (approximately 0.05-0.10 mM) in aquifer water throughout the flow system, sulfate concentrations are greater in confining-bed pore water (0.4-20 mM). The distribution of culturable sulfate-reducing bacteria in these sediments suggests that this concentration gradient is maintained by greater sulfate-reducing activity in sands than in clays. Calculations based on Fick's Law indicate that possible rates of sulfate diffusion to aquifer sediments are sufficient to explain observed rates of CO2 production (about 10(-5) mmoll-1 year-1), thus eliminating the apparent electron-acceptor deficit. Furthermore, concentrations of dissolved hydrogen in aquifer water are in the range characteristic of sulfate reduction (2-6 nM), which provides independent evidence that sulfate reduction is the predominant terminal electron-accepting process in this system. The observed accumulation of pyrite- and calcite-cemented sandstones at sand-clay interfaces is direct physical evidence that these processes have been continuing over the history of these sediments.

TI Green and Ampt infiltration into soils of variable pore size with depth

ID TRANSMISSIVITY PROFILE; TOPMODEL
AB Most expressions for infiltration rely upon the assumption of vertical uniformity in soil texture and hydraulic properties. We present an extension of the results of Beven [1982, 1984] for infiltration and lateral how in soils with decreasing permeability with depth. Unlike Beven, we base the derivations upon joint changes in soil properties based on an overall change in characteristic pore size via Miller scaling. A set of very simple expressions for the time rate of infiltration are obtained using a Green and Ampt approach for soils with permeability that decreases with depth following linear, power law, and exponential relationships.

TI Computing under-ice discharge: A proof-of-concept using hydroacoustics
   and the Probability Concept
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
AB Under-ice discharge is estimated using open-water reference hydrographs; however, the ratings for ice-affected sites are generally qualified as poor. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Colorado Water Conservation Board, conducted a proof-of-concept to develop an alternative method for computing under-ice discharge using hydroacoustics and the Probability Concept.
   The study site was located south of Minturn, Colorado (CO), USA, and was selected because of (1) its proximity to the existing USGS streamgage 09064600 Eagle River near Minturn, CO, and (2) its ease-of-access to verify discharge using a variety of conventional methods. From late September 2014 to early March 2015, hydraulic conditions varied from open water to under ice. These temporal changes led to variations in water depth and velocity. Hydroacoustics (tethered and uplooking acoustic Doppler current profilers and acoustic Doppler velocimeters) were deployed to measure the vertical-velocity profile at a singularly important vertical of the channel-cross section. Because the velocity profile was non-standard and cannot be characterized using a Power Law or Log Law, velocity data were analyzed using the Probability Concept, which is a probabilistic formulation of the velocity distribution. The Probability Concept-derived discharge was compared to conventional methods including stage-discharge and index-velocity ratings and concurrent field measurements; each is complicated by the dynamics of ice formation, pressure influences on stage measurements, and variations in cross-sectional area due to ice formation.
   No particular discharge method was assigned as truth. Rather one statistical metric (Kolmogorov-Smirnov; KS), agreement plots, and concurrent measurements provided a measure of comparability between various methods. Regardless of the method employed, comparisons between each method revealed encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and the absence or presence of ice cover.
   For example, during lower discharges dominated by under-ice and transition (intermittent open-water and under-ice) conditions, the KS metric suggests there is not sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis and implies that the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating represent similar distributions. During high-flow, open-water conditions, the comparisons are less definitive; therefore, it is important that the appropriate analytical method and instrumentation be selected. Six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with Probability Concept-derived discharges with percent differences (%) of -9.0%, -21%, -8.6%, 17.8%, 3.6%, and -2.3%.
   This proof-of-concept demonstrates that riverine discharges can be computed using the Probability Concept for a range of hydraulic extremes (variations in discharge, open-water and under-ice conditions) immediately after the siting phase is complete, which typically requires one day. Computing real-time discharges is particularly important at sites, where (1) new streamgages are planned, (2) river hydraulics are complex, and (3) shifts in the stage-discharge rating are needed to correct the streamflow record. Use of the Probability Concept does not preclude the need to maintain a stage-area relation. Both the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating offer water-resource managers and decision makers alternatives for computing real-time discharge for open-water and under-ice conditions.

TI Simulation of water flow in fractured porous medium by using discretized

   Numerical simulation; Aperture heterogeneity
ID PIPE NETWORK METHOD; 2-PHASE FLOW; MODEL
AB The discretized virtual internal bond (DVIB) is adopted to simulate the water flow in fractured porous medium. The intact porous medium is permeable because it contains numerous micro cracks and pores. These micro discontinuities construct a fluid channel network. The representative volume of this fluid channel network is modeled as a lattice bond cell with finite number of bonds in statistical sense. Each bond serves as a fluid channel. In fractured porous medium, many bond cells are cut by macro fractures. The conductivity of the fracture facet in a bond cell is taken over by the bonds parallel to the flow direction. The equivalent permeability and volumetric storage coefficient of a micro bond are calibrated based on the ideal bond cell conception, which makes it unnecessary to consider the detailed geometry of a specific element. Such parameter calibration method is flexible and applicable to any type of element. The accuracy check results suggest this method has a satisfying accuracy in both the steady and transient flow simulation. To simulate the massive fractures in rockmass, the bond cells intersected by fracture are assigned aperture values, which are assumed random numbers following a certain distribution law. By this method, any number of fractures can be implicitly incorporated into the background mesh, avoiding the setup of fracture element and mesh modification. The fracture aperture heterogeneity is well represented by this means. The simulation examples suggest that the present method is a feasible, simple and efficient approach to the numerical simulation of water flow in fractured porous medium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB With urbanization and the growth of agriculture, the importance of precisely assessing the contribution of diffuse- and point source loads arriving to surface waters is becoming more and more important. Determining their effects, however, is not as straightforward as it at first seems. The main aim of the study was to determine the driving background factors of a river located in an agricultural watershed, and furthermore, to separate the role of the diffuse- and point source nutrient loads. The method used to achieve the aims was Dynamic Factor Analysis. This is an effective tool for exploring time series which describe such phenomena. It is capable of taking into account the lagged correlation structure, thus enabling the researcher to uncover the background processes operating in time series. Dynamic Factor Analysis was applied to the time series (1978-2006) of 21 response parameters measured in the River Zala and 6 explanatory (agricultural, meteorological, water quality, etc.) parameters measured in its watershed.
   The results demonstrated that with the aid of Dynamic Factor Analysis the superimposed effects of the socio-economic changes which began in the mid-1980s, and the introduction of advanced wastewater treatment (P removal) in the river catchment in the early 1990s could be separated and their relative importance assessed, as well as that of other determining external factors.

AB Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and pore network model (PNM) are two types of simulation methods for modelling the fluid flow in porous media at the pore scale. LBM is accurate in representing the pore structures but is computationally expensive, while PNM is very efficient but cannot capture the details of pore structures. In this work, we propose to couple these two methods to simulate two-phase drainage flow in porous media. To describe the throat geometry more accurately, an improved pore network extraction method is proposed based on watershed method, where throat bonds with real throat cross sections are extracted. A multi-relaxation-time color-gradient lattice Boltzmann model is adopted to simulate the flow properties for each throat bond, namely critical entry capillary pressure, capillary pressure - saturation relationship, single-phase conductance and relative conductance - saturation relationship for both phases, which are the input parameters for PNM simulations. To further improve the computational efficiency, five artificial neural network models are developed which relate the five flow properties to the actual shape of throat cross sections, where the shape is characterized by 9 parameters. The database consists of LBM simulations of the flow properties of 1421 throat cross sections extracted from 5 sandstone digital rocks. The trained artificial neural network models show much better performance than the conventional PNM when predicting the flow properties for each throat bond. Finally, the accuracy of the improved PNM coupled with LBM is validated by both the single-phase flow and two-phase drainage flow in a Berea sandstone.

AB Sediment graphs and hydrographs were analyzed in a small, high-gradient reforested watershed in Mie Prefecture, Japan, which was instrumented to measure discharge and sediment transport. The study was conducted to recognize determinant factors on sediment graphs and hydrographs relationships, and corresponding rating loops using eight storm events that occurred in 2004. A cause-and-effect analytical approach was employed in the investigation of factors controlling individual hydrological events. The results showed that in a single event, the sediment peak preceded the peak discharge, following a clockwise hysteretic loop. The rating loops exhibited hysteresis with a greater suspended sediment concentration for a given discharge occurring on the rising limb rather than on the failing limb. Furthermore, the reduction in suspended sediment concentrations in a sequence of events and the falling limbs could mainly be associated with sediment exhaustion and contributions of throughfall and throughflow. We concluded that a combination of sediment availability, rainfall characteristics, soil water repellency, and contribution of different flow components control the variations in event-wise sediment graphs and rating loops in the study area. Understanding the relationship between controlling factors and sediment yield dynamics in the study area should greatly improve our understanding of sediment transport mechanisms and predictions in reforested watersheds, which should ultimately lead to better management of forest ecosystems.

AB This paper uses generalized expressions for both cross-section geometry and hydraulics (generalization of the Chezy and Manning relations) to derive explicit equations for the exponents and coefficients in the power-law at-a-station hydraulic-geometry relations. The exponents are shown to depend only on the depth exponent in the hydraulic relation (p) and the exponent that reflects the form of the cross-section (r). The coefficients depend on p and r, but also on the slope exponent in the generalized hydraulic relation and on the physical characteristics of the section: bankfull width, bankfull maximum depth, hydraulic conductance, and slope. The theoretical ranges of coefficient and exponent values derived herein are generally consistent with the averages and individual observed values reported in previous studies. However, observed values of the exponents at particular cross-sections commonly fall outside the theoretical ranges. In particular, the observed value of the velocity exponent m is commonly greater than the theoretical value, suggesting that hydraulic conductance often increases more strongly with discharge than predicted by the assumed hydraulic relations. The developments presented here provide new theoretical insight into the ways in which hydraulic and geometric factors determine hydraulic geometry. This insight should help to explain the variation of at-a-station hydraulic geometry and may facilitate prediction of hydraulic geometry at river reaches where detailed measurements are unavailable.

AB Climate change and human activities have been widely recognized as two major factors that deeply influenced hydrological processes. It has great importance to evaluate and identify the contributions among distinct driving factors, which could help carry out better regional water resources management regulation. In this study, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to quantify the contributions for different climatic variables and human activities to runoff in the Luanhe River basin (LRB) with semi-arid climate, northern China. Our intention is to detect the multiple impacts of climate change (CC), such as precipitation change (PC) and temperature rising (TR), and human activities (HA), including land use/cover change (LUCC) and direct human activities (i.e., water withdrawal and inter-basin water diversion, DHA), on runoff variance. The "natural period" (1961-1979), "weak impact period" (1980-1997) and "strong impact period" (1998-2016) were divided based on the double-mass curves and Mann-Kendall's test of observed runoff data from 1961 to 2016. The results indicated that, 1) compared with climate change, human activities were the major factors decreasing the runoff, which contributed more than 60% to the runoff reduction in two impact periods; 2) the runoff variation affected by climate was ruled by the precipitation change positively and strongly, and the impacts of precipitation and temperature strengthened with time. 3) During the strong impact period, the direct human activities have presented the most contribution on runoff reduction, which may result from the water diversion and water withdrawal. The influence of LUCC on runoff was mainly due to the conversion between grassland and cropland. These results would be helpful for policymakers and researchers to better understand the responses of runoff to this changing environment conditions and provide implications for future water resources planning and management at the basin scale.

AB Seawater intrusion (SWI) has led to salinization of fresh groundwater reserves in coastal areas worldwide and has forced the closure of water supply wells. There is a paucity of well-documented studies that report on the reversal of SWI after the closure of a well field. This study presents data from the coastal carbonate aquifer in northeast China, where large-scale extraction has ceased since 2001 after salinization of the main well field. The physical flow and concomitant hydrogeochemical processes were investigated by analyzing water level and geochemical data, including major ion chemistry and stable water isotope data. Seasonal water table and salinity fluctuations, as well as changes of delta H-2-delta O-18 values of groundwater between the wet and dry season, suggest local meteoric recharge with a pronounced seasonal regime. Historical monitoring testifies of the reversibility of SWI in the carbonate aquifer, as evidenced by a decrease of the Cl- concentrations in groundwater following restrictions on groundwater abstraction. This is attributed to the rapid flushing in this system where flow occurs preferentially along karst conduits, fractures and fault zones. The partially positive correlation between 8180 values and TDS concentrations of groundwater, as well as high NO3- concentrations (>39 mg/L), suggest that irrigation return flow is a significant recharge component. Therefore, the present-day elevated salinities are more likely due to agricultural activities rather than SWI. Nevertheless, seawater mixing with fresh groundwater cannot be ruled out in particular where formerly intruded seawater may still reside in immobile zones of the carbonate aquifer. The massive expansion of fish farming in seawater ponds in the coastal zone poses a new risk of salinization. Cation exchange, carbonate dissolution, and fertilizer application are the dominant processes further modifying the groundwater composition, which is investigated quantitatively using hydrogeochemical models.

AB Sensitivity analysis represents an important step in improving the understanding and use of environmental models. Indeed, by means of global sensitivity analysis (GSA), modellers may identify both important (factor prioritisation) and non-influential (factor fixing) model factors. No general rule has yet been defined for verifying the convergence of the GSA methods. In order to fill this gap this paper presents a convergence analysis of three widely used GSA methods (SRC, Extended FAST and Morris screening) for an urban drainage stormwater quality-quantity model. After the convergence was achieved the results of each method were compared. In particular, a discussion on peculiarities, applicability, and reliability of the three methods is presented. Moreover, a graphical Venn diagram based classification scheme and a precise terminology for better identifying important, interacting and non-influential factors for each method is proposed. In terms of convergence, it was shown that sensitivity indices related to factors of the quantity model achieve convergence faster. Results for the Morris screening method deviated considerably from the other methods. Factors related to the quality model require a much higher number of simulations than the number suggested in literature for achieving convergence with this method. In fact, the results have shown that the term "screening" is improperly used as the method may exclude important factors from further analysis. Moreover, for the presented application the convergence analysis shows more stable sensitivity coefficients for the Extended-FAST method compared to SRC and Morris screening. Substantial agreement in terms of factor fixing was found between the Morris screening and Extended FAST methods. In general, the water quality related factors exhibited more important interactions than factors related to water quantity. Furthermore, in contrast to water quantity model outputs, water quality model outputs were found to be characterised by high non-linearity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PROPAGATION; WAVE; DEFORMATION; FREQUENCY; MEDIA; FLOW
AB A rigorous mathematical framework is presented for the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations to describe the consolidation of saturated soils under the simultaneous action of external static loads and gravity forces. These equations generalize the Biot model of poroelasticity in a systematic manner to well account for additional momentum exchange arising from the physical mechanisms involved in gravitational compaction due to changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent.
   A boundary-value problem is then formulated as a representative example to quantitatively examine gravity effect on the dissipation of excess pore fluid pressure and settlement magnitude, and is solved numerically in a finite difference scheme. In the current study, the boundary conditions have been directly calculated in numerical scheme, which improves previous studies to avoid using the approximation of the trapezoidal rule. A physically-consistent parameter, derived fundamentally from the first principle, balance of momentum, is proposed for the first time, which provides an exact measure of the degree to which variations in final total settlement occur due to the presence of gravity effect. This dimensionless parameter takes a closed-form expression that refines our foregoing works, and is quite general since it is applicable to both saturated and variably-saturated soils.
   Our studies show that the variations are essentially controlled by soil elasticity modulus and height, as well as a derived gravity factor. This factor underlines the importance of the dependency between consolidation behaviors and distinct physical properties of pore fluids. Lastly, a comparative study is carried out, indicating that gravity forces yield more significant impact on unsaturated soils than saturated soils we examined, leading to more relative increment in the final total settlement.

AB This study proposes a stochastic approach to simulate sediment vertical dispersion in turbulent solid-liquid flows by developing a fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) to characterize the dynamics of sediment suspension. The fADE is a generalization of the traditional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) where the first-order spatial derivative is replaced with a fractional derivative of order alpha (0 < alpha <= 1). Many previous investigations of sediment suspension in steady sediment-laden flows apply the classic or improved Rouse equation, which was derived from the traditional ADE by assuming Fick's first law for the sediment dispersive flux. Recent observations in field and laboratory studies, however, have indicated that large errors may arise from the traditional ADE when applied to flows with coarse sediments. Instead, the vertical dispersion of suspended sediment is most likely a space nonlocal transport process in flows with turbulent bursting because particle vertical jumps with ejection events are no longer constrained to a small distance defined by the representative elementary volume. In other words, the vertical random displacements of suspended particles follow Levy motion instead of Brownian motion. After validating against field measurements in the Las Vegas Wash as well as a set of published experimental data, we find that the proposed fractional model can describe the real-world vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration in steady turbulent flows.

AB Water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment, since the majority of water resource-related data is imprecise or uncertain to some extent. MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) is a well-suited decision support tool for water resources management, however multiple uncertainties existed in criteria weights (CWs) and performance values (PVs) hinder the application of MCDM methods in real-world problems. This paper proposes an application-oriented stochastic MCDM framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty. A weight aggregation approach based on the game theory coupled with feasible weight space (FWS) is developed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation. We propose a novel SMAA-GRA model by combining the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) theory and grey relational analysis (GRA). The risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are utilized to assess decision-making uncertainty. We perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives. The proposed framework is demonstrated via two water resources management case studies. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision-making results. The results indicate that the framework enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk-informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities.

AB It is critical to assess drought risk based on a reliably integrated drought index incorporating comprehensive information of meteorology, hydrology and agriculture drought indices, which is of great value for further understanding the future drought tendency, prevention and mitigation. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to focus on constructing a multivariate integrated drought index (MIDI) by coupling four drought indices (i.e., Precipitation Anomaly Percentage (PAP), Runoff Anomaly Percentage (RAP), Standardized Precipitation Index with 6-month aggregation time step (SPI6) and Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI)) to objectively and comprehensively investigate drought risk. The variable fuzzy set theory and entropy weight method are used during the MIDI construction process. Based on the MIDI, a drought event including drought duration and severity is redefined using run theory. Then copula-based drought risk is fully assessed through the joint probability distribution of drought duration and severity. Results indicate the following: (1) the constructed MIDI is consistent with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Runoff Anomaly Percentage (RAP) series, and it is more sensitive and effective to capture historical drought events; (2) the drought characteristics present noticeable spatial variability among five subzones, and the entire basin has 49 droughts with the longest drought duration spanning 8.55 months; and (3) the mainstream, especially the middle and lower reaches, has higher occurrences of severe droughts for approximately every 10 years.

   well flow rates
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   and recovery; leakage
AB The present paper investigates aquifer horizontal movement driven by hydraulic forces. New analytic solutions are found for the velocity and displacement fields describing aquifer radial transient movement caused by welt discharge and recharge within a confined leaky aquifer. The development of the new solutions is based on linear momentum of bulk mass flux, mass conservation of bulk mass flux, the Darcy-Gersevanov Law, and the analytic hydraulic drawdown. If the Hantush-Jacob, Carslaw-Jaeger, and Theis analytic drawdowns are applied respectively, a corresponding aquifer transient movement is found within the new solutions. Three sets of simplified solutions based on the Carslaw-Jaeger drawdown have been applied to three schemes of well flow rates that are power, periodic and exponential functions of time. For all three schemes, the dimensionless relations of aquifer displacement versus radial distance show the zones and locations where possible tensile stress may occur and cause potential earth fissuring. For the well flow rates varying as a power or periodic function, tensile stress may be generated when inertial forces change directions based on the dimensionless relations of aquifer velocity versus time. Analysis of effects that vertical leaky flow have on aquifer horizontal movement shows that the vertical water flow plays a significant role in aquifer radial movement, and that aquifer radial velocity is much more responsive to the vertical flow than is aquifer displacement.

AB Using data from 22 catchments in Northern Finland, this study demonstrates how runoff prediction in ungauged high-latitude catchments can be improved using simplified conceptual models tailored to readily available data in the region. The newly developed current precipitation index (CPIsnow) model provides a parsimonious tool to predict streamflow in data-limited high-latitude regions. Use of current precipitation index (CPI) and runoff coefficient formulation in the soil moisture and response routine conceptualization makes soil moisture and response routine parameters in the model identifiable with catchment properties influencing storage, evapotranspiration, and infiltration losses. Most of the model parameters showed a significant relationship with observable physical catchment properties, climate properties, or both. This made it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in an ungauged catchment with minimal uncertainty. The parameter functional relationships derived with catchment attributes produced equally good model results when applied to independent test catchments. Inclusion of snow-water equivalent records and use of multiple objective functions for both snow-water equivalent and runoff simulations in the model optimization process helped reduce the effect of parameter equifinality, thereby making it easier to determine the optimal parameter values. Ranges of parameter values are proposed for the CPIsnow model in relation to key observable catchment characteristics in the boreal zone, enabling application of the model in ungauged catchments in the region.

   STREAMFLOW; RECHARGE; WATERSHEDS; SEPARATION; DISCHARGE
AB Groundwater recharge by precipitation is often assumed by practitioners as well as scientists to be a slow process of filtration through layers of uniform texture analogous to Darcy's law. In most basins, however, rainwater also finds its way through macropores and preferential pathways to the shallow unconfined aquifers within hours of falling. Recharge phases may extend over several days, increasing groundwater levels, stored volume and hence baseflows into adjoining rivers. In this study, groundwater recharge and storage are computed from baseflow as separated with a nonlinear reservoir algorithm from time series of daily flows at gauging stations in northern Germany. Results are compared to groundwater level fluctuation in the catchments and to daily seepage rates measured in a lysimeter station. Peak times of the fast transfer of rain water through the vadose zone are generally the same. However, while recharge from baseflow ends when baseflow assumes its typical recession, the attenuation of lysimeter seepage may last much longer. The volume of lysimeter seepage is generally higher than the recharge in catchments due not only to different vegetation but also to rim effects impeding direct runoff. Furthermore, the lysimeter walls allow vertical fluxes only. Without further evidence or improved devices, lysimeter seepage should therefore not be indicated as groundwater recharge for the site or catchment. Findings also indicate that the shape of derived recharge unit responses is practically time invariant but with a strong seasonal variation in the recharge-rainfall ratio of precipitation events.

AB When simulation-optimization (S/O) is used for groundwater contamination source identification (GCSI), to reduce the calculation load and time generated by calling the simulation model, a surrogate model is often used instead of the simulation model. However, when the conversion relationship between the simulation model inputs and outputs is complex and the model is highly nonlinear, the commonly used approach of building a surrogate model may lose its advantage. This study use and check a deep learning method with the long-short term memory (LSTM) network which has great potential for characterizing the input-output conversion relationship of complex nonlinear numerical simulations, to a surrogate model of the simulation model. The accuracy of the surrogate model developed by the LSTM method was compared with that of commonly used surrogate models developed by the Kriging method, the radial basis function network method, and the kernel extreme learning machine method. The surrogate model with the highest accuracy was linked to the optimization model, and the optimization model was solved to identify the contamination source information. Results show that compared with the other three methods, the surrogate model constructed by the LSTM method had the best accuracy and generalization performance. LSTM is therefore an effective method of building a surrogate model. Linking the LSTM surrogate model to an optimization model and then solving the optimization model can save approximately 99% of the computing load and time otherwise required.

AB This paper addresses the relationship between multitemporal variability and regime shifts in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Nino Southern Oscillation, with precipitation and streamflows in Andean watersheds of the north-central region of Chile. In addition, an analysis of the effect of a regime shift displayed by annual streamflow records on their distributional properties is performed. By applying empirical fluctuation processes to monthly standardized PDO, Nino 3.4, precipitation and streamflow time series, the occurrence of a regime shift in the streamflow series, consistent with that for PDO, but highly dependent on the latitude of particular watersheds, is shown. No regime shift is detected for the precipitation time series. Using the ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition procedure on all series, a relationship between climatic indices and hydrological variables in two main modes is determined: the former associated with a mean period of quasi 1.5-3 years related to interannual variability, and the latter with a mean period of quasi 30-35 years, related to decadal low frequency variability. Using the regional frequency analysis based on the L-moments procedure, it is found that the distributional properties of streamflow records are influenced by the phases of the PDO, with changes that affect the mean, L-CV, L-skewness and L-kurtosis in three identified homogeneous regions. The importance of incorporating low-frequency climate variability for distributional analysis and the implications of these results for water resources management and planning in north-central Chile and similar areas is discussed.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil and stream waters in upland catchments are widely monitored, in part due to the potential of DOC to form harmful by-products when chlorinated during treatment of water for public supply. DOC can be measured directly, though this is expensive and time-consuming. Light absorbance in the UV-vis spectrum is often used as a surrogate measurement from which a colour-carbon relationship between absorbance and DOC can be derived, but this relationship can be confounded by numerous variables. Through the analysis of data from eight sites in England and Wales we investigate the possibility of using the concentration of phenolic compounds in water samples as a proxy for DOC concentration. A general model using data from all the sites allowed DOC to be calculated from phenolics at an accuracy of 81-86%. A detailed analysis at one site revealed that a site-specific calibration was more accurate than the general model, and that this compared favourably with a colour-carbon calibration. We therefore recommend this method for use where estimates of DOC concentration are needed, but where time and money are limiting factors, or as an additional method to calculate DOC alongside colour-carbon calibrations. Tests demonstrated only small amounts of phenolic degradation over time; a loss of 0.92 mg L-1 after 8 months in storage, and so this method can be used on older samples with limited loss of accuracy.

AB Fluorescence intensity (FI) and organic carbon concentration of groundwater percolating through soil and rock into the Santana Cave were monitored at eight different cave sites between 2000 and 2002 to investigate their relationships to climatic parameters, stalactite discharge and thickness of rock overlying the cave. FI values, compared among sampling sites, are inversely proportional to depth and directly proportional to discharge; in contrast, dissolved organic matter (DOC) shows no significant spatial variability. Time-series analysis demonstrated similarities in DOC trends of different waters, but no correlation was observed with FI trends. Combined evaluation of DOC of infiltration waters, rainfall data and chemical parameters of Fe, O-2, pH, Eh in soil solution indicate that peaks in DOC content coincide with more reduced conditions in the soil and have a lag time of 2-3 months after heavy showers. Variation of FI throughout the year occurs at all sampling sites but only higher drip discharge and rimstone pool waters were correlatable to rainfall events. FI of lower discharge sampling sites shows similar trends, but no relationship between drip discharge and rainfall variation was observed. Ranges and means of FI for all drip waters were significantly higher in the 2001-2002 period than in the preceding 2000-2001 period, which correlates with a 5.5 degreesC increase in mean austral winter temperatures in 2001. Hence, FI variations of karst waters that form carbonate speleothems under a humid subtropical climate may provide a useful proxy in paleoenvironmental reconstruction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Stefan models have been used for many problems such as freezing and melting processes. However, there are few research reports on using Stefan model for the problem of unsaturated flow in a granular packed bed, but the Stefan model has never been used before for considering the effects of particle sizes and supplied water flux to water saturation and moving infiltration fronts. The purpose of this work is to present novel mathematical models and numerical schemes for solving one-dimensional infiltration flow problems. A systematic development and comparison of two proposed models (Single-phase model and Stefan model) is performed. The influences of particle sizes and supplied water flux on water infiltration, i.e., the infiltration layer are studied in detail. It is found that the results of the comparison between these two models are in good agreement. Furthermore, the Stefan model shows better agreement with the experimental results than the Single-phase model. This study shows that the Stefan model can be used effectively for many physical phenomena involving flow infiltration coupled with a moving boundary, compared with other conventional models, i.e., the Single-phase model.

AB Studying the response of streamwater chemistry to changes in discharge can provide valuable insights into how catchments store and release water and solutes. Previous studies have determined concentration-discharge (cQ) relationships from long-term, low-frequency data of a wide range of solutes. These analyses, however, provide little insight into the coupling of solute concentrations and flow during individual hydrologic events. Event-scale cQ relationships have rarely been investigated across a wide range of solutes and over extended periods of time, and thus little is known about differences and similarities between event-scale and long-term cQ relationships. Differences between event-scale and long-term cQ behavior may provide useful information about the processes regulating their transport through the landscape.
   Here we analyze cQ relationships of 14 different solutes, ranging from major ions to trace metals, as well as electrical conductivity, in the Swiss Erlenbach catchment. From a 2-year time series of sub-hourly solute concentration data, we determined 2-year cQ relationships for each solute and compared them to cQ relationships of 30 individual events. The 2-year cQ behavior of groundwater-sourced solutes was representative of their cQ behavior during hydrologic events. Other solutes, however, exhibited very different cQ patterns at the event scale and across 2 consecutive years. This was particularly true for trace metals and atmospheric and/or biologically active solutes, many of which exhibited highly variable cQ behavior from one event to the next. Most of this inter-event variability in cQ behavior could be explained by factors such as catchment wetness, season, event size, input concentrations, and event-water contributions. We present an overview of the processes regulating different groups of solutes, depending on their origin in and pathways through the catchment. Our analysis thus provides insight into controls on solute variations at the hydrologic event scale.

AB Deep saline aquifer is the preferred reservoir for CO2 geological storage. However, during the primary drainage process of injecting scCO(2) into deep saline aquifers, residual water will form and cannot be drained, which will have adverse effects on the capacity and safety of CO2 storage. This is a new study based on the preliminary exploration, 9 groups of scCO(2) drainage experiments in a natural rock core are carried out under multiple pressure (8, 10 and 12 MPa) and temperature (40, 50 and 60 degrees C) conditions to investigate the formation mechanism of residual water during primary drainage process. A quantitative power function relationship between residual water saturation and drainage time is proposed; a quantitative exponential function relationship between irreducible water saturation and P-T conditions is also presented. The coefficients a, b, c and d of two fitting functions are discussed in detail. In addition, the irreducible water saturation increases with the increase of temperature and decreases with the increase of pressure. Through deep analysis on the interfacial tension, viscosity ratio and logCa-logM stability phase diagram, the interfacial tension of CO2-H2O system, which determines the capillary entry pressure, is regarded as the guiding factor influencing the experimental results, rather than the viscosity ratio. It is worth mentioning that under the given P-T conditions in this study, the influence of temperature on the experimental results is greater than that of pressure.

AB Understanding the metal dynamics in natural waters is critical to assessing the process and flow pathways that deliver these constituents to the stream network. Metal dynamics can be addressed by an analysis of concentration-discharge relationship across a large spectrum of hydrological conditions. However, metal-discharge responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events. In this study, a detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops exhibited by metal concentration-discharge relationship was undertaken to assess the Al, Fe, Mn and Cu dynamics and factors controlling changes in metal concentrations in a small scale rural catchment. Metal (sediment-associated and dissolved) concentrations were measured at high temporal resolution during storm events in a small rural headwater catchment in Galicia (NW Spain). Hysteresis analysis indicated a contrasting concentration-discharge dynamic for sediment-associated and dissolved metals, highlighting a strong decoupling between the two due to their different sources or delivery pathways. For sediment associated metals, clockwise hysteresis (56%) was the predominant pattern, highlighting the rapid sediment associated metal mobilisation via surface runoff from sources located near the stream channel. In contrast, dissolved metal showed predominantly anticlockwise hysteresis (58% of storm events), emphasising the role of subsurface flow and soil leaching processes. The different flushing mechanisms between sediment-associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export.

AB Intensified water usage due to rapid industrialization is often dictated by economic policies based on monetary growth rather than sustainable use of environmental resources. In addition, interdependence within economic sectors further interweaves water usage through product transactions, which further makes it difficult to quantify the dynamics of hydro-economic systems at regional, national and global scale. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of domestic virtual water networks (VWN) of 189 countries based on concept of information theory by quantifying network metrics that describes VWN flow capacity, robustness, efficiency and flexibility. These networks represent virtual water interconnected through economic sectors within a specified country built based on environmentally extended multi region input output (EE-MRIO) approach. We further estimated trends associated with network metrics, as well as coupling intensity between metrics with respect to socio-economic indicators, such as, population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI). It was observed that capacity and flexibility of VWNs are strongly and positively correlated indicating that a high capacity VWN can be more flexible. Our results also indicate that, in general a higher percentage of developing countries (i.e. both least developing and developing nations) have exhibited increasing trends in capacity, robustness, efficiency and flexibility of VWN compared to developed nations. It was revealed that the dynamics of VWNs are positively coupled with socio-economic growth for few countries, which indicates the sustainable behavior of VWN with socio-economic growth. Our results argue that the information theory-based metrics by embedding water footprints can holistically capture sustainability aspect of the VWN dynamics.

AB Storm drain inlet blockage causes more flooding incidents than does storm sewer overloading in flat urban catchments. Although inlet clearance has proved to be cost-effective in mitigating pluvial flooding, clearing all inlets in the wet season is unfeasible. No study has sought to partition the role of storm drain inlets because the dynamic flow exchange at every inlet is impossible to monitor at a catchment scale and even hard to calculate. This study presents a proactive approach to identifying strategic (i.e., most influential) inlets to save considerable labor costs in grate inlet maintenance. Our findings show that the tapered Pareto distribution can describe the distribution of inlet interception rates almost invariant to rainfall types. A modified Pareto principle called the 70-25 rule is derived, suggesting that 70% surface runoff is drained by the top 25% inlets. A nested hydrodynamic model, which solves full shallow water equations and captures detailed physical processes, was built to compute surface runoff intercepted by grate inlets in the built environment. The model is composed of a subcatchment scale, 2D-1D dual drainage model embedded in a catchment scale 1D model. The 2D-1D interaction was described by a piecewise function of piezometric head at the grate inlet; the parameters in each subfunction were statistically derived from a series of 3D numerical experiments involving full processes from free-surface flow to pressurized flow. The 2D model was built on a sensitivity-tested, unstructured mesh with allowable triangle areas ranging from 0.15 to 6 m(2). The simulations showed a mild (ca.5%) versus radical (40-50%) reduction in runoff interception with the removal of the non-strategic versus strategic inlets under non-extreme rainfalls. The application to the low-lying, ultra-urban test case confirmed the robustness and effectiveness of the method for strategic inlets identification.

AB A warming climate is expected to perturb the hydrological cycle, resulting in changes to both the frequency and duration of drought, especially in arid and semiarid grassland. Although considerable attention has been paid to the responses of key water fluxes to severe drought, few have explored the effects of prolonged drought on evapotranspiration (ET), its partitioning into vegetation transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (E), and its relationship with vegetation productivity. In this study, we used a combination of the eddy covariance (EC) flux technique and satellite remote sensing products to evaluate the effects of prolonged drought on ET components based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency (uWUE). The results showed T accounted for about 51% (standard deviation +/- 0.03%) of ET during prolonged drought lower than those in normal and/or wet years (range, 59-62%). We detected strong positive relationships between the T/ET ratios and aboveground biomass (AGB), leaf area index (LAI), and precipitation (R-2 of 0.80, 0.58, and 0.49, respectively). The specific responses of ecosystem functioning to prolonged drought indicated that grassland ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth to a certain extent unless extreme drought hit. The results implied that more intense and prolonged droughts will result in ecological degradation and substantial changes in ecosystem functioning. And these results improve our understanding of how the climate change will affect the function and structure of grassland ecosystem.

AB Linear relationships between regional water quality and catchment characteristics (terrain land cover geology base flow Index and rainfall) are examined for rivers in North West England using a GIS-based approach and an extensive Environment Agency water quality database The study considers the role of diffuse and distal point sources on river water quality The results show that base canon concentrations are strongly linked to catchment terrain and land cover while pH is linked to bedrock geology and land cover Mean nitrate concentrations are most strongly related to arable cover although distal point sources in urban and rural catchments appear to have a significant effect on river nitrate concentrations in the region Orthophosphate and suspended sediment concentrations are most closely related to the percentage urban development Linear models are tested on a large Independent water quality dataset resulting in maps showing predicted water quality across the region The approach works well for the prediction of nitrate concentrations and other constituents which have predominantly diffuse sources In contrast the linear approach to predicting orthophosphate concentrations in North West rivers using catchment characteristics is problematic The major influence of point sources may mask the effect of wider basin attributes on orthophosphate concentrations Within-river processing of phosphorus may also explain why the relationship breaks down Further work is needed to explain phosphorus contributions and variability in North West rivers especially in the context of effective catchment management (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Water level variation of explorational boreholes in mining sites is one of the most direct representations of water inrush risk. Despite recent efforts on mine water inrush accident prediction based on various types of observation data including water level of boreholes using a wide range of machine learning models, the accuracy and timeliness of the prediction for major accidents are still unsatisfactory. In this study, a novel prediction method based on the analysis of water level variation anomalies in borehole groups is proposed using the coupled model of long short-time memory (LSTM) and Isolation forest (IForest). Multi-variate LSTM algorithm is firstly used to model the correlated time sequence water level data in the borehole group, followed by the full extraction of the data variation feature based on the combination of variables including the prediction error being used as inputs of the IForest algorithm. As a result, anomalous variations of the data are detected as possible precursors of water inrush accident. Finally, a set of water inrush risk level grading rule is established based on the number of simultaneous anomalous data instances being detected within a borehole group. The results obtained for the water inrush accident in Xingdong coal mine demonstrate extraordinary timeliness and high accuracy as high water-inrush risk warning is issued for more than 2 days earlier than the time of actual sighting of the accident with very few false alarms being caused throughout the period of the testing dataset. This study provides an innovative solution to the low prediction accuracy and slow responding speed during major water inrush acci-dents of existing methods. The major parameters of the proposed coupled model of LSTM + IForest can also be easily calibrated based on traditional empirical methods for the best performance, allowing the method to be widely applied in various mining conditions.

AB Water quality and quantity data are essential for water resources management, but historical records are not always available at sites where information is required, especially for water quality (WQ) data because of the high costs of implementing and operating water quality monitoring networks. This leads to the impossibility/impracticality of monitoring all streams/watersheds in a region under monitoring. A novel statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of WQ characteristics (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) at ungauged streams/watersheds. The proposed approach is based on developing a WQ causes-effects functional relationship, which has not been done before. The WQ causes are represented by the watershed physiographic (natural and anthropogenic) attributes and the effects are represented by the WQ characteristics. For a target ungauged stream/watershed: (i) a canonical correlation analysis-based-neighborhood approach was applied to identify homogeneous gauged watersheds; and (ii) nonlinear regression models were then calibrated using data available at the selected gauged watersheds to develop the causes-effects functional relationship between the physiographic attributes as predictors, and WQ characteristics as dependent variables. Once the regression models were validated, the physiographic characteristics of the target ungauged stream/watershed were used to estimate its WQ characteristics. The jack-knife validation method was applied to evaluate the proposed statistical approach using 50 gauged streams from the Nile-Delta of Egypt. Results showed accurate and precise estimation of the Electric Conductivity and Sodium percentiles. For Iron, relatively less precision was obtained due to the absence of attributes that can describe the Iron concentrations.

AB We analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous U.S. Specifically, this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations, covering the period 1940-2013. Drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model. In addition to meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand), we obtained a number of topographic, soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin. A hydrological drought index (the Standardized Streamflow Index; SSI) was computed for each basin and linked to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity. The relationships between different SPEI time-scales and their corresponding SSI were assessed by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient. Also, the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis. Overall, results demonstrate a positive response of SSI to SPEI at shorter time-scales, with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences. We also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis. Results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of SSI to SPEI time-scales. Similar analyses were made for three sub-periods (1940-1964, 1965-1989 and 1989-2013), whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of SSI to SPEI over the past eighty years.

AB Hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is indispensable for describing water flow process in freezing soils. However, this conductivity is difficult to measure in the laboratory. So, the objective of this study is to propose a simple and smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFCC). Considering that the volume of pore water approximately represents the pore volume, the distribution of effective pore radii changed as a function of temperature was determined by combining the SFCC and the Gibbs-Thomson equation. Based on the distribution of effective pore radii, Hagen-Poiseuille equation, Darcy's law, relative hydraulic conductivity and tortuosity, a simple and smooth hydraulic conductivity model for saturated frozen soil based on the SFCC was proposed. To illustrate the model performance, eight existing experimental cases were analyzed. The results showed that predictions considering the three different tortuosity formulations were in good agreement with the tested data; the results were worse when not considering the tortuosity and the results were best when considering the tortuosity tau(F) = (B/r(b))(2). Moreover, the predictive modeling power was related to the tortuosity function. Furthermore, the model was further compared with the previous models, the results of which showed the better performance of the proposed model. The model is quite simple and timesaving to use when the SFCC and the saturated hydraulic conductivity are available. This result provides a new idea for developing the hydraulic conductivity model of saturated frozen soil.

AB Reaction-infiltration instability, in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore-fluid flow channels in fluid-saturated rocks, may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology. Although this topic has been studied for many years, there is a recent debate, which says that the use of large-density asymptotics in the previous studies is invalid. However, there is a crucial conceptual mistake in this debate, which leads to results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of physics. It is well known that in terms of distance, time and velocity, there are only two independent variables. But they are treated as three independent variables, a procedure that is the main source of the physically unrealistic results and conclusions in the debate. In this paper, we will discuss the results and conclusions related to the debate, with emphasis on the issues leading to the corresponding errors. In particular, we demonstrate that there is an unappreciated constraint condition between the dimensional/dimensionless distance, time and velocity in the debate. By using this constraint condition, it can be confirmed that as the ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration approaches zero, the dimensionless transport parameter, H, automatically approaches infinity. Therefore, it is further confirmed that the previous work conducted by Chadam and others remains valid. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The migration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from groundwater is an environmental concern because of the risk of vapor intrusion. In coastal aquifers or areas under the influence of systematic pumping, groundwater table fluctuations may be significant, which may affect VOC flux. This study developed a one-dimensional numerical model to simulate VOC mass transfer from groundwater to the vadose zone to the atmosphere, which was validated with data gained from a previously performed soil tank experiment. The numerical model revealed that groundwater table fluctuations in a simulated sandy aquifer cause VOC flux levels to increase by more than one order of magnitude. Furthermore, groundwater table fluctuations of larger amplitude are associated with larger VOC flux levels. Contaminants associated with larger Henry's law constants and smaller water-solid distribution coefficients are influenced to a greater extent by groundwater table fluctuations. In a coarse sand aquifer, the non-equilibrium model demonstrated that the VOC flux level is lower (18%) than that calculated if equilibrium is assumed, showing the equilibrium assumption to be somewhat conservative. Groundwater table fluctuations induce significant increases in VOC flux from soils of coarse or medium sand, while flux levels are not significantly affected in silt or clay soils. Rainfall only has a temporal effect on VOC flux during groundwater table fluctuations. The numerical model in this paper could help improve estimates of human health risk by VI in areas with groundwater table fluctuation. Further non-equilibrium studies are needed to estimate mass transfer coefficients among the three phases for different contaminants under different conditions.

AB Offshore fresh groundwater is increasingly suggested as a potential water resource for onshore human demands. In many cases, onshore pumping already draws significant fresh groundwater from offshore. However, offshore aquifers and the extent of offshore freshwater are usually poorly characterised due to data scarcity. This study combines geophysical data, hydraulic information and a first-order mathematical analysis to investigate offshore freshwater extent in the Gambier Embayment (Australia). A large seismic data set, combined with onshore and offshore bore-log geological profiles, are used to explore the regional offshore hydro-stratigraphy. Aquifer hydraulic parameters and onshore heads are obtained from onshore investigations. A novel application of Archie's law, geophysical data and onshore hydrochemical data provide useful insights into the salinity profiles within four offshore wells. These are compared to steady-state, sharp-interface estimates of the freshwater extent obtained from a recently developed analytical solution, albeit using simplified conceptual models. Salinities derived from resistivity measurements indicate that in the south of the study area, pore water with total dissolved solids (TDS) of 2.2 g L-1 is found up to 13.2 km offshore. Offshore pore-water salinities are more saline in the northern areas, most likely due to thinning of the offshore confining unit. The analytical solution produced freshwater-saltwater interface locations that were approximately consistent with the freshwater-saltwater stratification in two of the offshore wells, although analytical uncertainty is high. This investigation provides a leading example of offshore freshwater evaluation applying multiple techniques, demonstrating both the benefit and uncertainty of geophysical interpretation and analytical solutions of freshwater extent.

ID VOLUME CONSERVATION; KINEMATIC WAVE; CUNGE METHOD; SCHEME; MASS
AB A wide range of approaches are used for flow routing in hydrological models. One of the most attractive solutions is the variable-parameter Muskingum (VPM) method. Its major advantage consists in the fact that (i) it can be applied to poorly-gauged basins with unknown channel geometries, (ii) it requires short execution time and (iii) it adequately captures, also in the presence of mild slopes, the most salient features of a dynamic wave such as the looped rating curve and the steepening of the rising limb of the hydrograph. In addition, the method offers the possibility to derive average water levels for a reach segment, a quantity which is essential in flood forecasting and flood risk assessment. For reasons of computational economy the method is also appropriate for applications, in which hydrological and global circulation models (GCM) are coupled, and where computational effort becomes an issue. The VPM approach is presented from a philosophical and conceptual perspective, by showing the derivation of its mass and momentum balance properties from the point to the finite scale, and by demonstrating its strengths by means of an application in an operational context. The principal novel contributions of the article relate to (a) the extension of the Muskingum-Cunge-Todini approach to accept uniformly distributed lateral inflow, (b) the use of power law cross sections and (c) the validation of the method through a long-term simulation of a real-world case, including the comparison of results to those obtained using a full Saint Venant equations model.

AB Soil moisture systems generally exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns due to their nonlinear interactions with surrounding environments. In this paper, the possible existence of chaotic behaviors in soil moisture time series was investigated using the chaos theory, specifically based on the techniques of phase space reconstruction, correlation dimension (CD), largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), and local approximation prediction (LAP) methods. Daily soil moisture data for six years along with different influencing factors were obtained for 35 Nebraska Mesonet (NM) stations with varying hydroclimatic conditions and soil properties. The results of CDs and LLEs revealed the presence of chaos in soil moisture systems, implying that soil moisture dynamics was controlled by deterministic systems with a limited number of governing variables. The results obtained by the LAP method offered further evidence on the chaotic behavior of soil moisture systems. Specifically, Median of CD values of 4.51, 4.06, 3.23, and 1.40 were obtained for soil moisture time series at the depths of 10, 25, 50, and 100 cm, respectively, indicating that the complexity of soil moisture systems decreased with increasing depth. Moreover, the correlations of CDs with different influencing factors showed that the dominant controls on soil moisture dynamics switched at different depths. At shallower depths (e.g., 10 and 25 cm), CDs were more correlated with meteorological forcings, while stronger correlations emerged between CDs and soil texture in deeper soil layers (e.g., 50 and 100 cm). As the first attempt to analyze the complexity of soil moisture systems from the perspective of the chaos theory, the results of this study offer additional avenues for understanding chaotic behaviors of soil moisture dynamics.

AB The aim of this research is to enlarge knowledge of space-time evolution of precipitation in California over the last decade on a monthly, seasonal and annual time-scale. This study also analyses the relationship between precipitation and teleconnection patterns with most influence on Californian climate. The homogeneity of the data from the selected stations was verified and finally 165 meteorological stations were used with an observation period that ranged from 1980 to 2019. In order to evaluate trends and statistical significance, both the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and modified Sen's slope method were used. Correlation analysis using the partial non-parametric Spearman Test (95% confidence level) was performed to find out relationships between precipitation and nine teleconnection patterns in the State of California. Spatial analysis was achieved using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK). Finally, this research, as a novelty, shows regionalisation of California State as a function of significance in the correlation of precipitation with teleconnection patterns. To achieve this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster analysis (HCA) was performed. Results show a positive precipitation trend in winter and negative precipitation trend in late summer and autumn. The teleconnection patterns more correlated with precipitation are El Nin similar to o along Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Four areas were discerned outlining the Mojave Climate Region (Area 4) by having ENSO as the teleconnection pattern that best account precipitation.

ID EROSION MODEL; SOILS
AB Hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix dynamically responds to changes in the surrounding environment. Therefore, infiltration parameters for the Green-Ampt equation should change for each storm event in continuous simulation models. This study focused on improving Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model estimates of runoff using over 220 plot-years of natural runoff plot data from 11 locations. By optimizing the effective Green-Ampt hydraulic conductivity, K-e, for each event within the simulation, a method of correlating hydraulic conductivity on any given day to many other parameters was established. Factors with significant correlation to optimized values of K-e fell into three distinct categories; (1) factors related to soil crusting and tillage; (2) factors related to event size; (3) factors related to antecedent moisture conditions. Equations were developed to represent the temporal variability of hydraulic conductivity for each group. The equation describing the decrease in hydraulic conductivity owing to crusting used an exponential decay function based primarily on cumulative rainfall kinetic energy since last tillage, a soil stability factor, and a crust factor. The relationship between hydraulic conductivity and event size was characterized using an exponential relationship with total rainfall kinetic energy. The final adjustment used the moisture content immediately below the infiltration zone to account for the influence of antecedent moisture conditions on optimized hydraulic conductivities. All three adjustments were incrementally incorporated into WEPP and each improved the average model efficiency.

AB Efficient simulation of rainfall-runoff relationships is one of the most complex problems owing to the high number of interrelated hydrological processes. It is well-known that machine learning models could fail in simulating streamflows from only meteorological variables in the absence of antecedent streamflow values. The main reason for this could be low and lagged relationships between streamflow and meteorological variables. To overcome this inefficiency, for the first time, we developed a simulation framework by coupling a base flow separation method to three machine learning methods. It was demonstrated that separating streamflow into different components such as base flow and surface flow can be useful for improving simulation and forecasting capabilities of machine learning models. We simulated streamflow in four rivers in the United States with Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) as a function of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We concluded that the base flow separation method improved the simulation performances of the machine learning models to a certain degree. Apart from the simulation scheme, we also employed a forecasting scheme by using the antecedent observed discharge values in addition to P, T, and PET. We discussed performances of models in simulation and forecasting of streamflow regarding model types, input structures and catchment dynamics in detail.

AB Environmental isotopes ((2)H or D, (18)O, (3)H), along with geology, hydrochemistry and in situ physiochemical parameters (EC, T. DO, pH) were employed to study surface water (reservior, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationships at (1) Nagewadi, a minor irrigation project in the State of Maharashtra, Western India; (2) Kanhirapuzha reservoir in the State of Kerala, Southern India and (3) Ghatghar Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project in the State of Maharashtra. Western India for the purpose of understanding the seepage/leakage and its associated problems. The studies concluded that the springs found downstream of the Nagewadi project originate from the reservoir and not from the abutments or shallow aquifers. The Kanhirapuzha reservoir receives a substantial base-flow component compared to riverine inputs. The reason for the water-logging problem at a nearby downstream village during the non-summer periods is due to the change in the upstream groundwater flow direction under reservior filling conditions and is not due to reservior leakage. Most of the springs in the approach tunnel to the underground power house of the Ghatghar Project originate from the lower reservior and not from the upper reservoir or the overburden rock matrix. The above case studies illustarte the diversity of environmental isotope applications in surface water (reservoir, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationship related to sustainability of hydro-projects.

AB Statistical properties of rain exhibit the interesting feature that they depend in a nontrivial way on the length and time scales over which rain rate is averaged. A quantitative understanding of this dependence can be utilized to relate statistics at different scales and is important for inter-comparison of rainfall data obtained from measuring devices with differing space-time resolutions. A stochastic dynamical model of rainfall based on a fractional diffusion type kinetic equation introduced earlier by the authors describes fairly well how the second moment statistics of area-averaged rain rate depend on the averaging length L and predicts a power law scaling behavior as L -> 0. The model pictures the correlation of the precipitation field as arising from two-dimensional Levy flights. The present paper extends the investigation to the full space-time covariance function of the precipitation field. In particular, a scaling regime is identified in which the various second moment statistics of area- and/or time-averaged rain field exhibit invariance under a combined rescaling of the space and time variables-a property known as dynamic scaling, the scaling exponent being identified with the Levy index. Although the space and time scales resolved in the radar data used to establish the model turn out to be too coarse for the dynamic scaling behavior to be experimentally demonstrated, we predict that it should be observable in high frequency rain gauge data from dense gauge networks.

AB Climate change, population growth, and weakly developed water management institutions in many of the world's dry communities have raised the importance of designing innovative water allocation methods, that adapt to water supply fluctuations while respecting cultural sensitivities. For example, Afghanistan faces an ancient history of water supply fluctuations that have contributed to periodic food shortage and famine. Poorly designed and weakly enforced water allocation methods continue to result in agriculture sector underperformance and periodic food shortages when water shortfalls occur. To date, little research has examined alternative water sharing rules on a multi-basin scale to protect food security for a subsistence irrigation society when the community faces water shortage. This paper's contribution examines the economic performance of three water-sharing mechanisms for three basins in Afghanistan with the goal of protecting food security for crop irrigation under ongoing threats of drought, while meeting growing demands for food in the face of anticipated population growth. We achieved this by formulating an integrated empirical optimization model to identify water-sharing measures that minimize economic losses while protecting food security when water shortages occur. Findings show that implementation of either a water trading policy or a proportional shortage policy that respects cultural sensitivities has the potential to raise economic welfare in each basin. Such a policy can reduce food insecurity risks for all trading provinces within each basin, thus being a productive institution for adapting to water shortage when it occurs. Total economic welfare gains are highest when drought is the most severe for which suffering would otherwise be greatest. Gains would be considerably higher if water storage reservoirs were built to store wet year flows for use in dry years. Our results light a path for policy makers, donors, water administrators, and farm managers, who shoulder the burden of protecting food security and rural livelihoods in the world's poor dry communities.

AB Diffusivity was measured for 12 rock and construction material samples using a diffusion chamber method with oxygen as the tracer gas. Several steps were implemented to minimize leakage between the sample and the core holder, and rigorous tests were performed to evaluate and correct the overall leakage of the diffusion apparatus. This method was proven capable of rapidly measuring the diffusion coefficient for consolidated samples having dimensionless diffusivity values greater than 4.7 x 10(-4) in a relative short duration (hours to 1 day). Gas diffusion measurements were also conducted for 11 repacked sediments and sands. Our results are consistent with literature data from liquid tracer through-diffusion methods; the diffusivity versus porosity relationship for our data can be described by Archie's law. The m value in Archie's law was found to be correlated to pore size: the finer the pore size is, the larger the m value is. A linear regression equation can describe the change of m with ln d(50) (the volumetric mean pore diameter) for most rocks with d(50) < 1.3 mu m, while the outliers can be correlated to narrower pore size distribution.

AB The Indian Ocean which is home to many islands and the low-lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes. In this study, we examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. Various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable. Based on the cross-validation analysis, the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes. The analysis reveals that Bangladesh, Seychelles, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise. These regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades, posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems. Flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. In addition, relationships between regional factors (sea surface temperature, air temperature, and vertical land motions) affecting sea level rise are investigated. Our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of Seychelles and Cocos Islands. There is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions. This study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. The methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world.

AB Sustainable groundwater management is becoming increasingly important due to intensifying water deficits around the world, which highlights the necessities and challenges to explore the dynamics of groundwater at the catchment-scale. In this paper, a tracer-aided approach has been developed and applied to quantify the relationships between groundwater storage and discharge, upon which the dynamics of groundwater storage and its residence time are assessed. Robust nonlinear storage-discharge relationships are found for the eight studied catchments located in a headwater region of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The dynamics of groundwater storage for all the studied catchments largely show synchronization with regional climate. The estimated highest and active groundwater storages in a year are more responsive to precipitation than the lowest storages. For all the studied catchments, during dry seasons without recharge, the depletion rate of groundwater is found to decrease with the decline in groundwater storage, which can be ascribed to the vertical heterogeneity of their unconfined aquifers. The mean residence time of groundwater represented by MRT75 (i.e. time taken for groundwater storage to diminish from its mean level to the 75th percentile) varies between 57 and 111 days across the studied catchments, suggesting considerable hydrogeological differences among the studied catchments. The groundwater dynamics observed in this research could contribute to improving hydrogeological model performance in simulating the connection between groundwater and surface water at the catchment-scale. Moreover, the findings could serve to develop guidelines for groundwater extraction when considering the constraints of environmental flow requirements.

AB Comparative water potential and chloride profiles (similar to 10 m deep) collected from four vegetation communities in the Trans-Pecos region of the Chihuahuan Desert were assessed to evaluate the potential for using vegetation patterns as a means of efficiently improving large-scale estimates of basin-floor recharge in semiarid and and regions. Analytical solutions and multiphase flow and transport modeling constrained flux histories and current fluxes across the water table at each site. Chloride bulge profiles containing similar to 12- 15 kyr of atmospheric deposition and long-term drying water potential profiles typified most desertscrub and grassland sites. In contrast, evidence of episodic sub-root zone percolation and chloride profiles containing < 250 yr of atmospheric deposition characterized the woodland site. The results suggested that the desertscrub and grassland areas support small upward fluxes across the water table (nonrecharge), whereas the woodland site supports significant downward fluxes across the water table (recharge). A nonrecharge -recharge transition was identified to be collocated with a grassland- woodland ecotone. The establishment of vegetation - recharge relationships such as this will improve estimates of basin-scale recharge by identifying regions where no recharge is expected and regions where recharge is expected and point measurements should be concentrated. An approach integrating remotely sensed spatial distributions of vegetation and indicator relationships to recharge is both timely and warranted, although several caveats, as revealed in this study, should be noted. For example, the relative importance and distribution of vertical conduits that permit percolation to the water table merits future investigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, new factors that influence precipitation were extracted from geographic variables using factor analysis, which allow for an accurate estimation of orographic precipitation. Correlation analysis was also used to examine the relationship between nine topographic variables from digital elevation models (DEMs) and the precipitation in Jeju Island. In addition, a spatial analysis was performed in order to verify the validity of the regression model. From the results of the correlation analysis, it was found that all of the topographic variables had a positive correlation with the precipitation. The relations between the variables also changed in accordance with a change in the precipitation duration. However, upon examining the correlation matrix, no significant relationship between the latitude and the aspect was found. According to the factor analysis, eight topographic variables (latitude being the exception) were found to have a direct influence on the precipitation. Three factors were then extracted from the eight topographic variables. By directly comparing the multiple regression model with the factors (model 1) to the multiple regression model with the topographic variables (model 3), it was found that model 1 did not violate the limits of statistical significance and multicollinearity. As such, model 1 was considered to be appropriate for estimating the precipitation when taking into account the topography. In the study of model 1, the multiple regression model using factor analysis was found to be the best method for estimating the orographic precipitation on Jeju Island. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB For a few decades the local rainfall measurements are generally obtained by tipping bucket sensors, that allow to record each tipping time corresponding to a well-known rain depth. However, a considerable part of rainfall data to be used in the hydrological practice is available in aggregated form within constant time intervals. This can produce undesirable effects, like the underestimation of the annual maximum rainfall depth, H-d, associated with a given duration, d, that is the basic quantity in the development of rainfall depth-duration-frequency relationships. The errors in the evaluation of H-d from data characterized by a coarse temporal aggregation, t(a), and a procedure to reduce the non-homogeneity of the H-d series are here investigated. Our results show that for t(a) = 1 min the underestimation is practically negligible, whereas for larger temporal aggregations with d = t(a) the error in a single Hd can reach values up to 50% and in a series of H-d in the average up to 17%. Relationships between the non-dimensional ratio t(a)/d and the average underestimation of H-d, derived through continuous rainfall data observed in many stations of Central Italy, are presented to overcome this issue. These equations allow to improve the H-d estimates and the associated depth-duration-frequency curves at least in areas with similar climatic conditions. The effect of the correction of the H-d series on the rainfall depth-duration-frequency curves is quantified. Our results indicate that the improvements obtained by the proposed procedure are of the order of 10%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONTINENTAL DIFFERENCES; RELIABILITY; VARIABILITY
AB This is the second of three papers describing hydrologic analyses of monthly and annual streamflow data for a global set of 729 unregulated rivers with at least 25 years of continuous data. Capacity estimates of hypothetical reservoirs are computed for each river using the Sequent Peak Algorithm (SPA), Behaviour analysis and the Goutd-Dincer Gamma procedure. Based on SPA and Behaviour procedures, empirical relationships relating reservoir capacity and yield were developed which accounted for 87-96% of the variance in capacity estimates across the global data set of monthly streamflows. The theoretical Gould-Dincer Gamma procedure was also shown to be a suitable technique to estimate reservoir capacity-yield relationships. It is noted that the three procedures are based on different definitions of supply reliability. Continental variations of the estimated capacities under equivalent conditions are examined. Reservoir performance measures - reliability, resilience and dimensionless vulnerability - are computed and their continental variations described. As a result of these analyses a number of differences are noted about the performance of reservoirs across continental regions. For example, the median continental reservoir capacity as a ratio of the mean annual flow varied by a factor of 9 across the continental regions. Furthermore, based on the reliability metric as an example of reservoir performance, high reliabitities occur in the South Pacific and Europe, slightly less reliable systems in North and South America, tower still in northern Africa, followed by Australia and the lowest value in southern Africa. This distribution follows inversely with the coefficient of variation of annual streamflow between continents. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In response to the severe water crisis in Iran, the Iranian government has changed its approach to the management of the country's water resources in different sectors from supply-side to demand-side management-an approach that relies on reducing water demand. In this regard, due to the high consumption of water in the agricultural sector, switching from rice cultivation that requires large amounts of water, to less water-intensive crops were considered a priority for the country, and the government banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation policy. It is however very difficult for a government or any other power to enforce such a measure as it must be voluntarily accepted by end users (i.e., farmers) to be successful. Therefore, the success of this policy largely depends on what the public think of such measures. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to know how farmers think and behave in terms of these policies. The aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about farmers' intention toward changing the rice cropping system. To achieve our goal, we used a social-psychological theory known as the Theory of Interpersonal Behavior. A sample of 250 rice growers in southwest Iran was selected. Structural equation modeling showed that farmers' intention to change from rice cultivation to another crop is determined by personal norms, beliefs about their role and emotional considerations.

AB In large river basins, there may be considerable variations in both climate and land use across the region. The evapotranspiration that occurs over a basin may be drastically different from one part of the region to another. The potential influence of these variations in evapotranspiration estimated for the catchment is weakened by using a spatially based distributed hydrological model in such a study. Areal evapotranspiration is estimated by means of approaches requiring only meteorological data: the combination equation (CE) model and the complementary relationship approach-the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration (CRAE) and advection-aridity (AA) models. The capability of three models to estimate the evapotranspiration of catchments with complex topography and land-use classification is investigated, and the models are applied to two catchments with different characteristics and scales for several representative years. Daily, monthly, and annual evapotranspiration are estimated with different accuracy. The result shows that the modified CE model may underestimate the evapotranspiration in some cases. The CRAE and AA models seem to be two kinds of effective alternatives for estimating catchment evapotranspiration. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB A refined version of a conditional phosphorus risk index (PRI) for P losses to waters was developed based on monitoring and analyses of PRI factors from an agricultural catchment in Sweden. The catchment has a hummocky landscape of heavy glacial till overlying moraine and an overall balanced soil P level. Single P source factors and combinations of factors were tested and discussed together with water movement and water management factors important for catchments dominated by drained clay soils. An empirical relationship was established (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.861, p < 0.001) between phosphorus sorption index (PSI-CaCl2), measured in a weak calcium chloride solution, and iron (Fe-AL) aluminium (Al-AL) and phosphorus (P-AL) in soil extract with acid ammonium lactate. Differing relationships were found for a field that had not received any manure in the last 15 years and a field that had received chicken litter very recently. In addition, a general relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.839, p < 0.001) was found between the ratio of phosphorus extracted from fresh soil in water (Pw) to PSI-CaCl2 and the degree of phosphorus saturation in lactate extract (DPS-AL). One exception was a single field, representing 7% of agricultural land in the catchment, that had been treated with glyphosate shortly before soil sampling. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC) in heavy clay in contact with the moraine base (at 1 m depth) was on average 0.06 m day(-1). In clay not in contact with moraine, SHC was significantly lower (mean 0.007 m day(-1)). A reduction in the present tile drain spacing (from 14-16 m to 11 m) is theoretically required to maintain satisfactory water discharge and groundwater level. Up to 10% of the arable land was estimated to be a potential source area for P. based on different indices. Parts of a few fields close to farm buildings (1% of total arable land) were identified as essential P source areas, with high DPS-AL values and low PSI-CaCl2 values throughout the soil profile. A further 2% of arable land was identified as potential important transport areas, based on visible surface water rills or frequent water-ponded conditions. Fields comprising 10% of the total arable land in the catchment should be re-drained in the near future to improve water infiltration and avoid unnecessary channelised water flow. The need for an improved PRI for erosion and water transport is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An optimized groundwater monitoring network is essential for agricultural irrigation that uses groundwater resources. This technical note presents a new scheme to optimize the existing groundwater-level monitoring network in the Zhangye Basin, China. The scheme integrates kriging theory, spatial stratification and temporal stability analysis. The optimized results indicate that the number of additional observation wells in each stratum is correlated with the number of existing wells, the stratum areas and the temporal stability of the groundwater-level spatial pattern. These findings are consistent with expectations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated, and its implementation is simple, robust and flexible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Some data on the flow of fluids in rocks exhibit properties which may not be interpreted with the classic theory of propagation of pressure and of fluids in porous media [Bell and Nur, 1978; Roeloffs, 1988] based on Darcy's law, which states that the flux is proportional to the pressure gradient. Concerning the fluids, some may react chemically with the medium enlarging the pores; some carry solid particles, which may obstruct some of the pores; and finally, some may precipitate minerals in the pores diminishing their size or even closing them as in geothermal areas. These phenomena create a spatially variable pattern of mineralization and permeability changes that can be localized. In order to obtain a better representation of the flux and of the pressure of fluids, Darcy's law is modified, introducing general memory formalisms operating on the flow as well as on the pressure gradient, which imply a filtering of the pressure gradient without singularities. We also modify the second constitutive equation of diffusion, which relates the density variations of the fluid to the pressure, by introducing a rheology in the fluid also represented by memory formalisms operating on the pressure as well as on the density variations. The memory formalisms are then specified as derivatives of fractional order. The equations used here for the diffusion of fluids are different from the classic ones; however, the equation governing the diffusion of the pressure is the same as that of the flux, as in the classic case. For technical reasons the majority of the studies on diffusion is devoted to the diffusion of the pressure of the fluid rather than to the flux; in this paper we shall devote our attention to studying the flux and its spectral properties in a practical example seeing that the memory used implies a low-pass filtering of the flux or a band pass centered in the low-frequency range. A half space is considered where the boundary values are applied to the plane limiting it, and the problems solved are the computation of the Green function of the flux in the cases when (1) a pressure constant in time is applied on the boundary plane and (2) a periodic pressure is applied to the boundary plane while the half space is initially at zero pressure in both cases. We found closed form formulae for the flux and its spectrum. A discussion follows concerning the mode of determination of the parameters of memory formalisms ruling the diffusion using the observed pressure and/or the flux at several frequencies in problem 2. Concerning the flux, it is tentatively seen that when the medium is oil rock and the fluid is water, for a pressure of 10(5) Pa at the boundary and derivative of order 0.1, the flux at a distance of 0.1 km from the boundary plane is 1700 kg h(-1).

AB Accurate projection of global warming on the probabilistic behavior of hydro-climate variables is one of the main challenges in climate change impact assessment studies. Due to the complexity of climate associated processes, different sources of uncertainty influence the projected behavior of hydro climate variables in regression-based statistical downscaling procedures. The current study presents a comprehensive methodology to improve the predictive power of the procedure to provide improved projections. It does this by minimizing the uncertainty sources arising from the high-dimensionality of atmospheric predictors, the complex and nonlinear relationships between hydro-climate predictands and atmospheric predictors, as well as the biases that exist in climate model simulations. To address the impact of the high dimensional feature spaces, a supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm is presented that is able to capture the nonlinear variability among projectors through extracting a sequence of principal components that have maximal dependency with the target hydro-climate variables. Two soft-computing nonlinear machine-learning methods, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), are engaged to capture the nonlinear relationships between predictand and atmospheric predictors. To correct the spatial and temporal biases over multiple time scales in the GCM predictands, the Multivariate Recursive Nesting Bias Correction (MRNBC) approach is used. The results demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the downscaling procedure in terms of precipitation projection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Depth-to-water measurements from 181 monitoring wells in unconfined or semi-confined aquifers in nine regions of the central and northeastern U.S. were analyzed. Groundwater storage exhibited strong seasonal variations in all regions, with peaks in spring and lows in autumn, and its interannual variability was nearly unbounded, such that the impacts of droughts, floods, and excessive pumping could persist for many years. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies (deviations from the long term mean) increases as a power function of extent scale (square root of area). That relationship, which is linear on a log-log graph, is common to other hydrological variables but had never before been shown with groundwater data. We describe how the derived power function can be used to determine the number of wells needed to estimate regional mean groundwater storage anomalies with a desired level of accuracy, or to assess uncertainty in regional mean estimates from a set number of observations. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies within a region often increases with the absolute value of the regional mean anomaly, the opposite of the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability and mean. Recharge (drainage from the lowest model soil layer) simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was compatible with observed monthly groundwater storage anomalies and month-to-month changes in groundwater storage.

AB Glacier shrinkage caused by climate change is likely to trigger diminished and less consistent stream flow in glacier-fed watersheds worldwide. To understand, model, and adapt to these climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1) political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use; and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water use-including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation, large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use practices did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately, then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone. Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the development of climate change adaptation plans.

   PRODUCTION; MODEL
AB The TOPMODEL is a variable contributing area conceptual model in which the predominant factors determining the formation of runoff are represented by the topography of the basin and a negative exponential law linking the transmissivity of the soil with the distance to the saturated zone below the ground level. Although conceptual, this model is frequently described as a 'physically based model' in the sense that its parameters can be measured directly in situ. In line with the analysis of various conceptual rainfall-runoff models conducted by Franchini and Pacciani (J. Hydrol., 122: 161-219, 1991), a detailed analysis of the TOPMODEL is performed to arrive at a closer understanding of the correspondence of the assumptions underpinning the model with the physical reality and, in particular, the role that topographic information (expressed by the topographic index curve) and the nature of the soil (expressed by saturated hydraulic conductivity and its decay with soil depth), have within the model itself. Also investigated is the extent to which the model parameters actually reflect the physical properties to which they refer and how far their values offset the inevitable schematisation of the model. The various applications to real situations include the Sieve basin (river Arno tributary), which was used for the comparison of conceptual rainfall-runoff models described in the above-mentioned study by Franchini and Pacciani. This allows that analysis to be extended to the TOPMODEL.

AB Water flow to subterranean drains is described by using the Boussinesq equation subjected to radiation type boundary conditions; these conditions establish a relationship between drainage flux and water head at the drain. Analyzed radiation conditions are a quadratic polynomial equivalent to the Hooghoudt equation and a power function; both conditions contain linear and quadratic radiations. Evidence is given that these last radiations correspond to the extreme probabilistic models of water flow proposed, respectively, by Purcell [Purcell, W.R., 1949. Capillary pressures their measurement using mercury and the calculation of permeability thereform. Petr. Trans., Amer. Inst. Mining Metall Eng. 186, 39-48] and Childs and Collis-George [Childs, E.C., Collis-George, N., 1950. The permeability of porous materials. Proc. R. Soc., Ser. A 201, 392-405].
   Hooghoudt type radiation results from a convex combination of extreme radiations using a reference flux and an interpolation factor as parameters. Power radiation is established from both fractal geometry concepts and partially correlated water flow by soil structure. This fractal radiation contains a reference flux and an exponent equal to double of the surface soil-particles fractal. dimension with regards to Euclidean soil dimension. Considering that convex radiation is an approximation to fractal radiation, the least square method allows us to establish a relationship between the interpolation factor and the exponent of the fractal. radiation.
   We use a numerical solution to the Boussinesq equation subjected to radiation conditions to describe a drainage experiment performed in the laboratory. The results shows that the cumulative drained depth is better represented by fractal and convex radiations rather than by extreme ones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Annual and monthly streamflows for 729 rivers from a global data set are used to assess the adequacy of five techniques to estimate the relationship between reservoir capacity, target draft (or yield) and reliability of supply. The techniques examined are extended deficit analysis (EDA), behaviour analysis, sequent peak algorithm (SPA), Vogel and Stedinger empirical (lognormal) method and Phien empirical (Gamma) method. In addition, a technique to adjust SPA using annual flows to account for within-year variations is assessed. Of our nine conclusions the key ones are, firstly, EDA is a useful procedure to estimate streamflow deficits and, hence, reservoir capacity for a given reliability of supply. Secondly, the behaviour method is suitable to estimate storage but has limitations if an annual time step is adopted. Thirdly, in contrast to EDA and behaviour which are based on time series of flows, if only annual statistics are available, the Vogel and Stedinger empirical method compares favorably with more detailed simulation approaches.

AB An OBJect-oriented TOPographic-based (OBJTOP) hydrological model with a graphical user interface (GUI) was created using object-oriented design (OOD) methods and the objected-oriented programming (OOP) language-C + +. OBJTOP presents an array of alternative TOPMODEL hydrological processes of (1) saturation excess or the mixture of infiltration/saturation excess overland flow, (2) exponential or power law decay of hydraulic conductivity with soil depth, (3) topographic index (TI) or soil topographic index (STI) weighting of run-off likelihood, and (4) simulations with or without channel routing, to explain watershed response and increase flexibility and applicability. OBJTOP utilized an object-oriented design (OOD) approach, including the 'inheritance' concept to study individual objects (or processes) at multiple levels, and the,aggregation' concept to study the interactions of objects (or processes). Further, OOD readily provides for model extension, creating a description of hydrologic processes in a natural, direct, concise, and adaptable manner distinct from procedurally designed and implemented models. The OBJTOP GUI provides an efficient tool for data input, parameter modification, simulation scheme selection and model calibration with three objective functions, including Nash-Sutcliffe. Graphical outputs include time series plots of precipitation depth, partitioned run-off volumes, watertable depth (average or TI/STI based), and map graphics of TI, STI, and depth to watertable. Applications illustrating OBJTOP ability and flexibility include simulation of the TOPMODEL standard Slapton Wood, UK dataset, and simulation of Ward Pound Ridge, NY a small forested catchment with power function decay of hydraulic conductivity and extensive impervious surfaces.

AB The flow behavior in smooth and artificial rough fractures is experimentally investigated. The piezometric head is measured at several positions to determine experimentally the head gradient through a sophisticated procedure, and the hypothesis of one-dimensional flow is verified. It is demonstrated that both the Forchheimer and Izbash equations adequately describe the flow conditions, and proper coefficients for these equations are estimated. The experimental results are also used to construct a Moodytype diagram, where a non-monotonic dependence is shown to characterize the friction factor - Reynolds number relationship in the transition between laminar and weak turbulent flow.

AB Stream sampling programmes for water quality estimation constitute a statistical survey of a correlated population. The properties of parameter and other estimates made from sample values from such programmes are set in the context of statistical sampling theory. It is shown that a model-based rather than a design-based approach to statistical analysis is usually appropriate. The influence of model structure and sampling design on the robustness and suitability of estimation procedures is investigated, and relationships with kriging are demonstrated. Methodology is discussed with reference to data from a UK sampling programme.

AB Can total annual streamflow in any given year be largely characterised by a relatively small number of high flow events? A comprehensive assessment of this is of high value as there is evidence to suggest that as flood events increase in rarity a more consistent response between streamflow extremes and temperatures increases can be established - providing greater reliability in projections of rare events. We propose here a novel methodology to characterise streamflow regimes in the context of total annual streamflow for water supply. Using the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Hydrologic Reference Station database, we developed annual event flow distributions that standardise the relationship between total annual streamflow and event flows. It was found that the annual event flow distributions are primarily a function of local climate and catchment size and were largely insensitive to interannual variability represented by the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation Index, mean annual temperature, or total annual rainfall volume. Statistically significant trends were found in the timeseries of annual event flow distribution values, signalling a move to a less even distribution in the southern latitudes and a more even distribution in the northern latitudes. Our results show that total annual streamflows can be characterised by a small number of high flow events. This suggests that for Australia's most critical surface drinking water supply catchments the streamflow yields can be represented by changes in a few, high flow events, independent of interannual variability. As these relationships are non-stationary, they may provide a basis for understanding changes in water supply into the future.

AB The spatiotemporal variability in precipitation could have a significant impact on ground subsidence. In this paper, we utilize a previously developed one-dimensional theory of consolidation for a two-fluid system, the generalization of Biot's theory, to investigate the impact of a time-dependent fluid flux across the surface of an unsaturated soil on the solid deformation and pore pressure responses. We consider three prescribed fluid flux patterns and the associated gradient of pore water pressure: constant, periodic, and exponential flux patterns. We employ a Fourier series representation and Laplace transformation in the space and time domains to derive a complete set of closed-form analytical solutions, including the complementary and particular solutions, describing both transient and steady-state excess pore water and pore air pressure responses as well as the total settlement induced by the fluid flux. Using two different types of soil, i.e. clay and sand, we demonstrate the dependence of the solution on the initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity in the saturated and unsaturated regimes. Results of this study reveal that the fluid flux across the surface could have a significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the time evolution of the total settlement of the ground surface. The effect on the pore water pressure is more significant for sand than for clay irrespective of moisture content, mainly because of the much higher hydraulic conductivity of sand. Finally, we show that the hydraulic conductivity has a dominant effect on the consolidation behaviors of saturated and unsaturated soils subjected to surface fluid flux.

AB Shale gas and oil, as unconventional clean energy sources, has shown growing importance to addressing increasingly serious energy crisis. The bottleneck limiting widespread shale development and utilization is the large amounts of water consumptions during well drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. However, little attention has been paid to water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently available; moreover, previous studies using mathematical models can only depend on clear understanding of stringent physical law, implied mechanisms, and quantitative data. Focusing on twelve shale regions in Southwest China, we construct the first knowledge graph (KG) in the world and then use a RippleNet algorithm (RNA) to fulfill smart recom-mendation of water use policies base on the KG. By comparing results under four scenarios, we find that the identified policies vary with accessible cities and water resources, depending on the priority experience (i.e., historical records) input to RNA. Three mathematically based programming models are parallelly developed to generate optimal water use policies for comparing with those from smart recommendation. Similarities are found among the policies though discrepancies occur in part of scenarios. Despite the difficulty in evaluating the priority of each policy, the most remarkable advantage in this smart recommendation lie in the 1) independence on quantitative data (from monitoring or statistics) and mechanism modeling, and 2) capability of using a preference probability to suggest the likelihood or preference of each policy to be recommended. Outputs from this research provides new technical implication on developing conjunctive water-use and energy-extraction policies.

AB Frost heave models are important tools to study engineering damage in cold regions. However, multi-physical -field-coupling and different methods of coupling components bring difficulties to compare the models and to optimize their error sources. Therefore, classifying and deconstructing of different frost heave models and further evaluating them are significant for model development. We reviewed frost heave models for the past 50 years and built frost heave model families to show the classification and inheritance relationships. Then, the models were deconstructed by the thermal-hydraulic framework (THF) and frost heave quantification method (FHQM). Finally, based on simulated and experimental data in cited papers, the model errors caused by different THFs and FHQMs were analyzed. The results show: (a) Present frost heave models can be classified as porosity increase based (P) and ice lens increase based (I) models and they are tending to merge with each other; (b) THFs of P models regarding freezing soil as porous medium are the main reason for water migration error in the region of multi-ice layers, which also results high uncertainty of hydraulic parameters under different simulation condi-tions; (c) The most used two FHQMs of P models cause error exceeding 20 % because inaccurate relationship between pore strain and frost heave displacement; (d) The errors of THFs and FHQMs offset each other, which will hidden the error sources of the models. This paper can provide a reference for the improvement of frost heave models used in engineering.

AB In the realm of sustainability science, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the basal condition of a natural system as well as its long-term behavior. Research is needed to better explain the temporal scaling of water chemistry in streams and watersheds and its relationship with the hydrologic factors that influence its behavior. Persistence of dissolved chemicals in streams has been demonstrated to be linked to certain hydrologic processes, such as interaction between hydrologic units and storage in surface or sub-surface systems. In this study, spectral and wavelet analyses provided a novel theoretical basis for insights into long-term chloride behavior in an east Tennessee watershed. Temporal scaling analyses were conducted on weekly time series data of chloride collected from November 1995 to December 2005 at the West Fork of Walker Branch in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The objectives of the study were to: evaluate chloride concentration (a conservative solute) to determine the presence of statistical persistence and the relationship of the persistence to hydrologic variables (discharge and rainfall) using time and frequency domain analyses of high-frequency hydrologic and chloride concentration data. Results demonstrated that chloride showed some level of statistical persistence that was influenced by rainfall and/or discharge. Short-term statistical persistence (less than a year) was related to the persistence of rainfall and discharge, whereas long-term statistical persistence (more than a year) was related to the persistence of discharge.

AB For instantaneous latent heat flux (lambda(E)) estimates from thermal remote sensing data to be useful in the hydrologic sciences, they require integration over longer time frames (e.g., months to years). This is not trivial because thermal remote sensing data acquired under cloud-free daytime conditions require upscaling to a monthly energy amount that is both relevant over cloudy periods and considers daytime and nighttime. Previous work has compared upscaling approaches, but as yet there is no authoritative comparison that does so under conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing. In this paper we describe, under the conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing, a generic framework for comparing any upscaling approach that assumes self-preservation. Then we use eddy-flux data from two sites in contrasting climates to systematically evaluate the accuracy of different upscaling proposals within the framework. We assumed that the instantaneous estimate of the latent heat flux measured by the eddy-flux technique would have been measured by a satellite sensor. We then scaled this estimate to a monthly period using four approaches and compared the result with the observed monthly integral. This design enabled us to isolate the accuracy of each upscaling method. The four methods upscaled lambda(E) by: (i) observed solar irradiance (S): (ii) modelled solar irradiance from a sine function (S-SIN): (iii) modelled top-of-atmosphere solar irradiance (S-TOA); and (iv) observed available energy (A(E)). We showed that upscaling lambda(E) using observed data (S, A(E)) resulted in underestimation of monthly evaporative energy. while the use of modelled data (S-SIN, S-TOA) led to overestimation, primarily due to the relationship between error and both the season (day-of-year) and cloud fraction. Of the two observed fluxes, upscaling with S resulted in lower overall errors than when using A(E) (S bias: -1.11 MJ m(-2) d(-1) or -16%; A(E) bias: -2.15 M J m(-2) d(-1) or -34%). Of the two modelled fluxes, upscaling with S-TOA had lower errors than the widely used S-SIN method (S-SIN bias: 1.03 M J m(-2) d(-1) or 14%; S-TOA bias: 0.91 M J m(-2) d(-1) or 13%). We subsequently developed a simple procedure to minimise bias from all four upscaling approaches, and concluded that modelled data (S-TOA) can be used to upscale lambda(E) to longer timescales for thermal remote sensing applications. This study developed the theory to minimise upscaling bias at two sites with contrasting climates, further work is needed to extend the approach to all global terrestrial climates.

AB Hydrological processes regulating sediment transport from land to sea have been widely studied. However, anthropogenic factors controlling the river flow-sediment regime and subsequent response of the estuary are still poorly understood. Here we conducted a multi-timescale analysis on flow and sediment discharges during the period 1967-2014 for the two tributaries of the Jiulong River in Southeast China. The long-term flow-sediment relationship remained linear in the North River throughout the period, while the linearity showed a remarkable change after 1995 in the West River, largely due to construction of dams and reservoirs in the upland watershed. Over short timescales, rainstorm events caused the changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the rivers. Regression analysis using synchronous SSC data in a wet season (2009) revealed a delayed response (average 5 days) of the estuary to river input, and a box-model analysis established a quantitative relationship to further describe the response of the estuary to the river sediment input over multiple timescales. The short-term response is determined by both the vertical SSC-salinity changes and the sediment trapping rate in the estuary. However, over the long term, the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary. The results of this study indicate that human activities (e.g., dams) have substantially altered sediment delivery patterns and river-estuary interactions at multiple timescales.

ID GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; WATER; RUNOFF; QUANTIFICATION;

AB Modeling of overland flow for a depression-dominated area is a difficult task due to the spatial distribution of depressions. Particularly, the hierarchical relationships of depressions and their variable contributing areas make the hydrologic modeling more complicated. In traditional hydrologic modeling, however, digital elevation models (DEMs) that are used to represent surface topography are often edited by filling depressions before delineation, and the impacts of depressions are considered by using certain simplified and lumped approaches. Due to such flaws, these hydrologic models fail to account for the actual dynamic influences of surface depressions. The objective of this study is to improve hydrologic modeling for depression-dominated regions by developing a new modeling framework to quantify the influence of spatially distributed depressions. To achieve this objective, a new puddle-based unit (PBU) probability distributed model (PBU-PDM) is developed and coupled with the existing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The PBU-PDM facilitates separate simulations for non-depressional and depressional areas, and accounts for the hierarchical relationships of depressions, their filling and spilling processes, and the dynamic variations in their contributing areas. The PBU-PDM enhanced SWAT was applied to the Upper Maple River watershed in North Dakota, and calibrated and validated using the observed data. In particular, it was also compared with the original SWAT model, which demonstrated the abilities of PBU-PDM to mimic the filling-spilling overland flow dynamics and the threshold behavior. The PBUPDM provides improved watershed-scale hydrologic modeling, especially for depression-dominated areas.

AB Variability of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) versus discharge relationships in streams is often high and illustrates variable particle origins or availability. Particle availability depends on both new sediment supply and deposited sediment stock. The aim of this study is to improve SSC-discharge relationship interpretation, in order to determine the origins of particles and to understand the temporal dynamics of particles for two small streams in agricultural catchments from northwestern France. SSC and discharge were continuously recorded at the outlets and data were examined at different time-scales: yearly, monthly, with distinction between flood periods and non-flooding periods, and individual flood events. Floods are classified in relation to SSC-discharge hysteresis, and this typology is completed by the analysis of SSC-discharge ranges during rising and falling flow. We show that particles are mainly coming from channel, banks, either by hydraulic erosion or by cattle trampling. Particle availability presents a seasonal dynamics with a maximum at the beginning of autumn when discharge is low, decreasing progressively during autumn to become a minimum in winter when discharge is the highest, and increasing again in spring Bank degradation by cattle is the determining factor in the suspended sediment dynamics. Cattle bank-trampling produces sediment, mostly from spring to autumn, that supplies the deposited sediment stock even outside floods. This hydrologically independent process hides SSC-discharge correlation classically linked to hydraulic erosion and transport. Differences in SSC-discharge relationships and suspended sediment budgets between streams are related to differences in transport capacity and bank degradation by cattle trampling and channelization.

AB Mean daily stream flow records from 48 watersheds in Switzerland with an undisturbed runoff regime are analysed for trends with the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test in three study periods (1931-2000, 1961-2000, 1971-2000). The statistical significance of trends is tested for each station on an annual and seasonal basis and for different stream flow quantiles. The field significance of trends is tested by a bootstrap procedure. Identified trends in stream flow are examined together with changes in precipitation and air temperature, and correlated with watershed attributes. Complex changes in the stream flow regime in Switzerland especially in the more recent periods are demonstrated. The main identified trends are an increase in annual runoff due to increases in the winter, spring and autumn season runoff, an increase in winter maximum stream flow (at more than 60% of the stations) and an increase in spring and autumn moderate and low flows. The behaviour in the summer period is different, with both upward and downward trends present in moderate and low flow quantiles. Many of the trends are field significant. Changes in precipitation are not sufficient to explain the observed trends in stream flow. Air temperature, most notably a substantial increase in the number of days with minimum daily temperature above 0 degrees C, may explain some of the observed increases in winter and spring season runoff. Correlation analyses reveal a strong relationship between stream flow trends and mean basin elevation, glacier and rock coverage (positive), and basin mean soil depth (negative). These relationships suggest that the most vulnerable environments from the point of view of stream flow change are mountain basins. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The stability of a residual gravelly soil slope during heavy rainfall is closely related to the seepage field, which is directly affected by the seepage boundaries of the slope. To examine the boundary effect, a novel model flume that can implement permeable and impermeable boundary conditions was designed. With this flume, hydraulic model tests of a gravelly soil slope considering those two seepage boundaries were carried out. The results show that distinct spatial morphology of seepage fields is reflected by the hydraulic characteristics of the slope models with different seepage boundaries. The slope with permeable boundaries generally exhibits a larger average infiltration rate as well as a relatively smaller moving speed of wetting front in the lower part compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries. The residual moisture content in the deep-lower part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 6.6% cm(3)/cm(3) smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries. Nevertheless, the maximum pore water pressure in the middle part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 1.2 kPa higher than that in the corresponding part of the slope with impermeable boundaries. It is noted that regional pore water pressures in the shallow-lower and shallow-middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations with an amplitude over 0.5 kPa. The seepage field in the slope with permeable boundaries presents a multi-dimensional development, which may lead to a local failure of the slope. The results are of great significance in studying the similarity of seepage boundary condition in the field of similarity theory on landslide model tests and provide an experimental basis for establishing rainfall-induced landslide theory.

AB Water markets are considered as effective mechanisms to support efficient use of limited water resources and to increase crop production in agricultural systems. This study presents an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to explore the performance of an agricultural water market under the joint influence of water permit allocation and farmers' behaviors. The ABM employs a power law function to simulate water permit distribution among farmers for any given level of inequality measured by the Gini coefficient. Farmers' irrigation behavior (i.e., sensitivity to soil dryness) and bidding behaviors (i.e., degree of rent seeking and learning rate coefficient) are explicitly incorporated into the ABM to represent farmers' decision-making in a water market based on double auction. Through a set of scenario analyses in a study area in Texas, we find that the water market performance to increase basin-level crop production is constrained by a joint effect of, especially the complex and non-linear interplay between the inequality of water permit allocation, farmers' behaviors, and hydrological conditions. The potential market performance is higher when water permits are more unequally distributed. The relative market performance is higher when the inequality of water allocation is at a moderate level. The modeling results can advance our understanding of the key contributing factors in market transactions, and provide policy implications to assess the comparative advantage between institutional development and farmers' behavioral change for improving market performance. This study also provides model implications for future research to draw more robust conclusions about market benefits in the real world.

AB The rapid movement of water in a complex system of preferential pathways in soils is a common natural phenomenon. However, quantification of the properties of this phenomenon is not easy and such results are not often found in the literature. The paper presents results of quantification of the number of macropores, their relative volume and the ratio of water infiltrating through the macropores for five study sites with stony soils located in a mountain catchment of northern Slovakia. These characteristics were calculated from the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities under the assumptions of the Poiseuille's law. Saturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by single ring infiltrometer measurements in the field and by falling head method in the laboratory. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by tension infiltration measurements in the field (using a minidisc infiltrometer, Decagon Devices). The largest amount of macropores (defined as the pores with radius larger than 1.5 ram) in the entire soil profile (7-5276 per 1 m(2)) was found at forest sites overgrown by spruce with high to extremely high stoniness. The number of macropores decreased with depth of the soil profile at all study sites. The contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration varied from approximately 63% to almost 100%. Although macropores can conduct a large proportion of water, their relative volume is small (0.001-0.9%). The relative volume of all macropores (active and non-active) estimated from the soil porosity and the water retention function was in the range 2-23%.

AB In order to forecast the effects of global warming on the water environment, the relationship between meteorological conditions and lake water quality was investigated statistically using 17 years of monitoring data obtained from a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Kasumigaura. The usefulness of the DPY (difference from the previous year) method was confirmed for removing the watershed change (e.g. land cover, population, etc.). From the analysis of the relationships between air temperature and water temperature on a monthly basis, the delay of time was seen to be negligible, but the gain was reduced due to the high frequency of change. As the amount of precipitation affected their relationship on a yearly basis, the slopes of 1.0-1.2 degrees C water temperature/degrees C air temperature were determined with the DPY method by excluding the combinations of the years having large difference in annual precipitation. The deterioration of lake water quality, such as increases in COD (chemical oxygen demand) and decreases in transparency, was quantitatively assessed as corresponding to an increase in air temperature. In addition, we found that higher precipitation led to high nitrogen concentrations on a monthly basis, as well as on a yearly basis, probably induced by both the runoff of soilwater having high concentrations and the lowering of residence times of lake water.

TI A germ theory for glacial systems?
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Glacial systems in the form of glaciers and ice sheets are important actors in Earth's water cycle and climate. Improving our understanding of their structure and functionality is of considerable importance, and glaciologists have tended to apply a purely physical perspective to the study of glacial systems. However, a novel paradigm of glaciers and ice sheets as Earth's largest freshwater ecosystems is being supported by studies revealing the abundance, activity, and diversity of life in glacial ecosystems and the importance of glacial systems in global biogeochemical cycles. Nevertheless, while the importance of microbial activities in shaping their habitats and influencing landscape-scale processes is well recognized elsewhere in our biosphere it has hitherto been overlooked in glacial systems. Here, the potential for several discrete microbial processes to interact with mass balance and landscaping in glacial systems as part of a 'germ theory' of glacial systems is identified. These processes range from microbial biocatalysis of ice crystal formation and structure, albedo reduction by microbial assemblages at the ice-atmosphere interface to microbe-mediated mineral weathering at the rock-ice interface. Integrating these microbial processes with abiotic, physical processes in a framework of microbial glaciology will be required to understand the extent and significance of microbial influences upon the properties of glacial systems. Furthermore, adopting a microbial glaciology approach also complements existing physical and chemical approaches to glaciology to understand how glacial systems respond to our warming climate.

AB Calibration is necessary for improving raw forecasts generated by global climate models (GCMs) to fully utilize potential benefits of the forecasts in practical applications. Based on quantile mapping (QM), this paper proposes a five-parameter Gamma-Gaussian model to calibrate monthly and seasonal GCM precipitation forecasts. While QM directly maps forecasts to observations without accounting for the dependency relationship, the GammaGaussian model employs the Gamma distribution to normalize precipitation forecasts and observations using normal quantile transform (NQT) and then formulates a bivariate Gaussian distribution to characterize the dependency relationship. A case study is devised to calibrate global precipitation forecasts generated by the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) using both QM and Gamma-Gaussian models. The results show that both QM and Gamma-Gaussian models can effectively correct biases. While QM can improve forecast reliability to some degree by reducing biases, reliability is not always satisfactory. The Gamma-Gaussian model outperforms QM because it can ensure forecast reliability and coherence. To facilitate the selection of marginal distributions for the purpose of calibrating GCM precipitation forecasts, six alternative distributions, i.e., Gamma, lognormal, generalized extreme value, generalized logistic, Pearson type III and Kappa distributions, are employed to characterize the marginal distribution of forecasts (observations) in NQT. It is observed that the Gamma distribution is overall the most suitable and that the alternative distributions tend to fit sample-specific noises and get penalized under cross validation. Overall, the Gamma-Gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate raw GCM forecasts for hydrological modeling and water resources management.

AB Stable isotopes in water (oxygen-18 and deuterium) are hydrologic tracers, which have been embedded into both analytical mass balance and physically based continuous simulation models, improving hydrologic process partitioning and regional source identification, resulting in early climate change detection. Recent advances in the field of isotope hydrology have improved coordinated investment in global monitoring networks, invested in integrated modelling tools to support prediction and model evaluation, and expanded the scale of analyses possible. This review focuses on the applications of isotope tracers to large scale hydrologic modelling, its inception and evolution, and future directions for advancing this field with emphasis on the utility of isotope tracers for operational water resources prediction. The hydrologic community has begun to steer toward alter-native hydrologic data due to the coinciding realities of limited data records and urgent data needs. Water re-sources infrastructure and management requires projections of water supply beyond the 50-to 100-year design life, with the general rule of flow frequency necessitating a 100-to 200-year assessment, however, there exist few data networks globally with records sufficient to support this kind of long-term assessment, and climate change is increasing the frequency of these extreme events. Historically, large-scale, and long time series simulation has meant less attention on process function (model fidelity) due to computational constraints, however, we argue that this may no longer be adequate under increasingly complex climate-hydrologic feedbacks, and integrated system models that incorporate human decisions, environmental health and socio-economic pressures. To expand the uptake of isotope tracers in practice, we emphasize their value for extreme quantile prediction under future projections and call for the community of practice to support data networks and accessibility, support peer re-view of large-domain (less data intensive) applications, and employ the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) scientific principles. Though still an emerging scientific field, isotope hydrology has considerable value to the practitioner community with the proper education and training necessary to build confidence, under-pinned by well developed and accessible tools for deployment.

AB By rigorously accounting for dimensional homogeneity in physical laws, the II theorem and the related self-similarity hypotheses allow us to achieve a dimensionless reformulation of scientific hypotheses in a lower-dimensional context. This paper presents applications of these concepts to the partitioning of water and soil on terrestrial landscapes. For such processes, their complexity and lack of first principle formulation make dimensional analysis an excellent tool to formulate theories that are amenable to empirical testing and analytical developments. The resulting scaling laws help reveal the dominant environmental controls for these partitionings. In particular, we discuss how the dryness index and the storage index affect the long-term rainfall partitioning, the key nonlinear control of the dryness index in global datasets of weathering rates, and the existence of new macroscopic relations among average variables in landscape evolution statistics. The scaling laws for the partitioning of sediments, the elevation profile, and the spectral scaling of self-similar topographies also unveil tantalizing analogies with turbulent flows.

AB This paper presents a systematic analysis of the influence of nine urban characteristics (distance between buildings, mean building size, building coverage, etc.) on surface flow in case of pluvial flooding. Time dependent stored volumes, outflow discharges and mean water depths were computed for a set of 2000 synthetic urban forms, considering various terrain slopes and return periods of the rainfall. An efficient porosity-based surface flow model was used to compute the 2D flow variables. Statistical analysis of the relationship between the flow and urban variables highlights that the flooding severity is mostly influenced by the building coverage.

AB A long time series of damaging flood records in Northern Portugal for 1871-2011, gathered from a large number of documentary sources, is analyzed. The relationships between damaging floods (DFs) and relevant circulation weather types (CWTs) are also assessed. The DFs database has 1861 records and CWTs are identified using the 20th century reanalysis dataset v2. A coefficient of effectiveness (CE) is calculated for each weather type in order to assess DF-CWT relationships. Furthermore, conditions in the 10 days preceding a DF outbreak, type of flood and season were taken into account in CE calculations. The DF occurrences were responsible for 186 killed people, 59 injured, 29 missing, 1873 displaced and 15,924 homeless people. The monthly frequencies each CWT show that anticyclonic (A) and easterly wind (E) types are prevalent in winter, whereas R tends to prevail in the summer half of the year. However, the results show that the cyclonic (C) type has a positive frequency with DF occurrence (i.e. anomalously frequent), both on the DF day and on the nine previous days. The C type is commonly associated with southwesterly flow and unsettled weather conditions over Portugal, which are favorable to rain-generating mechanisms. The results also highlight some seasonal variation: in autumn, winter and spring, the C type is largely related to DFs, while the A and E types acquire higher preponderance in the summer. In effect, the latter two CWTs may trigger thunderstorms and heavy precipitation episodes in the Douro River catchment in summer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of historical streamflow trends and their relationship to landscape characteristics is essential for understanding geographic differences in runoff within the Great Lakes basin and for distinguishing temporal trends from temporal variance. Factor analysis of streamflow records (1956-1988) from 32 US Geological Survey gauging stations within the Great Lakes basin revealed distinct spatio-temporal patterns of stream runoff within five different regions of the basin. Streams represented by the first annual factor occurred in southern Wisconsin and the lower peninsula of Michigan, and exhibited a linear increase in mean annual streamflow over the 33 year period caused by increased autumn and winter runoff. The second annual factor represented streams in New York and eastern Ohio, which exhibited sharply increased autumn discharge during the 1970s and 1980s. The remaining three annual, factors distinguished groups of streams in western Ohio, Minnesota, and the upper peninsula of Michigan with differing annual and seasonal flow patterns but no consistent trends in annual flow. Factor analysis of monthly flow expressed as a proportion of annual flow identified three seasonal proportion factors that were temporally distinct but geographically dispersed. Annual yield (annual streamflow per unit watershed area) was greatest from watersheds with greater topographic relief and forest cover, and February yield was greatest from small, tower elevation watersheds having a small proportion of wetland area. Understanding past spatio-temporal patterns of streamflow variability within the US Great Lakes basin and their relationship to landscape properties provides a basis for evaluating future change.

AB Microbial contamination of groundwater used for drinking water can affect public health and is of major concern to local water authorities and water suppliers. Potential hazards need to be identified in order to protect raw water resources. We propose a non-parametric data mining technique for exploring the presence of total coliforms (TC) in a groundwater abstraction well and its relationship to readily available, continuous time series of hydrometric monitoring parameters (seven year records of precipitation, river water levels, and groundwater heads). The original monitoring parameters were used to create an extensive generic dataset of explanatory variables by considering different accumulation or averaging periods, as well as temporal offsets of the explanatory variables. A classification tree based on the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) recursive partitioning algorithm revealed statistically significant relationships between precipitation and the presence of TC in both a production well and a nearby monitoring well. Different secondary explanatory variables were identified for the two wells. Elevated water levels and short-term water table fluctuations in the nearby river were found to be associated with TC in the observation well. The presence of TC in the production well was found to relate to elevated groundwater heads and fluctuations in groundwater levels. The generic variables created proved useful for increasing significance levels. The tree-based model was used to predict the occurrence of TC on the basis of hydrometric variables.

AB The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal mechanism by which the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of streams, lakes, and wetlands are protected in the United States. The CWA has evolved considerably since its initial passage in 1948, including explicit expansions and contractions of jurisdictional scope through a series of legislative actions, court decisions, and agency rules. Here, we provide a practical summary of the CWA's evolution, detailing the major updates or revisions and their circumstances. Additionally, we identify the jurisdictional scope of the law for rivers and streams, lakes, and wetlands based on the language used and implementation by the agencies during the same time period. While the rulemaking process commonly uses language that will be abstract to many hydrologists, understanding the on-the-ground implications, quantifying regulatory (un)certainties, and assessing the magnitude of changes through time is important to understanding the implications of environmental regulation development, litigation, and enforcement. Thus, we translate the enforcement norms and definitions into quantitative estimates for Clean Water Act scope in the Wabash River Basin (Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, USA) as a demonstration of the spatial consequences of changing regulatory language.

AB For both societal and ecological reasons, it is important to understand past and future subsurface water dynamics but estimating subsurface water storage is notoriously difficult. In this pilot study, we suggest the reconstruction of subsurface water dynamics by a multi-disciplinary approach combining hydrology, dendrochronology and geodesy. In a first step, nine complete years of high-precision gravimeter observations are used to estimate water storage changes in the subsurface at the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell in the Bavarian Forest, Germany. The record is extended to 63 years by calibrating a hydrological model against the 9 years of gravimeter observations. The relationship between tree-ring growth and water storage changes is evaluated as well as that between tree-ring growth and supplementary hydro-meteorological data. Results suggest that tree-ring growth is influenced primarily by subsurface water storage. Other variables related to the overall moisture status (e.g., Standardized Precipitation Index, Palmer Drought Severity Index, streamflow) are also strongly correlated with tree-ring width. While these indices are all indicators of water stored in the landscape, water storage changes of the subsurface estimated by depth-integral measurements give us the unique opportunity to directly reconstruct subsurface water storage dynamics from records of tree-ring width. Such long reconstructions will improve our knowledge of past water storage variations and our ability to predict future developments. Finally, knowing the relationship between subsurface storage dynamics and tree-ring growth improves the understanding of the different signal components contained in tree-ring chronologies.

AB The Kinematic Wave Model (KWM), representing a simplification of the Full Wave Model (FWM) under the shallow-water approximation, is often used in the one-dimensional formulation for describing the dynamics of debris/mud flood. The present work investigates the applicability conditions of the KWM to analyze mud floods, characterized by a rheological behaviour expressed through a power-law model. The study is carried out through the numerical solution of both the Full and Kinematic Wave models changing the characteristic time of hydrograph, i.e. the wave duration, imposed at the channel inlet. The predictions of the two models are compared in terms of maximum flow depth, maximum discharge and peak discharge at the downstream channel end. The study is performed for several values of the Froude (F) and the Kinematic Wave (K) numbers. Similarly to the clear-water case, present results show that higher errors in applying KWM pertain to shorter flood wave durations, but the performance of KWM appears to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index, becoming worse as the fluid rheology becomes more shear-thinning. The study furnishes applicability criteria representing a guideline for practical applications in terms of minimum wave duration above which the KWM error in reproducing the considered flood characteristics (the maximum flow depth, the maximum discharge and the peak discharge at the downstream channel end) is less or equal than 5%. Finally, it has been shown that the wave period criterion, obtained considering linearized wave dynamics, may be safely applied at least for fluid with moderate shear-thinning behavior and for moderate values of the dimensionless number KF2.

AB Recently, ensemble post-processing (EPP) has become a commonly used approach for reducing the uncertainty in forcing data and hence hydrologic simulation. The procedure was introduced to build ensemble precipitation forecasts based on the statistical relationship between observations and forecasts. More specifically, the approach relies on a transfer function that is developed based on a bivariate joint distribution between the observations and the simulations in the historical period. The transfer function is used to post-process the forecast. In this study, we propose a Bayesian EPP approach based on copula functions (COP-EPP) to improve the reliability of the precipitation ensemble forecast. Evaluation of the copula-based method is carried out by comparing the performance of the generated ensemble precipitation with the outputs from an existing procedure, i.e. mixed type meta-Gaussian distribution. Monthly precipitation from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFS) and gridded observation from Parameter Elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) have been employed to generate the post-processed ensemble precipitation. Deterministic and probabilistic verification frameworks are utilized in order to evaluate the outputs from the proposed technique. Distribution of seasonal precipitation for the generated ensemble from the copula-based technique is compared to the observation and raw forecasts for three sub-basins located in the Western United States. Results show that both techniques are successful in producing reliable and unbiased ensemble forecast, however, the COP-EPP demonstrates considerable improvement in the ensemble forecast in both deterministic and probabilistic verification, in particular in characterizing the extreme events in wet seasons.

AB A frozen soil layer may impede snowmelt infiltration, resulting in a large amount of runoff that influences the soil water balance and anion movement in the soil profile. To examine the relationships among soil frost depth, snowmelt runoff, and nitrate leaching in agricultural fields, we measured both the snowmelt runoff for three winters and other environmental factors including the soil frost depth and nitrate content in a similar to 10,000 m(2) field. We divided the field into two subplots: one was maintained in a natural snow cover condition (the control plot), and the snow cover was compacted on the other plot (the treated plot) to enhance the development of the soil frost depth. In all three winters, soil frost depths in the control plot were < 0.2 m and very little runoff was observed during the snowmelt period. In contrast, the soil frost depth became > 0.4 m and a large amount of snowmelt runoff was observed in the treated plot. The depth of the peak nitrate concentration after the snowmelt period was shallower in the treated plot compared to the control plot. Moreover, a significant linear relationship was observed between (1) the amount of nitrate in the 0-0.3 m depth after the snowmelt period and (2) the total amount of snowmelt infiltration calculated by subtracting the amount of snowmelt runoff from the amount of snowmelt water. These results suggest that snow compaction can be a promising technique to develop a uniform soil frost depth in large-scale fields, which consequently controls the soil water and nutrient movement in the soil layer.

AB The inland migration of seawater in coastal aquifers, known as seawater intrusion (SWI), can be categorised as passive or active, depending on whether the hydraulic gradient slopes downwards towards the sea or the land, respectively. Despite active SWI occurring in many locations, it has received considerably less attention than passive SWI. In this study, active SWI caused by an inland freshwater head decline (FHD) is characterised using numerical modelling of various idealised unconfined coastal aquifer settings. Relationships between key features of active SWI (e.g., interface characteristics and SWI response time-scales) and the parameters of the problem (e.g., inland FHD, freshwater-seawater density contrast, dispersivity, hydraulic conductivity, porosity and aquifer thickness) are explored for the first time. Sensitivity analyses show that the SWI response time-scales under active SWI situations are influenced by both the initial and final boundary head differences. The interface is found to be steeper under stronger advection (i.e., caused by the inland FHD), higher dispersivity and hydraulic conductivity, and lower aquifer thickness, seawater density and porosity. The interface movement is faster and the mixing zone is wider with larger hydraulic conductivity, seawater-freshwater density difference, and aquifer thickness, and with lower porosity. Dimensionless parameters (Peclet number and mixed convection ratio) from previous steady-state analyses offer only limited application to the controlling factors of passive SWI, and are not applicable to active SWI. The current study of active SWI highlights important functional relationships that improve the general understanding of SW!, which has otherwise been founded primarily on steady-state and passive SWI.

AB Salinization is a global threat to the quality of streams and rivers, but it can have many causes. Oil and gas development were investigated as one of several potential causes of changes in the salinity of Muddy Creek, which drains 2470 km(2) of mostly public land in Wyoming, U.S.A. Stream discharge and salinity vary with seasonal snowmelt and define a primary salinity-discharge relationship. Salinity, measured by specific conductance, increased substantially in 2009 and was 53-71% higher at low discharge and 33-34% higher at high discharge for the-years 2009-2012 compared to 2005-2008. Short-term processes (e.g., flushing of efflorescent salts) cause within-year deviations from the primary relation but do not obscure the overall increase in salinity. Dissolved elements associated with increased salinity include calcium, magnesium, and sulfate, a composition that points to native soil salts derived from marine shales as a likely source. Potential causes of the salinity increase were evaluated for consistency by using measured patterns in stream chemistry, slope of the salinity-discharge relationship, and inter-annual timing of the salinity increase. Potential causes that were inconsistent with one or more of those criteria included effects from precipitation, evapotranspiration, reservoirs, grazing, irrigation return flow, groundwater discharge, discharge of energy co-produced waters, and stream habitat restoration. In contrast, surface disturbance of naturally salt-rich soil by oil and gas development activities, such as pipeline, road, and well pad construction, is a reasonable candidate for explaining the salinity increase. As development continues to expand in semiarid lands worldwide, the potential for soil disturbance to increase stream salinity should be considered, particularly where soils host substantial quantities of native salts.

AB Many studies have used hydrological variables derived from long-term discharge records to describe the flow regime of streams. However, many streams in the wet-dry tropics of Australia have little or no flow data available for such analysis. In this study, an analysis was undertaken to link significant hydrological variables to a selection of basic catchment characteristics. Long-term discharge records from streams within three relatively well-gauged catchments - Daly (Northern Territory), Fitzroy (Western Australia) and Flinders (Queensland) rivers - were analysed to classify streams into flow regime groupings. Hydrological variables based on flow variability, flood regime pattern and intermittency, were derived for the complete record of each stream. Cluster analysis indicated that streams could be classified broadly into (1) perennial, (2) seasonal, (3) dry seasonal, and (4) seasonal-intermittent. The coefficient of variation of total annual flow and mean annual number of zero flow days were the two most significant variables for classifying streams into flow regime groupings. A selection of broad-scale catchment characteristics based on digital elevation, topographical and geological data were derived for each long-term station within the three catchments. Significant relationships were fitted linking the two most influential hydrological variables, coefficient of variation of total annual flow and mean annual number of zero flow days, to these catchment characteristics. Long-term discharge data from test stations within five other catchments of the wet-dry tropics were used to validate the fitted relationships. Using hydrological variables based on catchment characteristics, most of the test stations were classified within the same flow regime group as that based on hydrological variables derived from flow data. This result indicates that the predicted hydrology variables can be used to broadly classify the flow regime of ungauged or data-limited streams within Australia's wet-dry tropics.

ID SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION PHENOMENON; MONSOON RAINFALL; PREDICTION; EXTREMES
AB We investigate the viability of using El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sea surface temperature (SST) data to predict seasonal streamflow for one of the major rivers in Sri Lanka, the Kelani, using correlation analysis, contingency tables, and principal component analysis. The agricultural seasons in Sri Lanka are Yala (April-September) and Maha (October-March). The correlation between the Kelani River streamflow during Yala and ENSO indices (r = -0.41) is significant at 99% level. In addition, the Kelani streamflow during Yala has a correlation with the Central Indian Ocean SST (r = -0.40) that is also significant at the 99% level. The first principal component of the Indo-Pacific Ocean SST is reminiscent of the SST associated with the ENSO mode. A prediction scheme based on this mode for the streamflow during Yala has a skill characterized by a correlation of 0.5 in a cross-validated mode.
   The prediction of streamflow during Maha is best carried out separately for the two halves of the season. During the El Nino phase, the rainfall during Maha is enhanced during the first half of the season (October-December) and diminished in the second half (January-February). Rainfall rather than streamflow has a better relationship with ENSO from October to December. During the second half of the Maha season, rainfall declines with both warm and cold ENSO phases and any prediction scheme has to take into account this non-linear relationship. Overall, useful skill for seasonal streamflow predictions has been demonstrated for the Yala season and skill for seasonal rainfall predictions for the first and second half of the Maha season has been elucidated.

TI Macrodispersion in a radially diverging flow field with finite Peclet
   numbers 2. Homogenization theory approach
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article

AB We study the transport behavior of a tracer in a radially diverging heterogeneous velocity field. Making use of homogenization theory, we derive effective transport equations. These effective transport equations are very similar to those defined on the local scale. However, the local transport parameters such as local dispersion coefficients are replaced by effective dispersion coefficients. For smoothly varying heterogeneous media, explicit results for effective radial dispersion coefficients are derived. Starting with the purely advective transport behavior (infinite Peclet numbers), we extend our calculations to transport with finite Peclet numbers. We find that the impact of molecular diffusion on the effective dispersivity differs from the impact of local dispersion: Including local dispersion leads to effective dispersivities which are constant and equivalent to the effective dispersivities found in uniform flow configurations. In contrast, effective dispersivities including diffusion are not constant but depend on the radial distance. We compare the results found by homogenization theory with those derived by Neuweiler er al. [this issue] by standard method of moments.

AB This study examined the role of tree arrangement (random versus aligned) on the drag forces and velocity inside a 1/12th-scale model mangrove forest over a range of tree density (trees m(-2)). Each model tree included an aerial root system geometrically similar to Rhizophora, with maximum root height HRmax and water depth H > HRmax The non-dimensional root density was defined as a(r) HRmax with root zone frontal area per volume, a(r). For both random and aligned low-density forests, a(r) HRmax  < 0.1, the vertical profile of velocity followed a boundary layer shape. Within both random and aligned high-density forests, a(r) > 0.1, the velocity was diminished in the root zone (z < HRmax) and enhanced above the root zone, relative to the boundary layer profile. For all forest arrangements, the force on the roots dominated the force on the entire tree, even in cases with diminished velocity within the root zone. Compared with a tree at the leading edge, a tree inside a randomly distributed forest could experience either a greater or lesser force, and the variation in drag force increased with tree density. In contrast, for an aligned distribution of trees the force on an individual tree within the forest was always diminished relative to a tree at the leading edge. A drag coefficient was defined using a quadratic drag law. The forest-average drag coefficient, defined using the channel-average velocity, was up to 30 percent higher for random tree arrangements, compared to in-line tree arrangements.

AB The aim of this work was first, to compare two methods for obtaining soil boundary-layer resistance, one based on the turbulent diffusion theory (TD) and another based on the energy balance of heated and unheated sensors (EB), and secondly, to analyse how the results obtained from both methods are affected by canopy structure parameters in typical sparse vegetation. The study was carried out in stands of three different species characteristic of the semiarid South East of Spain (Retama sphaerocarpa, Anthyllis cytisoides and Stipa tenacissima). Comparison of the two methods showed that EB boundary-layer resistances, unlike TD, implicitly considers the peculiarities of the plant architecture and structure, as well as its distribution in the field and the presence or absence of substrate under the canopies. In contrast, for the TD method, quantitative attributes of the vegetation (average vegetation height, h, leaf area index, L, fractional. vegetative cover, f, drag coefficient, C-d and the eddy diffusivity decay constant, n) are necessary, which are not only sometimes difficult to obtain in the field, but also seem to be insufficient to explain the development of the soil boundary layer in sparse semiarid vegetation. The advantages of using the EB method are both practical and theoretical. Positioning of the sensors and data storage with automatic data loggers is easy, and does not require knowledge of the aerodynamic attributes of the vegetated area. Furthermore it allows qualitative interpretation of the effect of non-transpirable vegetative elements, as well as the architecture of the vegetation and its distribution in the field, neither of,which are considered in the turbulent diffusion theory.

AB Understanding climate variations over the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau has become essential because the high plateau sustains various ecosystems and water sources, and impacts on the Asian monsoon system. This paper provides new information from isotopic signals in meteoric water and atmospheric water vapour onlhe Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using high frequency observation data over a relatively short period. The aim is to explore temporal moisture changes and annual variations at the onset and during the summer monsoon season at a transitional site with respect to the monsoon influence. Data show that high frequency and short period observations can reveal typical moisture changes from the pre-monsoon to the monsoon seasons (2010), and the large variation in isotopic signals in different years with respect to active/inactive periods during a mature phase of the monsoon (2011), especially inferring from the temporal changes in the d-excess of precipitation and its relationship with 6180 values, when higher d-excess is found in the pre-monsoon precipitation. In this transition zone on a daily basis, 6180 values in precipitation are controlled mainly by the amount of rainfall during the monsoon season, while temperature seems more important before the onset of monsoon. Furthermore, the "amount effect" is significant for night-time rain events. From comparison of signals in both the precipitation and water vapour, an inconsistent relationship between d-excess values suggests various moisture fluxes are active in a short period. The temporal pattern of isotopic signal change from the onset of the monsoon to the mature monsoon phase provides information about the larger circulation dynamics of the Asian monsoon.

AB Recent concern for problems of soil degradation and the offsite impacts of accelerated erosion has highlighted the need for improved methods of estimating rates and patterns of soil erosion by water. The use of environmental radionuclides, particularly caesium-137 (Cs-137), as a means of estimating rates of soil erosion and deposition is attracting increasing attention and the approach has now been recognised as possessing several important advantages. However, one important uncertainty associated with the use of Cs-137 measurements to estimate soil erosion rates is the need to employ a calibration relationship to convert the measured Cs-137 inventory to an estimate of the erosion rate. Existing calibration procedures are commonly subdivided into empirical relationships, based on independent measurements of soil loss, and theoretical models, that make use of existing understanding of the fate and behaviour of fallout radionuclides in eroding soils to derive a relationship between erosion rate and the reduction in the Cs-137 inventory relative to the local reference value. There have been few attempts to validate these theoretical calibration models and there is an important need for such validation if the Cs-137 approach is to be more widely applied. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at validating the use of a simple exponential profile distribution model to convert measurements of Cs-137 inventories on uncultivated soils to estimates of soil erosion rates. It is based on a small (1.38 ha) catchment in Calabria, southern Italy, for which measurements of sediment output are available for the catchment outlet. Because there is no evidence of significant deposition within the catchment, a sediment delivery ratio close to 1.0 can be assumed. It is therefore possible to make a direct comparison between the estimate of the mean annual erosion rate within the catchment derived from Cs-137 measurements and the measured sediment output. In undertaking this comparison, account was taken of the different periods covered by the measured sediment output and the erosion rate estimated using Cs-137 measurements. The results of the comparison show close agreement between the estimated and the measured erosion rates and therefore provide an effective validation of the use of the Cs-137 approach and, more particularly, a profile distribution calibration model, to estimate soil erosion rates in this small catchment. Further studies are required to extend such independent validation to other environments, including cultivated soils, and to different calibration procedures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Determining the precipitation phase-rain or snow-is an important factor in modelling discharge in mountainous basins. In a study carried out in the outer tropical Andes Cordillera of Bolivia, half-hourly determination of precipitation phase was obtained by applying a suitable expert system, taking I I meteorological parameters into consideration that are measured over 21 months at an altitude close to 4800 m. Straightforward relationships between the determined precipitation phase and observed air temperature were analysed in histograms that contain percentage occurrences of snowfall, rainfall and mixed precipitation events for 0.5 degrees C air temperature increments. The graph shows a nearly identical distribution of percentage occurrences of snowfall in the Andes to that on a 1600-m high site in the Swiss Alps. This result suggests that, for hydrological modelling purposes in the outer tropical Andes, the same rain/snow threshold temperature as in the compared Swiss site can be applied.

ID 2-PARAMETER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION; CN; DERIVATION
AB The sediment graph models are useful for computation of sediment yield as well as total sediment out flow from watershed. In this study, the analytical development of proposed sediment graph models is based on Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) procedure coupled Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, Nash's Instantaneous Unit Sediment Graph (IUSG)model and Power law. This coupling has led to the development of four sediment graph models (SGMs), i.e., SMA-SGM1, SMA-SGM2, SMA-SGM-3 and SMA-SGM4 depending on the four different hydrologic conditions as: (i) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and initial abstraction (I-a) = 0, (ii) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal OandinitialabstractionIa = 0, (iii) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and (I-a) - 0, and (iv) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal 0 and initial abstration (I-a) not equal 0, respectively. These models are applied on six natural watersheds with nineteen storm events having different land use/land cover, climatic condition (arid, semi-arid, humid and sub-tropical), rainfall and land slope conditions. The goodness-of-fit statistics is evaluated in terms of Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and relative error (RE) between observed and simulated (calibrated and validated) sediment graphs. Further, the performance of these models is also compared with the sediment graph model of Bhunya et al. (2010) (BSGM) on all the six study watersheds. It is found that the proposed models perform very well in simulating sediment yield generation process for all the watersheds and show significant improvement over the BSGM model.

AB A new dynamic-wave cellular automata framework for two-dimensional (2D) shallow water flow (SWF) modeling is herein proposed. During the last decade, the concept of cellular automata (CA) has been widely adopted to develop various 2D shallow water flow models. Such CA models use simple transition rules that only consider the conservation of mass and neglect the conservation of momentum, as a result, the models behave like the non-inertia wave approximation which are not suitable for modeling strong discontinuous flows (i.e., tran-scritical flows and wet-dry interfaces). To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a new CA framework (SWFCA) for 2D shallow water flow modeling, in which the Bernoulli hydraulic head is adopted to replace water level as the key factor to determine water movements. A novel methodology for linking water depths and velocities in the framework is developed. Model verification is carried out through four cases of regular flows and six benchmark cases with strong discontinuous flows. Model efficiency assessment is also conducted to analyze the numerical performance under various flow conditions. The outcomes indicate that the proposed SWFCA model and a non-inertia wave CA-based model (WCA2D) both provide satisfactory results on regular flows. In modeling strong discontinuous flows, the SWFCA model performs better than the WCA2D model and provides the same accuracy as the finite volume model with a HLLC scheme (FV-HLLC). In the aspect of moving wet-dry interfaces and flows under the partially wet condition, the SWFCA model can achieve higher accuracy than the FV-HLLC model. The numerical efficiency of the SWFCA model relates to the flow conditions involved. As the portion of strong discontinuous flows in the computational domain is increasing, the SWFCA model can be up to 305.5% and 121.0%-1282.2% faster than the WCA2D model and the FV-HLLC model, respectively. This novel CA-based framework has been proved its accuracy and efficiency for shallow water flow modeling. Therefore, it has considerable potentials as a useful tool for real-time flood inundation modeling.

TI Optimizing river discharge measurements using Monte Carlo Markov Chain
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Discharge measurement; Optimization; Monte Carlo Markov Chain;
   Area-velocity method
AB In this work we implement Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) dynamics in the search of rules that may lead to optimizing river discharge measurements, which should prove useful in situations when resources are scarce. The MCMC dynamics is based on a recently proposed computational interpolation scheme, where the velocity profile for each vertical section is first determined by applying polynomial regression, and then a continuous approximation for the velocity across the entire vertical section is obtained through interpolation. To this end, we use the data obtained experimentally on rivers Exu and Capibaribe, state of Pernambuco, in the northeast of Brazil. By considering the velocity profile obtained through this procedure using all the available measurement points as the "best known profile", or benchmark, we proceed by randomly choosing a small number of measurement points, repeating the above procedure, and comparing the result with the benchmark. The deviation of the reduced point approximation from the benchmark is then used as an objective function, which is minimized through an iterative MCMC process of moving the individual measurement points in different directions, and accepting or rejecting these movements. MCMC dynamics is applied for different choices of the reduced number of measurements, and finally a "recipe" is proposed for the practical choice of the number of measurement points and their placement, which optimizes the river discharge measurement. More precisely, instead of performing the full set of measurements at k vertical sections using several points for each vertical in order to apply the standard area-velocity method, one may perform just a single measurement close to the surface for every other of the k verticals, and then apply the proposed computational scheme. If the image of the velocity profile keeps changing as new measurements are incorporated, and one is interested in the details of the multiple flow structure, additional measurements should be made between adjacent high velocity observations.

ID SALT-WATER INTERFACE; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SEAWATER INTRUSION; FLOW; IMPACT
AB In this study, we provide a simplified equation with a new concise set of parameters defining the approximate interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers. We derive the solution directly by applying the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation at the outset, and mathematically prove its sameness for the uniform flow in a vertical plane with the interface profile computed using the comprehensive discharge potential theory by Strack and Ausk (2015). We present a surprising result that interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary turns out to be same as in which water table and interface coincides with the coastline. The interface profile is a function of the transmissivity-field centroid elevation and the total transmissivity of the freshwater-flow domain above the interface. We found that the boundary potential at the coast in the discharge-potential theory solution represents the first moment of the transmissivity. We also analyzed the differences in the interface profiles in aquifers with different hydraulic-conductivity contrasts for two sets of boundary conditions-constant head and constant flux. For a given-flux boundary, interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts converge in the upper part of the aquifer and diverge at the aquifer bottom, leading to different toe-positions. Conversely, for a given-head boundary, interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts significantly differ in the upper part of the aquifer, while converge at the aquifer bottom resulting in the same toe-position. We provide explicit solutions for the toe-position and freshwater discharge in unconfined aquifers, an extension to our previous work for confined aquifers. Insights from the newly identified parameters can also potentially help in reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the real-world SWI extent and optimize the requirement of the extent of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization.

DE River Amazon; discharge; measurement; methodology; rating curve
AB This paper describes the way in which the daily discharges of the River Amazon were calculated at Obidos. The stage-discharge relationship is practically univocal in low and mean water. In high flow periods, the scatter of the stream gaugings compared to the univocal rating curve effects the correction of the discharges according to the levels at Santarem then at Parintins. The "normal difference in level" method is not well adapted for Obidos: it was replaced by a "normal difference in level with variable geometry" method, a function of the water levels at Obidos. While using only the Santarem station, the application of this new method reduced the scattering to 3.0% on the entire rating curve.

AB To better understand the biogeochemical processes of iron, sulfur, and phosphorus and their coupled relationships, we used the in situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to characterize labile Fe, S, and P in the sediment porewater of a mangrove coast in the Jiulong River Estuary, China. The distributions of DGT-labile Fe and S indicated that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and microbial iron reduction (MIR) exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature-dependent behavior. Thus, in addition to the expected MSR, MIR is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter (OM) mineralization in this Fe-rich mangrove coast. Labile Fe, S, and P distributions and variations demonstrate that Fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating P behavior and P cycling. An additional new finding is that the flux of labile S in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides, indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide-induced redox changes. The net P flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from -0.306 +/- 0.001 to 0.343 +/- 0.013 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in the winter survey, suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a P source in the subtidal zone and a P sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter. The continuous accumulation of labile P in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing MIR process in the subsequent riverine flood season, which may promote eutrophication of the adjacent Xiamen Bay.

AB Canopy interception of rainfall is an important process in the water balance of forests. The intrastorm dynamics of canopy interception is less well understood than event scale interception. Accordingly, armed with measurements of hourly interception intensity (i) from the field, this study is among the first to examine the differences in canopy interception dynamics between the first and second halves of rainfall events to quantify dynamic storage values for a coniferous forest in Japan. At this site, experimental results demonstrated that: (1) the relationship between interception loss (I) and gross rainfall (GR) at the event scale is better explained by a parabolic curve than a linear relationship, and there is a low correlation between rainfall intensity (gr) and i; (2) the ratio of accumulated i during the first half (I-F) to that of gr (GR(F)) was larger than the second half (Is/GRs), with no significant correlations between potential evaporation during first half (PEF) vs I-F or the second half (PEs) vs I-s; and (3) water storage capacity was similar to the magnitude of maximum I. By emphasizing the comparison between IF and Is, this study concludes that the water storage on tree surface is more important than losses by wet canopy evaporation and splash during rain. This study also adds insights into intrastorm interception dynamics of coniferous forests which are necessary to better model and forecast interception losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
AB Main objective of this work was the study of the infiltration and recharge mechanisms in the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) outcrop zone. The study was based on hydrogeologic monitoring, evapotranspiration and water balance in a pilot watershed. The pilot watershed (Ribeir $(a) over bar $o da Onca) is situated in the outcrop zone of the Guarani Aquifer between parallels 22 degrees 10' and 22 degrees 15' (south latitude) and meridians 47 degrees 55' and 48 degrees 00' (west longitude). For the execution of the research project, a monitoring network (wells, rain gauge and linigraph) was installed in the watershed. Data have been systematically collected during the period of a hydrological year. Water level fluctuation has been used to estimate deep recharge and subsurface storage variation. The method used to estimate the direct recharge adopted the hypothesis that the recession of the groundwater Level obeys a function of power law type. Direct recharge is obtained through the difference between the actual level of an unconfined aquifer and the Level indicated by extrapolation of the recession curve, in a given period. Base outflow is estimated through a mixed function (linear and exponential). Outflow in the creek has been measured with current meter and monitored continuously with a linigraph. The annual infiltration in 2005 was estimated to be 350 mm, while the deep recharge, based on water balance, appears to be 3.5% of the precipitation (1410 mm). These results indicate that the estimated tong term water availability of the Guarani Aquifer System should be studied more carefully. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acid in-situ uranium leach mining is an effective, popular technology for extracting uranium without large uranium mill tailings. However, acid in-situ leaching causes extremely high concentrations of acidic contaminants in aquifers. To represent the migration and range of acidic contaminant pollutants in confined aquifers, this study applied the controlled source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (CSAMT) method to a uranium mining area located in the Yili Basin, Xinjiang, northwest China. We collected ten CSAMT profiles from 364 sites with an average site interval of 20 m. The electrical resistivity model of the uranium mining area was obtained via twodimensional inversion using CSAMT data, with 23 frequencies, ranging from 8192 Hz to 4 Hz. Combined with geological, geochemical, and well log data, this resistivity model was successfully used to identify the scale and position of acid contaminant plumes beneath the uranium mining area, which appear as electrically well-defined features that closely coincide with the distribution of sulfate and uranium ions in groundwater. With uranium mining activities ceasing, the scale of acid contaminant plumes has been reduced, owing to the natural attenuation of the aquifer or the contaminants well confined in the mining site. The low-permeability sandstone surrounding the aquifer was imaged as a resistive feature, which confines the contaminant plumes to the uranium mining area and slows the downstream migration of contaminants. According to the modified Archie's law, the porosity of the sandstone bearing uranium beneath the injection well zone increases, owing to acidification, while the porosity of the sandstone beneath the production well zone decreases, owing to pore plugging.

AB Using the single-well push-pull (SWPP) test to quantify in situ aquifer characteristics associated with solute transport (dispersion coefficient, geobiochemical reaction rates), the accuracy of parameter estimation was not only dependent on the solute transport models but also the groundwater flow models. However, many previous studies on the SWPP test were based on assumptions over-simplifying the flow field, namely, groundwater flow followed Darcy's law; flow was in the steady state during the entire test duration; the wellbore storage could be negligible. In this study, we have carefully examined such assumptions by developing a new finite-difference model of the SWPP test under the transient Forchheimer flow condition, considering the wellbore storage. The SWPP test included an injection phase, a chaser phase, a rest phase, and an extraction phase. The results showed that the concentration of the steady-state flow solution was greater than that of the transient flow solution at the beginning, and its peak value was also greater than that of the transient flow solution. The difference between the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the transient flow SWPP model and the steady-state flow SWPP model was not negligible, and such a difference increased with the decreasing specific storage. We also found that BTCs were not sensitive to the inertial force coefficient, while they were sensitive to the wellbore storage. BTCs with different radius of the wellbore (r(w)) were clearly different from each other, and a larger 74, resulted in a greater concentration at the well during the extraction phase.

AB The mismatch between the space-time scales of flash flood occurrence and those of the typical hydro meteorological monitoring networks has stimulated the development of forensic flash flood analysis, which involves post-flood indirect peak discharge estimation in ungauged channels and flood response modelling driven by weather-radar rainfall estimates. However, both approaches are potentially affected by significant uncertainties. Assessment of scale dependence of such uncertainties is important to identify how uncertainty affecting forensic flash flood analysis increases with decreasing basin size. In this work, we apply the forensic methodology to the flash flood of November 18, 2013 in Sardinia (Italy). We introduce the 'flash flood forensic consistency index' as a tool to compare the probability distribution of peak discharge uncertainties from observational and model estimates, and to determine the scale effects of the forensic analysis concept. Uncertainties in field-based peak flow estimates are evaluated through a first-order error analysis of the Taylor series approximation of the slope-conveyance method, whereas uncertainties in flash flood modelling are based on the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation methodology using a distributed hydrologic model. Results show no significant relationship between observational and modelling uncertainties, considered independently, and basin area and channel bed slope. Conversely, when considering the interaction between the two uncertainty distributions, a relationship arises between their degree of overlap and basin size. In particular, with decreasing basin area or increasing channel bed slope, the absolute relative bias between the estimated peak flow values increases more than their relative uncertainties, decreasing the consistency index. This calls for more robust approaches for the analysis of flash flood response in small-sized rugged-relief mountain basins, which are of high interest for flood risk management.

AB The concept of Damkohler numbers have been extensively used in the discipline of chemical engineering and lately increasingly found its application into environmental science in order to describe the integrated behavior of hydrological systems with respect to their physical transport and biogeochemical transformation capabilities. Defining characteristic time scales of transport and reaction, as part of the Damkohler concept, however is not trivial especially for non-well mixed systems like catchments where physically controlled transport and biogeochemical moderated reactions can be highly variable among individual flow paths. Often, system specific residence times alone are not useful to describe the time scales of transport in the Damkohler concept, because it neglects that degradation of redox-sensitive compounds depend on dynamically changing and non-uniformly distributed hydro-biogeochemical boundary conditions that either facilitate or suppress biogeochemical reactions. In this study an approach is presented that highlights the importance to specifically distinguish between residence and exposure times if system specific transformation efficiencies are evaluated. We investigate the inter-relationship between residence and exposure time distributions for different biogeochemical processes in a virtual wetland environment that is exposed to different hydrological conditions. The relationship between exposure and residence times is mathematically described by a composition matrix that linearly relates the two identities to each other. Composition matrices for different hydrological conditions are analyzed by using the singular value decomposition technique. Results show that especially the type of couplings between the surface and subsurface flow domain control how exposure and residence times are related to each other in the wetland system and that timescales of residence and exposure typically differ by orders of magnitude. Finally, results also indicate that the assessment of system specific transformation efficiencies can be very error-prone if residence instead of exposure times are being used to derive system specific Damkohler numbers.

AB A simple model based on the Monin-Obukhov surface layer similarity theory of heat and momentum transport can be used to predict the latent heat flux for a variety of atmospheric and soil moisture conditions. Experiments were carried out on the Campbell Tract at the University of California, Davis, from 14 September to 23 November 1990. The latent heat flux was measured precisely with a large weighing lysimeter and the surface temperature by a thermal IR transducer. The evaporation predictions and lysimeter measurements overall were in good agreement (R2 = 0.86), including cases of dry surface conditions. Even low daily evaporation of the order of 1 mm could be modeled with the procedure studied.

AB Two well-known relationships in hydrology and hydrometeorology, the Budyko and complementary relationships, are examined within an idealized prototype representing the physics of large-scale land-atmosphere coupling developed in prior work. These relationships are shown to hold on long (climatologic) timescales because of the tight coupling that exists between precipitation, atmospheric radiation, moisture convergence and advection. The slope of the CR is shown to be dependent on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship between saturation-specific humidity and temperature, with important implications for the continental hydrologic cycle in a warming climate; e.g., one consequence of this dependence is that the CR may be expected to become more asymmetric with warming, as higher values of the slope imply a larger change in potential evaporation for a given change in evapotranspiration. In addition, the transparent physics of the prototype permits diagnosis of the sensitivity of the Budyko and complementary relationships to various atmospheric and land surface processes. Here, the impacts of anthropogenic influences, including large-scale irrigation and global warming, are assessed.

AB The purpose of this analytic-numerical Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) is to produce a short-term probabilistic river stage forecast based on a probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast as an input and a deterministic hydrologic model (of any complexity) as a means of simulating the response of a headwater basin to precipitation. The BFS has three structural components: the precipitation uncertainty processor, the hydrologic uncertainty processor, and the integrator. A series of articles described the Bayesian forecasting theory and detailed each component of this particular BFS. This article presents a synthesis: the total system, operational expressions, estimation procedures, numerical algorithms, a complete example, and all design requirements, modeling assumptions, and operational attributes.

AB The underlying uncertainties in the prediction of freshwater evolutions in some regions can be induced by several unmitigated human actions, multi-scale climatic drivers, and dynamic physical processes. These factors have enduring hydro-ecological effects on the environments and combine to limit our understanding of large scale hydrological processes and impacts of climate on water availability. Considering the fact that several hydrogeological perturbations and disturbances have been reported during the last decade in South America (SA), a further assessment of continental land water storage is therefore warranted. In this study, a two-step regularization approach that combined the JADE (Joint Approximate Diagonalisation of Eigen matrices) algorithm and PLSR (partial least squares regression) was employed to assess GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)-terrestrial water storage (TWS) over SA. Based on the Bartlett's statistics, significant independent patterns of SST (Sea Surface Temperature) anomalies from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were used in the PLSR scheme to model the temporal evolutions of TWS (2002 - 2017) over twelve prominent river basins in SA. From the JADE rotation of TWS over SA, strong inter-annual changes in TWS observed over the Amazon basin and within its floodplain corridors were identified. The unabated mass loss in Patagonia ice-field caused by warming of the climate and other GRACE-hydrological signals were also retrieved from the JADE scheme. The rainfall TWS relationship is considerably strong (r = 0.80 at 0 - 2 months lag) in much of tropical SA, including the Amazon basin and highlights the influence of climate variability in the region. Medium (r = 0.40) and moderately strong (r = 0.60) rainfall-TWS relationship were also found to be significant (a = 0.05) but with up to 4 months lag and more in some basins. During the 2010 - 2017 period, estimated TWS trends (a = 0.05) showed a considerable fall in Orinoco (- 38.48 +/- 7.90 mm/yr) and Sao Francisco (- 30.84 +/- 4.17) while the strongest rise was found in Uruguay (28.28 +/- 3.49 mm/yr). As the rainfall-TWS relationship is not statistically significant (a = 0.05) in some areas, the spatial distribution of trends in TWS and rainfall, especially in some arid regions, which are inconsistent confirm possible impacts resulting from complex hydrogeological processes and/or anthropogenic influence. Further, in the modelling of TWS time series using the JADE-PLSR scheme, several validation skill metrics (e.g., R-2 , Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) confirm the considerable agreements between predicted and observed TWS in the Amazon (R-2 = 0.95), Orinoco (R-2 = 0.94), Tocantins (R-2 = 0.91), and Chobut (R-2 = 0.88). However, GRACE-hydrological signals in some regions are somewhat complex given the relatively higher uncertainties in the multivariate models employed in this study.

AB Statistical analysis of mean monthly rainfall measured by 31 gauges in the Freetown Peninsula shows clear differences between those facing the south-westerly monsoon and those in the peninsular rain-shadow. Whilst catches between ocean-facing and rain-shadow gauges were very similar in the drier months of December to May, catches by ocean-facing gauges were considerably greater in the wetter months of June to October, and their catches varied less spatially. Rainfall in the monsoon months increased with altitude, but the relationships between monthly rainfall and altitude were more marked for rain-shadow gauges than for ocean-facing gauges. Rainfall in the monsoon months also tended to decrease with distance from the sea, and whilst the decreases were similar in magnitude for both rain-shadow and ocean-facing gauges, the decreases per km distance were less variable in the rain-shadow than where gauges faced the ocean. Two gauges, one in rain-shadow and one ocean-facing, were found to catch less than expected; and two gauges in the ocean-facing group were found to be particularly influential in determining the regression fit.

AB Baseflow recession rates vary inter-seasonally in many watersheds. This variability is generally associated with changes in evapotranspiration; however, an additional and less studied control over inter-seasonal baseflow recession rates is the effect of aquifer antecedent storage. Understanding the role of aquifer antecedent storage on baseflow recession rates is crucial for Mediterranean-climate regions, where seasonal asynchronicity of precipitation and energy levels produces large inter-seasonal differences in aquifer storage. The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the relation between aquifer antecedent storage and baseflow recession rates in four central California watersheds using antecedent streamflow as a surrogate for watershed storage. In addition, a parsimonious storage-discharge model consisting of two nonlinear stores in parallel was developed as a heuristic tool for interpreting the empirical results and providing insight into how inter-seasonal changes in aquifer antecedent storage may affect baseflow recession rates. Antecedent streamflow cumulated from the beginning of the wateryear was found to be the strongest predictor of baseflow recession rates, indicating that inter-seasonal differences in aquifer storage are a key control on baseflow recession rates in California watersheds. Baseflow recession rates and antecedent streamflow exhibited a negative power-law relation, with baseflow recession rates decreasing by up to two orders of magnitude as antecedent streamflow levels increased. Inference based on the storage-discharge model indicated that the dominant source of recession flow shifted from small, rapid response aquifers at the beginning of the wet season to large, seasonal aquifers as the wet season progressed. Aquifer antecedent storage in California watersheds should be accounted for along with evapotranspiration when characterizing baseflow recession rates. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for management of eutrophication in off-stream artificial lakes in semi-arid and arid regions is proposed. Identification of the lake's water resources system components and stakeholders, simulation of Phosphorus (P) export from upstream watershed, simulation of the lake water quality as well as simulation of water demands and supply, development of management scenarios for the lake and selecting the best scenario using social choice methods (i.e. discrete and fuzzy Borda counts) are the four main parts of the framework. The proposed framework is applied on Chitgar Artificial Lake (ChAL), the largest intra-urban artificial lake in Tehran which has been constructed in 2010-2013 for recreational purposes. The Load Apportionment Model (LAM) is used for the simulation of P loads from the point and non-point (diffusive) sources and the LakeMab model is used for the simulation of P dynamics in the lake. The management scenarios contain optimized rule curves for water intake/outtake blended with P management plans (i.e. removal of point sources of P load in the upstream watershed, construction of a hydroponic bio-filter or an advanced water treatment plant beside the lake for reduction of external loading of P and recycling lake water, alum treatment of lake sediments for controlling the internal loading of P as well as construction of a dry detention basin). The most preferred scenarios selected by the discrete Borda count are the low-cost alum treatment and dry detention basin, while the most preferred scenario according to fuzzy Borda count, which considers the uncertainty of model inputs, is the costly water treatment plant. In all preferred scenarios, water intake is conducted from flood flows in order to avoid conflict with downstream agricultural demands. In addition to decentralized decision making and stakeholders' participation, the proposed framework promotes the integration of the technical aspects such as the role of internal loading in lake eutrophication and separation of flood and non-flood flows in the off-stream lakes' systems.

AB This paper lays the foundation for the use of scenario modelling as a tool for integrated water resource management in the Okavango River basin. The Pitman hydrological model is used to assess the impact of various development and climate change scenarios on downstream river flow. The simulated impact on modelled river discharge of increased water use for domestic use, livestock, and informal irrigation (proportional to expected population increase) is very limited. Implementation of all likely potential formal irrigation schemes mentioned in available reports is expected to decrease the annual flow by 2% and the minimum monthly flow by 5%. The maximum possible impact of irrigation on annual average flow is estimated as 8%, with a reduction of minimum monthly flow by 17%. Deforestation of all areas within a 1 km buffer around the rivers is estimated to increase the flow by 6%. However, construction of all potential hydropower reservoirs in the basin may change the monthly mean flow distribution dramatically, although under the assumed operational rules, the impact of the dams is only substantial during wet years. The simulated impacts of climate change are considerable larger that those of the development scenarios (with exception of the high development scenario of hydropower schemes) although the results are sensitive to the choice of GCM and the IPCC SRES greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. The annual mean water flow predictions for the period 2020-2050 averaged over scenarios from all the four GCMs used in this study are close to the present situation for both the A2 and B2 GHG scenarios. For the 2050-2080 and 2070-2099 periods the all-GCM mean shows a flow decrease of 20% (14%) and 26% (17%), respectively, for the A2 (B2) GHG scenarios. However, the uncertainty in the magnitude of simulated future changes remains high. The simulated effect of climate change on minimum monthly flow is proportionally higher than the impact on the annual mean flow. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall infiltration on hillslopes is an important issue in hydrology, which is related to many environmental problems, such as flood, soil erosion, and nutrient and contaminant transport. This study aimed to improve the quantification of infiltration on hillslopes under both steady and unsteady rainfalls. Starting from Darcy's law, an analytical integral infiltrability equation was derived for hillslope infiltration by use of the flux-concentration relation. Based on this equation, a simple scaling relation linking the infiltration times on hillslopes and horizontal planes was obtained which is applicable for both small and large times and can be used to simplify the solution procedure of hillslope infiltration. The infiltrability equation also improved the estimation of ponding time for infiltration under rainfall conditions. For infiltration after ponding, the time compression approximation (TCA) was applied together with the infiltrability equation. To improve the computational efficiency, the analytical integral infiltrability equation was approximated with a two-term power-like function by nonlinear regression. Procedures of applying this approach to both steady and unsteady rainfall conditions were proposed. To evaluate the performance of the new approach, it was compared with the Green-Ampt model for sloping surfaces by Chen and Young (2006) and Richards' equation. The proposed model outperformed the sloping GreenAmpt, and both ponding time and infiltration predictions agreed well with the solutions of Richards' equation for various soil textures, slope angles, initial water contents, and rainfall intensities for both steady and unsteady rainfalls.

AB It is necessary to consider a great number of arbitrarily developed fractures in applications involving realistic 3-d fracture network flow models of rock masses. In order to model the fluid flow in a complicated arrangement of discrete fracture networks (DFNs), two core issues have to be solved. Firstly, how does one identify the connection relationships between fractures in the 3-d arbitrary fracture network? Secondly, how can one calculate numerically the fluid flow in arbitrarily-shaped 2-d domains? This paper first proposes that the boundaries of all enclosed blocks form flow pathways. All enclosed blocks can be identified using a 3-d block cutting method. The boundaries of the blocks are composed of loops which are formed by intersecting lines between all faces (fractures and other surfaces). Therefore, the connection relationships between fractures can be determined according to the linkages of the loops. Accordingly, the linkages of the finite element nodes between different faces can also be determined. On the other hand, the fluid flow occurring in the fractures can be treated as a 2-d continuous flow within the arbitrarily shaped loops in the fracture's local coordinates. We propose that these loops can be meshed into triangles using a method of simplex triangulation of the arbitrarily shaped domain. Then, according to the linkages between nodes, the global conductivity matrix can be assembled and the solution of the equations governing flow can be derived. Three cases are used to validate the model. Finally, an analysis is made of a practical engineering example (with 8914 lines of intersection and 4188 loops) which shows that the proposed flow model is practicable and can deal with complicated DFNs.

AB Knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of moisture in soil is of great importance especially in arid regions where water is scarce. Following a previous research that showed a significant relationship between daylight surface wetness duration and the average chlorophyll content of 5 biocrusts in the Negev Desert (Israel), and the resultant outcome that pointed to the possible use of biocrusts as biomarkers for surface wetness duration, we hypothesize that biocrusts may also serve as biomarkers for the moisture content of the upper soil layer. Toward this end, daylight surface wetness duration was measured at 5 crust types following rain events during 1993-1995 along with periodical soil sampling of the upper 30 cm (at 5 cm intervals) of the soil profiles underlying these biocrusts. The findings showed a positive linear relationship between daylight surface wetness duration and the chlorophyll content of the crusts (r(2) = 0.96-0.97). High correlations were also found between daylight surface wetness duration and the available water content (r(2) = 0.96) and duration (r(2) = 0.85-0.88) of the upper 30 cm soil and between the chlorophyll content of the crust and the available water content (r(2) = 0.93-0.96) and duration (r(2) = 0.78-0.84). Topography-induced shading and slope position (which determined additional water either by runoff or subsurface flow) are seen responsible for the clear link between subsurface moisture content, daylight surface wetness duration and chlorophyll content of the crust. This link points to the possible use of biocrusts as biomarkers for subsurface water content and highlights the importance of crust typology and mapping for the study of the spatial distribution of water and their potential use for the study of ecosystem structure and function.

Throughfall, interception and stemflow represent, respectively, 65.3%, 34.2% and 0.5% of the incident rainfall. A semi-logarithmic relationship between interception and gross precipitation is given. Transpiration of the stand determined by sap-flow measurements represents only 27% of the potential evapotranspiration. Evaporation of water intercepted by the vegetation is the major component of the evapotranspiration.

AB There are substantial challenges facing humanity in the water and related sectors and purposeful integration of the disciplines, connected sectors and interest groups is now perceived as essential to address them. This article describes and uses bibliometric analysis techniques to provide quantitative insights into the general landscape of Integrated Water Resource Assessment and Modelling (IWAM) research over the last 45 years. Keywords, terms in titles, abstracts and the full texts are used to distinguish the 13,239 IWAM articles in journals and other non-grey literature. We identify the major journals publishing IWAM research, influential authors through citation counts, as well as the distribution and strength of source countries. Fruitfully, we find that the growth in numbers of such publications has continued to accelerate, and attention to both the biophysical and socioeconomic aspects has also been growing. On the other hand, our analysis strongly indicates that the former continue to dominate, partly by embracing integration with other biophysical sectors related to water environment, groundwater, ecology, climate change and agriculture. In the social sciences the integration is occurring predominantly through economics, with the others, including law, policy and stakeholder participation, much diminished in comparison. We find there has been increasing attention to management and decision support systems, but a much weaker focus on uncertainty, a pervasive concern whose criticalities must be identified and managed for improving decision making. It would seem that interdisciplinary science still has a long way to go before crucial integration with the non-economic social sciences and uncertainty considerations are achieved more routinely.

AB This study unravels the controlling factors of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations and solute export regimes of spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters, radium and Rn-222. A simplified analytical solution is derived to quantify radium based mean transient time (MTT) based on radium disequilibrium. Key hydrogeological and lithological parameters such as retardation factor (R-f,R-Ra) and MTT of radium nuclides, and effective surface areas (S-e) of subsurface are therefore quantified based on the long term monitoring records and discussed with the C-Q relation and solute export regimes. The study leads to the findings: 1) The spring water is characterized by very short MTT (days to weeks). Lower MTT, higher effective surface areas and R-f,R-Ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons. 2) The slow mass transfer between immobile and mobile phases controls the solute exports of Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Export regimes of theses solutes are negligibly influenced by dynamics of S-e and retardation processes. 3) Lower MIT, higher S-e and activation of NO3- and SO42- lead to higher concentrations of NO3- and SO42- in wet seasons, and vice versa in dry seasons. 4) SO42- export is additionally influenced by co-precipitation of sulphate precipitates. HCO3- is controlled by dynamics of CO2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table. This study demonstrates that the disequilibrium of radium transport in the fractured aquifer can be deployed to investigate the metrics of the critical zone and the solute export regimes of a springshed.

AB The joint design and operation of multi-reservoir systems is a vital issue for reservoir management. Existing studies mostly focus on determining the optimal scheme by establishing an optimization model and relying on intelligent algorithms. However, the research on the mutual feedback mechanism between the flood control capacity of each reservoir has not been adequately addressed. The overall aim of this paper is to propose a new joint optimization method for design and operation of multi-reservoir systems considering the conditional valueat-risk (CVaRa). In the proposed method, the flood damage assessment with CVaRa for a multi-reservoir system is constructed firstly, and then the feasible flood storage combination scheme (FSCS) of reservoirs in the system is deduced. Finally, the tradeoffs between the hydropower generation benefit and flood damage loss have been analyzed. Selecting China's Ankang-Danjiangkou Cascade Reservoirs as a case study, the results indicate that (1) the CVaRa value is more sensitive to changes in the flood storage of Danjiangkou reservoir (larger and downstream) than that of Ankang reservoir (smaller and upstream); (2) the feasible area of the FSCSs can be described as a triangle, and the boundary of this feasible interval is determined by the allowable minimum flood storage (AMFS) value of each reservoir; and (3) the relationship between the hydropower generation benefit and the flood damage assessment index CVaRa is not monotonic. These findings are helpful for understanding the relationship between flood storage values of each reservoir from the perspective of the entire multi-reservoir system.

AB The recharge mechanism of groundwater in the Badain Jaran Desert, North China has been a focus of research and still disputable in the past two decades. In this study, the chemical and hydrogen (H) and oxygen (0) isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater, lake water and local precipitation in the Badain Jaran Desert and neighboring areas were investigated to reveal the relationships between various water bodies and the recharge source of shallow groundwater. Isotopic and hydrogeochemical results show that (I) shallow groundwater was associated with local precipitation in the Ayouqi and Yabulai regions, (2) lake water was mainly recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland, (3) shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland, Yabulai Mountain and Gurinai Grassland had a common recharge source. Shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland had a mean recharge elevation of 1869 m a.s.l. on the basis of the isotope-altitude relationship and thus originated chiefly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the Yabulai Mountain. It is further concluded that shallow groundwater flowed towards the Gurinai Grassland according to the groundwater table contour map. Along the flow pathway, the H-O isotopic variations were primarily caused by the evaporation effect but chemical variations of shallow groundwater were affected by multiple factors, e.g., evaporation effect, dilution effect of occasional heavy-precipitation and dissolution of aquifer evaporites. Our findings provide new insight into the groundwater cycle and benefit the management of the limited water resources in the arid desert area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal stability (Schmidt stability) and water age, which are significantly related to water quality and algae bloom in deep reservoirs, are two crucial indicators of stratification strength and pollutant transport time, respectively. Here, the original Schmidt stability, which was derived from a one-dimensional assumption, was theoretically extended to a three-dimensional water body. In addition, a three-dimensional model was verified for the case study of Hongfeng Reservoir in China based on data from 2009 and 2010. Although the revised stability was similar to the original stability of Hongfeng Reservoir, which occurred at a relatively low level, the greater stratification in other deep water bodies would enhance their difference. Air temperature and water depth were the most important factors of the temporal variation in stability and the spatial variation in stability, respectively. The pollutant transport processes in the Hongfeng Reservoir was very complex with alternate appearances of overflow, interflow and underflow, depending on the season. The spatial water age was primarily determined by the morphometry and the inflow/outflow (with the highest water age in North Lake), whereas the vertical difference in the water age among the layers was primarily controlled by thermal stratification. Negative linear relationships between the average stability and the water ages of the bottom layers in three representative sites during summer were observed. Positive linear relationships between the average stability and the water ages of the surface layers were also observed. These findings enable a better understanding of the hydrodynamic and pollutant transport processes in a deep reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall-groundwater interactions are complex and can depend upon a variety of hydro-geological and geographical conditions and can commonly present high nonlinearity. This study proposed an integration of cross wavelet transform and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to analyze the space-time nonlinear relationships between the precipitation and groundwater changes. The proposed method was applied to investigating the non-stationary and nonlinear precipitation-groundwater relationships in Pingtung Plain aquifer during 2005-2010. We analyzed daily groundwater and rainfall observations at 47 wells and 27 stations across the study area operated by Taiwan Water Resources Agency and Central Weather Bureau respectively. Results show that EOF method revealed three major space-time patterns of the groundwater levels. The cross wavelet transform further identified the lagged effects between precipitation and groundwater changes. The temporal lags 'can vary not only with respect to the temporal scales of groundwater processes, but also the different identified groundwater regions, which can associate with distinct physical mechanisms. In general, the lagged periods between high frequency signals of precipitation and groundwater can range from 0 to 18 days, showing how rainfall events perturbed the groundwater levels across space. The long-term lags for the three identified underlying groundwater processes were 3.71, 56.6, and 72.07 days, respectively, showing seasonal recharge patterns can depend upon the geographical and geological conditions. Our results distinguished the space-time recharge processes in different frequencies, which present nonlinear and non-stationary rainfall-recharge interactions of a groundwater system, which can be spatially and frequency dependent.

AB Changes of global terrestrial water storage (TWS) retrieved from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission have been extensively evaluated in previous studies. However, natural drivers and their relative contributions to global TWS changes (TWSC) are still poorly understood. In this study, based on two global precipitation (P) datasets, three global evapotranspiration (ET) datasets, and one global runoff (R) dataset, the responses of TWSC to the three major water fluxes, P, ET, and R, were comprehensively examined for 168 river basins. In addition, by using hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis, the corresponding relative contributions (RC) of P, ET, and R to TWSC were quantified. The results showed that for the period Jan. 2003-Dec. 2011, significant increases in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) were observed over 49 basins, whereas 42 basins presented significant decreases in TWSA. A robust positive relationship between P and TWSC was observed in low-latitude basins, but strong negative relationships of TWSC with ET and R were identified in mid- and high-latitude basins. Averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all P-ET-R combinations, we found that three independent variables explained an average of 61.4% of TWSC. The corresponding RC of P, ET, and R were 42.6%, 43.2% and 4.2%, respectively. In spatial terms, a larger contribution of P to TWSC was found in low-latitude basins, and larger contributions of ET and R were identified for mid-and high-latitude basins. The findings of this study were important for improving our understanding of global TWSC responses to climate change.

AB This is the second in a series of three papers about the meta-channel concept which illustrates the derivation of the principles behind the concept, the construction of the hydraulic geometry and the application of the concept to flood routing, respectively. It was shown in the first of these that a channel network in a catchment can be conceptualized into a single 'effective channel' representation: a meta-channel. This study uses this conceptualization to show how such a meta-channel can be constructed. The techniques derived are applied to one catchment in New Zealand. We derive hydraulic geometries expressed as functions of flow distance throughout this catchment based on the Leopold and Maddock power laws. This derivation uses classical published values for hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents, regional parameterization of the index flood relationship for New Zealand as a whole, together with local knowledge regarding the order of magnitude of the channel roughness. Conservation principles derived from the continuity and mechanical energy balance equations are used to construct the hydraulic geometry of the meta-channel of this catchment. A meta-channel long profile is established and compared against the mainstream long profile. The effectiveness of the Leopold and Maddock power law assumptions is tested by comparing the derived hydraulic geometry against available field cross-sectional data for the gauging site at the outlet of the catchment.

AB The relationship of groundwater flow paths to the acid/base status and composition of groundwater was examined by directly monitoring groundwater inputs to an acidic Adirondack, New York, lake (Dart's Lake). Groundwater inputs near the shoreline of the lake were acidic throughout the year (pH <5 and alkalinity <0 mueq L-1) and reflected the influence of shallow soil horizons. Groundwater transported within the deep surficial deposits and through sediments farther from shore was characterized by higher alkalinity and higher pH values and was enriched in nitrate (>40 mueq L-1). Elevated concentrations of basic cations and alkalinity as well as lower concentrations of organic anions and sulfate were characteristic of deep groundwater entering the lake at the study site. Spatial variability of groundwater chemistry was found to be substantial over a relatively short distance (<6 m) from the lake shoreline and indicates that inputs to the lake of components dissolved in groundwater are highly flow path dependent.

AB The hydrology of the Canadian prairie region is complicated by the existence of numerous land depressions that change the contributing area dynamically and result in a non-linear and hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage. Depressions are represented conceptually in most hydrologic models as simple storage (bucket) units. These conceptual approaches are simplified and might not adequately represent the dynamics of the depressions and the changing non-contributing area either temporally or spatially, and therefore, the simulation of streamflow remains challenging. This study advances a more physically based simulation of the hydrology, streamflow, and spatiotemporal pluvial/nival flooding extents and the associated noncontributing area in the prairies. This is achieved by coupling the MESH hydrology-land surface model with a newly developed surface routing component designed to explicitly deal with the prairie-pothole system (PRIMA) and is referred to as MESH-PRIMA. In this model, MESH handles the classical vertical water and energy balance calculations while PRIMA routes the water over the landscape and quantifies the depressional storage and runoff. The streamflow simulation of MESH-PRIMA is compared against that of MESH with its current conceptual prairie algorithm (MESH-PDMROF) on the Smith Creek Research Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. MESH-PRIMA shows an improved streamflow and flood simulation compared to MESH-PDMROF and can replicate the non-linear and hysteretic relationship of the basin response. MESH-PRIMA allows for mapping the spatial distribution of water (pluvial/nival flooding) and the non-contributing area over landscape for different events. The results of MESH-PRIMA can help in updating the non-contributing area map and in identifying pluvial/nival flooding hazard, which is useful in flooding contexts.

AB The loss of available nutrients and the effects of soil erodibility on available nutrients losses were rarely researched. Here, laboratory simulation experiments were conducted to determine the soil erodibility effects on the available nitrogen (AN) and phosphorus (AP) losses. The impacts of rainfall intensity and slope on AN and AP losses were also studied. Two contrasting agricultural soils (Burozems and Cinnamon) that occur throughout the northern erosion region of China were selected. Two rainfall intensities (60 and 120 mm h(-1)) and two slopes (10% and 20%) were studied. Overall, greater runoff, sediment and available nutrient losses occurred from the Cinnamon soil due to its greater soil erodibility, which was approximately 2.8 times greater than that of the Burozems soil. The influence of runoff on sediment was positively linear. The absolute slope of the regression line between runoff rate and sediment yield rate was suitable as a soil erodibility indicator. Runoff-associated AN and AP losses were mainly controlled by runoff rate, and were weakly affected by soil erodibility (p > 0.05). However, soil erodibility significantly influenced the sediment-associated AN and AP losses (p < 0.01), and a positive logarithmic correlation best described their relationships. Since the runoff-associated AN and AP losses dominated the total AN and AP losses for both soils, soil erodibility also exhibited negligible influence on the total AN and AP losses (p > 0.05). Increasing rainfall intensity and slope generally increased the runoff, sediment, and available nutrient losses for both soils, but had no significant influences on their relationships. Our results provide a better understanding of soil and nutrient loss mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies have shown that statistics of streamflow time series, in particular empirical moments, scale with physical properties of the drainage basin, such as the catchment area. Those scaling laws have been extensively used to estimate statistics of streamflow series at ungauged sites. The role of climate variability and change has not been considered in such models. Further, most studies are based on classical statistics, where parameter uncertainties are usually neglected or not formally considered. In this paper we develop and apply hierarchical Bayesian models, to both assess regional and at-site trends in time in a spatial scaling framework, and simultaneously provide a rigorous framework for assessing and reducing parameter and model uncertainties. The models are tested with reconstructed natural inflow series from over 40 hydropower sites in Brazil with catchments areas varying from 2588 to 823,555 km(2). Both annual maximum flood series and monthly streamflow are considered. Cross-validated results show that the Hierarchical Bayesian models are able to skillfully estimate monthly and flood flow probability distribution parameters for sites that were not used in model fitting. The models developed can be used to provide record augmentation at sites that have short records, or to estimate flow at ungauged sites, even in the absence of an assumption of time stationarity. Since model uncertainties are accounted for, the precision of the estimates can be quantified and hypotheses tests for regional and at-site trends can be formally made. A formal inclusion of climate predictors to facilitate seasonal forecasting or climate change scenario development is also feasible. This is indicated, but not developed here. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Flow and infiltration during flash floods in ephemeral channels were investigated through scaling analysis and numerical experiments. Scaling of the equations governing flow has shown that momentum loss due to transmission losses (flow that infiltrates through the channel bed) during flash floods can be of the same order as momentum loss due to channel friction and can significantly affect the flow velocity. Numerical simulations were carried out using a shock-capturing MUSCL (monotonic upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws), which incorporates transmission losses as a sink term in the momentum and continuity equations. The wetted area of the channel bed during floods is the primary control on the volume of water that can infiltrate into the bed. The increased velocity of floods in narrow channels that adds wetted area to the channel bed due to greater flood propagation distance is not sufficient to overcome the reduction in wetted area due to reduced channel width; wider channels transmit a greater percentage of the flood volume that enters the channel reach to the bed sediments. Floods of the same total volume but different hydrograph shapes transmit different proportions of their volume to the bed sediments; the nature and magnitude of the differences will depend on the flood propagation distance. Increasing the total volume of the flood and decreasing the channel width increases the sensitivity of the total infiltration to the hydrograph shape. For reaches of the same bed area but different spatial distributions of channel width, differences in the rate of channel widening affect the spatial distribution but not the total volume of water that infiltrates into the bed sediments.

AB Groundwater as an open-access and a common pool resource (CPR) among several beneficiaries faces overexploitation especially in arid and semi-arid regions. To tackle such problems, cooperative management method using game theory concepts could be considered as an effective approach in operating a CPR. This study examines the effect of cooperation and internalization of environmental damages on managing the groundwater resources in Namdan aquifer located in Fars province, Iran. For this purpose, an evolutionary hydro-economic simulation-optimization model has been developed and various cooperation and environmental damages internalization scenarios have been considered to the study area over a planning horizon of 30 years. Continuous ant colony optimization (CACO) algorithm, which is an innovative application in this area of study has been applied to the simulation- optimization model. Some cooperative game theory methods have been used to allocate the obtained net benefits. The results indicate that under the full-cooperation scenario, the highest value of the sum of net benefits has been gained for any value of environmental damages. Moreover, internalizing the environmental damages has caused increase in the sum of net benefits among all cooperation scenarios. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the effect of changing the environmental damages value and also the importance factor of extraction externalities. The results of these analysis indicate that the cooperation conditions are independent of the value of environmental damages and also the intensity of extraction externalities. The methodology presented in this study provides water resource managers with a cooperative management platform in order to evaluate the possibilities of sustainable development of groundwater resources in more realistic conditions. The application of an efficient evolutionary algorithm provides a variety of realistic problems with an opportunity to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization techniques.

AB Soil hydraulic conductivity (K) significantly affects subsurface flow and solute transport, but convenient measurement of K remains a challenge. Electrical conductivity (EC), which can be measured conveniently and accurately, can be quantitatively related to K because of the similarity between current movement and groundwater flow, motivating us to estimate K using EC. A soil column apparatus was built to explore the relation between EC and K. Fifty-four experiments were conducted under various degrees of soil compaction and grain diameters, including six different particle sizes, three compaction levels, and six solution concentrations. The overall (negative) correlation between K and EC can be fitted reasonably well by an exponential function with a large determination coefficient (> 0.81) for each solute concentration, while a power-law function better fits the correlation when K is larger than 10 m/d. These experiments led to several empirical models (for specific solution concentrations) and one comprehensive model (with variable parameters) to estimate K given EC. In the field, if the EC of pore water can be measured, the empirical models under the specific solution concentrations can be applied to greatly improve the K estimation. Comparison showed that the proposed models, which provides a quick estimate of K using easily available EC, performed better than most of the classical grain size-based formulas. Although there is uncertainty in the K estimation likely due to the limited control factors considered in this study, the new method proposed above can provide a convenient estimate for K for the field site with strong spatial heterogeneity.

AB We have assessed the ability of a range of pesticide, site and climate parameters to discriminate between detected and non-detected pesticides as observed by long-term monitoring data of pesticide use and groundwater occurrence in a small catchment in southern Sweden. Of seventeen investigated parameters, six demonstrated such an ability: dosage applied, the Henry's Law Constant (HLC), the octanol-water partitioning coefficient (logP(ow)), the amount of precipitation the week before application, the amount of precipitation the month after application, and the substance degradation potential (DT50). The apparent influence of the investigated parameters on pesticide occurrence in groundwater, and their apparent suitability as descriptive parameters in terms of assessment of related risks, is accordingly discussed.
   We conclude that knowledge of actual pesticide use appear fundamental for risk assessment of groundwater contamination potential. We further suggest that chemical property-parameters of specific pesticides, although clearly valuable, should be applied in groundwater contamination risk assessments with care. If site-specific values are unattainable, tabular values of logP(ow), HLC and water solubility (W-s) are demonstrated to exhibit a superior explanatory ability than those of substance adsorption potential (K-oc) and DT50 which, in the latter case, is shown to be able to lead to misleading conclusions on actual risks.
   The demonstrated explanatory ability of precipitation both before and after application suggests that relatively greater precipitation amounts occur in relation to application of non-detected substances. Increased dilution and run-off as well as decreased soil matrix retainment and decreased top-soil cracking are potential explanations although higher-resolution monitoring records are needed in order to confirm these hypotheses.

AB Accurate prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is essential for efficient planning and management of limited water resources through proper irrigation scheduling. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approach to ET0 estimation was adopted to compute ET0 from data obtained in a subtropical climatic region in Bangladesh. Quantified ET0 values along with the meteorological variables for two other Stations located in south Florida, USA, were directly obtained from the USGS website. A commonly used machine learning algorithm, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), was employed to predict daily ET0 using regional meteorological data (e.g., daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity, sensible heat flux, latent heat and sunshine duration). Four optimization algorithms were employed to tune ANFIS, resulting in hybrid models: Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO-ANFIS), Firefly Algorithm (FA-ANFIS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-ANFIS), and Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO-ANFIS). These models' performances were compared with the standard ANFIS model with parameters tuned using an Integrated Least Squares and Backpropagation Gradient Descent (LSGD) algorithm. Decision theories were applied to assess the accuracy of the predictions as well as to rank prediction models based on eight statistical indices. Results indicated that FA-ANFIS resulted in the most accurate ET0 predictions. In the next stage, ensembles of these prediction models were compared to determine whether the ensemble models resulted in more reliable predictions than the standalone models. To develop each ensemble, three decision theories were applied: Shannon's Entropy, Coefficient of Variation, and Grey Relational Analysis. All three ensemble approaches provided similar results, showing ensemble prediction methods to perform better than most individual models.

AB Palaeo-hydrological interpretations of lake sediment proxies can benefit from a robust understanding of the modern lake environment. In this study, we use Nar Golu, a non-outlet, monomictic maar lake in central Turkey, as a field site for a natural experiment using observations and measurements over a 17-year monitoring period (1997-2014). We compare lake water and sediment trap data to isotopic, chemical and biotic proxies preserved in its varved sediments. Nar Golu underwent a 3 m lake-level fall between 2000 and 2010. delta O-18(lakewater) is correlated with this lake-level fall, responding to the change in water balance. Endogenic carbonate is shown to precipitate in isotopic equilibrium with lake water and there is a strong relationship between delta O-18(lakewater) and delta O-18(carbonare), which suggests the water balance signal is accurately recorded in the sediment isotope record. Over the same period, sedimentary diatom assemblages also responded, and conductivity inferred from diatoms showed a rise. Shifts in carbonate mineralogy and elemental chemistry in the sediment record through this decade were also recorded. Intra-annual changes in delta O-18(lakewater) and lake water chemistry are used to demonstrate the seasonal variability of the system and the influence this may have on the interpretation of delta O-18(carbonate) We use these relationships to help interpret the sedimentary record of changing lake hydrology over the last 1725 years. Nar Golu has provided an opportunity to test critically the chain of connection from present to past, and its sedimentary record offers an archive of decadal- to centennial-scale hydro-climatic change.

AB Urban evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential part of the hydrological cycle. A complete understanding of urban ET is necessary to understand the interaction between the atmosphere and the urban surface. However, estimating urban ET is challenging due to the influence of urban surface heterogeneity and human activities in urban areas. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved multisource parallel model (PM-urban) based on the Penman Monteith model, which is suitable for the ET estimation for the underlying surface of the city. The PM-urban model takes into account the violent human activities in the city, and its main characteristics are: (1) the anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) was included in the surface energy balance formula; (2) The building water dissipation was considered. In this paper, taking Shenzhen, one of the cities with the fastest urbanization process globally, as an example, seven urban ET maps of Shenzhen were generated using Landsat 8 images. The model was verified using pan evaporation data corrected by complementary relationships. The results showed that: (1) The ET of each land use type has the following relationship: water body > vegetation > bare soil > no building impervious surface, and the value of building water dissipation varies due to the height and type of buildings significant; (2) The PM-urban model that considers AHF is better than the original model that ignores AHF; (3) This model can describe the characteristics of urban ET well and explain the phenomenon of high water consumption in cities. Our research results provide a new perspective for calculating the urban ET, which can be applied to urban management, planning, and reducing the urban heat island effect.

TI Recession and hysteresis effects of hyporheic zone permeability changes

AB Baseflow is the main groundwater discharge mode from mountainous areas to rivers and is an important component of river runoff. Temperature changes in the hyporheic zone in seasonal freeze-thaw areas cause changes in its permeability, which then affect the recession of baseflow. It is critical to study underground surface water transformation processes in cold regions to explore baseflow recession and hysteresis effects caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone under variable temperatures. In this study, we investigated the Hanyangtun Basin in the Changbai Mountain District to determine the functional relationship between permeability and temperature in the hyporheic zone using theoretical analysis combined with laboratory saturated permeability experiments using medium-and fine-grained sand at variable temperatures. We then calculated and analyzed the recession amplitude and hysteresis time of the baseflow caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone of this freeze-thaw mountainous area using water temperature and reference baseflow data. The results indicate that owing to large temperature changes in the study area, the permeability of the hyporheic zone changed substantially. Lower permeability leads to the blocking of groundwater discharging to surface water, i. e., the baseflow hysteresis effect. The recession amplitude of the baseflow caused by lower permeability increased with decreasing temperatures, reaching a maximum of 41.67%. The groundwater discharge hysteresis time increased with decreasing temperature. The hysteresis effect was most obvious during the stable melting period, with a maximum hysteresis time of 16 days, while the total annual hysteresis time was 60 days. This study provides a new perspective for qualitative and quantitative studies of the relationship between groundwater and surface water in the mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze-thaw.

AB Erosion is the process of land degradation due to rainfall and other environmental factors, and it can be described by indices such as the kinetic energy of rainfall (KE). Microphysical data from disdrometers have been used to determine the relationship between kinetic energy content (KEmm, in J m(-2) mm(-1)) and rainfall intensity (R, in mm h(-1)). Optical disdrometer (PWS100) measurements were gathered between 2014 and 2018 at five sampling sites across Mexico, and the data analyzed to study the characteristics of KEmm-R relationships with altitude. A PWS100 unit at each of the sampling sites was collocated a few meters from a tipping-bucket rain gauge to record R simultaneously. Individual raindrops fall speeds measured with the disdrometers were found to agree well with theoretical estimations using the environmental conditions at each sampling site. The mean fall velocities indicated that raindrops detected at the continental sampling sites (medium and high altitudes) have greater speeds than those near coastal areas (low altitudes). Comparisons of the estimated KEmm for rainy periods with comparable R show greater values as the altitude increases. This result is attributed to the increase of raindrop fall speed due to the air density decrement with altitude. Exponential relations between KEmm and R based on one-minute sampling periods were fitted for each sampling site, producing high values of coefficients of determination and suggesting a good response. Finally, the maximum kinetic energy parameter, KEmax, in the empirical KEmm-R equations was found to increase with altitude. These findings indicate that the detachment of soil particles by individual drops are magnified at higher altitude locations.

ID TRENDS
AB Recently available hydrological data from Hukou station at the junction of the Poyang Lake with the Yangtze River along with other data from stations in the Poyang Lake basin have allowed further examination and understanding of the basin effect (basin discharge generated by rainfall) and the Yangtze River blocking effect on variations of the Poyang Lake level and floods at annual to decadal scales. Major results show that the basin effect has played a primary role influencing the level, of Poyang Lake and development of severe floods, white the Yangtze River played a complementary rote of blocking outflows from the take. In most cases, only when the basin effect weakened did the river effect become large, a relationship indicating that the river's blocking effect diminishes when the take level is high from receiving large amount of basin discharge, albeit a few exceptions to this relationship occurred when river flow also was elevated from receiving large rainfall discharges in upstream areas. Moreover, the basin effect has become stronger in the period 1960-2003 in accordance with the increase of warm season rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin. In particular, large increases of the basin's rainfall in the 1990s corresponded to the most severe floods (in 1998, 1995, and 1992) of the last 4 decades. The strong increase of warm season rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin in the 1990s is consistent with the recent southward shift of major warm season rain bands in eastern China. Results of this study provide a utility for improving predictions of the Poyang Lake level and floods, which affect a population of about 10 million. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An approach is presented for a joint mapping and regionalization of statistical descriptors of streamflow like the mean value and the coefficient of variation of daily data, the flow duration curve, moments and distributions of annual minima and maxima. Probability theory, and specifically extreme value theory, offers possible parametric relations to be tested, linking knowledge of the basic mean value and coefficient of variation with the other descriptors. This initial study is limited to theoretical results derived from the assumption that the original daily data follow the lognormal or the gamma distribution. With these standard distributions the statistical regularity found is surprisingly good when confronting the theory against the empirical data of daily streamflow from 35 catchments in the Moselle drainage basin in France. The lognormal distribution appears to be the best candidate for the flow duration curve, as well as maximum and minimum streamflow. The tail behaviour of streamflow maxima is well described, while for minima the results are more difficult to interpret. One problem might be the relative higher uncertainty in annual low flow data, and especially the sensitivity to outliers towards high values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, infrared thermal imaging technology is adopted to measure water content at soil surface by cali-brating the linear relationship between water content at soil surface and interfacial temperature difference of a given soil type. The method is suitable for the soil surface which is unsaturated. First of all, the theoretical considerations of the new method are introduced. Infrared thermal imaging technology can directly measure soil surface temperature and the difference between the soil surface temperature and the ambient temperature is named as the interfacial temperature difference. For over-saturated soils, at a certain environmental condition, the interfacial temperature difference of a given soil type is a constant value. For unsaturated soils, there is a linear relationship between water content at soil surface and interfacial temperature difference. For the tested four types of soils with different textures, all the values of R2 for the linear fitting are greater than 0.9. Then, the water content at soil surface can be calculated based on the surface temperature measured by the infrared camera. Moreover, in this study, a cracked soil sample with an uneven surface water content field is tested for validating the feasibility of the proposed method. There is a good match between the data measured by the proposed method and traditional oven drying. It indicates that the proposed method can be used to obtain the distribution of water content on the soil surface and may provide a new idea for the future research on the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of in-situ soil under climate change and provide a new choice for leakage detection of structures like dams, tunnels, etc.

AB Downscaling of local daily precipitation from large-scale climatic variables is required for assessing the impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources. This study proposes wavelet transform (WT)-based FeedForward Neural Network (FF-NN) and Nonlinear Auto Regressive with exogenous inputs Network (NARX-NN) models for downscaling daily precipitation. The models are applied to a large river basin, the Krishna River basin, in the Indian subcontinent. Several climatic variables, including geo-potential heights, wind direction, vorticity, humidity, air temperature, mean sea level pressure, meridional velocity at surface, and 500hpa and 850hpa levels, are considered based on their statistical correlations. The results are evaluated using different performance measures and the ability of the models to capture the extreme events at five selected grid points (in different locations) having varying climatic characteristics is assessed. The performance of the proposed waveletbased models is also compared with that of four different traditional and recent downscaling methods: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM), Genetic Programming (GP), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The results reveal that the wavelet-based neural network models (WT-FF-NN and WT-NARX-NN) are robust compared to the other methods in terms of their ability to capture the regional precipitation patterns and the extreme events. The improvement in the wavelet-based models can be attributed to their ability to unravel the hidden relationship between the predictors and precipitation. It is also observed that there is considerable increase in the correlation between precipitation and the decomposed climatic variables. All these results suggest that wavelets aid in unravelling the relationship between local precipitation and large-scale climatic variables and improving the overall performance of the downscaling models.

AB Abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability. How to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue, but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking. In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels: no, weak, moderate, strong, and dramatic. The approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component. A bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change. Results of Monte-Carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach, and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change. The approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change, and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series.
   Application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in China showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern China, which have arid or semi-arid climate and severe shortages of water resources. Runoff processes in northern China were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern China. Although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount (SWRA) exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds, abrupt changes in the latter were more significant. Compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation, human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding SWRA, except for the Northwest Inland River watershed.

AB Variations in inferred water movement are examined during a two-year study of an upland floodplain wetland at Afon Clwyd, in mid-Wales, UK in 2001 and 2002. Soil-water pressures (psi) were monitored by six tensiometer nests, each comprising two sensors at depths of 30 and 60 cm below the surface. Detailed sedimentary sections were produced and changes in saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (and their relationship to psi) were estimated. Seasonal trends in psi were identified and vertical hydraulic gradients within different tensiometer nests were derived and interpreted in the context of the local channel and floodplain sedimentology, channel bedform morphology and hydro-climatic conditions. Although there is considerable variation in psi, the results display characteristic trends at several levels: (1) in relationship to precipitation; (2) reflecting changes in river stage (with downstream stage providing base-level control through a riffle-pool couplet); and (3) marked spatial variations in the direction and rate of water movement. These controls influence water redistribution through the wetland, which reflects the relative position of distinct sedimentary units within the floodplain. The results demonstrate that water movement is episodic and characterised by relatively rapid horizontal water fluxes during and immediately following individual rain events, followed by residual seepage to the river and water movement under a local soil moisture gradient. The implications of these results include elucidating the role of upland floodplains in buffering sub-surface drainage, and attenuating patterns of river flow under base flow conditions. This has the potential to advance the basis for future upland floodplain wetland and channel restoration schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds must identify solute sources and their spatial and temporal connectivity to rivers to assess the processes that control the solute behavior in these rivers. In this study, we collected hourly time series of total dissolved ions (TDI) concentrations, water levels, water temperatures and air temperatures at select stations distributed longitudinally in a river in an arid watershed. Our objectives were to: (1) document the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations and (2) determine the processes controlling the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations. We conducted this investigation over a two-year period at four stations along the Okavango River flowing through the Okavango Delta (Delta) in the middle Kalahari Desert, Botswana. At the spatial scale, we observed progressive downriver enrichment in TDI concentrations associated with evapotranspiration of river water because of the 5 months river transit across the hot Delta. At a temporal scale, the TDI concentrations increased seasonally from evapoconcentration and subseasonally from solute transfer from the watershed to the river. We analyzed sub-seasonal TDI concentration perturbations using the slope (beta) of the relationship between TDI concentrations and normalized water level (CNWL) relationships. We find that at low discharge during flow recession and at the beginning of rising discharge from flooding, the solute enrichment anomalies with beta > 0 are related to hydrologic connectivity between the river and solute stores in the river floodplains, hundreds of thousands of salt islands and isolated evapoconcentrated wetland pools. Our findings indicate that hydrologically-driven river connectivity to solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration jointly control the solute behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales in rivers in arid watersheds. We anticipate that our findings will inform solute transport and solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds.

AB Multipurpose reservoir operation is a very complex decision-making process because of its multiple and usually conflicting targets. A system view of the interactions between various reservoir purposes (like for example, hydropower production and environmental impacts such as fish habitats, sediment flushing, and landslide stability) is a prerequisite to attain the full benefits from reservoir operations. System dynamics simulation is a well suited approach for dealing with complex time-varying systems and is widely used in water resources management and analyses of global change. This paper presents the development of a generic system dynamics simulation approach (SDSA) for the analyses of interactions between reservoir's various functions. The implementation of SDSA includes two steps. First, the causal diagram of the reservoir system is used to map and analyze the main interactions among reservoir system's different components, identify driving feedback relationships and use the system structure to obtain insights' into system behavior. In the second step, the stock and flow diagraming is used to quantify those feedbacks and interactions by introducing a set of physical and empirical relationships required to simulate the model. The developed SDSA is applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir in China. Scenario based simulation analyses are performed with the SDSA model to increase the understanding of placing different priorities on the interactions between hydropower production and environmental impacts of reservoir operations. Results from model validation and sensitivity analyses suggest that the developed SDSA model is capable of simulating interactions among reservoir's various functions, and the case study application demonstrates the utility of the model for capturing the main characteristics of reservoir system dynamic behavior. The insights gained from model simulations can assist in environmentally friendly operations of the reservoir.

AB Owing to the rise in water demand and looming climate change, recent years have witnessed much focus on global drought scenarios. As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Beginning with a discussion of drought definitions, this paper attempts to provide a review of fundamental concepts of drought, classification of droughts, drought indices, historical droughts using paleoclimatic studies, and the relation between droughts and large scale climate indices. Conclusions are drawn where gaps exist and more research needs to be focussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the largely dry and increasingly heavily populated western US, operational modeling systems for seasonal river runoff volume forecasting are key elements of the practical water and hydropower management infrastructure. Explainability of model results in terms of known hydroclimatic processes and conditions is a core requirement for these systems. To improve geophysical interpretability of a standard statistical modeling approach to operational water supply forecasting (WSF), we introduce a hybrid statistical-artificial intelligence method. The procedure involves using a recently developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed for improved explainability (non-negative matrix factorization with k-means clustering, NMFk) to extract a compact basin-scale hydroclimatic index from available precipitation and snowpack data; that index is then used as the predictor variate in a largely conventional probabilistic regression on seasonal water supply. The resulting method, dominant-signal NMFk regression, is applied to a challenging forecast site, the Owyhee River, drawn from the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service WSF system. Outcomes demonstrate that improved interpretability and plausibility relative to conventional statistical methods are achieved through physical consistency of NMFk results with nonnegativity of the environmental data being analyzed. In particular, the nonnegativity property facilitates identifying potential geophysical relationships to input variable type (snow water equivalent vs. accumulated precipitation), location, and underlying hydrologic processes; and it encourages nonnegative river runoff predictions, improving physical realism of WSFs over conventional statistical approaches in certain cases. The method also offers straightforward interpretation of relationships to known forms of climate variability. However, testing suggests that with these capabilities come limitations. Its primary anticipated role, at present, is to augment geophysical interpretation when needed, by serving as a complement alongside other methods in a next-generation US West-wide operational forecasting system.

TI Estimation of relative hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils based on a

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE vadose zone modeling; infiltration in sandy soils; water retention
   curves; relative hydraulic conductivity
AB The sophistication of numerical methods that are available to solve the governing equation of unsaturated flow in soils (Richards' equation) far exceeds the ability to accurately estimate parametric functions of the equation. One of these parametric functions that defines the relationship between the capillary pressure and saturation (retention function) is usually obtained by fitting one of a number of available models to measured laboratory or field data. A second relationship, the hydraulic conductivity-saturation function can also be obtained by fitting to measured data. More often, the measured data of hydraulic conductivity is not available and a model of hydraulic conductivity-saturation function is obtained by using measured capillary pressure-saturation data. Such a hydraulic conductivity model that is widely used in soil physics applications was developed by Mualem (Mualem, Y,, 1976 Water. Resour, Res. 12 (3), 513-522), An empirical parameter in this model was obtained by fitting to retention data from non-sandy, agricultural field soils. This model also conceptualizes unsaturated flow to occur in pipes that assume no air-water interfaces. In most aquifer contamination problems sandy soils are encountered and the unsaturated flow in these soils is dominated by air-water interfaces. In a laboratory sand column experiment we have demonstrated that the Mualem's model under-predicts the hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils. A new model of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity that is specifically applicable for sandy soils is developed. This model approximates the sand grains by uniform spheres, and uses a flow geometry that allows for the incorporation of an air-water interface at the pore-scale. The model was then applied to predict the capillary pressure head in a laboratory sand column under conditions of vertical infiltration. The proposed model matched the observations much better compared to Mualem's model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

AB Spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture (theta) is a challenge that remains to be better understood. A trade-off exists between spatial coverage and temporal resolution when using the manual and realtime 8 monitoring methods. This restricted the comprehensive and intensive examination of theta dynamics. In this study, we integrated the manual and real-time monitored data to depict the hillslope theta dynamics with good spatial coverage and temporal resolution. Linear (stepwise multiple linear regression-SMLR) and non-linear (support vector machines-SVM) models were used to predict theta at 39 manual sites (collected 1-2 times per month) with theta collected at three real-time monitoring sites (collected every 5 mins). By comparing the accuracies of SMLR and SVM for each depth and manual site, an optimal prediction model was then determined at this depth of this site. Results showed that theta at the 39 manual sites can be reliably predicted (root mean square errors <0.028 m(3) m(-3)) using both SMLR and SVM. The linear or non-linear relationship between theta at each manual site and at the three real-time monitoring sites was the main reason for choosing SMLR or SVM as the optimal prediction model. The subsurface flow dynamics was an important factor that determined whether the relationship was linear or non-linear. Depth to bedrock, elevation, topographic wetness index, profile curvature, and theta temporal stability influenced the selection of prediction model since they were related to the subsurface soil water distribution and movement. Using this approach, hillslope theta spatial distributions at un-sampled times and dates can be predicted. Missing information of hillslope theta dynamics can be acquired successfully.

   Up-scaling from physically based numerical simulations at hillslope

AB Subsurface stormflow is an important component of the rainfall-runoff response, especially in steep forested regions. However; its contribution is poorly represented in current generation of land surface hydrological models (LSMs) and catchment-scale rainfall-runoff models. The lack of physical basis of common parameterizations precludes a priori estimation (i.e. without calibration), which is a major drawback for prediction in ungauged basins, or for use in global models. This paper is aimed at deriving physically based parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship relating to subsurface flow. These parameterizations are derived through a two-step up-scaling procedure: firstly, through simulations with a physically based (Darcian) subsurface flow model for idealized three dimensional rectangular hillslopes, accounting for within-hillslope random heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties, and secondly, through subsequent up-scaling to the catchment scale by accounting for between-hillslope and within-catchment heterogeneity of topographic features (e.g., slope). These theoretical simulation results produced parameterizations of the storage-discharge relationship in terms of soil hydraulic properties, topographic slope and their heterogeneities, which were consistent with results of previous studies. Yet, regionalization of the resulting storage-discharge relations across 50 actual catchments in eastern United States, and a comparison of the regionalized results with equivalent empirical results obtained on the basis of analysis of observed streamflow recession curves, revealed a systematic inconsistency. It was found that the difference between the theoretical and empirically derived results could be explained, to first order, by climate in the form of climatic aridity index. This suggests a possible co-dependence of climate, soils, vegetation and topographic properties, and suggests that subsurface flow parameterization needed for ungauged locations must account for both the physics of flow in heterogeneous landscapes, and the co-dependence of soil and topographic properties with climate, including possibly the mediating role of vegetation.

AB Frequent flash-floods causing immense devastation in the Klang River Basin of Malaysia necessitate an improvement in the real-time forecasting systems being used. The use of meteorological satellite images in estimating rainfall has become an attractive option for improving the performance of flood forecasting-and-warning systems. In this study, a rainfall estimation algorithm using the infrared (IR) information from the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) is developed for potential input in a flood forecasting system. Data from the records of GMS-5 IR images have been retrieved for selected convective cells to be trained with the radar rain rate in a back-propagation neural network. The selected data as inputs to the neural network, are five parameters having a significant correlation with the radar rain rate: namely, the cloud-top brightness-temperature of the pixel of interest, the mean and the standard deviation of the temperatures of the surrounding five by five pixels, the rate of temperature change, and the sobel operator that indicates the temperature gradient. In addition, three numerical weather prediction (NWP) products, namely the precipitable water content, relative humidity, and vertical wind, are also included as inputs. The algorithm is applied for the areal rainfall estimation in the upper Kiang River Basin and compared with another technique that uses power-law regression between the cloud-top brightness-temperature and radar rain rate. Results from both techniques are validated against previously recorded Thiessen areal-averaged rainfall values with coefficient correlation values of 0.77 and 0.91 for the power-taw regression and the artificial neural network (ANN) technique, respectively. An extra lead time of around 2 h is gained when the satellite-based ANN rainfall estimation is coupled with a rainfall-runoff model to forecast a flash-flood event in the upper Klang River Basin.

AB The Monegros playa-lakes are isolated saline wetlands, locally named 'saladas" situated in a vulnerable semi-arid territory where agricultural expansion threatens the natural hydrologic cycle with regular artificial flooding, risking the survival of a valuable natural resource. This study aims to examine the water regime of these playa-lakes from climate data and available hydrologic records. These records are historical and limited to a series of weekly measurements of depth and of water extent extracted from Landsat imagery. We have characterized the hydrological behavior of the playa-lakes by treating ground and satellite data separately. For this purpose, the playa-lakes are first grouped according to the water occurrence episodes. Then their hydrologic status is related to the previous rainfall and also to ETO, since there is a lack of local records of wind as well as brine or fresh water evaporation. The northern playa-lakes respond to rain faster than the southern ones. All playa-lakes have a significant relationship between water occurrence and rainfall accumulated within 180 days prior to an observation. A significant relationship between ETO and water occurrence was found for a shorter 15-day accumulation period. Quantifying the current water regime now is critical for monitoring the effects of expanding irrigation in adjacent lands. Remote sensing is well-suited to an environmental assessment for regions of difficult access with the added benefit of lowered field measurement cost. The hydrological data from the Monegros playa-lakes could be integrated with other playa environments worldwide to compare regionally specific climate conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Streamflow from forested mountain watersheds is critical to aquatic ecosystems and social development in watersheds. However, understanding the intra-annual variability of streamflow is limited by the lack of observation of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in large-scale watersheds. This study developed a monthly Budyko framework incorporating TWS from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The extended Budyko framework was applied using four classic Budyko equations in the Qinba Mountains. The results showed that the extended Budyko framework could competently represent the relationship between monthly water supply and demand, with better performance than the original Budyko framework. Based on the extended Budyko framework, this study further quantified the contributors of streamflow variability using the variance decomposition method. The dominant contributor to intra-annual streamflow variability was precipitation (50%), followed by TWS (11%) and their covariance (-21%) in this region. Specifically, precipitation played a dominant role on streamflow variability in summer and autumn, while evapotranspiration and TWS significantly impacted streamflow in spring and winter, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrologic effects of rainfall intensity and vegetation were investigated to explain streamflow variability. As the rainfall intensity decreases, more precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and TWS, while the increase of rainfall intensity leads to the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow. Similarly, monthly vegetation promotes the partitioning of precipitation into TWS, while inhibiting the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow. The opposite effect of vegetation on streamflow and TWS is weakened due to the neglect of TWS at an annual timescale, which may lead to an overestimation of the effect of annual vegetation on streamflow. The results have implications for improving the performance of the Budyko framework to reveal the relationship between monthly water supply and demand and understanding streamflow variability at an intra-annual timescale.

AB Following results by Crow et al. (2017) [Geophys. Res. Lett. 44, 5495-5503] on the impact of antecedent soil moisture on runoff production, we investigate total runoff production during individual rainfall-runoff events in agricultural landscapes as a function of antecedent soil moisture, total rainfall, and vegetation cover for catchments with drainage areas ranging from 80 to 1000 km(2) in the state of Iowa, USA. For our study, we use Enhanced SMAP soil moisture estimates, the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), gauge-corrected Stage IV radar rainfall, and USGS streamflow data. We analyze the event runoff ratio as a function of event-scale rainfall, antecedent SMAP soil moisture and soil-moisture-deficit-normalized rainfall for the events in a period from March 31, 2015 to October 31, 2018. Our goal is to confirm the relationships identified by Crow et al. (2017) in heavily managed agricultural landscapes and to refine some of their methodological steps to quantify the role of additional variables controlling runoff production. To this end, we define three different strategies to identify rainfall-runoff events and add a baseflow separation step to better insulate event scale storrnflow runoff. We test the effects of antecedent soil moisture, rainfall, and vegetation on the event-scale runoff ratio. The antecedent SMAP soil moisture and event-scale rainfall are found to have significant predictive power in estimating event runoff ratio. Soil moisture deficit-normalized rainfall, introduced as the ratio of event-scale rainfall to available space in top soil before initiation of the event, exhibited a more distinct relationship with runoff ratio. The long-term analysis of runoff ratio, rainfall, and MODIS EVI indicated that, in an agricultural region, vegetation plays a significant role in determining event-scale runoff ratios. The methodology and outcome of our study have direct implications on real-time flood forecasting and long-term hydrologic assessments.

AB The climatic relationship of the ENSO phenomena (El Nino/La Nina) and monthly precipitation patterns over South Korea is examined based on the composite and harmonic analysis. Three core regions, namely the Upper Region (UR), the Middle Region (MR), and the Lower Region (LR), were identified with a high level of the spatial coherence and temporal consistency rate, which represent the geographical extent and magnitude of the response of the ENSO forcing to the precipitation patterns. During the El Nino events, the February (+) to May (+), November (0) to April (+), and November (0) to May (+) wet period for UR, MR, and LR respectively, are the signal seasons having a high level of coherence and consistency. The spatial coherence rates of each region are 0.94, 0.98, and 0.98, and the temporal consistency rates are 0.80, 0.90, and 0.80 respectively. On the other hand, in case of the La Nina events, the October (0) to January (+), November (0) to May (+) dry period for UR and MR respectively, are the signal seasons showing a strong and consistent teleconnection. The spatial coherence rates of each region are 0.98, 0.96 and the temporal consistency rates are both 0.78. According to the comparative analyses for both extreme episodes, in three core regions, the El Nino/La Nina-precipitation relationships show the opposite sign, positive and negative precipitation anomalies respectively. Based on the results of annual cycle analysis, Mann-Whitney U hypothesis test and cross-correlation analysis, the wet anomalies during the warm event years, which prevail over the whole region, are more remarkable and significant than the dry departures during the cold event years. In conclusion, the climatic teleconnection between the extreme phase of SO and mid-latitude precipitation is identified over South Korea. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB f Long-term changes in nitrate concentration and flux between the middle of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century were estimated for the Des Moines River and the Middle Illinois River, two Midwestern Corn Belt streams, using a novel weighted regression approach that is able to detect subtle changes in solute transport behavior over time. The results show that the largest changes in flow-normalized concentration and flux occurred between 1960 and 1980 in both streams, with smaller or negligible changes between 1980 and 2004. Contrasting patterns were observed between (1) nitrate export linked to non-point sources, explicitly runoff of synthetic fertilizer or other surface sources and (2) nitrate export presumably associated with point sources such as urban wastewater or confined livestock feeding facilities, with each of these modes of transport important under different domains of streamflow. Surface runoff was estimated to be consistently most important under high-flow conditions during the spring in both rivers. Nitrate export may also have been considerable in the Des Moines River even under some conditions during the winter when flows are generally lower, suggesting the influence of point sources during this time. Similar results were shown for the Middle Illinois River, which is subject to significant influence of wastewater from the Chicago area, where elevated nitrate concentrations were associated with at the lowest flows during the winter and fall. By modeling concentration directly, this study highlights the complex relationship between concentration and streamflow that has evolved in these two basins over the last 50 years. This approach provides insights about changing conditions that only become observable when stationarity in the relationship between concentration and streamflow is not assumed.

AB It is of great significance to investigate the joint probabilities of the combination of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons under the background of global warming. The Guanzhong Plain, a very important agricultural production area, was selected as the study area. The joint probabilities of the combination of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in 1961-2010 were computed by copulas functions. The Mann-Kendall trend test method and wavelet analysis were used to investigate the trend and period of dry and wet conditions, respectively, and the Bayesian copula selection method was used to choose the best copula. Furthermore, the cross wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the correlation between dry and wet conditions and sunspot activities. Results indicate the following: (1) the Guanzhong Plain is characterized by an relatively obvious trend towards dry in non-flood season and a relatively striking tendency towards wet in flood season; (2) the dry and wet conditions in the Guanzhong Plain have a statistically significant in-phase relationship with sunspot activities in 1983-1997 with a period of 8-12 years, whilst they have a non-statistically significant anti-phase relationship with sunspot activities in 1961-1973 with a period of 9-12 years, hence, sunspot activities exert a strong influence on dry and wet conditions in the Guanzhong Plain; (3) the plain is characterized by a high-frequency continuous dry condition in the entire year and a high risk of continuous wet condition in the season of Summer-Autumn;(4) the joint return period of the combination of dry and wet conditions between adjacent seasons gradually increases from east to west in the west and middle of the Guanzhong Plain, which is possibly closely linked to different geomorphic terrains, intensity of human activities and ENSO events.

AB Linear mixture models have been used to invert spectral reflectances of targets at the Earth's surface into proportions of plant and soil components. However, operational use of mixture models has been limited by a lack of biophysical interpretation of the results. The main objectives of this study were (I) to relate the deconvolved components of a mixture model with biophysical properties of vegetation and soil at the surface and (2) to apply the mixture model results to remotely sensed imagery. A radiative transfer model (SAIL: Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) was used to generate reflectance 'mixtures' from leaf and bare soil spectral measurements made at HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot EXperiment) study sites, The SAIL model was used to create canopy reflectances and fractions of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) for a range of mixed targets with varying leaf area index (LAI) and soils. A spectral mixture model was used to deconvolve the simulated reflectance data into component fractions, which were then calibrated to the SAIL-generated LAI, fAPAR and soil brightness. The calibrated relationships were validated with observational ground data (LAI, fAPAR and reflectance) measured at the HAPEX Sahel fallow bush/grassland, fallow grassland and millet sites. Both the vegetation and soil component fractions were found to be dependent upon soil background brightness, such that inclusion of the soil fraction information significantly improved the derivation of vegetation biophysical parameters. Soil brightness was also shown to be a useful parameter to infer soil properties. The deconvolution methodology was then applied to a nadir image of a HAPEX-Sahel site measured by the Advanced Solid State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS). Site LAI and fAPAR were successfully estimated by combining the fractional estimates of vegetation and soils. obtained through deconvolution of the ASAS image, with the calibrated relationships between vegetation fraction,LAI and fAPAR, obtained from the SAIL data.

AB Hydrogeochemical and multi-isotopic (O-18, H-2 , H-3, C-13, and C-14) approaches were applied accompanied with hydrogeological investigations to determine the origin and mechanism of groundwater salinization in Kashan Plain Aquifer (KPA). Evolution of hydrogeochemical facies in KPA is Ca-HCO3 (19.04%), Mix Ca-Cl, and Ca-Cl (9.52%), Mix Na-Cl, and Na-Cl (72.26%) based on the HFE-M. The isotopic composition of delta H-2 and delta O-18 varies from - 8.38 to 6.48 parts per thousand with average of - 4.49 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and - 57.09 to 22.68 parts per thousand with average of - 40.28 parts per thousand for delta H-2. The fresh and saline groundwater samples were plotted near the GMWL, with a minor shift towards more enriched values, indicating that the present meteoric water is the main origin of groundwater in the study area. Intrusion from salt lake and saltpan was rejected by ionic ratios and stable isotopes approaches. Further, geophysical investigations ruled out contributions from the Nasr Abad salt dome, as it is buried at about 480 m depth underneath the KPA. In addition, the radioisotopes results (H-3, and C-14) showed that the KPA groundwaters comprise of modern meteoric waters mixed with deep paleo-brine waters (10000 to 21000 yr BP). Further, the Na/Cl, I/Cl, Cl/Br, and Li/Cl/Br/Cl ratios and H-2 and O-18 data showed that, most probable source of salinity for this deep paleo- brine water is halite dissolution in Miocene Marl and URFs formation in the bedrock of KPA. The mixing ratio calculated by chloride concentration showed about 60% mixing between deep brine and groundwater samples. Consequently, the source of salinity in KPA groundwater is dissolution of halite and gypsum in deep paleo-brine which is likely upconing and mixing with fresh groundwaters during heavy pumping.

AB An accurate assessment of terrestrial ecosystem transpiration (T) is important to understand the vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks under climate change. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows great potential to estimate T because of its mechanical linkage with photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. However, a global and spatially estimation of terrestrial T based on remotely sensed SIF remains unresolved and novel strategies are challenged to entail a precise partition of T from evapotranspiration (ET) across various biomes. Here, with far-red SIF from Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and ground observations for a total of 30 sites encompassing ten primary plant functional types (PFTs), we extend a SIF-driven semi-mechanism canopy conductance (g(c)) model for different plant functional types (PFTs), and use the optimized Penman-Monteith model (PMopt) to calculate T and T/ET. We reveal that the relationship between SIF and the product of gc and 0.5 power of vapor pressure deficit (g(c) x VPD0.5) is tighter than the relationship between SIF and ecosystem productivity. The SIF-g(c) x VPD0.5 linear regressions show improved R-2 and increased magnitude in slopes across PFTs when aggregating daily to 16-day. Our T/ET results show high correlations with the results of the Ball-Berry-Leuning model combined with PMopt at the site scale (R-2 = 0.69), and with the results calculated by leaf area index in a previous study at the PFT scale (0.70). We further determine the global mean T/ET (0.57 +/- 0.14), close to the ensemble mean of global averaged T/ET (0.55), using 36 different methods. The global T estimated using the SIF-based approach is compared with two other remote sensing products. Our method provides a valuable tool for T and ET estimation using remote sensing data and is critical to understanding ecohydrological processes under climate change.

AB Ecosystem service approaches to watershed management have grown quickly, increasing the importance of understanding the streamflow response to realistic land-cover change. Previous work has investigated the relationship between watershed characteristics and streamflow in catchments around the world, but little has focused on systematic relationships between watershed characteristics and streamflow change after land-cover restoration. To address this gap, we simulate streamflow responses to restoring 10% of watershed area from agricultural land to forest and natural pasture in 29 watersheds around the world. This change is consistent with that performed in watershed-service programs. We calculate the change in a broad array of streamflow indices for each site and use a graph-connectedness approach to cluster the sites based on the sign of the index value changes. We find three primary clusters with distinct responses to restoration. Permutation tests and effect sizes demonstrate the difference in watershed characteristics and streamflow indices across clusters. The low-flow intensifying sites have shallower soils and smaller saturated soil volumes. After restoration, simulated streamflow in these sites increases during relatively dry periods and declines during high-flow periods. The high-flow intensifying sites have larger saturated soil volumes. After restoration, simulated dry-season flow in these sites decreases. The high-flow enhancing sites have larger soil hydraulic conductivities than the high-flow intensifying sites. After restoration, simulated dry-season flow in these sites decreases less than in high-flow intensifying sites. The soil depth and hydraulic conductivity appear to be the characteristics that determine clusters, as clusters are not statistically related to climate, watershed location, proximity, size and shape, elevation, or pre-existing land cover. This study provides valuable understanding of land-cover restoration and the watershed characteristics that most impact streamflow change.

AB Global warming has substantially altered vegetation growth and phenology In temperate biomes worldwide, whose impacts on river runoff have not been fully understood, especially at the watershed scale. Investigating the relationships among phenological shift, changes in vegetation growth, and river runoff is essential to improve our understanding of the ecosystem response to ongoing climate change. Using in-situ runoff records, phenological dates that were extracted from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the period 1982-2015, and grey relational analysis, this study investigated the relationships between changes in river runoff and phenological variables in Luanhe River basin, China. It was found that the growing season in the Luanhe basin was significantly extended by 0.60 +/- 0.08 d per year associated with climate warming over the period 1982-2015, which is mainly related to the earlier start of growing season (SOS, 0.40 +/- 0.05 d per year), rather than the delayed end of growing season (EOS, 0.11 +/- 0.01 d per year). The vegetation growth, defined as the average growing season NDVI (GS_NDVI), significantly increased in more than 88.4% of the study area, on average the GS_NDVI increased by 1.30 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) d per year. On the other hand, runoff significantly reduced by 1.42 nun per year over the study period, but large differences were observed between upper and middle-lower reaches region of the Luanhe basin. The grey relational analysis confirmed the primary regulation of river runoff by precipitation, but the length of growing season and vegetation growth also played a key role in the changes of runoff. These results provide new insights into the interaction between vegetation dynamics and water balance at the watershed scale, and highlight to couple the phenological processes into eco-hydrological models to improve the modelling accuracy.

AB We build surrogate models for dynamic 3D subsurface single-phase flow problems with multiple vertical pro-ducing wells. The surrogate model provides efficient pressure estimation of the entire formation at any timestep given a stochastic permeability field, arbitrary well locations and penetration lengths, and a timestep matrix as inputs. The well production rate or bottom hole pressure can then be determined based on Peaceman's formula. The original surrogate modeling task is transformed into an image-to-image regression problem using a con-volutional encoder-decoder neural network architecture. The residual of the governing flow equation in its discretized form is incorporated into the loss function to impose theoretical guidance on the model training process. As a result, the accuracy and generalization ability of the trained surrogate models are significantly improved compared to those of fully data-driven models. They are also shown to possess flexible extrapolation ability to permeability fields with different statistics. The surrogate models are used to conduct uncertainty quantification considering a stochastic permeability field, as well as to infer unknown permeability information based on limited well production data and observation data of formation properties. Results are shown to be in close accordance with those of traditional numerical simulation tools, but computational efficiency is dramati-cally improved.

TI Phosphorus export dynamics from two Swiss grassland catchments

AB Phosphorus (P) export from agricultural catchments is often event-driven and variable in time. Accordingly, a proper monitoring requires high-temporal resolution sampling during flow events. We report on a comparative study on the P export dynamics from two grassland catchments in Switzerland, where concentrations of dissolved reactive Phosphorus (DRP) have been monitored at a high temporal resolution for periods of 1.2 and 5 y, respectively. The data set is complemented by measurements on total P (TP), total dissolved P (TDP) and particulate P (PP) obtained from routine sampling ongoing since 1984 in both catchments. In one area, the high-temporal resolution monitoring revealed a pattern of the P export dynamic as expected from other studies. During flow events DRP concentrations usually increased significantly exceeding 1000 mg DRP m(-3) during peak flow, while the values remained low between 20 and 100 mg DRP m(-3) at base flow. This pattern was partially confirmed in the second catchment. The expected pattern was observed in 1998 and 1999 but was partially replaced by a new one for the following years. In the growing season, DRP only weakly increased with flow rate or remained almost constant. During flow events values larger than 300-400 mg DRP m(-3) were rare. In contrast to these relatively low peak flow concentrations, high values (200-300 mg m(-3)) were recorded at base flow during the years 2000-2002. During the same period, DRP concentrations exhibited strong daily oscillations. Independent sampling and analytical control measurements verify the findings. Point sources like leaks from manure tanks could be ruled out based on the ammonia measurements. We suggest that biogeochemical processes within the brook are responsible for this change in the P export dynamics. Despite these changes in the pattern of the P export dynamic and ecological measures implemented on the farms no significant effect on the annual P loads could be observed during the last 10 years.

AB Climatic shifts, disturbances, and land-use change can alter hydrologic flowpaths, water quality, and water supply to downstream communities. Prior research investigating streamflow generation processes in mountainous areas has largely focused on high-elevation alpine and subalpine catchments; less is known about these processes in lower-elevation foothills and montane catchments. In these lower-elevation ecoregions, precipitation shifts seasonally from snow to rain, which can result in differing seasonal flowpaths. We analyzed stream water for electrical conductivity, SiO2, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4, K, and dissolved organic carbon on both a weekly and storm event basis from April to August 2018 in three small (<10 km(2)) foothill catchments, and one larger (63.2 km(2)) catchment extending from the foothills to the subalpine ecoregions, in the Colorado Front Range. Using two end-member hydrograph separations and concentration-runoff relationships, we inferred the dominant catchment-scale flowpaths of precipitation to the streams. We selected catchments with varying land use to investigate the relationship between these characteristics and hydrologic flowpaths. We observed that concentrations of lithogenic constituents generally increased and dissolved organic carbon decreased as seasonal runoff decreased in the three foothill catchments, reflecting a transition from shallow subsurface flowpaths to deeper subsurface flowpaths. Elevated SO4 and Cl concentrations during low-flow periods in two of our catchments suggest that historical or current anthropogenic activities, such as mining, application of road salt, and/or near-stream septic systems, affect local stream and groundwater chemistry. In a foothill catchment with anthropogenic and geologic impervious surfaces, streamflow during storm responses was sourced from faster, surficial flowpaths compared to a less disturbed neighboring catchment, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic land-use on runoff generation. This study provides insight into the fundamental hydrology of foothill catchments and how they may function in the future with human development, precipitation shifts and disturbances.

AB In mountainous catchments, soil erosion and sediment transport are highly variable throughout time and their quantification remains a major challenge for the scientific community. Understanding the temporal patterns and the main controls of sediment yields in these environments requires a long term monitoring of rainfall, runoff and sediment flux. This paper analyses this type of data collected during 7 years (2007-2014), at the outlet of the Galabre River, a 20 km(2) watershed, in south eastern France, representative of meso-scale Mediterranean mountainous catchments.
   This study is based on a hybrid approach using continuous turbidity records and automated total suspended solid sampling to quantify the instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), sediment fluxes, event loads and yields. The total suspended sediment yield was 4661 Mg km(-2) and was observed during flood events. The two crucial periods for suspended sediment transport at the outlet were June and November/December (63% of the total). The analysis of suspended sediment transport dynamics observed during 236 flood events highlighted their intermittency and did not show any clear relationship between rainfall, discharge and SSC. The most efficient floods were characterised by counter-clockwise hysteresis relationships between SSC and discharges. The floods with complex hysteresis were the more productive in the long term, during this measuring period exceeding a decade. Nevertheless, the current research outlines the need to obtain medium-term (five years) continuous time series to assess the range of variations of suspended sediment fluxes and to outline clearly the seasonality of suspended sediment yields. Results suggest the occurrence of a temporal dis-connectivity in meso-scale catchments over short time-scales between the meteorological forcing and the sediment yields estimated at the outlet. These findings have important methodological impacts for modelling and operational implications for watershed management.

AB In recent decades, the Yongding River in Beijing has ceased to flow due to the impact of climate and anthropogenic factors, which has led to severe environmental degradation. The Beijing government is constructing new freshwater ecosystems on the Yongding River to improve environmental conditions for ecosystem services. Clarification is needed on the influence of precipitation and anthropogenic factors on streamflow decline in Beijing. A hydrological time-series analysis was conducted on recorded streamflow at Guanting Reservoir, Yanchi, and Sanjiadian to estimate the influence of precipitation variability on the drying of the Yongding River in Beijing. From 1980 to 2010, the mean annual rates of streamflow decline were 0.44 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1) (Guanting), 0.42 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1) (Yanchi), and 0.03 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1) (Sanjiadian). The most probable abrupt change-point for annual streamflow was 1999 at Guanting Reservoir and Yanchi, and was 2000 at Sanjiadian. Between the pre-change (1980-1999) and post-change (2000-2010) periods, mean annual streamflow decreased by 68.56% (Guanting), 66.92% (Yanchi), and 96.78% (Sanjiadian). A multiple regression analysis using annual precipitation and streamflow at Guanting, Yanchi, and Sanjiadian showed an insignificant relationship between local precipitation and streamflow in both periods. Next we assessed the potential impact of upstream human activities on downstream flow using: (1) correlation statistics between upstream flow and downstream flow, (2) water abstracted above Sanjiadian, and (3) upstream socioeconomic data. The results suggest upstream human activities are important drivers on downstream flow decline, which could possibly explain the weak relationship between precipitation and streamflow. Further analysis is needed to clarify the influence of upstream water consumption on Guanting Reservoir to advise management on the new freshwater ecosystems along the Yongding River.

AB This paper focuses on parameter regionalization for the block-wise use of the TOPMODEL with the Muskingum-Cunge routing method (BTOPMC). Pre-determined quantitative relationships with physical basin characteristics are used to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimation and enable prediction in ungauged basins. BTOPMC parameter values, which have previously resulted in efficient model performance, are applied to ten Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) basins without any parameter adjustment to test model performance using 'blind' a priori parameter estimates. It is quantitatively shown that parameters can not be satisfactorily estimated a priori without parameter adjustment, either through calibration or transfer functions linking parameters to physical basin features, referred to as 'improved' a priori parameter estimation. To compare model performance using different parameter estimation techniques, BTOPMC parameters are re-estimated by automatic optimization. As anticipated, model performance improves significantly when these optimized parameters are used. Good correlation of model performance is also observed between the 19-year validation and 20-year calibration results when optimized parameters are used. This indicates that BTOPMC's predictive accuracy depends strongly on calibration accuracy, implying that well-optimized parameter values can ensure the accuracy of model predictions. It appears reasonable to use optimized parameter values, selected from successful modelling applications, to make transfer functions which 'improve' a priori parameter estimates. The 'improved' a priori parameter estimation is achieved through multiple linear regression analysis relating BTOPMC parameters to soil and vegetation types within the basin being modelled. The results suggest that the preliminary parameter transfer functions are encouraging and that 'improved' a priori parameter estimation techniques have the potential to reduce parameter uncertainty and enable prediction in ungauged basins. To improve parameter estimation and predictive accuracy of the model, further research to determine more accurate values, and their relationship with physical basin characteristics, is needed.

AB Geomorphic impacts of a July 2001 flood in the Hungry Mother basin near Marion, Virginia, were examined to shed light on the relationships between channel characteristics and the frequency of channel-modifying discharges. Creeks in the study area have been observed for many years, with no significant channel changes since at least 1985. The 2001 flood had a recurrence interval of > 200 years, and caused the only channel change, bank erosion, and transport of coarse channel material observed in recent decades. The paucity of fines in channels before or after the flood, and the absence of sub-sand sized material in the flood deposits, indicates that normal, frequent, well-below-bankfull flows are sufficient to transport the (apparently limited) supply of fines. The large particles transported during the 2001 flood after years of inactivity indicate that relatively rare floods are necessary to mobilize this material. This suggests the notion of a bimodal 'dominant' discharge. On the one hand frequent flows considerably below bankfull levels are sufficient to maintain the channel and prevent significant accumulation of fine sediments and organic matter. On the other hand, rare floods are necessary to transport the coarser bed material and erode channel banks. In the Hungry Mother area, bed material has no relationship to normal flows, or to flows with recurrence intervals on the order of 1-3 years. Bankfull discharge is apparently not related to either the maintenance or channel-changing dominant discharges. These results suggest that the use of channel dimensions and/or bed material as surrogate indicators of hydrologic regimes can be quite complicated, and that in some streams bankfull flow has no particular significance in terms of sediment transport and channel modifications.

TI New semi-empirical formulae for predicting soil solution conductivity

AB Pore solution electrical conductivity (sigma(w)) is an important measurement for agricultural and environmental applications. Salt concentration can be predicted from sigma(w) and used to trace and monitor the transport of ionic solutes. Most models for predicting sigma(w) rely also on measurements of volumetric water content (theta(v)). However, theta(v) dependent estimations of sigma(w) are difficult to obtain because theta(v) measurements are not always available and because of the complex nature of physicochemical interactions between soil and water. Electromagnetic sensors offer an alternative approach because estimations of sigma(w) can be obtained without direct knowledge of theta(v). We developed two semi-empirical formulae for predicting sigma(w) that are mathematically independent of theta(v). The new models are dielectric equivalents of the Rhoades type two-pathway models that are based on linear and power law solutions for the transmission coefficient. The models were fitted by nonlinear regression to a data set collected from different soil textures, and disturbance treatments, to predict known electrical conductivities of similar to 0, 1.23, 2.41, 2.02 and 3.96 dS m(-1). Average sigma(w), predicted by the new models compared well to known saturating solution conductivities (average R-2 = 0.82 and average root mean square error of 0.80 dS m(-1)). The new models also compared well to models reported in the literature. The precision and accuracy of the estimates increased as sigma(w) increased, which might be related to a reduction of the influence of soil solid phase components on the estimates as sigma(w) becomes much higher than the solid phase conductivity.

AB Daily rainfall observed at a network of 1107 raingauges in Japan is analyzed using Shannon's entropy (informational) theory. The uncertainty of the over-a-year rainfall apportionment is quantitatively measured by entropy and an isoentropy map for the whole country is constructed. This isoentropy map is compared with Japan's well-known climatic division map, and is found to be capable of satisfactorily explaining the characteristics of nationwide rainfall. When used in conjunction with an isohyetal map of the average annual rainfall, it enables a relative assessment or categorization of the potential availability of water resources.

AB At the in-situ Long Term Sorption Diffusion Experiment (LTDE-SD), performed in the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden), anomalous penetration profiles of tracers were observed. The concentration of sorbing tracers, particularly Cs-137, sharply decreased around the rock surface but was still quite high in the distance, which was known that it is difficult to model with the classic Fick's law. To understand the mechanism of matrix diffusion and sorption of solute by reproducing the observed penetration profiles in the LTDE-SD test, three cases for the matrix were proposed and evaluated: (1) homogeneous medium with a disturbed zone; (2) heterogeneous medium considering mineral grains with intragranular porosities and their intergranular pores; and (3) heterogeneous medium considering vein and microfractures as well as porous mineral grains and intergranular pores. The modelling domains for Cases 2 and 3 were established using 2-D microstructure characterization results from analyses including chemical staining of minerals and C-14-PMMA autoradiography. The numerical models for Cases 1-3 were calibrated by minimizing the discrepancies between simulations and observations of the penetration profiles and the changes in concentration in the reservoir for the tracers, Cs-137 and Na-22. The results show that only the calibrated transport parameter values for Case 3 were within the reported ranges, and we concluded that the sharp decrease in concentrations in the near-surface zone in the observed penetration profiles was likely to result from disturbed biotite grains and the long tails in the observed penetration profiles might originate from diffusion along the vein and microfractures transacting minerals.

AB One of the most difficult issues in the development of hydrologic models is to find a rigorous source of data and specific parameters to a given problem, on a given location that enable reliable calibration. In this paper, a distributed and physically based model (2D Shallow Water Equations) is used for surface flow and runoff calculations in combination with two infiltration laws (Horton and Green-Ampt) for estimating infiltration in a watershed. This technique offers the capability of assigning a local and time dependent infiltration rate to each computational cell depending on the available surface water, soil type or vegetation. We investigate how the calibration of parameters is affected by transient distributed Shallow Water model and the complexity of the problem. In the first part of this work, we calibrate the infiltration parameters for both Horton and Green-Ampt models under flat ponded soil conditions. Then, by means of synthetic test cases, we perform a space-distributed sensitivity analysis in order to show that this calibration can be significantly affected by the introduction of topography or rainfall. In the second part, parameter calibration for a real catchment is addressed by comparing the numerical simulations with two different sets of experimental data, corresponding to very different events in terms of the rainfall volume. We show that the initial conditions of the catchment and the rainfall pattern have a special relevance in the quality of the adjustment. Hence, it is shown that the topography of the catchment and the storm characteristics affect the calibration of infiltration parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE River flow estimation; Artificial neural network; Fuzzy c-means
   clustering
AB Reliable river flow estimates are crucial for appropriate water resources planning and management. River flow forecasting can be conducted by conceptual or physical models, or data-driven black box models. Development of physically-based models requires an understanding of ail the physical processes which impact a natural process and the interactions among them. Since identification of the relationships among these physical processes is very difficult, data-driven approaches have recently been utilized in hydrological modeling. Artificial neural networks are one of the widely used data-driven approaches for modeling hydrological processes. In this study, estimation of future monthly river flows for Guvenc River, Ankara is conducted using various artificial neural network models. Success of artificial neural network models relies on the availability of adequate data sets. A direct mapping from inputs to outputs without consideration of the complex relationships among the dependent and independent variables of the hydrological process is identified. In this study, past precipitation, river flow data, and the associated month are used to predict future river flows for Guvenc River. Impacts of various input patterns, number of training cycles, and initial values assigned to the weights of the connections are investigated. One of the major weaknesses of artificial neural networks is that they may fail to generate good estimates for extreme events, i.e. events that do not occur at all or often enough in the training data set. It is very important to be able to identify such unlikely events. A fuzzy c-means algorithm is used in this study to cluster the training and validation input vectors into regular and extreme events so that the user will have an idea about the risk of the artificial neural network model to generate unreliable results.

AB Hillslopes are fundamental landscape units, yet represent a difficult scale for measurements as they are well-beyond our traditional point-scale techniques. Here we present an assessment of electromagnetic induction (EM) as a potential rapid and non-invasive method to map soil moisture patterns at the hillslope scale. We test the new multi-frequency GEM-300 for spatially distributed soil moisture measurements at the well-instrumented Panola hillslope. EM-based apparent conductivity measurements were linearly related to soil moisture measured with the Aqua-pro capacitance sensor below a threshold conductivity and represented the temporal patterns in soil moisture well. During spring rainfall events that wetted only the surface soil layers the apparent conductivity measurements explained the soil moisture dynamics at depth better than the surface soil moisture dynamics. All four EM frequencies (7.290, 9.090, 11.250, and 14.010 kHz) were highly correlated and linearly related to each other and could be used to predict soil moisture. This limited our ability to use the four different EM frequencies to obtain a soil moisture profile with depth. The apparent conductivity patterns represented the observed spatial soil moisture patterns well when the individually fitted relationships between measured soil moisture and apparent conductivity were used for each measurement point. However, when the same (master) relationship was used for all measurement locations, the soil moisture patterns were smoothed and did not resemble the observed soil moisture patterns very well. In addition the range in calculated soil moisture values was reduced compared to observed soil moisture. Part of the smoothing was likely due to the much larger measurement area of the GEM-300 compared to the soil moisture measurements. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RIVER-BASINS; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT
AB Water is central to sustainable development; making transboundary cooperation among riparian a core aspect of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 6 on water and sanitation includes an indicator, SDG Indicator 6.5.2, to assess cooperation over transboundary waters by measuring the "Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation." The definitions developed by the methodology for calculating the Indicator have the potential to significantly impact the resulting structure and type of cooperation that are assessed and that will develop. Indeed, the composition of this indicator will both directly and indirectly influence water diplomacy, international policy, and water law. In this research, we analyze the methodology for assessing SDG Indicator 6.5.2, examine how operational cooperative arrangements are defined, and identify the strengths and limitations of the method for measuring transboundary water cooperation. This is done by simulating the application of the methodology and calculating the Indicator in three national case studies (Bangladesh, Honduras, and Uganda) and in a global overview. The unequal distribution regionally of operational cooperation is evident, as well as the gap in coverage between transboundary surface waters and aquifers. However, the normative and binary nature of the Indicator obscures the political complexity of establishing cooperative processes and has the potential to present a false depiction of the extent of cooperation that is occurring over shared waters. In this article, we also discuss bias that can be introduced with using surface area as a metric to assess cooperation that results in weighting larger basins and aquifers over smaller basins in the calculation of the Indicator. This paper presents a basis for further analysis of SDG Indicator 6.5.2 and the possible adaptations of the Indicator design to better assess transboundary water cooperation.

AB The quasi-exact implicit (QEI) analytical formulation of Haverkamp equation, which might be also known as Parlange model, and its one- and two-term approximate expansions are among the mostly used equations for in situ determination of soil sorptivity, S, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, from unsaturated one-dimensional (1D) cumulative infiltration into soils. However, from practical point of view, the approximate expansions are only valid from short to intermediate times and the QEI analytical formulation has a complex resolution, which makes its use complicated in inverting procedures. Therefore, alternative functions are needed to compute cumulative infiltration for longer times and improve inverting procedures for easier, more robust and accurate predictions of S and K-s. In this regard, current work presents and evaluates a new three-term approximation of the QEI analytical formulation. As a first step, we checked the accuracy of the proposed three-term approximate expansion with respect to the QEI formulation for three different soils (sand, loam and silt) in order to define its time domain validity. Next, the accuracy of the three-term approximate expansion to estimate S, K-s and the beta parameter was compared to those obtained with one- and two-term approximate expansions. Lastly, a large dataset of field experimental data was inverted using the proposed three approximate expansions and the QEI analytical formulation, and goodness of fits predicted and measured cumulative infiltration curves and accuracy of the parameters (S, K-s and the beta) estimates were compared. The results revealed that the three-term approximate has a larger validity time interval compared to one- and two-term approximate expansions, which allows its use for larger infiltration times durations resulting in more accurate estimates of K-s. Its capability of estimating S is also improved. The accurate prediction of beta parameter is not still guaranteed for none of the approximate expansions. Compared to the one- and two-term approximate expansions, the experimental infiltration data usage revealed that the three-term approximate expansion resulted in higher performance and better prediction of hydraulic parameters.

AB Because geomorphology can readily be mapped, our ability to characterize unsaturated flow over large areas would be greatly enhanced if relationships between geomorphic settings and unsaturated flow could be identified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate relationships between geomorphic settings and spatial and temporal variability in unsaturated flow at a field site in the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas. This study differs from most previous studies in the variety of geomorphic settings studied, including drainage areas (Blanca Draw and Grayton Lake playa) and interdrainage areas (basin-fill deposits, eolian sheets, alluvial fans, and a fissure), density of data (similar to 50 sampled boreholes 3-31 m deep), and variety of techniques (physical, chemical, and electromagnetic) used to quantify unsaturated flow. Spatial variability in unsaturated flow parameters is related to geomorphic settings. The various geomorphic settings form distinct groups on a plot of chloride versus water potential. Interdrainage areas have low water potentials and high chloride concentrations, indicating low water fluxes. Mean water fluxes estimated from chloride data ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 mm yr(-1). In contrast, localized topographic depressions (fissure, gully, and borrow pit) have high water potentials and low chloride concentrations which indicate high mean water flux (similar to 100 mm yr(-1)). These topographic depressions occupy <1% of the basin area. Drainage areas have low water potentials, which indicate low water fluxes and low to moderate chloride concentrations, which indicate higher water fluxes in the past (less than or equal to 40 mm yr(-1)). Short-term variability in response to precipitation events was only monitored in topographic depressions. The age of the pore water in the interdrainage areas spanned paleoclimatic variations (less than or equal to 136,000 years at 25 m depth); however, most interdrainage profiles show negligible response to past climate fluctuations. Some profiles in eolian sheets showed increased water flux in response to Pleistocene climate change. The findings from this study indicate that geomorphology can provide valuable information on unsaturated flow and underscore the importance of localized topographic depressions for focusing unsaturated flow.

AB In the Loess Plateau of northwestern China, a system for dry farming has evolved based on the employ of gravel mulch. A couple of lab experiments were conducted to study the influences of mulch stratum thickness and gravel grain size on water vapor flow, with a focus on resistance to evaporation in gravel mulch stratum. In Experiment 1, six treatments included mulching with gravel of different thickness (2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm) plus no mulching (control) were studied. In Experiment 2, the 10 cm thick mulch layer consisted of different grain size gravel [2-5 (A), 5-20 (B), 20-40 (C), 40-60 (D) and 60-80 (E) mm], plus three mixture treatments. Compared to bare soil, mulched soils had significantly lower accumulated evaporation, and gravel mulch significantly increased resistance to evaporation. The aerodynamic resistance to evaporation in bare soil is higher than that in mulched treatments and the relationship between equivalent grain size and aerodynamic resistance in mulched surface can be described by a line function. The relationships between mulch resistance and mulch stratum thickness or grain size of gravel, were represented by logistic curves. The findings showed that equivalent grain size and specific surface area of gravel were sensitive indicators of mulch resistance. Based on the results of laboratory experiments, we put forward a new calculated model of mulch resistance, but further research is needed for verification and exact parameterization of this model under field conditions.

AB We examined the presence of pesticides in the Llobregat river basin (Barcelona, Spain) and their effects on benthic biological communities (invertebrates and diatoms). The Llobregat river is one of Barcelona's major drinking water resources. It has been highly polluted by industrial, agricultural, and urban waste-waters, and-as a typical Mediterranean river-is regularly subjected to periodic floods and droughts. Water scarcity periods result in reduced water flow and dilution capacity, increasing the potential environmental risk of pollutants. Seven sites were selected, where we analysed the occurrence of 22 pesticides (belonging to the classes of triazines, organophosphates, phenylureas, anilicles, chloroacetanilides, acidic herbicides and thiocarbamates) in the water and sediment, and the benthic community structure. Biofilm samples were taken to measure several metrics related to both the algal and bacterial components of fluvial biofilms.
   Multivariate analyses revealed a potential relationship between triazine-type herbicides and the distribution of the diatom community, although no evidence of disruption in the invertebrate community distribution was found. Biofilm metrics were used as response variables rather than abundances of individual species to identify possible cause-effect relationships between pesticide pollution and biotic responses. Certain effects of organophosphates and phenylureas in both structural and functional aspects of the biofilm community were suggested, but the sensitivity of each metric to particular stressors must be assessed before we can confidently assign causality. Complemented with laboratory experiments, which are needed to confirm causality, this approach could be successfully incorporated into environmental risk assessments to better summarise biotic integrity and improve the ecological management.

ID DRIVEN FLOWS; APPROXIMATION; ACCUMULATION
AB Spreading of gravity currents in porous media has traditionally been investigated analytically by means of similarity solutions under the Dupuit-Forchheimer approach. We present a novel formulation to analyse the axisymmetric propagation of single-phase gravity currents induced by the release of a time-variable volume of fluid in a porous domain. Our approach is based on a first order expansion of the velocity potential that allows for the presence of vertical Darcy velocities. Coupling the flow law with mass balance equations leads to a PDE which admits a self-similar solution for the special case in which the volume of the fluid fed to the current increases at a rate proportional to t(3). A numerical solution is developed for rate proportional to t(alpha) with alpha not equal 3. Current profiles obtained with the first order solution have a finite height at the origin. Theoretical results are compared with two experimental datasets, one having freshwater and the other air as an ambient fluid. In general, experimental current profiles collapse well onto the numerical results; the first order solution shows a marked improvement over the zeroth order solution in interpreting the current behaviour near the injection point. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is conducted on both the first order and zeroth order theoretical model. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the flow process is more sensitive to porosity variations than to other parameters. The uncertainty analysis of the present experimental data indicates that the diameter of glass beads in an artificial porous medium is the source of most of the overall uncertainty in the current profile.

AB This Study was undertaken in two medium sized agricultural watersheds and their sub watersheds located ill Midnapore and Bankura districts of West Bengal state in India. Runoff hydrographs were generated from flow data and unit hydrographs (UH) were obtained for 1 and 2 h duration. UH parameters Such as time to peak (t(p)), time base (t(b)), and peak discharge were modeled with geomorphologic parameters of the watershed such as channel parameters as well as basin parameters. Basin parameters were obtained from the Survey of India maps using geographical information system (GIS) techniques and drainage network were updated from Indian remote sensing satellite digital images. A correlation matrix between UH parameters and geomorphologic parameters was generated and geomorphologic parameters having higher degree of correlation with UH parameters were selected. Regression equations were developed between individual UH parameters and one of the geomorphologic parameters obtained in the previous step. Out of various forms of equations, power law equations gave the highest values of the coefficient of determination (R-2). Based on higher values of R-2 geomorphologic parameters were selected. Then non-linear regression models were developed between UH parameters and the above-selected geomorphologic parameters based on Aikaike's information criterion (AIC) and higher R-2 value. All developed models for Tarafeni watershed and its sub watersheds were tested using different statistical tests for different rainfall events. Also these models were validated for nearby Bhairabbanki watershedand its sub watersheds. These models call be suitable for small and medium agricultural sub tropical sub humid basins having similar geohydrological conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB [1] Liquid saturation and gas-liquid interfacial area are important parameters for evaluating the transport and fate of contaminants in unsaturated subsurface environments. Recent findings indicate that interfacial surface area controls the relative degree of transmitted light in laboratory systems containing translucent porous media. Equations are derived to estimate the specific gas-liquid interfacial area from the area under the primary-drainage branch of the S-eff-h characteristic curve as parameterized using common water retention functions. The total area under the curve provides the maximum available specific gas-liquid interfacial area available at residual saturation, which can be incorporated into the relationship to determine the gas-liquid interfacial area at intermediate degrees of saturation via light transmission. Experimental results, and analysis of external data sets, support these findings. Closed-form relationships are presented as enhancements to a recent method for determination of liquid saturations above residual using light transmission. A physically based model is developed and tested for the quantification of liquid contents below residual saturation.

AB Spatial distribution of groundwater recharge/discharge fluxes has an important impact on mass and energy exchanges in shallow streambeds. During the last two decades, extensive studies have been devoted to the quantification of one-dimensional (1-D) vertical exchange fluxes. Nevertheless, few studies were conducted to characterize two-dimensional (2-D) heterogeneous flux fields that commonly exist in real-world cases. In this study, we used an iterative ensemble smoother (IES) to quantify the spatial distribution of 2-D exchange fluxes by assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements. Four assimilation scenarios corresponding to different potential field applications were tested. In the first three scenarios, the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields were first inferred from hydraulic head and/or temperature measurements, and then the flux fields were derived through Darcy's law using the estimated conductivity fields. In the fourth scenario, the flux fields were estimated directly from the temperature measurements, which is more efficient and especially suitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable. We concluded that, the best estimation could be achieved through jointly assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements, and temperature data were superior to the head data when they were used independently. Overall, the IES method provided more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those given by the widely used analytical solution-based methods. Furthermore, IES gave reasonable uncertainty estimations, which were unavailable in traditional methods. Since temperature can be accurately monitored with high spatial and temporal resolutions, the coupling of heat tracing techniques and IES provides promising potential in quantifying complex exchange fluxes under field conditions.

AB In shallow groundwater systems, recharge and evapotranspiration are highly sensitive to changes in the depth to water table. To effectively model these fluxes, complex functions that include soil and vegetation properties are often required. Model emulation (surrogate modelling or meta-modelling) can provide a means of incorporating detailed conceptualisation of recharge and evapotranspiration processes, while maintaining the numerical tractability and computational performance required for regional scale groundwater models and uncertainty analysis. A method for emulating recharge and evapotranspiration processes in groundwater flow models was developed, and applied to the South East region of South Australia and western Victoria, which is characterised by shallow groundwater, wetlands and coastal lakes. The soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model WAVES was used to generate relationships between net recharge (diffuse recharge minus evapotranspiration from groundwater) and depth to water table for different combinations of climate, soil and land cover types. These relationships, which mimicked previously described soil, vegetation and groundwater behaviour, were combined into a net recharge lookup table. The segmented evapotranspiration package in MODFLOW was adapted to select values of net recharge from the lookup table depending on groundwater depth, and the climate, soil and land use characteristics of each cell. The model was found to be numerically robust in steady state testing, had no major increase in run time, and would be more efficient than tightly-coupled modelling approaches. It made reasonable predictions of net recharge and groundwater head compared with remotely sensed estimates of net recharge and a standard MODFLOW comparison model. In particular, the method was better able to predict net recharge and groundwater head in areas with steep hydraulic gradients. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper reviews recent progress in relating the incidence of water repellency to other soil attributes, relating the severity of water repellency to different soil management and landuses and determining the value of soil survey in predicting the risk of water repellency. Data sets of soils from south-western Australia are used for this analysis.
   The relationship between water repellency and other soil attributes such as clay and organic matter contents has been found to be multivariate in nature, with a general form:
   Water repellency approximate to a Organic Matter(b)/Clay(c)
   where a, b and c are constants. Multiple regressions, which use a variety of attributes related to soil organic matter and soil surface area (e.g, clay, silt, amorphous iron contents), can explain up to 63% of the variation in water repellency. Water repellency increases in severity with increasing organic carbon content or decreasing soil surface area and vice versa, This relationship explains the poor or non-existent bivariate relationships between various soil attributes and water repellency reported in several studies and allows the re-interpretation of studies into the effects of liming, zero-till and different rotation lengths on water repellency as each affect soil organic carbon (OC) content, It is also consistent with observations that water repellency is more prevalent on sandy soils and repotted reductions in water repellency following applications of clay and fine inorganic materials. It similarly explains the occurrence of water repellency on soils with >5% clay; accumulation of sufficient amounts of OC can induce water repellency in any soil.
   Soil management and landuse affect water repellency. Water repellency is less severe in soils under crops compared to pastures and this has been considered as being caused by differences in organic matter composition. This is re-interpreted as being due to differences in organic matter amount, as cultivation mineralises and dilutes soil organic matter in the topsoil. Water repellency is also a feature of soils under natural vegetation (Eucayphtus, Banksia spD.) and may be more severe than that for agricultural soils. Increments of organic matter from natural vegetation can induce water repellency to a greater extent than equivalent amounts of organic matter from agricultural species. Thus, water repellency can be considered as a natural feature of soils, rather than a form of land degradation due to farming. Comparisons between the water repellency associated with different soil management or landuses are problematic due to differences in not only OC content and composition but also other soil properties such as surface area, due to the spatial separation of the areas compared.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

AB The Chezy friction formula for steady flow in a uniform symmetrical channel with constant slope-friction factor is examined mathematically. Firstly, a wide rectangular channel and a semi-circular channel are compared in respect of the mean flow velocity using the Chezy formula with the Manning, Chezy and logarithmic laws for velocity. Then the inverse Chezy problem, i.e. the determination of the channel shape above the reference level for a given depth/discharge rating curve, is posed and the differential-integral equation for its solution is derived. The rating curves used for computation are the results of multiplying the discharge for a trapezoidal shape above the reference level by an exponential function. To facilitate interpretation of the numerical results, the relationship between side slope and discharge is analysed. It is shown by the inverse problem solution that an exponential reduction of channel flow capacity changes linear channel sides into convex sides (making the cross section shape wider) while an exponential increase of capacity causes changes into concave sides (reducing a section width) which is against common sense.

ID VARIABILITY
AB Extreme value theory for the maximum of a time series of daily precipitation amount is described. A chain-dependent process is assumed as a stochastic model for daily precipitation, with the intensity distribution being the gamma. To examine how the effective return period for extreme high precipitation amounts would change as the parameters of the chain-dependent process change (i.e., probability of a wet day, shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution), a sensitivity analysis is performed. This sensitivity analysis is guided by some results from statistical downscaling that relate patterns in large-scale atmospheric circulation to local precipitation, providing a physically plausible range of changes in the parameters. For the particular location considered in the example, the effective return period is most sensitive to the scale parameter of the intensity distribution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Obtaining accurate estimates of evapotranspiration is a key issue in many fields like hydrology, ecology, and agriculture. There exist different ways, including physical-based and data-driven approaches, to estimate evapotranspiration. Here, the physical-based model (the surface energy balance system, SEBS), data-driven models (using three machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and symbolic regression (SR)), and hybrid model were compared using the FLUXNET2015 dataset. More importantly, different search strategies were investigated to optimize the network architecture and to explore the maximum accuracy of data-driven models. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was introduced to quantify the contributions of input features to evapotranspiration estimation. The results show that there is a large error in the SEBS model with RMSE of 121 W m(-2), while the data-driven models acquire the best evapotranspiration estimation with RMSE of 32-53 W m(-2). The hybrid approach, whose RMSE is 60 W m(-2), improves the SEBS model but still underperforms data-driven models. The complexity of data-driven models influences the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimations. By optimizing the network architecture, DNN and RF obtain results with similar precision. But the performance of SR, which generates a simple algebraic formula for evapotranspiration estimation, is significantly degraded. SHAP reveals that all models regard net radiation as the most crucial feature. The SEBS and hybrid models attach much importance to temperature and humidity. Three data-driven models learn the different relationships between input features and evapotranspiration. The DNN-based model is likely to learn a relatively correct relationship among the data-driven models because it has a similar feature importances pattern with physical-based and hybrid models.

AB In the hydrological cycle, the infiltration process is a critical component in the distribution of water into the soil and in the groundwater system. The nonlinear dynamics of the soil infiltration process yield preferential flow which affects the water distribution in soil. Preferential flow is influenced by the interactions between water, soil, plants, and microorganisms. Although the relationship among the plant roots, their rhizodeposits and water transport in soil has been the subject of extensive study, the effect of microbial exudates has been studied in only a few cases. Here the authors investigated the influence of two artificial microbial exudates-catechol and riboflavin-on the infiltration process, particularly unstable fingered flow, one form of preferential flow. Flow experiments investigating the effects of types and concentrations of microbial exudates on unstable fingered flow were conducted in a two-dimensional tank that was filled with ASTM C778 graded silica sand. The light transmission method (LTM) which is based on capturing the light intensity transmitted through a sand-water system and then converting it into degree of water saturation was used to visualize and characterize the flow of water in porous media as well as to image and measure the spatial and temporal distribution of water in porous media. Flow patterns, vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation of the fingers, as well as measurements of the fingers dimension (width), number, and velocity were determined using the light transmission method. Interfacial experiments exploring the influence of microbial exudates on the wettability behavior of water were performed by measuring the contact angle and the interfacial tension of the (solid)-gas-microbial exudate solution systems. Unstable wetting front generating fingered flow was observed in all infiltration experiments. The experimental results showed that the microbial exudate addition affected the infiltration process, as the measurements of the degree of saturation profiles and widths of the fingers differed from those of the control NaCl solution. These differences may be due to an improved water holding capacity in the presence of the microbial exudates. The lowest catechol solution concentration (10 mu M) produced the largest finger width (9.69 cm) among the tested catechol solution concentrations and all the other solutions including the control solution (7.24 cm). Moreover, the wettability of the medium for the catechol solution increased with an increase in concentration. The highest riboflavin solution concentration (1000 mu M) generated the highest finger width (7.75 cm) among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations. However, the wettability of the medium for the riboflavin solution decreased with an increase in concentration. Our study demonstrated that the microbial exudates which are biochemical compounds produced and released by microbes in the environment are capable of influencing the soil infiltration process. The results of this study also demonstrated that the influence of the contact angle expressed as (cos theta)(1/2) should be integrated in the scaling of the finger dimension, i.e., finger width, when the Miller and Miller (1956) scaling theory is applied for the hydrodynamic scaling in porous media.

AB When no discharge record is available for a site, a regional regression relationship can be used to estimate low-flow quantiles. Problems arise in the derivation of such models when some at-site quantile estimates are reported as zero. One concern is that quantile estimates reported as zero may be in the range from zero to the measurement threshold. A second concern is that a logarithmic transformation cannot be used with zero quantile estimates, so traditional log linear least squares estimators cannot be computed. This paper uses visual examples and Monte Carlo simulation to compare the performance of techniques for estimating the parameters of a regional regression model when some at-site quantile estimates are zero. Ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques employed in practice include adding a small constant to all at-site quantile estimates (denoted OLSC), or neglecting all observation reported as zero (denoted OLSD). OLSC and OLSD performed poorly compared to the use of a Tobit model, which is a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) procedure that represents the below threshold estimates as a range from zero to the threshold level. For a small amount of censoring, the OLSD method can be acceptable. A weighted Tobit model that accounts for the heteroscedasticity of the residuals in the regression model provided relatively little gain over the ordinary Tobit model.

AB The hydrological characterization of the vadose zone remains a major challenge considering the spatiotemporal variability of its properties and the limitations associated with hydrological measurements techniques. Geophysical methods, in particular the DC-resistivity and ground penetrating radar, can provide large scale images of hydrogeological structures and a non-invasive assessment of the subsurface dynamic processes. However, these approaches rely on the accuracy of the petrophysical relationships connecting the geophysical parameters to hydrogeological ones, where the site-specific determination of the associated petrophysical pa-rameters is considered crucial. The first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the water content, geological properties, and geophysical attributes at the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer. The second objective aimed to obtain the Archie's and Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM) pet-rophysical parameters by using borehole electrical resistivity and cross-hole ground penetrating radar data. For this purpose, we adopted a grid search inversion algorithm where the field geophysical data were integrated with water content profiles simulated by using HYDRUS-1D. The vadose zone profile was divided into three layers, and the inversion was carried out for the petrophysical parameters in each of the model layers. The electrical resistivity and relative dielectric permittivity data showed a very good correspondence with the simulated and experimental water content distributions along the vadose zone profile. The petrophysical parameters estimated by the inversion showed values that fall in the ranges reported in the literature. Similar values have been observed in the different model layers, with slight differences that were attributed to the vertical heterogeneities associated with the alteration and fracturation features of the limestone vadose zone. This study showed a very good correlation between geophysical, hydrogeological and geological data, and highlighted the presence of heterogeneities that can have profound effects on the vadose zone water dynamics.

AB We have developed a new method to analyze the power law based non-Darcian flow toward a well in a confined aquifer with and without wellbore storage. This method is based on a combination of the linearization approximation of the non-Darcian flow equation and the Laplace transform. Analytical solutions of steady-state and late time drawdowns are obtained. Semi-analytical solutions of the drawdowns at any distance and time are computed by using the Stehfest numerical inverse Laplace transform. The results of this study agree perfectly with previous Theis solution for an infinitesimal well and with the Papadopulos and Cooper's solution for a finite-diameter well under the special case of Darcian flow. The Boltzmann transform, which is commonly employed for solving non-Darcian flow problems before, is problematic for studying radial non-Darcian flow. Comparison of drawdowns obtained by our proposed method and the Boltzmann transform method suggests that the Boltzmann transform method differs from the linearization method at early and moderate times, and it yields similar results as the linearization method at late times. If the power index n and the quasi hydraulic conductivity k get larger, drawdowns at late times will become less, regardless of the wellbore storage. When n is larger, flow approaches steady state earlier. The drawdown at steady state is approximately proportional to r(1-n), where r is the radial distance from the pumping well. The late time drawdown is a superposition of the steady-state solution and a negative time-dependent term that is proportional to t((1-n)/(3-n)), where t is the time. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The scale-specific and localized bivariate relationships in geosciences can be revealed using bivariate wavelet coherence. The objective of this study was to develop a multiple wavelet coherence method for examining scale-specific and localized multivariate relationships. Stationary and nonstationary artificial data sets, generated with the response variable as the summation of five predictor variables (cosine waves) with different scales, were used to test the new method. Comparisons were also conducted using existing multivariate methods, including multiple spectral coherence and multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). Results show that multiple spectral coherence is unable to identify localized multivariate relationships, and underestimates the scale-specific multivariate relationships for nonstationary processes. The MEMD method was able to separate all variables into components at the same set of scales, revealing scale-specific relationships when combined with multiple correlation coefficients, but has the same weakness as multiple spectral coherence. However, multiple wavelet coherences are able to identify scale-specific and localized multivariate relationships, as they are close to 1 at multiple scales and locations corresponding to those of predictor variables. Therefore, multiple wavelet coherence outperforms other common multivariate methods. Multiple wavelet coherence was applied to a real data set and revealed the optimal combination of factors for explaining temporal variation of free water evaporation at the Changwu site in China at multiple scale-location domains. Matlab codes for multiple wavelet coherence were developed and are provided in the Supplement.

AB Climate change impact assessment studies in water resources section demand the simulations of climatic variables at coarser scales from dynamic General Circulation Models (GCMs) to be mapped to even finer scales. Related studies in this area have mostly been relying on statistical techniques for downscaling variables to finer resolution. This demands a careful selection of a suitable downscaling model, to alleviate the downscaling uncertainty. In this study, it is proposed to develop a dynamic framework for downscaling purpose by integrating the frequently used techniques, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In order to give flexibility in future predictors-predictand relationships and to account the sensitivity in model parameters, it is also proposed to generate an ensemble of outputs by identifying various plausible model parameter combinations. The performance of this framework for downscaling daily precipitation values at different locations is compared with simple KNN and SVM models. The proposed hybrid model is found to be better in capturing various characteristics of daily precipitation than individual models, especially in simulating the extremes, both in magnitude and duration. The mean ensemble is found to be efficient than single best simulation with optimum parameter combinations. The efficacy of hybrid SVM-KNN ensemble downscaling model is established through detailed investigations. The future downscaled projection for mid-century and late century employing this hybrid model indicates an increased variability in future precipitation, though the intensity varies for various locations. The developed methodology hence ensures lesser downscaling uncertainty and also eliminates the inherent assumption of relationship stationarity considered in many downscaling models.

AB One of the most important factors concerning the design of earth-fill dams is the accurate seepage estimation, which is highly correlated to the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the core material. With the geographic coordinates of 37 degrees 31'35.9,'' North and 46 degrees 07'55.6 '' East, Gale chay dam is located in the northwest of Iran in East Azerbaijan province. The dam is highly important regarding the provided economic benefits for the region. In this research, the steady-state seepage analysis of the Gale Chay dam was conducted via the finite element model (FEM) using a novel saturated fractal hydraulic conductivity model, and the results were compared with those obtained from the conventional and fractal models in the unsaturated condition. For estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material, the fractal theory was employed using the image processing technique, the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, and a new fractal permeability model. The estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities were in good accordance with the measured values. Furthermore, since the fractal theory considers the distribution of the pores, the estimated upper and lower bounds of the saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in better seepage estimations. Using the estimated maximum, minimum, and average fractal hydraulic conductivities, the results of the saturated seepage analysis indicated relative errors of 15.6%, 8%, and 10.8% compared to the observed seepage. The results were acceptable in terms of safety and economic aspects. Conducting the unsaturated seepage analysis, it was observed that the estimated seepage was highly influenced by the saturated hydraulic conductivity value. Hence, the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity by the image processing technique affected the unsaturated fractal and conventional models in a way that the unsaturated seepage analysis was improved by an average of 80%. Moreover, the unsaturated fractal model revealed reliable estimations compared to the conventional models and was considered a feasible alternative for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.

AB Watershed water resource allocation focuses on concrete aspects of the sustainable management of Ecosystem Services (ES) that are related to water and examines the possibility of implementing Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) for water ES. PES can be executed to satisfy both economic and environmental objectives and demands. Considering the importance of calculating PES schemes at the social equity and cooperative game (CG) levels, to quantitatively solve multi-objective problems, a water resources allocation model and multi-objective optimization are provided. The model consists of three modules that address the following processes: (1) social equity mechanisms used to study water consumer associations, (2) an optimal decision-making process based on variable intervals and CG theory, and (3) the use of Shapley values of CGs for profit maximization. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology for realizing sustainable development was examined. First, an optimization model with water allocation objective was developed based on sustainable water resources allocation framework that maximizes the net benefit of water use. Then, to meet water quality requirements, PES cost was estimated using trade-off curves among different pollution emission concentration permissions. Finally, to achieve equity and supply sufficient incentives for water resources protection, CG theory approaches were utilized to reallocate PES benefits. The potential of the developed model was examined by its application to a case study in the Yongding River watershed of China. Approximately 128 Me of water flowed from the upper reach (Shanxi and Hebei Provinces) sections of the Yongding River to the lower reach (Beijing) in 2013. According to the calculated results, Beijing should pay USD$6.31 M ((sic)39.03 M) for water-related ES to Shanxi and Hebei Provinces. The results reveal that the proposed methodology is an available tool that can be used for sustainable development with resolving PES amounts among different regions under social and environmental constraints by considering the characteristics of social equity and CGs.

AB Land surface evapotranspiration (ET) is the central process in hydrological cycle. The accuracy in simulating ET is affected by the calculation of underlying surface resistance. However, the surface resistance is difficult to be measured and greatly affected by climatic, crop and soil factors. How to quantify the combined effects of these factors on surface resistance is still a challenge for hydrologists. Our study attempted to construct and validate a semi-empirical surface resistance model based on the analysis of the response pattern of surface resistance to climatic resistance, leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture. The surface resistance was derived by the re-arranged Penman-Monteith (PM) equation and the measured maize ET using eddy covariance in 2007. Results indicate that the ratio of surface resistance to climatic resistance showed a logarithmic relationship with LA!, and an exponential function as soil moisture when LAI was below 2. But the ratio was nearly constant and not sensitive to variation in LAI and soil moisture when LA! exceeded 2. Based on the relationships, a surface resistance model was further constructed and compared to the widely used Katerji-Perrier and Jarvis models over the sparse maize and grape canopy. Our resistance model combined with the PM equation improved the accuracy in estimating daily maize ET by 11% in 2007 and 4% in 2008, and vineyard ET by 7% against the Katerji-Perrier model combined with PM method, while by 32% in 2007 and 104% in 2008, and vineyard ET by 5% against the Jarvis model combined with PM method. Thus our model significantly improved the performance in simulating sparse vegetation ET and can be used to estimate daily surface resistance under the partial canopy condition.

AB The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is critical for supplying water resources to downstream areas. However, streamflow in the SRYR declined despite a slight increase in precip-itation during the past few decades. The SRYR experienced significant frozen ground degradation with climate warming, but how frozen ground degradation influences runoff remains unclear. This study investigated the changes of the precipitation-runoff relationship using the double-mass curve method and examined the impact of long-term spatiotemporal changes in frozen ground on the water balance components using the geomorphology -based eco-hydrological model (GBEHM). The results showed that the precipitation-runoff relationship changed significantly since 1989 in the SRYR from 1960 to 2019. In the same period, the areal mean value of the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground (MTSFG) decreased by 0.10 m/10a and the areal mean active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost increased by 0.06 m/10a. Besides, 21.0 % of the entire SRYR has degraded from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground (SFG). Runoff decreased mainly in the region with elevation below 4200 m, where the evapotranspiration increase exceeded the precipitation increase. Frozen ground degradation significantly altered the hydrological processes, which is reflected by the increased subsurface runoff and the decreased surface runoff. The total water storage increased by 2.9 mm/a in the permafrost region due to the increase in active layer thickness and by 5.7 mm/a in the degradation region where permafrost completely thawed during 1960-2019. The runoff seasonality was also altered, being indicated as an increase in winter runoff. These findings help provide a better understanding of the runoff change under climate warming in permafrost-affected regions and provide insights into future water resources management in the Yellow River basin under the climate warming.

AB Climate change and riparian management are major drivers of hydrological change, with important implications for nutrient fluxes in lowland streams. However, the coupling of hydrological and nutrient dynamics is complex due to time-variant flow paths, interacting biogeochemical processes and variation in land use, fertilization levels and management measures. Here, we assessed the long-term (30 year) changes in climate, discharge, groundwater levels and stream water quality in a mixed land use catchment (Demnitzer Mill Creek catchment, DMC) in northern Germany. The catchment was subject to wetland restoration and subsequent beaver (Castor fiber) recolonization over the last 15 years. Climatic variability is the primary driver of the hydrological regime, with discharge and groundwater variations closely coupled to increases in annual air temperature and fluctuations of annual rainfall. Over the past 8 years, stream flows have been greatly reduced during a prolonged drought period. Meanwhile, beaver dams have also moderated flow regimes and facilitated groundwater recharge. In terms of water quality regimes, the concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationship for nitrate (NO3-N) and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) showed positive and negative chemodynamic behavior respectively, whilst dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exhibited chemostatic behavior. These differences were dictated by the intrinsic properties of each solute in terms of contrasting catchment storage and immobilization processes. Moreover, the changing hydrological conditions regulated such patterns and strengthened the C-Q relationships for nutrients during the drought. As an integrated result of drought and wetland restoration, nutrient concentrations and fluxes in stream water have been reduced in recent years. Headwater catchments like DMC, where much of the hydrochemical signature of larger, downstream river networks are generated, are critical observatories for integrating understanding of the linkages between water quality and land management in an era of climate change.

AB Analysis of the isotopic composition of five years of event based precipitation samples collected in the Blue Mountains near Sydney Australia is presented. The relationship between the stable isotopic (O-18, D-excess) composition of precipitation with moisture source regions and prevailing synoptic scale weather systems was investigated. Back trajectory analysis showed that when the majority of moisture was sourced over land the delta O-18 was significantly more enriched (-3.5 parts per thousand) compared to moisture sourced from the ocean (-7.1 parts per thousand). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the delta O-18 arithmetic means of different oceanic source regions. The analysis indicated that the large scale rainout during transport of moisture to the measurement site was a more important factor influencing the delta O-18 variability. A synoptic weather classification scheme was used to analyse the relationship with prevailing synoptic meteorology, which showed that the arithmetic mean of delta O-18 in precipitation for the East Coast Low (ECL) systems was significantly more depleted than other systems and exhibited much larger variability. There was no statistically significant difference in the delta O-18 arithmetic means of the other systems. The delta O-18 of the ECLs was shown to be related to the distance from low pressure system centre to the site and the large scale rainout along the back trajectory. Considering the large amount of precipitation that can result from ECLs, they may contribute significantly to signals observed over longer period collections such as the GNIP records. Winter and summer more depleted samples were from synoptic weather systems from which more precipitation had occurred both at the site and prior to the site. The enriched events could be associated with short duration low intensity precipitation events. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prediction of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is of vital importance for Indian economy, and it has been remained a great challenge for hydro-meteorologists due to inherent complexities in the climatic systems. The Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns from tropical Pacific Ocean (ENSO) and those from tropical Indian Ocean (EQUINOO) are established to influence the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall. The information of these two large scale atmospheric circulation patterns in terms of their indices is used to model the complex relationship between Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and the ENSO as well as EQUINOO indices. However, extracting the signal from such large-scale indices for modeling such complex systems is significantly difficult. Rainfall predictions have been done for 'All India' as one unit, as well as for five 'homogeneous monsoon regions of India', defined by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Recent 'Artificial Intelligence' tool 'Genetic Programming' (GP) has been employed for modeling such problem. The Genetic Programming approach is found to capture the complex relationship between the monthly Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation pattern indices - ENSO and EQUINOO. Research findings of this study indicate that GP-derived monthly rainfall forecasting models, that use large-scale atmospheric circulation information are successful in prediction of All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall with correlation coefficient as good as 0.866, which may appears attractive for such a complex system. A separate analysis is carried out for All India Summer Monsoon rainfall for India as one unit, and five homogeneous monsoon regions, based on ENSO and EQUINOO indices of months of March, April and May only, performed at end of month of May. In this case, All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall could be predicted with 0.70 as correlation coefficient with somewhat lesser Correlation Coefficient (C.C.) values for different 'homogeneous monsoon regions'.

AB Lateral seepage can be an important water loss pathway at the field level and a conduit for the discharge of pesticides and nutrients from rice fields. However, few studies have directly measured lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields. This study sought to characterize the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in California rice fields, and to explore the relationship between lateral seepage and soil properties or hydrologic conditions. Lateral seepage was measured during the growing season at 50 locations spread across six rice fields using a methodology that operates analogously to a double-ring infiltrometer. Lateral seepage rates varied over four orders of magnitude (0.05-33.11 cm(2) h(-1) or 0.0011-1.05 cm h(-1)), though even the highest rate measured was small compared to typical water inputs in California rice fields, and lateral seepage corresponded to only 1.0%-1.9% of water inputs at sites where irrigation inputs were measured. Lateral seepage was negatively correlated with levee width (p = 0.025) and the relative water height in the adjacent field, supply canal, or drainage ditch (p = 0.045), though this relationship explained little of the variation in lateral seepage rates (marginal r(2) = 0.129). Contrary to expectations, not all supply canals or higher flooded fields were a source for lateral seepage into fields, as unsaturated zones present in most levees served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee. Future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways.

AB Knowledge of vegetative responses to drought across hydroclimatic zones is crucial for understanding ecohydrologic cycles. Based on monthly self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-48 month scales), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study examined the relationship between natural vegetation dynamics and drought in the growing season during 1982-2012 at 293 sites over China. Pearson correlations between NDVI and drought indices (PDSI and SPED were employed to quantify the association between vegetation and drought. The results show that the Pearson correlations between PDSI and NDVI in growing season (C-NP) ranged from -0.47 to 0.84, and the maximum correlation between SPEI and NDVI in growing season (MaxSPEI) ranged from -0.31 to 0.86, within which the negative correlations were mainly observed in the areas dominated by forest in south China. Moreover, the C-NP was highly and nonlinearly related to the aridity index (empty set) (MaxSPEI showed a similar trend). The relationship between C-NP and empty set indicated that, water stress was not the limiting factor for natural vegetation in humid regions (empty set < 0.98) even during droughts; the drought vulnerability of natural vegetation increased with increasing empty set up to a point (empty set = 4.68) and then decreased with increasing empty set when empty set > 4.68; in extreme arid regions, the natural vegetation exhibited less sensitivity to drought. These tendencies could be seen worldwide. The varied physiological properties of plants and the response of photosynthesis to energy processes probably explain some discernible variation.

AB Estimating the permeability of superficial deposits is fundamental to many aspects of catchment science, but can be problematic where insufficient in situ measurements are available from pumping tests in piezometers. Consequently, common practice is to estimate permeability from the material description or, where available, particle size distribution using a formula such as Hazen. In this study, we examine the relationships between particle size, relative density and hydraulic conductivity in superficial deposits in Morayshire, Northern Scotland: a heterogeneous environment typical of many catchments subject to previous glaciations. The superficial deposits comprise glaciofluvial sands and gravels, glacial tills and moraines, raised marine sediments, and blown sands. Thirty-eight sites were investigated: hydraulic conductivity measurements were made using repeated Guelph permeameter measurements, cone resistance was measured in situ with a Panda dynamic cone penetrometer; material descriptions were made in accordance with BS5930:1999; and disturbed samples were taken for particle size analysis. Overall hydraulic conductivity (K) varied from 0.001 m/d to >40 m/d; glacial till had the lowest K (median 0.027 m/d) and glacial moraine the highest K (median 30 m/d). However, within each geological unit there was great variability in measured hydraulic conductivity values. Multiple linear regression of the data indicated that logd(10) and relative density (indicated by cone resistance or BS5930:1999 soil state description) were independent predictors of logK and together gave a relationship with an R-2 of 0.80. Material description using the largest fraction (e.g. sand or gravel) had little predictive power. Therefore, in heterogeneous catchments, the permeability of superficial deposits is most strongly related to the finest fraction (d(10)) and relative density of the material. In situ Guelph permeameter measurements at outcrops with good geological characterisation provide an easy and reliable method of determining the permeability of particular units of superficial deposits.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays an important role in stream ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on the factors influencing the HZ in the steady state. However, the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the HZ can become transient during a storm. This study investigates the impacts of different rainfall patterns (varying in intensity and duration) on the HZ under transient conditions. A two-dimensional numerical model of a 10-m long and 2-m deep domain is developed, in which the streambed consists of a series of dunes. Brinkman-Darcy and Navier-Stokes equations are respectively solved for groundwater and surface water, and velocity and pressure are coupled at the interface (i.e., the streambed surface). To compare the results under different transient conditions, this study proposes two indicators, i.e., the influential time (IT, the time required for the HZ to return to its initial state once it starts to change) and the influential depth (ID, the maximum increment in the HZ depth). To detect the extent to which the HZ undergoes significant spatial changes, moving split-window and inflection point tests are conducted. The results indicate that rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall duration (RD) both display logarithmic relationships with the IT and ID with high coefficients of determination, but only between certain lower and upper thresholds of the RI and RD. Moreover, the distributions of the IT and ID as a function of the RI and RD are mapped using the surface spline and kriging interpolation methods to facilitate future prediction of the IT and ID. In addition, it is observed that the IT has a linear negative correlation with the groundwater response while the ID is not affected by different groundwater responses. All of the derived relationships can be used to predict the impacts of a future rainfall event on the HZ.

AB Geophysical data have proven to be very useful for lithological characterization. However, quantitatively integrating the information gained from acquiring geophysical data generally requires colocated lithological and geophysical data for constructing a rock-physics relationship. In this contribution, the issue of integrating noncolocated geophysical and lithological data is addressed, and the results are applied to simulate groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer in the Prairie Waters Project North Campus aquifer recharge site, Colorado. Two methods of constructing a rock-physics transform between electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data and lithology measurements are assessed. In the first approach, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to fit a bimodal lognormal distribution to horizontal crosssections of the ERT resistivity histogram. In the second approach, a spatial bootstrap is applied to approximate the rock-physics relationship. The rock-physics transforms provide soft data for multiple point statistics (MPS) simulations. Subsurface models are used to run groundwater flow and tracer test simulations. Each model's uncalibrated, predicted breakthrough time is evaluated based on its agreement with measured subsurface travel time values from infiltration basins to selected groundwater recovery wells. We find that incorporating geophysical information into uncalibrated flow models reduces the difference with observed values, as compared to flow models without geophysical information incorporated. The integration of geophysical data also narrows the variance of predicted tracer breakthrough times substantially. Accuracy is highest and variance is lowest in breakthrough predictions generated by the MLE-based rock-physics transform. Calibrating the ensemble of geophysically constrained models would help produce a suite of realistic flow models for predictive purposes at the site. We find that the success of breakthrough predictions is highly sensitive to the definition of the rock-physics transform; it is therefore important to model this transfer function accurately.

AB Although river discharge is a fundamental hydrologic quantity, conventional methods of streamgaging are impractical, expensive, and potentially dangerous in remote locations. This study evaluated the potential for measuring discharge via various forms of remote sensing, primarily thermal imaging of flow velocities but also spectrally-based depth retrieval from passive optical image data. We acquired thermal image time series from bridges spanning five streams in Alaska and observed strong agreement between velocities measured in situ and those inferred by Particle Image Velocimetry (Ply), which quantified advection of thermal features by the flow. The resulting surface velocities were converted to depth averaged velocities by applying site-specific, calibrated velocity indices. Field spectra from three clear flowing streams provided strong relationships between depth and reflectance, suggesting that, under favorable conditions, spectrally-based bathymetric mapping could complement thermal PIV in a hybrid approach to remote sensing of river discharge; this strategy would not be applicable to larger, more turbid rivers, however. A more flexible and efficient alternative might involve inferring depth from thermal data based on relationships between depth and integral length scales of turbulent fluctuations in temperature, captured as variations in image brightness. We observed moderately strong correlations for a site aggregated data set that reduced station-to-station variability but encompassed a broad range of depths. Discharges calculated using thermal PIV-derived velocities were within 15% of in situ measurements when combined with depths measured directly in the field or estimated from field spectra and within 40% when the depth information also was derived from thermal images. The results of this initial, proof-of-concept investigation suggest that remote sensing techniques could facilitate measurement of river discharge. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Free overfall at the end of a circular channel is simulated as sharp-crested weir with zero height to get end-depth-discharge relationship. A closed-form equation for discharge in terms of end depth for subcritical flows is proposed and verified with the experimental data. Computed discharges show excellent matching with the observed data. Direct solution for discharge for known end depth, channel bed slope, and Manning's coefficient is provided in the graphical form for supercritical flow. Verification of this solution with the available experimental data revealed that computed discharges are within +/- 12% of the observed discharges. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid approach that considers both tree-ring chronologies and sea surface temperature (SST) data for reconstructing annual streamflow is proposed. The most common approach to reconstruct annual streamflow is to develop statistical regression relationships between principal components of tree rings and observed annual flow values and then extend the relationship to estimate annual streamflow values over the period for which tree-ring chronology is available. The primary limitation of this approach is in estimating high flow values since tree-ring growth reaches its potential limit during wet years. The proposed hybrid approach overcomes this limitation by using SST conditions from the tropical Pacific and tree-ring chronologies from the watershed for reconstructing annual streamflows. For this purpose, we considered eight virgin watersheds having long tree-ring chronologies over the southeastern United States. Given the role of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in influencing the hydroclimatology of the southeastern United States, we estimated the periodic component of streamflow using Nino3.4 - an index representing ENSO - and the non-periodic component of streamflow using the non-periodic component of tree rings that represent interannual variability of moisture supply within the region. We employed Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for extracting periodic and non-periodic components from tree-ring chronologies, Nino3.4 and streamflow data. The proposed tree ring and SST hybrid approach was compared with the traditional principal component regression (PCR) approach based on cross-validation. Results show that inclusion of SST provided better reconstructed flow values during high flow years but also resulted in overestimation of flow during low flow years. Combination of annual streamflow estimates from the two models - PCR and the hybrid approach - resulted in improved estimates of reconstructed annual streamflow for the selected eight watersheds. Potential applications for such improved reconstructed streamflow estimates is also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In northern Laos, small agricultural catchments are under high pressure because of the past decades of land management policies. Although the land degradation is well documented, no clear relationships have been established between land use and event scale runoff and erosion. In this study, we use a simple yet realistic model to obtain a per land use characterisation of small plot runoff production at the event scale. Runoff produced during 7 years (2003-2009) from 1 m(2) plots under different land uses is analyzed with the spatially variable infiltration (SVI) model. This model has been recently used by different authors to study infiltration at the plot scale under monsoon climate. It depends on rainfall intensity and a parameter to be calibrated that we called infiltrability. This parameter is an average infiltration rate during a rainfall event for given soil characteristics and a given land use. The analysis and calibration of runoff production with the SVI model led to a data set of almost 3000 infiltrability values. The statistical analysis of this data set with soil parameters, like surface features and slope, land use and the antecedent precipitation index (API), which is an indicator of soil moisture content, shows that infiltrability is strongly correlated with the percentage of crust and land use type. Except for certain land use like rice, the correlation with API is not well established and it is clear that minima of infiltration are reached in the rainy season after a close sequence of rainfall events and infiltrability is generally highest at the end of the dry season. Since we could not establish clear relationships between infiltrability, soil and meteorological parameters, we propose to consider infiltrability as a random function in space and time described, for each land use, by a log normal probability density function.

AB In the western United States many rivers experience high salinity resulting from natural and anthropogenic sources. This impacts the water quality and hence, is closely monitored. The salinity is closely linked with streamflow quantity in that, a higher flow brings with it more salt but also provides substantial dilution to reduce the salt concentration and vice-versa during low flow regimes. Decision makers typically plan strategies for salinity mitigation and evaluate impacts of water management policy options on salinity in the basin using decision support models. These models require statistically consistent basin wide scenarios of streamflow and salinity. Recognizing this need, we develop a basin wide stochastic generator of salinity that is consistent with the flows. The framework integrates a nonparametric space-time disaggregation model, applied to both flow and salt, and a nonparametric regression model, which simulates natural salt magnitude for a given natural flow. The nonparametric techniques do not require prior assumptions about the underlying functional relationship unlike traditional parametric methods, are data driven, and robust at capturing any functional form present in the data. They are also easily portable across sites. Within this integrated framework we propose two representative approaches, from several possible variations, for generating salt scenarios, each capturing different aspects of the flow and salt statistics. We demonstrate the performance of these approaches by applying them to flow and salt data from four gauges in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The spatial and temporal statistics of salt and their relationship with flows are well captured. This framework has utility in a variety of applications such as, short term salinity forecast conditioned on streamflow forecast, long term salinity scenarios conditioned on climate change projections, and also in reconstructing paleo salinity from paleo streamflows.

AB We propose a new framework to compare alternative geostatistical descriptions of a given site. Multiple realizations of each of the considered geostatistical models and their corresponding tomograms (based on inversion of noise-contaminated simulated data) are used as a multivariate training image. The training image is scanned with a direct sampling algorithm to obtain conditional realizations of hydraulic conductivity that are not only in agreement with the geostatistical model, but also honor the spatially varying resolution of the site-specific tomogram. Model comparison is based on the quality of the simulated geophysical data from the ensemble of conditional realizations. The tomogram in this study is obtained by inversion of cross-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival travel time data acquired at the MAcro-Dispersion Experiment (MADE) site in Mississippi (USA). Various heterogeneity descriptions ranging from multi-Gaussian fields to fields with complex multiple-point statistics inferred from outcrops are considered. Under the assumption that the relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity inferred from local measurements is valid, we find that conditioned multi-Gaussian realizations and derivatives thereof can explain the crosshole geophysical data. A training image based on an aquifer analog from Germany was found to be in better agreement with the geophysical data than the one based on the local outcrop, which appears to under-represent high hydraulic conductivity zones. These findings are only based on the information content in a single resolution-limited tomogram and extending the analysis to tracer or higher resolution surface GPR data might lead to different conclusions (e.g., that discrete facies boundaries are necessary). Our framework makes it possible to identify inadequate geostatistical models and petrophysical relationships, effectively narrowing the space of possible heterogeneity representations.

AB Flood peak data for focus catchments in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina are analyzed to test the hypothesis that, as the size of the hydrological event increases, the effect of forest cover on the peak discharge becomes less important. Previous research suggests that this hypothesis may hold for small catchments (less than 1 km(2)) but the pattern is less clear for large catchments. The principal study results are for small paired catchments (0.6-10 km(2)) with different forest covers (forest/pasture) in highland Ecuador and a small (0.35 km(2)) plantation catchment in southern Chile subjected to logging. The former were analyzed by comparing the corresponding peak discharges for given rainfall events, the latter by comparing the relationships between peak discharge and rainfall event size for the pre- and post-logging periods. In all cases there is relative or absolute convergence of the responses as discharge increases, with convergence likely for flood return periods of around 10 years. More limited data for larger catchments which have undergone either deforestation or afforestation (131 km(2) in Costa Rica and 94-1545 km(2) in Chile) suggest that the percentage change in forest cover must exceed 20-30% to provoke a measurable response in peak discharge; convergence of peak discharge response at high flows (return periods of around 5 years) for the different forest covers may then be observed. For a 12.9-km(2) snowmelt-affected catchment in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, extreme floods require rain-on-snow events but the data are not sufficient to quantify the complex relationship between forest cover, event return period and peak discharge. In general, forest cover is unlikely to reduce, significantly, peak discharges generated by extreme rainfall but may still offer substantial mitigation benefits for moderate (i.e. more frequent) rainfall events.

AB Remote sensing brings unprecedented opportunities to estimate precipitation at regional, continental, and even global scales. Nevertheless, the spatial resolutions of current mainstream satellite precipitation estimates are still too coarse to be directly used in the hydrological and meteorological applications over the medium and small scales. The spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation is often affected by various land surface factors, such as geographical location, vegetational cover, topographic characteristics, and ground temperature. Based on the relationship between precipitation and multi-geospatial factors, this study proposed a new spatial downscaling approach named as gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to downscale the annual satellite precipitation estimates of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) from 0.1 degrees to 0.01 degrees gridded resolution over Mainland China from 2015 to 2018. As for the preprocessing of downscaling algorithm, the entire study area of Mainland China was separated into four different climate regions due to the spatial discrepancy of the relationship between precipitation and geospatial factors. To validate the effectiveness of GBDT approach, we compared it with other two types of downscaling methods based on random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), respectively. Our evaluation results show that the geographical location (including both latitude and longitude) seems to be relatively more important and stable for GBDT modelling than other land surface factors across the four climate regions in Mainland China. In terms of large spatial scales, the GBDT and RF algorithms generally are superior to SVM for downscaling the IMERG precipitation, as SVM reduced the considerable accuracy of the downscaled results. Last but not least, GBDT exhibits more robust features in downscaling the satellite precipitation retrievals than RF over complex terrains, where the amount of precipitation has strong spatial heterogeneity.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) is a key characteristic of ecosystem function, and reflects the trade-off relationship between carbon gain and water loss. The coupled relationship between carbon and water is complex for ecosystems, especially along elevation gradient. A foliage stable carbon isotope method and the AVIM2 model were used to study the temporal and elevational pattern of carbon gain, water loss and WUE in subalpine dark coniferous forests (Abies fabri). The results showed that monthly WUE in wet season was larger than in dry season. The diverse response curves between carbon gain, water loss and meteorological factors, such as monthly precipitation, air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and net radiation (Rn), determined the monthly variation of WUE. Both the carbon gain (gross primary production, GPP; net primary production, NPP) and water loss (evapotranspiration, ET; transpiration, Et) decreased as elevation increased. The carbon gain exhibited moderately decreasing rate compared with that of water loss along the elevation gradient. Plant WUE (GPP/Et or NPP/Et) exhibited an increasing trend along the elevation gradient, comparing with ecosystem WUE (GPP/ET or NPP/ET) only increased from 2800 to 3500 m a.s.l. and slightly decreased as elevation continue increasing to 3700 m a.s.l. The ratio of canopy interception to ET determined the varied elevational pattern of WUE between plant and ecosystem scale. Air temperature contributed 79.27% and 68.66% for elevational pattern of GPP and transpiration (Et), respectively. While Ta and c(i)/c(a) (ratio of intercellular and air CO2 concentration) contributed 50.67% and 47.67 to the variation of GPP/Et along elevation gradient, respectively. The canopy height and canopy coverage were significantly negative with WUE along the elevation gradient. The asynchronous response of the carbon gain and water loss to climatic and physiological variables determined the temporal and elevational patterns of ecosystem WUE.

TI Correlation between flood frequency and geomorphologic complexity of

ID FRACTAL DIMENSION
AB Urban flooding is a combined product of the climate and watershed geomorphology. River system is one of the vital components of watershed geomorphology. The geomorphic characteristics of rivers have important effect on the formation of flooding. However, there have been few attempts so far to investigate the relationship between flooding frequency, the probability of flooding, and the geomorphological complexity of river system. Such relationship is essential in order to predict likely responses of flooding frequency to the large-scale changes in the complexity of the rivers network induced by accelerating urbanization around rivers. In this study we investigate the correlation between geomorphological characteristics of river system and the probability of flooding. Hangzhou city in China, which has suffered severe flooding, is chosen as a case study to evaluate this correlation and to investigate the impact of changes of drainage networks morphology on the local flooding. The fractal dimension, which is used to quantitatively assess geomorphological complexity of rivers network, is calculated by using box-counting method based on fractal geometry for eight sub rivers network in Hangzhou. A model based on the correlation of flooding frequency and fractal dimension is established. The model is applied to investigate the effect of the rapid urbanization induced changes of river geomorphology on the local flood frequency in two typical regions in Hangzhou. The results show that the flood frequency/event increases with the decrease of fractal dimension of the rivers network, indicating that the geomorphologic complexity of rivers network has an important effect on flooding. This research has great referential value for future flood quantitative investigations and provides new method for urban flood control and river system protection. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY.

ID CLOSURE
AB Secure workings in underground coal mines usually require the lowering of water levels via pumping. After mine closure, pump systems are stopped and the water level recovers in a process known as groundwater rebound. In the Asturian Coal Basin, Spain, the closure and flooding of underground coal mines carries associated environmental impacts that ought to be assessed. Among them, those related with groundwater flow and pollutant transport are of main interest. To evaluate the environmental risks during and after mine closure the construction of numerical flow models is suggested, which rely on an appropriate conceptualization of the mine-hydrogeological system. Underground mines of this region are characterized by very steep coal seams due to a folded and faulted geological structure. The resulting geometry translates into a complex network of hundreds of kilometers of mine tunnels and galleries. This is a challenge for the construction of numerical models in issues like geometrical problems, assignation of hydraulic parameters, coupling of physical laws and high computational cost. This paper presents the conceptual and numerical model of two linked mines of the region, Mosquitera and Pumarabule, that recently ended the flooding stage, to be used in assessment of post-closure environmental risks. To implement the geometry of the underground mine, a methodological approach to translate the mining information to the numerical simulator has been developed, that retains the hydraulic behavior of the key underground mine elements. A methodological approach for coupled simulation of mine conduits and porous media flow has been explicitly adapted. The results, in terms of the velocity distribution field inside the mine and possible outflow sites, are useful to provide a basis for later extension of transport models and assessment of hydro chemical impacts on the area.

AB The looming impacts of changing climate and ever increasing water and energy demands make it important to quantify expected water and energy availabilities and develop strategies to mitigate expected shortfalls. Keeping these aspects in mind, in this paper, hydrological modeling is performed on the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) to simulate the inflows to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) based on the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model and a Multiple-input single-output Linear Systematic Model (MLSM). These models are derived for historical (1960-2005) and future (near: 2021-2050 and far: 2061-2090) time periods using bias corrected climate projections from an ensemble of 6 RCMs available through the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Simulating with and without snow, hydrological responses to both the historical and future climates are fed into a daily reservoir simulation model where the operation of the TGR follows the designed operating rule curves which can be regarded as a standard operating policy (SOP). The results indicate marginal reduction in mean annual precipitation, inflow and hydropower generation and mean hydropower generation reliability for the future scenarios under RCP 8.5 with the decreases for far future being more prominent than those for near future. The inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the TGR in November and May and have limited impact on other months because of the regulation ability of the SOP. Hydropower generation responses to extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the TGR. The without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the TGR with respect to the with snow projections and are likely to have positive impact on the water impounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods.

AB The application of two-dimensional shallow-water equations models (2D-SWEs) for the description of hydrodynamic-based surface runoff computations is becoming a reference approach in rainfall-runoff simulations at the catchment scale. Due to their ability in generation of flow patterns throughout the basin, they can be used not only as an advanced method for flood mapping studies and hazard assessment but also as an innovative tool for the analysis of river drainage networks, opening new perspectives for several environmental processes. In particular, in this work we put the river networks in a 2D-SWEs framework, meaning that the traditional tree-like fluvial structure, represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines, is replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2-D geometry of the river structure itself, for which the values of the hydrodynamic values are provided by the numerical simulations. This approach is used here to derive a new scaling property that relates the specific discharge threshold, used to identify the river network cells, to the total areas of the network cells themselves. The hydrodynamic and geomorphological interpretation of this power law function and the influence of grid resolution, on some relevant parameters of this curve, have inspired the development of a heuristic procedure for non-uniform grid generation, able to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basins for which the grid refinement process makes sense. Moreover, information related to how much grid refinement is needed is provided as well. The performances of this procedure are very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges, hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas, reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of fine uniform grids.

AB We perform a comparative study of water discharge from Euclidean and fractal reservoirs. The Euclidean reservoir is modeled by a filter with a translationally invariant cubic network of straight square channels. As a model of fractal reservoir with the scale invariant pore network we use a pre-fractal inverse Menger sponge. The gravity-driven discharge experiments were carried out with two different setups. In the first setup, a porous filter is fixed in container above a lateral exit duct. In the second setup, the exit duct is connected to one of lateral exits of the pore network. In both cases, we found that the squared outflow velocity is a linear function of water table elevation above exit orifice. Hence, the water discharge is governed by the Bemoulli's principle rather than by the Darcy's law. Furthermore, we found that filters placed above the exit duct have no effect on the discharge rate, because absolute permeabilities of both filters are large enough to supply water into the volume between filter's bottom and exit orifice. Conversely, when the exit duct is connected to the lateral exit of the pore network, the water discharge from the inverse Menger sponge is faster than from the Euclidean reservoir. Experimental data fittings with a modified Torricelli's equation suggest that a loss of mechanical energy of flowing water in the fractal pore network is less than in the translationally invariant network of channels. This finding reveals that an effective wetted area along a flow path of least resistance in the self-similar pore network is smaller less than in the periodic network of straight channels. So, the fractal features of the pore network can have a strong impact on hydrological processes in natural reservoirs and karst aquifers which commonly possess statistical scale invariance.

AB The data collected have allowed the evaluation of the variations in the water levels of Lake Tanganyika between 1932 and 1995, the discharge at the outlet, the excess of the lake budget (or "level without discharge", DeltaH*), and the precipitation on the drainage area. The evolution of the annual lake budget is related to the precipitation variability. However a marked increase in the excess after 1961 is shown, which corresponds to a change in the relationship between annual excess and precipitation, which further corresponds to a higher effectiveness of rainfall. This marked change in the lake water budget could partly correspond to wetter conditions at the beginning of the rainy season, but the man-induced changes in land use and in the surface runoff conditions appear partly responsible for the difference in the lake sensitivity to precipitation.

AB Based on the Social Choice Theory (SCT), a new Decision Support System (DSS) is presented and employed to rank-order management alternatives (i.e. scenarios) in the water resources management system of Tehran metropolitan area, Iran. In the framework of the presented DSS, the quantitative characteristics of the stakeholders are taken into account to develop a decentralized decision-making method. An agent-based simulation model is employed to evaluate the outcomes of implementing each management scenario by calculating nine distinct environmental, social, and economic criteria over a 25-year simulation period. It is shown that the best scenarios selected by the DSS have merits to enhance the sustainability of the water resources in the study area, and to shift the stakeholders' network towards cooperation and collaboration.

AB A large part of the Sahel consists of endorheic hydrological systems, where reservoirs and lakes capture surface runoff during the rainy season, making water available during the dry season. Monitoring and understanding the dynamics of these lakes and their relationships to the ecohydrological evolution of the region is important to assess past, present and future changes of water resources in the Sahel.
   Yet, most of Sahelian watersheds are still ungauged or poorly gauged, which hinders the assessment of the water flows feeding the lakes and the overall runoff over their watershed.
   In this paper, a methodology is developed to estimate water inflow to lakes for ungauged watersheds. It is tested for the Agoufou lake in the Gourma region in Mali, for which in situ water height measurements and surface areas estimations by remote sensing are simultaneously available. A Height-Volume-Area (HVA) model is developed to relate water volume to water height and lake surface area. This model is combined to daily evaporation and precipitation to estimate water inflow to the lake, which approximates runoff over the whole watershed. The ratio between annual water inflow and precipitation increases over the last sixty years as a result of a significant increase in runoff coefficient over the Agoufou watershed.
   The method is then extended to derive water inflow to three other Sahelian lakes in Mauritania and Niger. No in situ measurements are available and lake surface areas estimation by remote sensing is the only source of information. Dry season surface area changes and estimated evaporation are used to select a suited VA relationship for each case.
   It is found that the ratio between annual water inflow and precipitation has also increased in the last 60 years over these watersheds, although trends at the Mauritanian site are not statistically significant.
   The remote sensing approach developed in this study can be easily applied to recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8, to quantify the evolution of hydrological systems in ungauged Sahelian regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial variability evaluation of the water table of an aquifer provides useful information in water resources management plans. Geostatistical methods are often employed to map the free surface of an aquifer. In geostatistical analysis using Kriging techniques the selection of the optimal variogram is very important for the optimal method performance. This work compares three different criteria to assess the theoretical variogram that fits to the experimental one: the Least Squares Sum method, the Akaike Information Criterion and the Cressie's Indicator. Moreover, variable distance metrics such as the Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, Canberra and Bray-Curtis are applied to calculate the distance between the observation and the prediction points, that affects both the variogram calculation and the Kriging estimator. A Fuzzy Logic System is then applied to define the appropriate neighbors for each estimation point used in the Kriging algorithm. The two criteria used during the Fuzzy Logic process are the distance between observation and estimation points and the groundwater level value at each observation point. The proposed techniques are applied to a data set of 250 hydraulic head measurements distributed over an alluvial aquifer. The analysis showed that the Power-law variogram model and Manhattan distance metric within ordinary kriging provide the best results when the comprehensive geostatistical analysis process is applied. On the other hand, the Fuzzy Logic approach leads to a Gaussian variogram model and significantly improves the estimation performance. The two different variogram models can be explained in terms of a fractional Brownian motion approach and of aquifer behavior at local scale. Finally, maps of hydraulic head spatial variability and of predictions uncertainty are constructed for the area with the two different approaches comparing their advantages and drawbacks.

AB Global precipitation products are very important datasets in flow simulations, especially in poorly gauged regions. Uncertainties resulting from precipitation products, hydrological models and their combinations vary with time and data magnitude, and undermine their application to flow simulations. However, previous studies have not quantified these uncertainties individually and explicitly. This study developed an ensemble-based dynamic Bayesian averaging approach (e-Bay) for deterministic discharge simulations using multiple global precipitation products and hydrological models. In this approach, the joint probability of precipitation products and hydrological models being correct is quantified based on uncertainties in maximum and mean estimation, posterior probability is quantified as functions of the magnitude and timing of discharges, and the law of total probability is implemented to calculate expected discharges. Six global fine-resolution precipitation products and two hydrological models of different complexities are included in an illustrative application. e-Bay can effectively quantify uncertainties and therefore generate better deterministic discharges than traditional approaches (weighted average methods with equal and varying weights and maximum likelihood approach). The mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of e-Bay are up to 0.97 and 0.85 in training and validation periods respectively, which are at least 0.06 and 0.13 higher than traditional approaches. In addition, with increased training data, assessment criteria values of e-Bay show smaller fluctuations than traditional approaches and its performance becomes outstanding. The proposed e-Bay approach bridges the gap between global precipitation products and their pragmatic applications to discharge simulations, and is beneficial to water resources management in ungauged or poorly gauged regions across the world.

ID INTEGRATION
AB In the real-time flood control operation of a multi-reservoir system, the multi-reservoir real-time flood control hybrid operation (MRFCHO) model with reduced structure is an effective way to improve the efficiency, but the reduction of the model structure may cause greater flood risk. This paper focuses on this scientific problem and evaluates the reliability of the MRFCHO model in real-time flood control operation through risk analysis. Firstly, the flood risk is defined. Then, the Bayesian network risk analysis model is established through four parts: Bayesian network structure construction, training samples generation, parameter learning, and inference. This paper takes the flood control system in upstream of the Lutaizi point in the Huaihe River basin as a case study. The flood risk of the MRFCHO model caused by the model structure reduction is quantitatively described, the spatial distribution and propagation characteristics of flood risk are evaluated, and the flood risk caused by the double uncertainties of the model structure and flood forecasting is analyzed. Besides, the factors affecting the risk of the public flood control point are diagnosed. The results show that (1) the model structure reduction does not significantly increase the flood risk at the public flood control point, and there is no obvious propagation law of flood risk in space; (2) compared with only considering the model structure reduction, considering the double uncertainties of flood forecasting and model structure reduction has a 65% probability of increasing the risk; (3) Runoff from the Runheji point in the upper reaches of main stream and the lateral inflow of Lutaizi point are the main reasons for the risk of Lutaizi point.

AB Carbon-climate feedback is sensitive in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A series of temporal measurements from Jinsha River and Yalong River, in conjunction with flow information, were used to study the carbon dynamics and predict future carbon fluxes under ongoing climate change. DIC and DOC concentrations showed considerable temporal variations, with low DIC and high DOC concentrations in the high-flow season, and vice versa. DIC and DOC concentrations had negative and positive relationships with runoff changes, respectively, showing the hydro-biogeochemical controls on carbon dynamics. With the increase of runoff, the accelerated chemical weathering and the high carbonate buffering capacity should be responsible for the chemostatic behaviors of DIC. Meanwhile, warm weather would enhance organic carbon degradation, and also thicken the active layer of permafrost in the source area, both of which would produce DOC. In addition, organic carbon degradation in the high-flow season would produce DIC with C-13-depleted values. delta C-13(DIC) also had significant temporal variations, synchronous with runoff changes (i.e., light values under high runoff conditions), supporting that biological carbon plays an important role in carbon dynamics during the warm season. Based on the clear positive correlations between carbon fluxes and runoff, we predicted that the sensitivities of DOC fluxes to temperature changes are 12.2%/degrees C and 8.3%/degrees C for the Jinsha River and Yalong River, respectively. The sensitivities of DIC fluxes to temperature changes are much lower, which are 5.5%/degrees C and 6.1%/degrees C for the Jinsha River and Yalong River, respectively. This study sheds lights on the alpine riverine carbon cycling based on runoff-shifting concentration-isotope (q-C-I) relationships in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has implications on the understanding of climate forcing on carbon fluxes in alpine areas.

AB Extreme climatic and hydrological events result in water-induced disasters and associated loss and damage of lives, livelihoods, and properties. It is related with various climatic, topographical, and anthropogenic factors, and therefore, expected to vary widely across the watersheds. This study characterized historical and projected future trends in climatic extremes, their spatial variations, hydrological extremes, and linkage between hydroclimatic extremes for a rain-fed Extended East Rapti (EER) watershed in Central-Southern Nepal. The watershed feeds into the Ganges in the South Asia through the Gandaki river. A set of 14 climate extreme indices, seven related to precipitation and seven to temperature, and eight hydrological indices were selected to characterize the extremes. Climatic and hydrological extreme indices were computed using RClimDex and IHA (Indicators for Hydrological Alteration) tools, respectively. Trends were calculated using the Modified Mann-Kendall test and Sens's slope estimator. Relationship between hydrological and climatic extremes was evaluated by checking dates for rainfall extreme, hydrological extreme, and reported cases of flooding during that period. Results showed increasing trends in both precipitation and temperature extremes for the historical period (1980-2005) with a rate of 10-35% increase in RX1day (monthly maximum 1-day precipitation), 10-50% increase in R95p (very wet days precipitation amount) and 15-60% increase in warm nights from the base period until the midcentury. Hydrological alterations in terms of increasing extremes are also clearly visible in maximum flows, minimum flows as well as the shift in the day of maximum flow. Since, hydro-climatic extremes bear a direct relationship, future hydrological extremes, primarily floods, are expected to increase in future.

AB The widely used probability based drought indices for drought characterization usually underlie the assumption of the considered hydrometeorological variables to be stationary, which is largely challenged under the current global change. Incorporating the parameters of probability distribution with covariates, such as time or climate indices, has become a common way to develop drought index considering nonstationarity. However most previous drought studies emphasized more on the linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates, which may neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lost useful information for drought assessment. Our study aims to develop a Nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (NSPI) with distribution parameters nonlinearly varying with potential influencing climate indices. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) of China are selected as the case study area to examine the performance of the NSPI with the performance of the traditional standardized precipitation index (SPI). Results indicate that the NSPI (with climate indices as covariates) is more robust than both the NSPI (with time as the covariate) and the traditional SPI. Furthermore, the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can be more suitable for drought assessment than the linear dependence of distribution parameters. Besides, there exists a higher frequency of extreme drought by the NSPI than the SPI in recent decades in most regions of the MLRYRB. Although the NSPI is a lithe computationally expensive with more required inputs of climate variables, it can depict the influence of changing environment on the drought occurrence, thus can be a feasible alternative for drought assessment considering nonstationarity in view of future change and provide valuable support for further studies.

AB The bed resistance is one of the most complex aspects of water flow studies in natural streams. Most of the existing non-linear formulas for describing alluvial channel flows are based on dimensional analysis and statistical fitting of data to the parameters considered in the functional relationships implicitly, which are partially valid. The present study aims at developing genetic programming (GP) - based formulation of Manning roughness coefficient in alluvial channels. The training and testing data are selected from original experiments, performed in a hydraulic flume using a sand mobile bed. A comparison was also made between GP and traditional nonlinear approaches of resistance modeling. The obtained results revealed the GP capability in modeling resistance coefficient of alluvial channels' bed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential water resources availability (PWRA) in an area is assessed in terms of disorder in intensity and over-a-year apportionment of monthly rainfall. The disorder is treasured by two different entropies. intensity entropy (IE) and apportionment entropy (AE), which are defined using Shannon's informational entropy theory. These entropies are standardized and pairs of standardized IE and AE for different locations of raingauges tire plotted. Then. simple clustering and K-means clustering are considered for delineating PWRA distributed over tin area of interest and classifying regional attributes of PWRA. Monthly rainfall data recorded at 11,260 raingauges are analyzed, and different classifications of PWRA are comparatively mapped. An example application of the proposed methodology to the worldwide PWRA assessment is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Darcy's law specifies a linear relation between the Darcy velocity of a fluid flow and the pressure gradient that drives the flow. However, in low-permeability porous media, the velocity of a fluid flow exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the imposed pressure gradient, which is referred to as the non-Darcian flow behavior. Temper-ature has been postulated to affect the threshold pressure gradient of a non-Darcian flow; however, the sup-porting data is very limited due to the challenges in conducting flow experiments in low-permeability porous media. In this study we for the first time report a systematic measurement of the threshold pressure gradient under various permeabilities and temperatures. The results show that a higher temperature leads to a lower threshold pressure gradient under the same permeability and a faster reduction of the threshold pressure gradient with increasing permeability. The experimental data are fitted to a two-parameter model we previously devel-oped to determine the parameters, h0 and a, which characterize the interfacial fluid-solid interactions and the transition between the Darcy and non-Darcian regimes. Both h0 and a decrease with an increasing temperature. The lower value of h0 under a higher temperature leads to the faster decline of threshold pressure gradient with increasing permeability. This is the first comprehensive experimental study that measured the threshold pressure gradient under multiple different permeabilities and temperatures, which generated the first laboratory dataset of this kind. The experimental data and the model constrained here allow for systematic predictions of both Darcy and non-Darcian flows for a general set of low-permeability porous media under various temperatures and pressure gradients, which have important applications to geological disposal of nuclear waste, hydrocarbon extraction from shale, and contaminant remediation in clay-rich formations.

AB Understanding soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV) at regional scales is of great value for various purposes; however, relevant studies are still limited and have yielded inconsistent findings about the primary controls on regional SMSV. To further address this issue, long-term soil moisture data were retrieved from two large scale monitoring networks located in the continental United States, including the Michigan Automated Weather Network and the Oklahoma Mesonet. To evaluate different controls on SMSV, supporting datasets, which contained data on climate, soil, topography, and vegetation, were also compiled from various sources. Based on temporal stability analysis, the results showed that the mean relative difference (MRD) of soil moisture was more correlated with soil texture (e.g., negative correlations between MRD and sand fraction, and positive ones between LAIRD and silt and clay fractions) than with meteorological forcings in both regions, which differed from the traditional notion that meteorological forcings were the dominant controls on regional SMSV. Moreover, the results revealed that contrary to the previous conjecture, the use of soil moisture temporal anomaly did not reduce the impacts of static properties (e.g., soil properties) on soil moisture temporal dynamics. Instead, it was found that the magnitude of soil moisture temporal anomaly was mainly negatively correlated with sand fraction and positively with silt and clay fractions in both regions. Finally, the relationship between the spatial average and standard deviation of soil moisture as well as soil moisture temporal anomaly was investigated using the data from both networks. The field data showed that the relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomaly was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation). The results of this study provided strong field evidence that local factors (e.g., soil properties) might outweigh regional factors (e.g., meteorological forcings) in controlling regional SMSV.

AB Results of three meter-scale outcrop studies suggest a quantifiable relationship between fluvial bounding surfaces and the permeability correlation structure, mapping of bounding surfaces and in situ measurements of permeability were obtained in three types of deposits: a low-energy channel deposit, a paleosol, and a high-energy channel-deposit. For the low-energy channel deposit only second-order surfaces separating lithofacies were mapped. The variogram exhibits anisotropic exponential behavior, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggests that the within-facies variation dominates over between-facies variation. The paleosol contained no internal bounding surfaces and exhibited a ''bell-shaped'' variogram consistent with a smoothly varying style of heterogeneity. Both first- and second-order bounding surfaces were mapped in the high-energy channel deposit. Results of the ANOVA suggest that the between-facies variation dominates over the within-facies variation. A model of spatial correlation using superposition of independent processes acting over different scales provides a good fit to the data. These three studies suggest that fluvial bounding surfaces provide a geological basis for conceptualizing and modeling heterogeneity in alluvial deposits.

AB This study aims to determine the rate of chemical denudation and the relationships between dominant geochemical reactions operating in the proglacial and subglacial environments of the polythermal glacier Werenskioldbreen (SW Svalbard) during an entire ablation season. Water sampling for major ion chemistry was performed at a proglacial hydrometric station and from subglacial outflows from May to September 2011. These data were combined with measurements of discharge and supraglacial ablation rates. The slopes and intercepts in best-fit regressions of [*Ca2+ + *Mg2+ vs. *SO42-] and [HCO3- vs. *SO42-] in meltwater from ice-marginal subglacial channels were close to the stoichiometric parameters of sulfide oxidation and simple hydrolysis coupled to carbonate dissolution (*concentrations corrected for input of sea-salt). This shows that these relationships predominates the meltwater chemistry. Our findings also show that sulfide oxidation is a better indicator of the configuration of subglacial drainage systems than, for instance, Na+ and K+. In the proglacial area and in sub-artesian outflows, the ion associations represent sulfide oxidation but other processes such as ion exchange and dissolution of Ca and Mg efflorescent salts may also contribute to the solute variations. These processes may cause enhanced fluxes of Ca2+ and HCO3- from glacierized basins during the early ablation and peak flow seasons as the proglacial salts re-dissolve. The overall chemical denudation rate in the basin for 2011 (ranging from 1601 to 1762 meq m(-2) yr(-1) (121.9 to 132.2 t km(-2) yr(-1))) was very high when compared to other Svalbard valley glaciers suggesting that the high rate of chemical denudation was mostly caused by the high rates of discharge and ablation. Chemical weathering intensities (876 and 964 meq m(-3) yr(-1)) exceeded previously reported intensities in Svalbard. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the effect of soil moisture deficit on the restriction of evaporation from bare soil surfaces, the process of evaporation in dry soil was investigated from field observations at a fallow site and a sand dune site. Analysis of the surface energy balance showed that soil drying affects not only the inter-diurnal variation of energy fluxes, but also their diurnal variation. In addition, the relationship between the surface resistance (r(s)) and soil water content (theta) of surface soil was found to be different between inter-diurnal and diurnal time scales. Stable isotopic analysis of soil water showed that liquid water transport from deeper soil layers stops at the bottom boundary of the dry surface layer (DSL) and that vapor water transport is dominant in the DSL. In addition, diurnal variations in water content and soil air humidity suggest that evaporation and condensation occurs alternatively within the DSL with diurnal cycle due to cyclic change in solar radiation and soil temperature. From these observational results, a conceptual model of the dynamics of the evaporation zone in dry sandy soils is presented. In the model, the evaporation zone consists of two sub-zones: a narrow sub-zone around the bottom boundary of the DSL, and a relatively wide sub-zone within the DSL. The former is active through a day and moves vertically with the development/reduction of the DSL at both diurnal and inter-diurnal time scales. The latter acts as evaporation zone only in the morning and acts as condensation zone in the late afternoon and at night. The dynamic behavior of the evaporation zone and those related to the form of water content profile can explain the difference in the r(s)-theta relationship between inter-diurnal and diurnal time scales.

AB The paper conceptualises new environmental derivatives, water options, which can be used as an important leverage to facilitate the growing Australian water market. A model of water option pricing has been developed. This model is based on the theory of stochastic processes with jumps. The developed model is justified by analysis of real price dynamics in water market in northern Victoria, Australia. The price of European call options is modelled as a Brownian motion and compound Poisson process. The numerical simulation for modelled water and option prices is obtained for a set of predefined jumps and hypothetical water price. Potential impacts of the introduction of water options on irrigators and the water market are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Transpiration (Tr) is influenced by environmental factors, vegetation properties, and anthropogenic management. The effect of environmental factors on Tr are taking place from two aspects: evaporative demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration, PET) and water supply (i.e., soil water). Soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Investigating the relationship between Tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change. Although the relationships of soil water and Tr have been widely studied, the independent effects of soil water on Tr are difficult to separate because soil water and PET occur concurrently under natural conditions. This study carried out field observations of sapflow density, meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust (Roblin:a pseudoacacia) plantation in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. This information was used to develop a model integrating the daily PET and relative extractable soil water (REW, an index that represents the available soil water): Tr = (0.27 x PET - 0.02 x PET2 - 0.32) x (1 - e(-5.70 x) (REW)). The model fitted the measured data well (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 0.06 mm day(-1)). We found that the daily Tr increased as the REW increased under varying PET levels. Additionally, the independent effects of soil water on Tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method. The REW was manipulated and PET varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the REW on Tr. The results showed that Tr increased with the REW during the study period at a rate of 0.53 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW when the REW < 0.4 and 0.09 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW beyond the threshold (REW = 0.4). Tr increased by 27.3 mm (43.7%) compared to the controlled Tr (observed PET and lowest REW) due to the effects of increasing REW (ranging from 0.14 similar to 0.81) during the study period (growing seasons of 2015 and 2016). Furthermore, canopy-level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted Penman-Monteith equation. The reference canopy-level stomatal conductance (Gsref), which represents the Gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water, showed an increasing response with increasing REW, which is the possible reason for the Tr dynamics with the REW. Our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water-Tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use. Although the method required abundant field observation data, we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest Tr.

AB The Macquarie Marshes is an intermittently flooded wetland complex covering nearly 200,000 ha. It is one of the largest semi-permanent wetland systems in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, and portions of the Marshes are listed as internationally important under the Ramsar Convention. Previous studies indicate that the Marshes have undergone accelerated ecological degradation since the 1980s. The ecological degradation is documented in declining biodiversity, encroaching of terrestrial species, colonisation of exotic species, and deterioration of floodplain forests. There is strong evidence that reduction in river flows is the principal cause of the decrease in ecological values. Although the streams are relatively well gauged and modelled, the lack of hydrological records within the Marshes hampers any attempts to quantitatively investigate the relationship between hydrological variation and ecosystem integrity.
   To enable a better understanding of the long-term hydrological variations within the key wetland systems, and in particular, to investigate the impacts of the different water management policies (e.g. environmental water) on wetlands, a river system model including the main wetland systems was needed. The morphological complex nature of the Marshes means that the approximation of hydrological regimes within wetlands using stream hydrographs would have been difficult and inaccurate. In this study, we built a coupled 1D/2D MIKE FLOOD floodplain hydrodynamic model based on a I m OEM derived from a LiDAR survey. Hydrological characteristics of key constituent wetlands such as the correlation between water level and inundation area, relationships between stream and wetlands and among wetlands were estimated using time series extracted from hydrodynamic simulations. These relationships were then introduced into the existing river hydrological model (IQQM) to represent the wetlands.
   The model was used in this study to simulate the daily behaviours of inflow/outflow, volume, and inundated area for key wetlands within the Marshes under natural conditions and recent water management practices for the period of July 1 1991 to June 30 2009. The results revealed that the recent water management practices have induced large changes to wetland hydrology. The most noticeable changes include the dramatic reductions in high flows (i.e. flows with less than 25% exceedence, reduction ranges from 85% to 98% of the high flow peak depending on the location), areal inundation extent (ranging from 13% to 79% depending on climatic conditions), and flow rising/falling rates (over 90% for high flows). Our analysis also highlighted that the impacts of water management practices on some of the flow variables for wetland habitats contrasted with those for instream habitats. For example, we did not find any evident alterations in the low flows (i.e. 75% exceedence) attributable to water management. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The validity of load estimates from intermittent, instantaneous grab sampling is dependent on adequate spatial coverage by monitoring networks and a sampling frequency that reflects the variability in the system under study. Catchments with a flashy hydrology due to surface runoff pose a particular challenge as intense short duration rainfall events may account for a significant portion of the total diffuse transfer of pollution from soil to water in any hydrological year. This can also be exacerbated by the presence of strong background pollution signals from point sources during low flows.
   In this paper, a range of sampling methodologies and load estimation techniques are applied to phosphorus data from such a surface water dominated river system, instrumented at three sub-catchments (ranging from 3 to 5 km(2) in area) with near-continuous monitoring stations. Systematic and Monte Carlo approaches were applied to simulate grab sampling using multiple strategies and to calculate an estimated load, Le based on established load estimation methods. Comparison with the actual load, 1, revealed significant average underestimation, of up to 60%, and high variability for all feasible sampling approaches.
   Further analysis of the time series provides an insight into these observations; revealing peak frequencies and power-law scaling in the distributions of P concentration, discharge and load associated with surface runoff and background transfers. Results indicate that only near-continuous monitoring that reflects the rapid temporal changes in these river systems is adequate for comparative monitoring and evaluation purposes. While the implications of this analysis may be more tenable to small scale flashy systems, this represents an appropriate scale in terms of evaluating catchment mitigation strategies such as agri-environmental policies for managing diffuse P transfers in complex landscapes.

AB The aim of this study is to derive operation rules for small reservoirs during dry events. The approach is illustrated by the case study of Ghezala Dam, located in the north of Tunisia. The following data were available: daily rainfall for the period from 1968 to 2005 and hydrological data from 1985 to 2002. As a first step, events of dry periods were analysed, according to a predetermined threshold. A dry event was considered to consist of a series of dry days separated by rainfall events, each defined as an uninterrupted series of rainfall days comprising at least one day with precipitation exceeding a threshold of 4 mm. A specific procedure was followed to generate synthetic sequences of dry and wet events, of lengths corresponding to a hydrological year. These data were routed through a simple rainfall-runoff model to obtain synthetic stream-flow series. Each generated data set was subject to deterministic optimization using incremental dynamic programming (IDP). Operation rules were derived by means of multiple regression analysis, and appeared to perform most satisfactorily for different predetermined levels of available reservoir storage. The practical utility of these rules is demonstrated for simulated dry, intermediate and wet years, respectively.

AB Accurate characterization of water fluxes in the streambed where surface water-ground water (SW-GW) interacts is essential to evaluate the fate and transport of a contaminant plume and to investigate aquatic ecosystems in aquifers connected to rivers or streams. Vertical streambed water fluxes were characterized on multiple spatial scales using temperature-depth profiles and head data measured in a reach of Munsan stream, Paju-si, South Korea. This study applied an exponential model and type curves to determine water fluxes on a large scale of aquifer thickness including a streambed (=15 m) under the assumption of steady state heat transport. On a small scale of the streambed (=0.3 m) Darcy's law was used to calculate water fluxes through the streambed. The results showed that regional ground water discharges occurred to the stream through the streambed over the reach considered in both August, 2008 and January, 2009 while significant spatial variability in vertical streambed fluxes was found for the streambed of 0.3 m in thickness due to heterogeneities in streambed hydraulic conductivity, variations in stream discharge, and hydraulic gradients in the streambed. Therefore, it is concluded that vertical water fluxes in the streambed of the site are affected by regional ground water flow moving from a deep aquifer to stream and by local small-scale upward or downward hyporheic flow simultaneously. From seepage flux estimates and electrical conductivity (EC) data of water samples, the origins of water in the streambed were inferred. It suggested that SW-GW mixing zones were present at 0.3 m deep or probably even deeper streambeds at S3-S5 located in mid- to downstream at the site. Results have significant implications on effective water resources managements and aquatic habitat investigations in ground water dependent ecosystems of the site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The analysis of the interactions between hydrologic processes and green roof installations in the urban environment requires to improve the understanding of the unsaturated water flow in the coarse-grained porous media usually employed in such technological solutions. In order to base our research on experimental evidences, a monitoring program was carried out at the green roof experimental site of the University of Genoa (Italy). A continuous acquisition system is available at the experimental site for rainfall intensity and subsurface water flow measurements at 1 min resolution. Soil water content is also measured at the same resolution in time by four TDR probes located along a vertical profile. The SWMS_2D model, based on Richards' law and the Van Genuchten-Mualem functions, is here applied to simulate the variably saturated flow within the green roof system. The model was calibrated and validated using rainfall-runoff events observed at the experimental site. The calibration and validation strategy involved comparing predicted and measured outflow hydrographs. The model adequately reproduces the hydrographs, as demonstrated by the limited relative percentage deviations obtained for the total discharged volume, the peak flow and the hydrograph centroid. Furthermore the predicted water content closely matches the observed one at various depths along the vertical profile where measurements are available, thus confirming that the model correctly describes the variably saturated flow field within the green roof. The mechanistic model, based on a single porosity approach, here employed to describe the variably saturated flow within the thin stratigraphy, is demonstrated to suitably describe the hydrologic performance of a green roof, which is typically realized with high hydraulic conductivity and coarse-grained porous media.

AB In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we replied to the comment on our published article "Numerical study on pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements" (Zhang et al., 2018). First, we solved the problem about inappropriate descriptions to the cited papers and some errors in equations. Second, we explained the relationship between fluid cell size in CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and particle size in DEM (discrete element method) in our CFD-DEM model, and we verified the reliability and accuracy of our CFD-DEM model using single-particle sedimentation case. It demonstrated that the CFD-DEM method used in our study was acceptable.

AB The change of groundwater levels after the 2016 M-w 7.0 Kumamoto crustal earthquake was evaluated using a simple conceptual hydrological model in an attempt to show the presence, intensity, and probable mechanism of water level rise observed in Kumamoto where a comprehensive observation-well network exists. A tank model was applied to verify 16 wells in the study field. In the model groundwater levels were first calibrated for the periods in ca. 2 years before the main shock using several hydrological parameters including precipitation, evapotranspiration, water recharge and discharge, and artificial recharge by irrigation. Water levels were then simulated by extrapolating this law of water fluctuating patterns for ca. 2.5 years after the main shock of the earthquake, without considering hydrogeological changes due to the earthquake. A difference in groundwater levels between observation and simulation results yields a degree of coseismic water level rises for each well. The coseismic abnormal water level increase was calculated to be similar to 11 m in 4-5 month after the main shock and was most significantly on the western slope of the Aso caldera rim mountains. The spatial distribution of the coseismic water increases clarified that the most dominate increasing anomalies prevail at mountain feet surrounding the plains, suggesting the occurrence of coseismic mountain water release resulting in the rise of water levels in downslope aquifers. Identified coseismic water level increases still continue up to 2.5 years after the earthquake, probably because changes in hydrogeological properties in mountain aquifers, i.e., permeability, are still sustained. Our forecasting water recovering trends require ca. 3.5-5 year after the earthquake for complete recovery to the original conditions. We demonstrated that our approaches are capable of describing coseismic water level changes and could potentially be applied to other fields.

AB Groundwater resources in the Tadla basin stem from surface water recharge and different groundwater inflows, forming a multilayered aquifer system, which hosts one of Morocco's most important groundwater reservoirs. The hydrodynamic infrastructure; i.e. the relationship between all regional aquifers, recharge, and the residence time of waters poses a serious challenge for current water management and future exploitation in aiming for a long-term sustainable utilization. A combined hydrogeologic and isotopic investigation using hydrochemical and isotopic tracers such as O-18, H-2, H-3, C-13 and C-14 was carried out in order to determine the sources of water recharge to the aquifers, the groundwater flow system, and the residence time of these waters. More than one hundred point measurements throughout the Study area in varying wells, boreholes, springs and rivers were investigated. Chemical compositions of the groundwater indicate an important influence by the host carbonate rocks from each of the Tadla aquifers. Stable isotope results indicate the existence of two groups of groundwater corresponding to the unconfined aquifer in the north and the confined aquifer in the south. The delta O-18, delta H-2, H-3, and C-14 data indicate that the High Atlas Mountains in the south and east of the basin, which are characterized by high rainfall and low delta O-18 and delta H-2 values, are currently the major source of recharge for the Tadla aquifers. A significant recharge zone lies in the northern part of the basin where all the aquifers outcrop. The confined zones show depleted O-18 values, corresponding to the signature of recharge water from the Atlas Mountains. Moreover, all isotope data demonstrated clearly that the Tassaout springs, which are located in the southwest of the basin and were previously interpreted as representing natural outlet of the deep aquifers, are comprised of young waters with depleted O-18 and H-2 signatures, suggesting a high altitude recharge from the Atlas Mountain. In contrast, the unconfined parts of the aquifers show higher values of delta O-18, indicating an evaporation phenomenon, which occurs during infiltration or recharge from irrigation. The mixing process of old and recent waters is confirmed by C-14 and H-3. The isotopic data also indicates probable interaction and flow between the different aquifers. The isotopic and hydrochemical data is therefore essential in confirming possible mixing relationships between aquifers whereas traditional hydraulic data is not capable to provide a quantitative assessment of these relationships. The data generated in this study will certainly encourage the revision and improvement of the current hydrological water resources model for the Tadla basin. The results provide a framework for development of a comprehensive management plan in which water exploitation shifts towards areas with modern recharge and where young and high quality groundwater is found.

AB A major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water, food, and energy sectors and the resulting economic, social, and environmental consequences. Focusing on the challenges in one sector (e.g. water shortage in the water sector) and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems; rather, it will create a new problem (the decline of food production) in the food sectors. The nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water, food, and energy sectors by considering the sectors' policies to achieve sustainable development. The present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the Yazd-Ardakan aquifer, Yazd province, Iran. For this purpose, 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public, private, semi-private and non-governmental organizations. Three types of interactions (knowledge and information exchange, budget transfer, and collaboration) were analyzed among the actors. The actor-network was, then, assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors. Then, a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level, and the power analysis was carried out using in-degree, out-degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level. Social network analysis criteria were, then, incorporated with the multi-criteria decision-making model ELECTRE I to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network. Next, the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis. According to the results, the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium. Most of the power lies with the public sector. The water, food, and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another.

AB Analogue methods provide a statistical precipitation prediction based on synoptic predictors supplied by general circulation models or numerical weather prediction models. The method samples a selection of days in the archives that are similar to the target day to be predicted, and consider their set of corresponding observed precipitation (the predictand) as the conditional distribution for the target day. The relationship between the predictors and predictands relies on some parameters that characterize how and where the similarity between two atmospheric situations is defined.
   This relationship is usually established by a semi-automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations: (i) it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows (hour of the day) for a given meteorological variable, (ii) it cannot handle dependencies between parameters, and (iii) it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom. In this work, a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically.
   The global optimization was applied to some variants of the analogue method for the Rhone catchment in the Swiss Alps. The performance scores increased compared to reference methods, especially for days with high precipitation totals. The resulting parameters were found to be relevant and coherent between the different subregions of the catchment. Moreover, they were obtained automatically and objectively, which reduces the effort that needs to be invested in exploration attempts when adapting the method to a new region or for a new predictand. For example, it obviates the need to assess a large number of combinations of pressure levels and temporal windows of predictor variables that were manually selected beforehand. The optimization could also take into account parameter inter-dependencies. In addition, the approach allowed for new degrees of freedom, such as a possible weighting between pressure levels, and non-overlapping spatial windows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although the hydrological effects of land use change have been studied extensively, only few datasets are available to accurately describe, model, and predict detailed changes in spatiotemporal patterns of hydrological fluxes and states due to land use change. The Wustebach catchment within the TERENO (TERrestrial Environmental Observatories) network in Germany provides a unique monitoring setup to measure the major components of the water balance (evapotranspiration, discharge, precipitation) and the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture before and after a partial deforestation. Here, we present five years of measured hydrological data, including all major water budget components three years before and two years after a partial deforestation. A data-driven approach was used to understand changes and related feedback mechanisms in spatiotemporal hydrological response patterns. As expected from earlier studies, the partial deforestation caused a decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in discharge. A closer look at the high resolution datasets revealed new insights in the intra-annual variability and relationship between the water balance components. The overall decrease in evapotranspiration caused a large increase in soil water storage in the deforested region, especially during the summer period, which in turn caused an increase in the frequency of high discharge in the same period. Although the evapotranspiration in the forested region was larger on average, the deforested region showed a higher evapotranspiration during part of the summer period. This could be related to wetter conditions in the deforested area, accompanied with the emergence of grass vegetation. At the same time, wetter soil moisture conditions in the deforested area increased the spatial variance of soil moisture in the summer and therewith altered the relationship between spatial mean and variance. Altogether, this study illustrates that detailed spatiotemporal monitoring can provide new insights into the hydrological effects of partial deforestation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Success in the use of computer models for simulating environmental variables and processes requires objective model calibration and verification procedures. Several methods for quantifying the goodness-of-fit of observations against model-calculated values have been proposed but none of them is free of limitations and are often ambiguous. When a single indicator is used it may lead to incorrect verification of the model. Instead, a combination of graphical results, absolute value error statistics (i.e. root mean square error), and normalized goodness-of-fit statistics (i.e. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, NSE) is currently recommended. Interpretation of NSE values is often subjective, and may be biased by the magnitude and number of data points, data outliers and repeated data. The statistical significance of the performance statistics is an aspect generally ignored that helps in reducing subjectivity in the proper interpretation of the model performance. In this work, approximated probability distributions for two common indicators (NSE and root mean square error) are derived with bootstrapping (block bootstrapping when dealing with time series), followed by bias corrected and accelerated calculation of confidence intervals. Hypothesis testing of the indicators exceeding threshold values is proposed in a unified framework for statistically accepting or rejecting the model performance. It is illustrated how model performance is not linearly related with NSE, which is critical for its proper interpretation. Additionally, the sensitivity of the indicators to model bias, outliers and repeated data is evaluated. The potential of the difference between root mean square error and mean absolute error for detecting outliers is explored, showing that this may be considered a necessary but not a sufficient condition of outlier presence. The usefulness of the approach for the evaluation of model performance is illustrated with case studies including those with similar goodness-of-fit indicators but distinct statistical interpretation, and others to analyze the effects of outliers, model bias and repeated data. This work does not intend to dictate rules on model goodness-of-fit assessment. It aims to provide modelers with improved, less subjective and practical model evaluation guidance and tools.

DE Direct-push permeameter; Hydraulic conductivity; Numerical simulation;
   High-resolution profiling; Site characterization
ID SOLUTE TRANSPORT; CONDUCTIVITY
AB The characterization of hydraulic conductivity (K) variations in heterogeneous aquifers has proven to be a significant challenge. Recent field and numerical assessments, however, have demonstrated the considerable potential of direct-push profiling for characterization of vertical K variations at the resolution needed for contaminant site investigations. The direct-push permeameter (DPP), in particular, has been found to be an effective characterization tool (0.4-m resolution in current configuration) over the K range expected in aquifers. The potential of this tool is explored further here through numerical simulations to assess the probe configuration and the analysis approach that are most appropriate for profiling in highly permeable heterogeneous systems. A probe configuration with transducers placed between 0.1 and 0.4 m from the injection screen appears to be most suitable for general field applications, as it can yield a reasonable resolution (few decimeters) in the presence of a typical level of sensor noise. DPP data are commonly analyzed using the spherical form of Darcy's Law. Although this approach will provide reliable K estimates in many situations, it can introduce error in the presence of thin (relative to the distance between injection screen and transducers) layers of vastly differing K. Simultaneous numerical inversion (under steady-shape conditions) of all DPP tests in a profile can yield improved results if information about aquifer structure is available. DPP K estimates have little sensitivity to the zone of compaction created during probe advancement, but estimates are sensitive to channeling along the probe surface. Proper probe design (probe shape and position of transducers) and test procedures (low injection rates) can reduce the potential for and impact of such channeling. These points are demonstrated using K data from an outcrop study in which K varies by orders of magnitude on the scale of a few decimeters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We diagnose the manner with which rainfall input and parametric uncertainty influence the character of the flow simulation uncertainty in a validated distributed hydrologic model. An extensive Monte Carlo numerical experiment was undertaken for several study watersheds in the southern Central Plains of the United States. It examined the sensitivity of ensemble flow simulations produced by the distributed model HRCDHM to uncertainty in parametric and radar rainfall input. The watersheds are associated with the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP) organized by the US National Weather Service Office of Hydrologic Development. The model validated well in DMIP both for watershed outlets and interior points on various scales with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.6-0.9 for hourly flow simulations [J. Hydrol. (2004) 14504, this issue], and we expect that the qualitative nature of the results of this study are of greater applicability than for this model alone. The uncertainty scenarios included: parametric uncertainty involving multiple soil model parameters simultaneously, routing model parameter uncertainty, rainfall uncertainty under two different error distributions, and combined uncertainty in both parameters and input. The flow sensitivities are summarized in terms of a relative measure of the dispersion in the flow ensembles computed for each event, and for several watershed locations consisting of the watershed outlet and additional interior locations. The results consistently show that the flow simulation uncertainty is strongly dependent on catchment scale for all cases of prescribed parametric and radar-rainfall input uncertainty. Simulation uncertainty is significantly reduced for larger scales of distributed model resolution. The consistency of this result across the selected watershed locations allows for the development of scaling relationships between catchment size and the flow uncertainty measure. The derived scaling relationship may be used to infer pronounced small-scale simulation uncertainties in distributed hydrologic model applications. Several fruitful future research directions are identified including the incorporation of model structure uncertainty in the analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A large part of total solid flux is transported as suspension in mountainous rivers. It is crucial for water resource management and for environmental issues to be able to model and to understand these fluxes. However, suspended load is known to be highly variable in time and space, as fine sediments can originate from various erosion processes and from various sources. Among the different methodologies available for analyzing the suspended sediment flux dynamics, hysteretic loops in discharge and suspended load signals are commonly used to assess sediment sources and production processes. However, the shape of these loops is often analyzed qualitatively for a single or a small number of catchments. Hence it is still unclear how the geomorphological catchment properties influence the variability of the flow rate - suspended sediment concentration relationship through the hysteresis effects. This is particularly true in mountainous catchments where important sources of fine sediments may originate from the river bed in addition to hillslopes.
   In this study we analyzed quantitatively ten long-term series of high-frequency observations of suspended sediment load measured in contrasted alpine catchments. Hysteresis effects were analyzed in a high number of automated sampled events and the dominant response for each catchment was sought. This was done by using a normalized hysteresis index developed by Lloyd et al. (2016), which we weighted by the mass transported during each event. The various catchments were characterized with a normalized geomorphological index expressing the relative importance of sediment sources originating from the river bed or from eroded areas as a function of the distance to the outlet of the catchment.
   The dominant hysteresis response of the ten alpine catchments studied was found to be greatly linked to their geomorphological index. These results suggest that the sediment source configuration upstream of a measuring station drives hysteresis effects and thus the variability of the flow rate-suspended sediment concentration relationship.

AB The identification of factors affecting the first flush phenomenon is important for the control of urban nonpoint source pollution. This study developed machine learning algorithms, the regression tree (RT) and random forest (RF) algorithms, to predict the mass first flush ratio (MFFn) from seven rainfall-related variables. We also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction. The RF algorithm outperformed the RT algorithm in terms of Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. In general, the target variables simulated using the RF algorithm had lower AIC values than did those of the RT algorithm, except for T-N and T-P. The RF algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the MFF10 to MFF20 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.67 and 0.52), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.71; NSE = 0.66 and 0.62), total organic carbon (TOC) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.63; NSE = 0.56 and 0.57), and total phosphorus (T-P) (R-2 = 0.72 and 0.71; NSE = 0.68 and 0.58). Suspended solids (SS) predicted by the RF algorithm showed an acceptable value for R-2 (0.68 and 0.64) but a low NSE for the MFF20 (NSE = 0.48). However, the prediction of MFF30 was unacceptable for all target variables. The rainfall-related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the MFFn prediction. Results also showed that SOD and COD were closely associated with rainfall intensity (RI). TOC and T-P showed strong relationships with RI and antecedent rainfall (AR). SS was closely related to RI and rainfall duration (R-dur). T-N showed strong relationships with R-dur, respectively. This study demonstrated that the RF algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the MFF10 and MFF20 of BOD, COD, TOC, and T-P on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments.

AB The aim of the study is to establish an hydrogeological scheme of the structure and the functioning of andesitic volcanic systems in the insular and humid tropical context. A watershed has been instrumented at Fefe in Guadeloupe (French West Indies) in the Lesser Antilles to measure rainfall, runoff and piezometric fluctuations between 2003 and 2006. Given the heterogeneity of the volcanic deposits, a multidisciplinary approach has been used: a geological and an hydrogeological survey, an hydrodynamic approach (hydraulic tests and signal processing of hydrological time series), and finally, an hydrogeochemical approach (major elements and some trace elements). Two main superposed aquifer respectively in aerial deposits, and in recent nuees ardentes (glowing ash) and lava flows, as well as the underlying aquiclude (the highly weathered older substratum) were identified. At a local scale, some hydrogeological heterogeneities internal to the aquifers were highlighted and related to a polyphased building-up of the geological formations. Hydraulic relationships between the multi-layered aquifers, such as the confinement of the deep aquifer upstream of the basin, were identified. Groundwater/stream exchanges were characterised, detailing various contributions of the shallow and the deep aquifers to stream and spring waters; significant river losses were also observed. At a global scale, within such relatively permeable volcanic formations, the aquifer recharge is about 85% of the annual effective rainfall for an average rainfall year. The hydrogeological scheme appears to be coherent with a geological structure of cut-and-fill paleovalleys frequently observed in andesitic areas. Consequently, groundwater drainage axis are mainly localised in recent nuees ardentes deposits, whereas the inversion of relief characteristic of volcanic areas explains the non-superposition of surface water and groundwater divides and both surface water losses and springs. Finally, this work shows the highly heterogeneous hydrogeological processes occurring in volcanic formations of andesitic-type. It also shows the relationships between the geological structure and the hydrogeological functioning of such basins, and proposes an affordable methodological approach to investigate such a hydrogeological context in depth.

However, independently, considerable differences between radar ARF and gauge ARF exist. Radar ARF decays at a faster rate (with increasing area) than gauge ARF. For a basin size of 20,000 km(2), the percent difference between radar ARF and gauge ARF ranges from 11 to 32%. This implies that radar-derived estimates of extreme point precipitation are disproportionately larger than radar-derived estimates of extreme areal precipitation, as compared to the corresponding relationship based on rain gauges.
   Between-station variance of same-day extreme precipitation, as well as the coefficient of variation tends to be larger for the radar-derived areal extreme events, favoring a smaller radar areal precipitation. Smaller radar ARF is also favored because, on average, a higher percentage of gauges have coincident annual maxima than do the radar pixels that correspond to these gauges. Radar ARF curves computed based on gauge-calibrated radar data decay at an even faster rate than the unadjusted radar ARE The accuracy of the calibrated radar data for these extreme events is suspect, however.
   Areal precipitation amounts for the 2-, 5- and 10-year return period were computed by fitting an extreme value distribution to the. areal radar. (and separately gauge), maxima from 5 years of available data. In one study area, the radar estimates tend to exceed those based on the gauge, whereas in a different region the gauge estimates tend to exceed those based on the radar. These results emphasize that a smaller radar ARF does not necessarily imply a lower radar mean areal precipitation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dependence of the runoff coefficient (RC) on basin size has been recognized since decades as a big challenge. However, how such region-specific scale effect varies with basin properties still remains poorly understood. This seriously limits the ability of runoff prediction in ungauged watersheds with different environments and the integrated management of watershed under climate change and land use/cover change. In this study, the scaling relationships of annual RC and its variations with basin properties were quantified based on annual precipitation and runoff data series in twenty-five sub-basins belonging to two large basins on the Loess Plateau, Northwest China. The scaling behavior of RC was found to be significant, and the mean annual RC range significantly decreased as basin size increase. And this decrease of mean annual RC was faster in areas with thin loess cover than that in areas with thick loess cover. Area thresholds, beyond which the mean RC was no longer sensitive to basin size change, were observed for the scaling behavior of annual RC and it was approximately 10,000 km(2) in thick loess areas and 25,000 km(2) in thin loess areas. This indicated that the effects of basin properties on RC scaling behavior was related with scales. Soil thickness might be one of the key basin properties that determined the scaling behavior. An exponential regression equation (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.01) was built for the annual runoff (R) according to the corresponding geomorphic area (a(n)) and annual precipitation (P) for basins with multiple geomorphic types (n). The results imply that the basin properties not only control the form of the scaling relationships of annual RC but also limit its variations under different geomorphic conditions. These findings may help us assess and manage water resources at the basin scale more accurately.

AB A regression-model based approach is a commonly used, efficient method for estimating streamwater constituent load when there is a relationship between streamwater constituent concentration and continuous variables such as streamwater discharge, season and time. A subsetting experiment using a 30-year dataset of daily suspended sediment observations from the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois, was performed to determine optimal sampling frequency, model calibration period length, and regression model methodology, as well as to determine the effect of serial correlation of model residuals on load estimate precision. Two regression-based methods were used to estimate streamwater loads, the Adjusted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (AMLE), and the composite method, a hybrid load estimation approach. While both methods accurately and precisely estimated loads at the model's calibration period time scale, precisions were progressively worse at shorter reporting periods, from annually to monthly. Serial correlation in model residuals resulted in observed AMLE precision to be significantly worse than the model calculated standard errors of prediction. The composite method effectively improved upon AMLE loads for shorter reporting periods, but required a sampling interval of at least 15-days or shorter, when the serial correlations in the observed load residuals were greater than 0.15. AMLE precision was better at shorter sampling intervals and when using the shortest model calibration periods, such that the regression models better fit the temporal changes in the concentration-discharge relationship. The models with the largest errors typically had poor high flow sampling coverage resulting in unrepresentative models. Increasing sampling frequency and/or targeted high flow sampling are more efficient approaches to ensure sufficient sampling and to avoid poorly performing models, than increasing calibration period length.

AB Traditional Budyko analysis is predicated on the assumption that the watershed of interest is in dynamic equilibrium over the period of study, and thus surface water partitioning will not be influenced by changes in storage. However, previous work has demonstrated that groundwatersurface water interactions will shift Budyko relationships. While modified Budyko approaches have been proposed to account for storage changes, given the limited ability to quantify groundwater fluxes and storage across spatial scales, additional research is needed to understand the implications of these approximations. This study evaluates the impact of storage changes on Budyko relationships given three common approaches to estimating evapotranspiration fractions: (1) determining evapotranspiration from observations, (2) calculating evapotranspiration from precipitation and surface water outflow, and (3) adjusting precipitation to account for storage changes. We show conceptually that groundwater storage changes will shift the Budyko relationship differently depending on the way evapotranspiration is estimated. A 1-year transient simulation is used to mimic all three approaches within a numerical framework in which groundwater-surface water exchanges are prevalent and can be fully quantified. The model domain spans the majority of the continental US and encompasses 25 000 nested watersheds ranging in size from 100 km(2) to over 3 000 000 km(2). Model results illustrate that storage changes can generate different spatial patterns in Budyko relationships depending on the approach used. This shows the potential for systematic bias when comparing studies that use different approaches to estimating evapotranspiration. Comparisons between watersheds are also relevant for studies that seek to characterizevariability in the Budyko space using other watershed characteristics. Our results demonstrate that within large complex domains the correlation between storage changes and other relevant watershed properties, such as aridity, makes it difficult to easily isolate storage changes as an independent predictor of behavior. However, we suggest that, using the conceptual models presented here, comparative studies could still easily evaluate a range of spatially heterogeneous storage changes by perturbing individual points to better incorporate uncertain storage changes into analysis.

AB With recent developments in computational techniques, Data-driven Machine Learning Models (DMLs) have shown great potential in simulating streamflow and capturing the rainfall-runoff relationship in given watersheds, which are traditionally fulfilled by Process-based Hydrologic Models (PHMs). There are debates on whether the DMLs can outperform and possibly replace the classical PHMs for streamflow simulation and river forecasting, but no clear conclusions have been made. This study aims to investigate whether the newer DMLs have any potential in further improving the simulation accuracy of classical PHMs, and vice versa. To do this, we compared a few popular PHMs and DMLs over four watersheds across the Continental US (CONUS) that are associated with different input, climate, and regional conditions. A total of five hydrologic models were chosen, including (1) two classical lumped models, i.e., the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and Xinanjiang (XAJ); (2) one modern distributed model, termed Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST); (3) and two DMLs including an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a deep learning model, termed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Our results demonstrated that the DMLs still significantly biased when using the baseline input scenario with the PHMs. However, the DMLs fed with delayed input scenarios had great potential and can reach high simulation accuracy. The DMLs, especially the ANN, outperformed other employed models under the rainfall-runoff relationship in which rainfall dominantly drives. The DMLs also showed better performance in the high-flow regime, while the PHMs had a better performance for the low-flow regime, implying both PHMs and DMLs have their own merits and are worthy of joint development. In general, our study indicated a great potential of using DMLs to simulate streamflow, but further studies are still needed to verify the transferability and scalability of DMLs in large-scale experiments, such as the Distributed Model Intercomparison Projects 1&2 conducted by National Weather Services but to compare modern DMLs and PHMs.

AB Hydrologic modeling literature illustrates that daily simulation models are incapable of accurately representing hydrograph timing due to relationships between precipitation and watershed hydrologic response that happen with a sub-daily time step in the real world. For watersheds with a time of concentration less than 24 h and a late day precipitation event, the observed hydrographic response frequently occurs one day after the precipitation peak while the model simulates a same day event. The analysis of sub-daily precipitation and runoff in this study suggests that, this one-day offset is inevitable in daily analysis of the precipitation-runoff relationship when the same 24-h time interval, e.g. the calendar day, is used to prepare daily precipitation and runoff datasets. Under these conditions, daily simulation models will fail to emulate this one-day offset issue (1dOI) and result in significant daily residuals between simulated and measured hydrographs. Results of this study show that the automatic calibration of such daily models will be misled by model performance metrics that are based on the aggregation of daily residuals to a solution that systematically underestimate the peak flow rates while trying to emulate the one-day lags. In this study, a novel algorithm called Shifting Hydrograph In order to Fix Timing (SHIFT) is developed to reduce the impact of this one-day offset issue (1dOI) on the parameter estimation of daily simulation models. Results show that with SHIFT the aforementioned automatic calibration finds a solution that accurately estimates the magnitude of daily peak flow rates and the shape of the rising and falling limbs of the daily hydrograph. Moreover, it is shown that this daily calibrated model performs quite well with an alternative daily precipitation dataset that has a minimal number of 1dOIs, concluding that SHIFT can minimize the impact of 1dOI on parameter estimation of daily simulation models.

AB The highly dynamic nature of preferential flow in time and space makes it challenging to identify and analyze its occurrence at the catchment scale. Novel analysis methods using soil moisture sensor response times offer an opportunity to investigate catchment-wide controls on preferential flow. The aim of this study was to identify factors that control preferential flow occurrence based on 3-year soil moisture monitoring using a wireless sensor network in the Wustebach catchment, Germany. At 101 locations, the sensor response times at three depths (5, 20, and 50 cm) were classified into one of four classes: (1) non-sequential preferential flow, (2) velocity-based preferential flow, (3) sequential flow, and (4) no response. A conceptual model, postulating that preferential flow in the Wustebach catchment is dominated by differences in soil type, landscape position, and rainfall input, was proposed for hypothesis testing. To test the conceptual model, the classification results were combined with spatial and event-based data to understand and identify controlling factors. Spatial parameters consisted of hydrological, topographical, and soil physical and chemical parameters. Temporal factors included precipitation characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The conceptual model as proposed could only be partly confirmed. Event-based occurrence of preferential flow was highly affected by precipitation amount, with a nearly catchment-wide preferential response during large storm events. During intermediate events, preferential flow was controlled by small-scale heterogeneity, instead of showing catchment-wide patterns. The effect of antecedent catchment wetness on the occurrence of preferential flow was generally less profound, although a clear negative relationship was found for precipitation events with more than 25 mm. It was found that spatial occurrence of preferential flow was however governed by small-scale soil and biological features and local processes, and showed no obvious relationship with any of the selected spatial parameters. Overall, the results demonstrate that sensor response time analysis can offer innovative insights into the spatial temporal interrelationship of preferential flow occurrence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to investigate trends in time series of hydrological variables, observational records are generally assumed to be independent (IND) or having short-term persistence (STP), as opposed to long-term persistence (LTP). This study systematically investigates the effect of these assumptions for estimating significance of trends using simulated time series of known STP- and LTP-like serial structures and using observational records of annual, winter and summer 30-day low flows Occurring in pristine rivers basins of Canada. For the analyses, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and two modified versions of this test and a block bootstrap resampling based test is used to estimate significance of temporal trends under the assumptions of IND and STP. A semiparametric and a parametric procedure based on the fractional auto-regressive integrated moving average modeling approach and a MK scaling test are used to estimate significance of temporal trends under the assumption of LTP. The results of the Study suggest that for the majority of the time series of low flows analyzed, the assumption of IND or STP cannot be ruled out. On the contrary. the fluctuating behavior of trends revealed in selected time series of low flows, with longer records, using moving window technique favor the LTP hypothesis. However, only a modest evidence for the presence of LTP in low flow time series using estimates of the Hurst exponent could be revealed, perhaps because of small sample uncertainties. In general, the results of trend investigation suggest that the estimates of trend significance are highly sensitive to IND, STP and LTP assumptions, e.g. adopting IND assumption instead of LTP for a given set of hydrological time series exhibiting LTP, could result in incorrect estimation of trend significance. Also, substituting IND assumption for STP would result in incorrect estimates of trend significance. Therefore, for reliable trend investigation, satisfactory identification of STP- or LTP-like behavior in hydrological time series, which seldom exceed 100 years, is important and challenging and must be given adequate attention in all trend investigation studies.

AB Numerous studies have analyzed how groundwater levels respond to pumping depending on aquifer and well characteristics. This study investigates how, conversely, the pumping capacity of a well depends on hydrogeological and operational conditions. The analysis is based on an analytical solution that considers wellbore storage and skin effects. The solution depends on aquifer transmissivity, aquifer storativity, well radius, well surface casing radius, skin layer transmissivity, pumping duration, and maximum allowable head change. We first conduct a sensitivity analysis of dimensionless pumping capacity to the three dimensionless parameters on which it depends. The results show strongly nonlinear relationships and an important effect of wellbore storage for small dimensionless pumping durations. Since the primary (dimensional) parameters are the ones that one ultimately needs to characterize or engineer in practice, we also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the primary system. The results show that, besides being trivially linearly related with the maximum allowable head change, pumping capacity (defined as a volume) is almost linearly related with aquifer transmissivity and pumping duration. Given the broad natural range of transmissivity values, transmissivity is the most critical parameter to determine for the estimation of pumping capacity. In contrast, pumping capacity is little sensitive to aquifer storativity and well radius, and so the precise determination of these parameters is less critical. Finally, we investigate the relationship between pumping capacity and specific capacity, the latter being a commonly used indicator of the productivity of wells. Our analysis confirms the previously acknowledged limitation of specific capacity for predicting pumping capacity when the duration of the specific capacity test is much smaller than the operational pumping duration. The theoretical insights gained from this study will assist groundwater scientists and engineers in their research, planning, and design activities.

AB Recently the mean residence time (MRT) of water in catchments has been shown to be a useful descriptor of hydrological function and a valuable tool for inter-catchment comparisons. In this paper the conservative tracer chloride and digital soil maps are used to develop simplified approaches to estimating MRTs for 22 montane catchments with areas ranging from 1 km 2 to 293 km(2). The study was based in sub-catchments of the River Dee in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland. Previous work in this geomorphic province used stable isotopes to derive the MRTs of catchments which were found to be predictable from catchment soil characteristics. These relationships formed the basis for developing transferable approaches to estimating MRTs with two simplified methods. First, simple input-output relationships were used as a MRT surrogate based on the ratio of the normalised standard deviation of Cl in streamwater to that of precipitation (MRTCl). Secondly, MRTs were predicted from the percentage coverage of hydrologically responsive soils using catchment soil maps derived from the UK hydrology of soil type (HOST) digital data base (MRTsoil). The two approaches were shown to have broadly comparable results; though the ones derived from Cl data compared better with in dependently-derived estimates from isotopic (MRT delta 18O) data in five of the study catchments. Predictions were also improved by considering only riparian soil cover, presumably because this better represents the connectivity of responsive soils with channel networks or the ability of free-draining soils to damp the tracer response. The derived MRTs were also strongly correlated with mean catchment slope, indicating that in some geographical. locations, topographic maps atone may have utility in predicting residence times in ungauged basins.

AB The widespread use of surveillance cameras has become an emerging means for rainfall observations. With the advantages of high spatial-temporal resolution, rainfall information obtained from surveillance videos is highly suitable for meteorological-related research and has bright prospects. However, due to the complex and variable monitoring scenarios, the quality of the rainfall data estimated by each camera is always inconsistent, resulting in low practical value. Dense ground-level surveillance cameras have temporal and spatial correlations that can be used to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation through mutual verification. In this study, we first introduce camera parameters to refine the spatial volume of rainfall (SVoR)(1) perceived by cameras to improve the accuracy of rainfall intensity (RI) estimation. Next, a novel quality control (QC) model of rainfall estimation with multisurveillance camera collaboration that takes the rainfall observations of all cameras as input is proposed. (i) We build a reliability evaluation (RE) model for the estimation of RI in accordance with raindrop imagery features to provide a reference for the subsequent correction of RI estimation; (ii) inspired by the first law of geography (Tobler, 1970), we then construct a spatial-temporal consistency filter and a situation consistency filter by using the spatial-temporal constraints between cameras to coarsely evaluate the RI values; and (iii) the correlation between cameras is calculated based on the fuzzy method to further build a correlation filter for the fine-grained correction of RI values. Experiments show that our method can effectively eliminate RI outliers and improve the accuracy and reliability of rainfall estimation results. Moreover, our method is highly suitable for heavy and violent rainfall application scenarios and can provide high-resolution rainfall data support for flooding warnings and simulations in urban areas.

AB A regional screening tool-which is useful in cases where few site-specific parameters are available for complex vadose zone models-assesses the leaching potential of pollutants to groundwater over large areas. In this study, the previous pesticide leaching tool used in Hawaii was revised to account for the release of new volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the soil surface. The tool was modified to introduce expanded terms in the traditional pesticide ranking indices (i.e., retardation and attenuation factors), allowing the estimation of the leaching fraction of volatile chemicals based on recharge, soil, and chemical properties to be updated. Results showed that the previous tool significantly overestimated the mass fraction of VOCs leached through soils as the recharge rates increased above 0.001801 m/d. In contrast, the revised tool successfully delineated vulnerable areas to the selected VOCs based on two reference chemicals, a known leacher and non-leacher, which were determined in local conditions. The sensitivity analysis with the Latin-Hypercube-One-factor-At-a-Time method revealed that the new leaching tool was most sensitive to changes in the soil organic carbon sorption coefficient, fractional organic carbon content, and Henry's law constant; and least sensitive to parameters such as the bulk density, water content at field capacity, and particle density in soils. When the revised tool was compared to the analytical (STANMOD) and numerical (HYDRUS-1D) models as a susceptibility measure, it ranked particular VOCs well (e.g., benzene, carbofuran, and toluene) that were consistent with other two models under the given conditions. Therefore, the new leaching tool can be widely used to address intrinsic groundwater vulnerability to contamination of pesticides and VOCs, along with the DRASTIC method or similar Tier 1 models such as SCI-GROW and WIN-PST.

AB In tracer experiments of surface flow constructed wetlands, residence time distributions (RTDs) are generally originated from the normalized concentration data of recovered tracers based on ideal instantaneous tracer release mode. However, this tracer release mode is commonly approximated by finite-continuous tracer release over a relatively short duration. As a result, the accuracy of RTDs and hydraulic indexes cannot be guaranteed if the RTD data and index values were still calculated based on the instantaneous release. To solve this problem, a method for correcting the original RTD data and the index values affected by tracer release duration was proposed. The correction of hydraulic indexes can be performed using analytical formulas, whereas the correction of the RTDs requires an RTD model (such as the gamma distribution and one-dimensional advection-dispersion model) or a smoothing algorithm (such as the simple moving average algorithm) to avoid the increasing effect of random measurement errors caused by the direct use of the RTD correction formulas. The correction method was successfully verified by a specially designed tracer test, and its practical application effect was exemplified. A Monte Carlo test also proved that the RTD correction owed certain robustness to tracer release instability, while the correction of some hydraulic indexes that reflect flow dispersion and comprehensive hydraulic efficiency had inferior robustness. Aside from this, the influence of tracer release duration on RTDs and hydraulic indexes without any correction was analyzed. It was found that the release duration caused the shape of the original RTDs to be more skewed in the positive direction of the x-axis and changed from "thin and high" to "fat and short", while the duration of the release caused the positive relative errors of most indexes, which became more serious with an increase in the duration or worsening hydraulic performance. Based on these influence rules, 0.01 was defined as the threshold of the normalized release duration which needs to correct RTDs and hydraulic indexes, considering that the relative errors between the uncorrected and corrected indexes were less than 5% when the normalized duration was less than this threshold.

AB The spatial scale of soil moisture measurements is often inconsistent with the scale at which soil moisture predictions are needed. Consequently a change of scale (upscaling or downscaling) from the measurements to the predictions or model values is needed. The measurement or model scale can be defined as a scale triplet, consisting of spacing, extent and support. 'Spacing' refers to the distance between samples; 'extent' refers to the overall coverage; and 'support' refers to the area integrated by each sample. The statistical properties that appear in the data, the apparent variance and the apparent correlation length, are as a rule different from their true values because of bias introduced by the measurement scale. In this paper, high-resolution soil moisture data from the 10.5 ha Tarrawarra catchment in south-eastern Australia are analysed to assess this bias quantitatively. For each survey up to 1536 data points in space are used. This allows a change of scale of two orders of magnitude. Apparent variances and apparent correlation lengths are calculated in a resampling analysis. Apparent correlation lengths always increase with increasing spacing, extent or support. The apparent variance increases with increasing extent, decreases with increasing support, and does not change with spacing. All of these sources of bias are a function of the ratio of measurement scale (in terms of spacing, extent and support) and the scale of the natural variability (i.e. the true correlation length or process scale of soil moisture). In a second step this paper examines whether the bias due to spacing, extent and support can be predicted by standard geostatistical techniques of regularisation and variogram analysis. This is done because soil moisture patterns have properties, such as connectivity, that violate the standard assumptions underlying these geostatistical techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to test the robustness of these techniques by application to observed data. The comparison indicates that these techniques are indeed applicable to organised soil moisture fields and that the bias is predicted equally well for organised and random soil moisture patterns. A number of examples are given to demonstrate the implications of these results for hydrologic modelling and sampling design. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The knowledge of hydraulic conductivity and solute transport parameters of topsoil is important in a variety of fields and their measurement has been an interest in both theory and practice. In this paper we present an in situ method to measure the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients of solute movement by modifying the double-ring infiltrometer into a triple-ring infiltrometer. Water flow in the apparatus is controlled in one dimension and solute movement in three dimensions. The solute transport parameters can be measured simultaneously with the hydraulic conductivity. Analytical solutions are derived to describe the solute movement, and field experiment was carried out to calculate the solute parameters in homogeneous soil using a simple method developed based on the analytical solutions. Simulating results using these estimated parameters predict the observed breakthrough curves reasonably well. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eutrophication and subsequent harmful cyanobacteria blooms are global water quality problems, and identifying the key drivers of water eutrophication and estimating nutrient thresholds for it in waterbodies have long been challenges for water quality managers. Data-intensive machine learning models have been shown to be better able to reveal the nonlinear relationships between variables in the study of complex biotic community dynamics than traditional mechanistic models. In this study, we applied random forest models to long-term datasets from nutrient monitoring and meteorological observations to characterize the relationships between algal growth and different environmental drivers in three eutrophic lakes in China. We further attempted to estimate the season-specific nutrient thresholds in these lakes, and assess the potential decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management. In general, chlorophyll a concentrations predicted by the random forest models were consistent with the values observed in the lakes, and successfully displayed the same seasonal variations. The estimated total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) nutrient thresholds were quite variable among months, and were higher in summer than in winter. To maintain chlorophyll a concentrations below 20 mu g/L, the estimated TN thresholds in Lakes Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu in August were 2145 +/- 683, 2372 +/- 918 and 1527 +/- 71 mu g/L (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively, and the corresponding TP thresholds were 82 +/- 24, 149 +/- 22, and 120 +/- 22 mu g/L. The modelling results indicated that it was more important to control the TP concentrations in these lakes than the TN concentrations to control algal growth in summer. In summary, the strong seasonal variation in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggests that a 'one-sizefits-all' nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies. Seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations and environmental drivers should thus be considered when establishing nutrient criteria and setting nutrient control targets.

AB The Tarim River is the largest inland river of China and a major water resource to the vast arid region in northwest China. For its four major headstreams, which contribute 98% of the Tarim River's streamflow, we investigated the dynamics of baseflow in the past 50 years. The digital filtering method was used to separate baseflow from surface flow, after which the baseflow index (BFI) was calculated and analyzed. The major findings of this study include (1) Baseflows of the four headstreams have increased considerably over the past 50 years. The large baseflow index (BFI) usually occurred in the wet years but the change rate was irregular, because of the increasing recharge from snow and glacial meltwater. (2) The annual baseflow variation of the four headstreams appeared to have cycles of 3-5 years, 10-14 years, and 25 years. (3) The baseflow and BFI showed obvious seasonal variation: The lowest baseflow and BFI typically occurred in December and January, and both increased gradually until the maximums reached in August or July. (4) The responses of runoff and baseflow to climatic factors were different. Precipitation possessed a great impact on runoff, whereas temperature possessed a great impact on baseflow. Baseflow is an important source to the Tarim River, and is affected by the increasing snow and glaciers melt as a result of temperature rise. For the four headstreams, we identified temperature thresholds in the time series of BFI and calculated regression relationships between temperature and BFI in the past 50 years. The thresholds and the regression relationships would help to assess and predict the impact of climate change on headwater inflow to the Tarim River. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the simulation of a succession of annual hydro-periods describing water table variations in a British floodplain wetland, Narborough Bog. This is achieved through the application of a model, developed using MODFLOW, which requires inputs of weekly precipitation, evapotranspiration and river stage. The model reproduces the observed temporal variation in the wetland water tables illustrating the range in water table conditions experienced by the wetland, their relationship to hydrometeorological conditions, and the seasonal and annual variability in the wetland water budget. The model also estimates defuse water fluxes such as seepage flows to and from the adjacent river. The model simulations demonstrate the importance of successful representation of the stratigraphy of alluvial and organic deposits within the wetland. Model performance is evaluated for 2 years: 1991 and 1992 during a period of field instrumentation. The model is then used to reproduce the wetland hydroperiod for further 6 years: 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1987 and 1988 when local data for precipitatio, evapotranspiration and river stage are available. The results indicate how the wetland responds to a combination of hydrological events and emphasise the importance of percipitation-both weekly totals and its annual distribution. The model simulations reveal the importance of the water storage function of the wetland and indicate the varying relationship of the wetland to the lowland river: at low flows the river represents a base level to which the wetland water table grades. Conversely, for small periods of time wetland water tables are elevated by the effects of marginal silt-clay levee adjacent to the riverbank. Conditions of influent seepage from river to wetland were experienced only on isolated occasions. Such results demonstrate the benefits of floodplain wetlands in moderating extremes of river flow and demonstrating the need for rivers and floodplain wetland to remain closely integrated.

AB During rain there can be substantial redistribution of water at the surface of sandy soils in the Sudano-Sahelian zone, because of localised runoff and runon. This results in variable infiltration over a field. Measurements of spatial variability in infiltration and crop growth were made in a millet field at the southern supersite of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment in Niger. Infiltration was calculated from the change in sail water storage measured using a neutron probe at up to 33 locations, before and after rain storms exceeding 10 mm. Data were obtained for five storms in 1993 and 1994, Infiltration varied from 0.3 to 3.4 times the recorded rainfall, though more than 80% of the locations had infiltration between 0.6 and 1.2 times the recorded rainfall. There was some consistency between storms, with locations at the extremes of infiltration having consistently high or low infiltration. The amount of infiltration had little discernable influence on crop growth, other than possibly at the very dry and very wet sites, where growth was reduced.
   The soil water balance model, SWIM, was used to assess the consequences of variable infiltration and crop growth on the partitioning of water losses between evaporation and drainage in 1992. Simulation of variable infiltration suggested that it has relatively little effect on evaporation, but considerable effect on point drainage. Once there was sufficient infiltration to cause drainage (which was achieved in all but extreme runoff areas), there was a linear relationship between any further cumulative infiltration and the annual loss through drainage, with typically more than 70% of any further input being lost as drainage. This linear relationship meant that on a held scale, variable infiltration had minimal effect on drainage, with increased drainage from runon areas tending to be at the expense of reduced drainage from runoff areas.

AB The hydrologic response of the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) in Alberta to projected changes in the future climate is investigated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) process-based and distributed hydrologic model. The model forcings are derived from a selected set of GCMs from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) statistically downscaled to a higher resolution (10 km) over Canada. Twelve hydrologic indicators that represent the magnitude and timing of the hydrologic regimes are evaluated for three 30-year time periods centered at the 1990s, 2050s and 2080s to identify significant alterations of hydrologic regimes between the reference and the two future periods using a t-test at 5% significance level. Hydrologic alteration factors (HAF) are also evaluated for each hydrologic indicator using the range of variability approach (RVA) to investigate projected changes in the distribution of these indicators. The results show increases in spring and winter flows for the two future periods at all hydrometric stations within the basin, resulting in an extended period of spring freshet. A higher rate of increase is projected for the stations located at the upper reach of the river because of the combined effects of increased precipitation and earlier snowmelt resulting from a warming climate. By contrast, summer flows are projected to decrease by up to 21% on average in the 2080s over most of the mainstem stations because of earlier snowmelt, increased evapotranspiration and no significant increase in summer precipitation. A water-management rule that optimizes impacts of water withdrawal from the lower reach of the Athabasca River under the current condition is also applied to the future scenarios to assess its relative performance under the projected climate conditions. The results indicate possible improvement in the water resources system performance in terms of increased reliability and resilience and reduced vulnerability during the two future periods as compared with those in the reference period mainly because of the projected increases in spring and winter flows, which has the potential to offset an expected future water deficit.

AB Knowledge on evapotranspiration is essential in quantifying water use depletion and to allocate scarce water resources to competing uses. Despite that an extensive literature describes the theoretical mechanisms of turbulent water vapour transport above and within crop canopies fewer studies have examined land surface parameters within composite landscapes of irrigated crops and semi-arid natural vegetation. Aiming to improve parameterizations of the radiation and energy balance in irrigated crops and natural vegetation, micro-climatic measurements were carried out on irrigated land (vineyards and mango orchard) and natural vegetation (caatinga) in the semi-arid zone of the Sao Francisco River basin (Brazil) from 2002 to 2005. The fractions of 24 h incident solar radiation available for net radiation were 46%, 55%, 51% and 53%, for wine grape, table grape, mango orchard and caatinga, respectively. Daily evaporative fractions of the net available energy used as latent heat flux (lambda E) were 0.80, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.33 respectively. The daylight values of bulk surface resistances (r(s)) averaged 128 s m(-1), 73 s m(-1), 133 s m(-1) and 1940 s m(-1) for wine grape, table grape, mango orchard and caatinga, respectively. Simplified parameterizations on roughness and evaporation resistances were performed. It could be concluded that net radiation can be estimated by means of a linear expression with incident global solar radiation depending on the type of vegetation. The variability of aerodynamic resistance (r(a)) could be mainly explained by the friction velocity (u.) which on turn depends on the surface roughness length for momentum transport (z(om)). The experimental data showed that for sparse canopies z(om) being 9% of the mean vegetation height is a doable operational rule for the semi-arid region of Sao Francisco River basin. The seasonal values of r(s) for irrigated crops were highly correlated with water vapour pressure deficit. The availability of analytical methods to assess ra and rs makes the one-step Penman-Monteith equation suitable for the computation of actual evapotranspiration and water productivity analyses.

AB Coastal bays with fresh submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) have been found to provide a favorable environment to shellfish (e.g., oysters). Significant variability in the spatial distribution and magnitude of SGD may occur because of subsurface heterogeneity. We investigated the relationship between stratigraphic controls (i.e. paleovalley systems) and the spatial distribution of SGD in relation to oyster reefs. In Copano Bay, South Texas, major oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore, along interfluves, and near paleovalley margins. A novel combination approach of radioactive geochemical tracers, stable isotopes, geophysical and petrophysical techniques were used to identify estuarine depositional environments for individual hydrogeologic characterization and evaluation of SGD distribution with implications to ecological features such as oyster reefs. A 1-km(2) area within a paleovalley system, in Copano Bay, yielded discernible differences in sediment type, apparent resistivity, and SGD rates among four different depositional environments: paleovalley, paleovalley margin, oyster reef and interfiuve. Electrical resistivity tomography revealed a direct connection between the oyster reef and the underlying, more permeable interfiuve, and the presence of a fresher SGD component in the subsurface. Measurements of SGD from stationary and mobile continuous radon-222 surveys across each depositional environment showed that, by and large, areas in proximity to reefs have larger SGD rates (62.6 +/- 11.3 cm/d in January and 28.7 +/- 10.8 cm/d in July) when compared to paleovalleys (31.9 +/- 8.9 cm/d in January and 19.5 +/- 7.2 cm/d in July). The role of depositional environments as hydrologic controls on SGD to oyster reefs revealed in this study is further confirmed by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed over small spatial scales offshore when compared to the entire estuary. Although constant mixing and radon-222 degassing of bay waters are likely altering the relationships between the different depositional environments and magnitude of SGD, this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs for more informed decisions on reef restoration efforts.

AB A distributed rainfall-runoff model was developed to predict storm runoff from humid forested catchments. The model. is physically based and takes into account the saturation excess overland flow mechanism and preferential subsurface flow. The watershed is discretized into a number of square grids, which then are classified into overland flow and channel flow elements based on water flow properties. On the overland elements, Infiltration, overland flow and lateral subsurface flow are estimated, while on channel flow elements river flow routing is performed. Lateral subsurface flow is calculated using Darcy's law and the continuity equation, whereas overland flow and channel flow are modeled using a one dimensional kinematic wave approximation to the St. Venant equations. The model governing equations are solved by an implicit finite difference scheme. While using process-based equations and physically meaningful parameters, the model. still maintains a relatively simple structure. Most of the model. parameters can be derived from digital elevation models (DEMs), digital soil and land use data, and the remainder of the parameters that are comparatively sensitive can be determined by model calibration. The model is tested using nine storm events in the Jiaokou watershed, a sub-basin of Yongjiang River in Zhejiang Province, China. Of these storms, one storm is used for calibrating the model parameters and the remaining eight storms are used to verify the model. When judged by the model, efficiency coefficient (R-2), volume conversation index (VCI), absolute error of the time to peak (Delta T), and relative error of the peak flow rate (delta P-max), acceptable results are achieved. Sensitivity analysis shows that the model is sensitive to saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), Manning's roughness coefficients (n) and the initial soil moisture content. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fractality has been found in many areas and has been used to describe the internal features of time series. But is it possible to use fractal theory to improve the performance of hydrological models? This study aims at investigating the potential benefits of applying fractal theory in model calibration. A new criterion named the ratio of fractal dimensions (RD) is defined as the ratio of the fractal dimensions of simulated and observed streamflow series. To combine the advantages of fractal theory with classical criteria based on squared residuals, a multi-objective calibration strategy is designed. The selected classical criterion is the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E). The E-RD strategy is tested in three study cases with different climates and geographies. The results reveal that, in most aspects, introducing RD into model calibration makes the simulation of streamflow components more reasonable. Also, pursuing a better RD during calibration leads to only a small decrease in E. We therefore recommend choosing the parameter set with the best E among the parameter sets with RD values of around 1.

AB Changes in vegetation growth may influence the availability of water resources. Located on the Tibetan Plateau, the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is a major freshwater source for Tibet, China and downstream South Asian countries, with high spatial heterogeneity in altitude and climate from the upstream to downstream regions. In this study, we combined satellite-based gridded datasets of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topography, precipitation, and temperature to investigate how vegetation growth has changed in the YZRB over recent decades (1982-2010), and to determine their driving mechanisms. Although a statistically significant trend in growing season NDVI was not detected at the basin scale, at the pixel scale 16.8% and 5.3% of the area of the YZRB was found to exhibit increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The greatest increases occurred in the Nyang subbasin. Variations of NDVI values along elevation, precipitation, and temperature gradients revealed the greatest variation over the middle ranges of the three variables. Partial correlation analyses indicate that in both arid and semi-arid regions of the YZRB precipitation is positively correlated with NDVI. The relationship between NDVI and temperature varies with aridity, reflecting different effects of snow-melting processes on vegetation growth. Temperature positively correlates with NDVI in the arid region. In addition, a negative correlation between NDVI and temperature is detected in the semi-arid region. This is the first comprehensive study to explore climate-vegetation-hydrology relationships in the YZRB at a spatial resolution finer than those derived from sparse in-situ meteorological stations or low resolution global climate datasets. Our results are valuable for understanding ecohydrological processes in both arid and semi-arid regions of this internationally important river basin.

AB The most uncertain parameter in determining the stage-discharge relationship of an ungauged stream is the friction factor, a parameter for which a gauged stream can be back-calculated using hydrometric survey data that has been compiled over a wide range of flow conditions. The existing friction factor models for ungauged streams that do not require hydrometric survey data as input can have very large prediction errors. In this study, 415 streamflow events collected from 52 rivers across three continents were assembled to allow for the use of a suitable global dataset size/range to develop a robust model for the prediction of the friction factor in ungauged streams using two machine learning algorithms (Gene Expression Programing (GEP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)). The new GEP and ELM models outperformed existing models with significantly improved R-squared values of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The combination of the two input parameters (relative smoothness and the friction slope) allowed the new models to more accurately predict the friction factor for a wider range of streams and flow conditions. The forecasting uncertainty of the developed GEP and ELM models were compared with past models and found to be the least uncertain, with Width Uncertainty Band (WUB) values of +/- 0.0536 and +/- 0.0504, respectively. For the first time in this field of research, partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied to the trends of the friction factor estimation by GEP and ELM. It was found that GEP and ELM models are extremely sensitive to friction slope in comparison with relative smoothness. The GEP and ELM model results for predicting the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were compared with different existing relationships, and the superior performance of the proposed models was illustrated.

AB There is a need for assessment of.uncertainties and hence effects on reliability of design and management of stormwater pipes due to the prevalence of urban floods trigged by modification of land cover and high precipitation intensities respectively due to increasing urbanization and changing climate.
   Observed annual maximum series (AMS) of extreme precipitation intensities of 17 durations (1-min to 1440-min) and runoff records of 27 years from a 21.255 ha (23% impervious, 35% built-up and 41% open areas) Risvollan catchment in Trondheim City were used. Using a balanced bootstrap resampling (BBRS) with frequency analysis, we quantified considerable uncertainty in precipitation and runoff quantiles due to the sampling variability of systematic observations (e.g., -43% to +49% relative differences from the quantile estimates for the original sample). These differences are higher than suggested increase in design rainfall and floods by many countries for climate change adjustment. The uncertainties in IDF curves and derived design storm hyetographs are found to have large effects on the "reliability of sizing of stormwater pipes. The study also indicated low validity of the assumptions on extreme precipitation and runoff relationships in the return period-based method for the partially paved urban catchment: (i) maximum of only 46% of the AMS of extreme precipitation and runoff events occurred concurrently and (ii) T-year return period extreme precipitation events do not necessarily result in T-year flood events. These indicate that there are effects of snowmelt seasonality, and probably catchment moisture states and interactions between the flows in subsurface media and pipes. The results substantiate the need for better understanding of relationships between precipitation and runoff extremes and urban runoff generation process, and importance of uncertainty assessment and application of reliability-based methods for design and management of water infrastructure.

AB Mesotrophic wet meadows with an upward seepage of fresh, alkaline groundwater are famous for their high species richness. However, due to the lack of seepage data on an appropriate spatial scale, no quantitative relationships have been established as yet between seepage and the occurrence of seepage-dependent plant communities. Since there is no established method to directly measure upward seepage in the field, we investigated the possibility of inferring the seepage intensity by using measurable hydrological quantities such as ground and surface-water levels. To this end, we designed 16 representative plots of virtual hydrological situations, using known sets of geohydrological parameters. Then we applied the integrated soil-water-atmosphere-plant model SWAP to generate 'measured' time series of ground and surface-water levels for these plots. Finally, using the SCEM-UA optimisation algorithm, we calibrated parameters that affect seepage onto these time series. We analysed how the accuracy and uncertainty of calibrated seepage fluxes depend on the measurement interval of input data and on the accuracy and uncertainty of inferred local geohydrological parameters and boundary conditions. Our analysis shows that it is possible to make reliable estimates of seepage intensities from data provided by easy to place piezometers and water level gauges. For application on real datasets, the analysis gives insight into the limitations of both the approach and the data requirements. For example, data supplied every fortnight was found to be just as valuable for seepage estimation as modern high frequency measurements. When setting up a monitoring programme, our method can help to decide what and when to measure. Furthermore, our method can be used establish quantitative relationships between seepage and plant communities on an appropriate spatial scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural droughts are usually caused by a period of lower than average precipitation. The resulting shortage in precipitation propagates through the hydrological system causing drought in the different segments of the hydrological system (unsaturated zone, saturated groundwater, surface water). To analyse the propagation and spatial distribution of the drought in the groundwater system, drought is analysed simultaneously in simulated recharge, hydraulic heads and groundwater discharge for a groundwater catchment (Pang, UK). The recharge and hydraulic heads are simulated and analysed spatially. The groundwater discharge is analysed in four reaches along the stream. Comparison of droughts in the recharge and heads shows that the droughts are greatly attenuated and delayed in the groundwater system. Comparison of the droughts in the heads and the discharge shows the opposite effect, so that the droughts in the discharge resemble more the droughts in the recharge than those in the hydraulic heads. The faster response in the groundwater discharge compared to the hydraulic heads is probably caused by the non-linear relationship between groundwater storage and discharge. Thus in the recharge and in the discharge, there are many short droughts, whereas in the hydraulic head fewer, more severe droughts occur. It is likely that these results hold not only for the Pang catchment but also generally for catchments with a large groundwater system and a non-linear groundwater discharge relationship. The spatial distribution of the droughts in the hydraulic heads shows that short droughts are more severe near the streams, as they are attenuated further away. Long periods of below average recharge have relatively more effect near the groundwater divide. The spatial distribution of the droughts in the groundwater discharge is such that upstream the droughts are more attenuated than downstream. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Compared with a single drought event, compound drought (i.e., two or more droughts occurring simultaneously) has more substantial effects on economic growth, water resources, and the ecological environment. A useful framework for assessing compound drought events from a drought propagation perspective was proposed. The framework includes the definition, identification, and risk assessment of compound drought. We defined compound drought as a drought event from a drought propagation perspective when meteorological drought and hydrological drought occur simultaneously. The Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were used to represent hydrological and meteorological drought, respectively. By applying a certain truncation threshold of run theory, the compound drought events in the time series were identified and characterized according to their duration and severity. Five univariate distribution functions (i.e., Log-normal, Exponential, Gamma, Weibull, and Pareto) and four bivariate copula models (i.e., Gaussian, Clayton, Frank, and Gumbel) were used for fitting both the duration and severity of compound drought and their joint return periods. A 40-year monthly streamflow and precipitation dataset from the Dongjiang River Basin, which is located on the southern coast of China, was used as a case study. The characteristics of compound drought, including duration and severity, were captured by considering the time continuity of meteorological and hydrological droughts from a drought propagation perspective based on run theory. The most severe compound droughts in the study area were observed in 1963 and 2004-2005. The characteristics of compound drought duration and severity were related to the timescale of the drought index (i.e., SSI and SPI). For the study basin, the SPI at a 2-3-month timescale better matched the SSI on the monthly timescale compared with other timescales. The Gaussian-copula function better characterized the joint return periods between the duration and severity of compound drought compared with three other copula models. Although reservoir regulation played an important role in decreasing the duration (lower by 8.25%) and severity (lower by 9.27%) of compound drought, it had little effect on extreme compound drought events. Overall, the results indicated that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical assessments of compound drought from a drought propagation perspective. This framework could also be applied to other regions.

AB Bound water (BW) has significant effects on the physical and chemical properties of soils and other geologic formations. However, little is known about its effect on the non-Fickian transport of solute in porous media. This paper investigated the effect of BW on the non-Fickian solute transport characteristics in mixed porous media. Different porous media of quartz sand with variable contents of powdered minerals were prepared. The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) was used to quantitatively characterise BW and its spatial distribution. Then solute transport experiments were conducted in different prepared porous media and the measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) were analysed using the advection-dispersion equation (ADE), mobile-immobile (MIM) and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models. The results revealed that all measured BTCs exhibi-ted the characteristics of early arrival and late-time tailing. However, stronger non-Fickian characteristics were observed as BW increased in content, indicating that BW influenced the non-Fickian transport of the solute. The optimised immobile water fraction of the MIM model consistently increased with increasing estimated BW fraction. Moreover, the coefficient of mass transfer rate (alpha) of MIM decreased as BW increased, meaning that the solute exchange between the mobile and immobile fluids became slower and consequently yielded strongly tailed BTCs. From the CTRW model, the solute transport velocity (vCTRW) increased with increasing BW, leading to a reduction in the breakthrough time of the solute. An increase in BW yielded a decreasing power law exponent (beta CTRW) of the CTRW model, implying an enhancement of the non-Fickian transport characteristics. Furthermore, the porous media with BW < 16.4% showed moderately non-Fickian solute transport whereas those with BW >= 16.4% exhibited highly non-Fickian solute transport.

AB Annual and seasonal maximum daily discharge time series for 55 stations in central Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) are used to examine flood frequency from a regional perspective. In this study we examine temporal nonstationarities in the flood peak records, and characterize upper tail and scaling properties of the flood peak distributions. There is a marked seasonality in the flood peak record, with a large fraction of annual maximum flood peaks occurring during the winter in the western part of the study domain, and during the summer in the southern portion of this region. The presence of abrupt and slowly varying changes in the flood time series is examined by means of non-parametric tests. Change-points in the mean and variance of the flood peak distributions are examined using the Pettitt test, while the presence of monotonic patterns is examined by means of Spearman and Mann-Kendall tests. Abrupt changes, rather than monotonic trends are responsible for violations of the stationarity assumption. These step changes can often be associated with anthropogenic effects, such as construction of dams and reservoirs and river training. Given the profound changes that these catchments have undergone, it is difficult to detect a possible climate change signal in the flood peak record.
   The estimates of the location, scale, and shape parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution are used to examine the upper tail and scaling properties of the flood peak distributions. The location and scale parameters exhibit a power law behaviour when plotted as a function of drainage area, while the shape parameter decreases log-linearly for increasing catchment area. The findings of this study suggest that these records exhibit a heavy tail behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Steady seepage through a hillslope aquifer results in the formation of a water table. In this paper, the boundary conditions governing the steady water table location are analysed, and an analytical series method applied to the problem, using eigenfunction expansions. Eigenfunction expansions, modified for nonorthogonal basis functions, provide a conceptually simple, efficient estimation process, that reduces the steady water table problem to a sequence of curve fitting exercises. A rigorous examination of the hodograph relationships reveals the possibility of more than one water table location, for given recharge rate. An elementary analysis reveals that one of these possibilities can always be eliminated. Also, the boundary conditions governing the steady water table are determined at a non-vertical upstream boundary. Hillslopes subjected to low recharge rates can be very difficult to analyse, and appropriate techniques for this case are detailed. In a companion paper (Adv. Water Resour., 19(2) (1996) 75-81), the techniques described in this paper are put to the test, and the upstream boundary conditions are investigated, using the series methods.

AB Building on a proof-of-concept study of energy balance over dry soil, a model of evapotranspiration is proposed based on the theory of maximum entropy production (MEP). The MEP formalism leads to an analytical solution of evaporation rate (latent heat flux), together with sensible and ground heat fluxes, as a function of surface soil temperature, surface humidity, and net radiation. The model covers the entire range of soil wetness from dry to saturation. The MEP model of transpiration is formulated as a special case of bare soil evaporation. Test of the MEP model using field observations indicates that the model performs well over bare soil and canopy.

AB Concrete and geomembranes are common materials used in canal linings to decrease canal seepage. Current numerical studies focus on concrete linings only by equivalent continuous models and seldom are about geomembrane and are suitable to quantify the seepage loss from canals with damaged linings. In this study, a new model is developed for the coupled numerical simulation of seepage through concrete with cracks and a geomembrane with holes in canal lining damage based on the finite element method. In this model, the porous media is discretized into solid elements, whereas discrete cracks and geomembranes are modelled by zero-thickness elements, with the Richards equation and cubic law applied to describe the water seepage process. The porous media and crack zones are implicitly coupled in time and space through the exchange flow between the concrete and the crack zones in that the heads are integrated in a single matrix equation. The domain area is divided into two subdomain areas by the geomembrane. For the two subdomain areas, the surfaces of both sides in the geomembrane are treated as two flux boundaries. The proposed model is calibrated and validated by the results of ponding tests conducted on a canal with four lining treatments and additional experiments, which showed that the model fit the experiments very well. The model is applied to sensitivity analyses by varying the model parameters. The model is shown to be capable of simulating the seepage of canals lined by concrete and geomembrane lining with different cracks and holes. The sensitivity analysis shows that canal seepage mainly depends on the lining characteristics, such as the crack width, hole density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of the geomembrane, K-s of the concrete, and K-s of the soil layers adjacent to the canal bottom.

AB Soil water infiltration can be described with the quasi-analytical Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation, defined by the hydraulic conductivity (K-s), sorptivity (S) and the beta parameter. K-s and S are commonly estimated from the transient cumulative infiltration curve, using a constant beta value. The objective of this work was to study the influence of beta on the estimation of K-s and S. The study was first performed on synthetic 1-D infiltration curves generated at different infiltration times for loam sandy, loamy and silty soils, and next extrapolated to a 3-D loam synthetic soil and on 10 infiltrations curves measured on the field with a disc infiltrometer on different types of soils. The infiltration measurements lasted between 600 and 900 s. The results showed that, while early infiltration times (i.e. 100 s) promoted good estimations for S, longer infiltrations (i.e. 1.000 s) were required to estimate accurately K-s. Only very long infiltration (i.e. 10.000 s) allowed defining the actual beta value. A similar behaviour was observed for the 3-D infiltration measurements. Except for f, significant relationships (R-2 = 0.99) were obtained between the K-s and S of the three theoretical soils and the corresponding values calculated by optimizing the three hydraulic parameters on 2.000 s 1-D infiltration curves. The large confidence interval observed in beta (between 0.3 and 2.0) resulted from the fact that beta had a small effect on the infiltration curve. A significant relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was also obtained between the K-s and S optimized from the experimental curves using a beta = 1.1 and the corresponding values obtained by simultaneous optimization of the three hydraulic parameters. These results demonstrated that S and K-s can be accurately estimated using a constant beta and that downward infiltration is not an appropriate procedure to estimate beta.

TI Groundwater recharge assessment at local and episodic scale in a soil

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   Soil cover; Water Table Fluctuation method
ID EPIKARST
AB Groundwater recharge assessment of karst aquifers, at various spatial and temporal scales, is a major scientific topic of current importance, since these aquifers play an essential role for both socio-economic development and fluvial ecosystems.
   In this study, groundwater recharge was estimated at local and episodic scales in a representative perched karst aquifer in a region of southern Italy with a Mediterranean climate. The research utilized measurements of precipitation, air temperature, soil water content, and water-table depth, obtained in 2008 at the Acqua della Madonna test area (Termini Mount karst aquifer, Campania region). At this location the aquifer is overlain by ash-fall pyroclastic soils. The Episodic Master Recession (EMR) method, an improved version of the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method, was applied to estimate the amount of recharge generated episodically by individual rainfall events. The method also quantifies the amount of precipitation generating each recharge episode, thus permitting calculation of the Recharge to the Precipitation Ratio (RPR) on a storm-by-storm basis.
   Depending on the seasonally varying air temperature, evapotranspiration, and precipitation patterns, calculated values of RPR varied between 35% and 97% among the individual episodes. A multiple linear correlation of the RPR with both the average intensity of recharging rainfall events and the antecedent soil water content was calculated. Given the relatively easy measurability of precipitation and soil water content, such an empirical model would have great hydrogeological and practical utility. It would facilitate short-term forecasting of recharge in karst aquifers of the Mediterranean region and other aquifers with similar hydrogeological characteristics. By establishing relationships between the RPR and climate-dependent variables such as average storm intensity, it would facilitate prediction of climate-change effects on groundwater recharge. The EMR methodology could further be applied to other aquifers for evaluating the relationship of recharge to various hydrometeorological and hydrogeological processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The quantification of spatio-temporal hydroclimatic extreme events is a key variable in water resources planning, disaster mitigation, and preparing climate resilient society. However, quantification of these extreme events has always been a great challenge, which is further compounded by climate variability and change. Recently complex network theory was applied in earth science community to investigate spatial connections among hydrologic fluxes (e.g., rainfall and streamflow) in water cycle. However, there are limited applications of complex network theory for investigating hydroclimatic extreme events. This article attempts to provide an overview of complex networks and extreme events, event synchronization method, construction of networks, their statistical significance and the associated network evaluation metrics. For illustration purpose, we apply the complex network approach to study the spatio-temporal evolution of droughts in Continental USA (CONUS). A different drought threshold leads to a new drought event as well as different socio-economic implications. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the role of thresholds on spatio-temporal evolution of drought through network analysis. In this study, long term (1900-2016) Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) was selected for spatio-temporal drought analysis using three network-based metrics (i.e., strength, direction and distance). The results indicate that the drought events propagate differently at different thresholds associated with initiation of drought events. The direction metrics indicated that onset of mild drought events usually propagate in a more spatially clustered and uniform approach compared to onsets of moderate droughts. The distance metric shows that the drought events propagate for longer distance in western part compared to eastern part of CONUS. We believe that the network-aided metrics utilized in this study can be an important tool in advancing our knowledge on drought propagation as well as other hydroclimatic extreme events. Although the propagation of droughts is investigated using the network approach, however process (physics) based approaches is essential to further understand the dynamics of hydroclimatic extreme events.

AB This study aimed to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of the microtopography and its influence on flow convergence on sloping farmland of purple soil area in China, Methods involving artificial rainfall, pin meter and photographic measurements were adopted to generate DEM (digital elevation model). Geographic statistics and multifractal theory were used for quantitative and hydrological analyses of microtopography based on ArcGIS. Two artificial tillage practices (ridge tillage and conservation tillage) were used to simulate different types of microtopography. Ridge tillage (RT) was designed according to local agricultural customs in China, with conservation tillage (CK) used for comparison purposes. A total of 12 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in two 1 m by 2 m boxes under increased rainfall series (1.0,1.5, and 2.0 mm min(-1)) and decreased rainfall series (2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 mm min(-1)) on a typical slope gradient of 15. Artificial tillage was the major contributing factor to the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography on sloping farmland of the purple soil area. Spatiotemporal variability of microtopography was expressed using semivariogram and multifractal spectrum, and spatial heterogeneity of drainage networks was expressed using general fractal dimension Delta D based on multifractal theory. In general, the drainage networks was mostly effected by microrelief. The drainage density of ridge tillage was smaller than that of the conservation tillage under different rainfall patterns, and the drainage density decreased remarkably with the increasing microrelief. Moreover, the Delta D values of ridge tillage ranged from 0.1817 to 0.5677. By contrast, the Delta D values of the conservation tillage ranged from 0.9662 to 1.3013, and thus the lower spatial heterogeneity of drainage networks in ridge tillage compared to conservation tillage. In this study, we established a novel method for analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and demonstrated the effect of microtopography on the flow convergence of sloping farmland. These findings had important implications for clarifying the essence of microtopography of purple soil area and laying a theoretical basis and a support datum for harnessing measure of sloping farmland.

AB Hydrothermal activity and seismicity are abundant along the Yushu-Ganzi-Xianshuihe fault system (YGXFS) in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. However, the processes and factors that control hydrothermal fluid circulation at a regional scale remain less constrained, and the relationship between geothermal anomaly and seismic activity is poorly known. In this study, we report an integrated dataset of thermal water chemistry (delta O-18(H2O), delta D-H2O, and delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)) to identify the origin, circulation path, and reservoir properties of hydrothermal fluids and then reveal the relationship between fluid circulation and seismic activity. The thermal waters are mainly classified as Na-HCO3 type with minor Ca-Na-HCO3 and Na-HCO3-Cl types. The delta O-18(H2O) (-18.7 parts per thousand to -14.5 parts per thousand) and delta D-H2O (-142 parts per thousand to -110 parts per thousand) values indicate recharge of meteoric waters, which infiltrated along the YGXFS to 2-6 km depths and underwent mixing with deep fluids prior to their discharge at the surface. A mass balance model based on delta C-13(DIC) values (-4.3 parts per thousand to 5.9 parts per thousand) and DIC contents of thermal waters reveals the involvement of CO2-bearing fluids from mantle and thermo-metamorphic decarbonation of crustal marine limestones in tectonic CO2 outgassing from the active fault. The estimated reservoir temperatures (85-336 degrees C) based on silica geothermometer of the thermal waters decrease from southeast to northwest along the YGXFS. Notably, the epicenters of strong earthquakes (Ms >= 6) are mostly located in the transition zone of geothermal anomalies according to spatial distribution of the reservoir temperatures. Combined with geological and geophysical information, we suggest that the heterogeneity of crustal thermal structure and the upwelling of deep fluids may play an essential role in the distribution of thermal springs and the high frequency of earth-quakes along the YGXFS.

AB The distribution of groundwater and dynamic fluctuations in groundwater levels have direct impacts on the eco-environment of and areas. Investigations of groundwater recharge in and areas are typically limited by a tack of adequate meteorological and hydrogeological records. This study focuses on groundwater recharge in a seasonally flooded and area within the Tarim Basin, China, with the aim of analyzing the influence of groundwater and topography on the response characteristics of overland flow. We conducted a simulation using a coupled MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model over 112 days of the flood season and calculated the average water balance. Based on the properties of the multiscale recognition of wavelets and the self-comparability of fractals in analyzing the detailed characteristics of groundwater diffusion and fluctuations in groundwater levels, a hybrid fractal-wavelet method was used to explain the recharge response associated with overland flow, distance from midstream, topography, and flooding depth. The results of the model simulations are generally consistent with observed data, indicating that the hybrid fractal-wavelet method is able to recognize the detailed characteristics of the groundwater response. Furthermore, the groundwater levels show a significant relationship with the orientation of the riverway prior to flooding. When flooding occurred, the groundwater levels showed a rapid response to changes in the depth of long-term overland flow. A total of 71.31% of the study area showed a strong correlation between groundwater level and the distance from midstream. The results demonstrate that the relationship exists for fluctuations in groundwater levels of more than 1.4 m. Variations in the height of the water table were significantly influenced by topographic elevation; in contrast, slope and aspect had little effect. In conclusion, the above results indicate that the proposed methodology is applicable for the management of water resources in and regions. The modeling and hybrid fractal-wavelet method study allowed quantification of the processes affecting groundwater levels and provided an insight into their implications in exploring groundwater level management.

AB In the paper, we evaluated some of the prominent mathematical models derived from Darcy's law used to describe filtration membrane fouling occurring during the clarification of turbid fluids. The fouling can occur by basic mechanisms like surface pore blocking, pore constriction/obstruction, caking, or their combination. The paper presents a novel application of these models to the infiltration of overland flow into the soil. The soil, as a porous medium, is assumed to be the filter. The soil infilling that occurs during structural seal formation is assimilated to the membrane fouling process, and the turbid fluid is the flow enriched in fine particles due to the illuviation of the soil particles detached by raindrop impact and overland flow. Explicit mathematical equations were derived for the dynamics of the free surface area for infiltration, the resistance of the infiltration porous medium, the infiltration rate, the cumulative infiltration volume and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. The fluid characteristics and the validation dataset were provided by the SERLAB (Soil Erosion LABoratory, 42 degrees 59 ' 34 ''N 12 degrees 17 ' 27 ''E, Italy) of the University of Perugia and derives from a sequence of rainfall-simulation experiments in a silty clay loam. The better fits were obtained by combining the models that simulate the basic mechanisms of the free surface pore area blocking and the increase in the medium resistance due to pore obstruction by infilling fine particles. Both processes occur during structural crust formation. As a model reproducing the fine particles infilling pores both at the surface and at the underneath layer could describe the behaviour of the infiltration data, the contribution of this process should be added in modelling the dynamics of structural seal formation and its effect on infiltration.

AB To understand the effect of residual oil on hydraulic properties and solute dispersive behavior of porous media, miscible displacement column experiments were conducted using two petroleum products (diesel and engine oil) and a sandy soil. The effective water permeability, effective water-filled porosity, and dispersivity were investigated in two-fluid systems of water and oil as a function of residual oil saturation (ROS). At the end of each experiment, the distribution of ending ROS along the sand column was determined by the method of petroleum ether extraction-ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Darcy's Law was used to determine permeability, while breakthrough curves (BTCs) of a tracer, Cl-, were used to calibrate effective porosity and dispersivity. The experimental results indicate that the maximum saturated zone residual saturation of diesel and engine oil in this study are 16.0% and 45.7%, respectively. Cl- is found to have no sorption on the solid matrix. Generated BTCs are sigmoid in shape with no evidence of tailing. The effective porosity of sand is inversely proportional to ROS. For the same level of ROS, the magnitude of reduction in effective porosity by diesel is close to that by engine oil. The relative permeability of sand to water saturation decreases with increasing amount of trapped oil, and the slope of the relative permeability-saturation curve for water is larger at higher water saturations, indicating that oil first occupies larger pores, which have the most contribution to the conductivity of the water. In addition, the reduction rate of relative permeability by diesel is greater than that by engine oil. The dispersivity increases with increasing ROS, suggesting that the blockage of pore spaces by immobile oil globules may enhance local velocity variations and increase the tortuosity of aqueous-phase flow paths.

AB This paper reports an investigation of the phosphorus (P) content of fluvial. suspended sediment samples collected from three lowland groundwater-dominated agricultural catchments in the UK. In-stream trap samplers were installed at a total of 21 locations in the catchments of the Rivers Frome and Piddle in Dorset and in the Upper Tern in Shropshire, UK. Time-integrated suspended sediment samples (n = 187) were collected at regular intervals over a period of 22 months and analysed for total phosphorus (TP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), organic phosphorus (OP) and algal available phosphorus (AAP). TP concentrations varied between sampling sites in the Rivers Frome and Piddle, allowing key P inputs to be identified, while fractionation of P assisted in identifying the nature of these inputs. There was also significant variation in both the TP concentration and the concentration of individual. fractions between the Frome and Piddle catchments and the Upper Tern. These contrasts were attributed to the differing underlying geologies, since the Frome and Piddle are underlain predominantly by chalk, whilst the Upper Tern is underlain by sandstone, and also to the different soil types present. The TP content of suspended sediment collected from the Frome catchment showed a statistically significant relationship with specific surface area, but this relationship was not found for the remaining catchments. Temporal variation in P concentrations at both the seasonal and event scale was also investigated. Seasonal variations were noted for TP concentrations and for the concentrations of IP, OP and AAP in all the study catchments, but no consistent seasonal patterns were discernible. Maximum and minimum concentrations of the individual fractions occurred during different months in each of the study catchments, suggesting that different controls operated in the individual catchments. Short-term temporal variations in TP concentrations were documented for two high flow events. Concentrations were tower during high flow events than in baseflow, reflecting dilution.

AB Land cover is considered to have significant influence on the hydrologic response of a river basin. In this study, we assessed how changes in land cover over time affected flood behaviour from 1988 to 2005, in the Upper Ping River Basin, northern Thailand. We correlated the types of land cover with rainfall-runoff behaviour for smaller and larger flood events taking place during this period. To quantify land cover, nine Landsat 5 TM images taken during the dry season (January or February) were obtained and processed to examine inter-annual land cover changes. From the networks of daily read rainfall data and stream gaugings available across the basin, 68 rainfall and 11 runoff stations were selected to evaluate peak flow rate and runoff coefficient for flood events. For individual sub-catchments, strong non-linear correlations were found between the overall runoff coefficient and peak flow rates for flood events. These runoff coefficients to peak flow relationships varied from year to year with different land cover for each sub-catchment. From these relationships within a particular sub-catchment, we determined relationships between different types of land cover and runoff coefficient for the 2, 5, 10 and 15 year Annual Recurrence Interval (ARI) peak flood events. We found that runoff coefficient increased with increasing forest proportion for these specified peak flood conditions, on nine out of eleven sub-catchments. On the other hand, the runoff coefficient associated with these peak flood events decreased as agricultural and disturbed forest areas increased. The influence of land cover on runoff coefficient was, however, found to be very different between smaller (lower than similar to 2 year ARI) and larger flood events (larger than similar to 2 year ARI). Runoff coefficient is higher for high forest cover during larger flood events; but for smaller flood events, runoff coefficient is lower when forest cover is high. This is due to the fact that for smaller flood events, rainfall loss rate for the forest area is normally higher than that of the non-forest area according to higher evapotranspiration and soil moisture capacity. Forests have proved to potentially offer flood mitigation benefits for smaller flood events. However, for larger flood events the situation of the basin can be different, especially on a basin with higher antecedent soil moisture or even under saturation stage. Antecedent soil moisture from the previous storms could be better retained within the forest area than the non-forest area due to deeper rote zone and higher soil moisture holding capacity of the forest area compared to non-forest area. For the larger flood events, forest area tends to produce more runoff than non-forest area as found in this study. These findings gave us a more thorough understanding of the effect of land cover types on flood behaviour at different stages of soil moisture conditions, and the severity of storm events. It can be useful for land use and flood management of the river basin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Rain-shadow hydrology: Influences on river flows and flood magnitudes
   across the central massif divide of La Grande Terre Island, New
   Caledonia
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Rain-shadow hydrology; Tropical islands; New Caledonia; South Pacific
AB Within the tropical South Pacific islands, meaningful examination of how mountain barriers influence river flow characteristics has not previously been attempted, owing principally to the lack of reliable long-term data from an adequate number of basins that are geographically spread across opposing sides of a major topographic divide. The island of La Grande Terre in New Caledonia provides an exception, since robust flow records with effective durations between 15 and 52 years are available for 22 monitored rivers draining both sides of a massif dividing range. Cross-island differences in several fundamental hydrological parameters were statistically analysed, including runoff coefficients, median daily discharges and specific flood flows. Results identify that significant flow contrasts exist between windward versus leeward basins, which are not necessarily revealed by observing patterns of rainfall distribution over the island.
   Power relationships are derived using both empirical and theoretically-based models for maximum decadal (Q(10y)) and centennial (Q(100y)) flood size against catchment area, with basins grouped according to windward or leeward location on La Grande Terre. A key finding is that the rain-shadow influence (RI) is essentially constant (and therefore quantifiable) across the central massif divide. Flood magnitudes for both Q(10y) and Q(100y) events are between 35% and 80% greater for windward versus leeward basins of equivalent size, depending on whether empirical or accepted theoretical models are applied. The term 'rain-shadow hydrology' is proposed for the generalised concept of windward vs leeward divergence in hydrological patterns. In spite of being developed for the La Grande Terre situation, the theme has relevance for neighbouring high islands in the tropical South Pacific, and therefore contributes to understanding tropical island hydrological characteristics in the trade wind belt. However, the transferability of estimated ratios of the rain-shadow influence (RI ratios) requires validation with flow data from other islands, especially to establish windward vs leeward differences in flood magnitude-basin area relationships.

DE evapotranspiration; baseflow recession
ID STREAMFLOW
AB By applying a nonlinear reservoir approach for groundwater drainage, catchment-scale evapotranspiration (ET) during flow recessions can be expressed with the help of the lumped version of the water balance equation for the catchment. The attractiveness of the approach is that ET, in theory, can be obtained by the sole use of observed flow values for which relatively abundant and long records are available. A 2D finite element numerical model of subsurface flow in the unsaturated and saturated zones, capable of simulating moisture removal by vegetation, was first successfully employed to verify the water balance approach under ideal. conditions. Subsequent practical applications over four catchments with widely varying climatic conditions however showed large disparities in comparison with monthly ET estimates of Morton's WREVAP model.

AB Existence of preferential flow paths (PFP) in heterogeneous aquifers may dramatically change the behavior of aquifers, making it critical to recognize PFP in solute transport simulation and environmental risk analysis. Conventional particle tracking method can recognize PFP but is computationally demanding and hardly applicable in real high-dimensional problems. Minimum resistance method based on graph theory, though efficient, is unable to consider flow conditions and may lead to implausible path results. In this paper we propose an easy-to-implement method based on stream function to analyze and recognize PFP in heterogeneity of multiple levels. Illustrative examples and robustness tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stream function-based method compared with particle tracking and minimum resistance methods. It is found that the proposed method is able to avoid high computational demand and potential conflicts with hydrodynamic conditions thus is both efficient and reliable.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and its dynamics in river systems are greatly affected by human activities. Based on the in situ measurements of water discharge (Q), suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), and concentrations (C) of total P (TP), particulate P (PP), and total dissolved P (TDP) from 1997 to 2017, P transport in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and the combined effects of cascade reservoirs operation and anthropogenic emissions have been explored. The whole period was divided into three sequential periods of January 1997 to May 2003 (period 1), June 2003 to September 2012 (period 2), and October 2012 to December 2017 (period 3), corresponding to the period prior to impoundment of the TGR, during the operation of the TGR, and after the impoundment of upstream cascade reservoirs, respectively. Results showed that the P concentrations were positively skewed and generally followed the three-parameter gamma and log-normal distributions. There was significant difference for SSC, TP, PP, and TDP between adjacent periods but not for Q. The SSC, TP, and PP presented downward trends during the periods affected by the impoundment of cascade reservoirs, while the TDP increased in period 2 especially after 2007 and decreased in period 3 due to the upstream reservoirs regulation and the pollution management in the tributaries. For the monthly variation, the SSC, TP, and PP became more evenly distributed throughout the year after the impoundment of cascade reservoirs, while the TDP tended to show a pattern of "higher in dry season and lower in flood season". The C-Q relationships indicated that the TP in the TGR was positively correlated with Q (transport limited), while negatively with Q for TDP (source limited). Generally, the TP, PP, and TDP were positively correlated with both SSC and anthropogenic P emissions, thus, the P concentrations declined with sediment retention in the reservoir but increased with time due to the increasing pollutant emissions. Correspondingly, the P dynamics were better depicted after considering the effects of sediment and pollutant emissions than using a simple C-Q relationship.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important fraction of organic carbon (OC) that together with colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) plays a key role in the carbon cycling of lakes. Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv is a large and shallow eutrophic lake where water quality measurements have been carried out for a long time. The monthly characteristics of DOC and CDOM in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv and its input/output rivers were traced in 5-years observations. We attempted to link the hydro-morphological indices as lake area (A), water level (WL) and volume variations (Qc) with lake DOC fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationships to improve understanding of carbon fluxes in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake, as well as of the possibility to estimate DOC fluxes by CDOM via remote sensing. The research questions were: how the properties and quantity of DOC, its fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationship in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake are responding to 1) variable proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous processes and 2) changing hydrological conditions. The increased lake volume variation in spring caused the higher level of CDOM, signifying the terrestrial (allochthonous) DOC (DOCAlloch) domination in Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv. The proportion of DOCAlloch increased together with increasing WL, A and CDOM concentration. Although the generally high proportion of DOCAlloch in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv, the autochthonous DOC determines the water color (CDOM/DOC) in this highly productive ecosystem with short residence time (280-365 days). Our study on DOC flux revealed that the internal carbon sources, driven by hydrological factors, contribute significantly to the role of large and shallow lakes in global carbon cycling. The further development of water color remote sensing could provide novel directions for understanding the feedbacks of lake DOC flux and changing hydrology.

AB Estimating the sensible heat flux H over sparse vegetation from thermal infrared temperature requires an estimate of the excess resistance r(r) to the aerodynamic resistance. This excess resistance has been commonly expressed as a function of the dimensionless parameter kB(-1). Experimental analysis of this parameter over diverse sparse vegetation in semi-arid areas showed a large and unexpected range of variation. The flux and ground-based thermal infrared data of the East Central Site of HAPEX-Sahel were used in this paper to study the behaviour of the kB(-1) parameter and to compare these results with the conclusions of previous studies. At first, the global accuracy of the; estimation of H as a function of the kB(-1) value was analysed; it was found that overestimating kB has less serious consequences than underestimating it. Then, optimal values of kB(-1), obtained for each site (one fallow savannah site and two millet sites), ranged from 5.1 to 10.2, with significantly different values for the two millet sites. The corresponding Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between estimated and measured H ranged from 43 to 67 W m(-2). Finally, the instantaneous Values of kB(-1) proved to be highly variable and the parameterization of kB(-1) proposed by Kustas et al. (1989) as a function of u(T-r - T-a) appeared valid only for high H values. For lower values, the slope of this relationship must be adjusted for each class of H. All the previous results confirmed that a constant value can neither be assumed for semi-arid areas nor for a given type of vegetation and that further studies are needed to understand its behaviour. Considering the difficulty in predicting the kB(-1) values, a different approach based on the relationship observed between aerodynamic and radiometric temperatures was investigated. This approach gave more accurate estimate of H (RMSE between 35 and 48 W m(-2)), but remains at this stage purely empirical. Further investigation is now needed to predict the parameterization of this approach.

AB Focusing on the problem of estimating direct runoff over a watershed resulting from rainfall excess, the goal of this study is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) that explicitly accounts within its architecture for the geomorphologic characteristics of the watershed. Such a geomorphology-based artificial neural network (GANN) is utilized to estimate runoff hydrographs from several storms over two Indiana watersheds. The architecture of the GANNs as well as a part of the network connection strengths are determined by watershed geomorphology, leading to a parsimonious ANN modeling tool. Comparisons of validation results from the GANN model with observed hydrographs over several events for two watersheds are presented. Results obtained by using the geomorphologic unit hydrograph theory (GIUH) are also included for illustration purposes. This study reveals GANNs to be promising tools for estimating direct runoff.

AB The objective of this paper is to empirically test the explanatory ability of cultural capital, which is generally considered more qualitatively and rarely quantified, for farmers' water conservation behavior. In applying this approach, we reflect the growing interest in the role of culture and identity in influencing farmer's decision-making. The study design involved a cross-sectional survey of growers in the Aleshtar county in Western Iran. The sample consisted of 360 farmers. The results of person correlation test showed significant relationships between all forms of cultural capital and both intention to behave and behavior. Furthermore, Structural Equation Model analysis revealed that the embodied and objective forms of capital predicted about 43% of the variance in farmers' intention. Moreover, the institutionalised, objective, intension and family experiences predicted about 45% of the variance in farmers' behavior. Based on the research results, recommendations for water conservation were provided.

AB Sediment transport capacity (T-c) is a key parameter for all process-based erosion models. The objective of this study was to develop a new approach for accurate determination of Tc under infiltration conditions based on rill morphology and the sediment feedback relationship. This would allow the way in which sediment transport capacity is computed in WEPP and GUEST models. Six-m long rills in three soils were subjected to constant inflow rates (50, 75 and 122 ml s(-1)) and three flume slope gradients (2%, 4% and 6%). Cross-sections of rills were measured precisely at 0.5 m intervals using a profile-meter prior to and after each experiment. The cumulative net rates of erosion at the end of each section were converted to sediment load along the rill length. The sediment feedback relationship was applied to fit the sediment load values and T-c was determined asymptotically under equilibrium conditions. The results showed that under infiltration conditions, both models tended to under-estimate T-c, however, T, predicted using the GUEST model had better agreement with the measured T-c values than that predicted with WEPP. Using the proposed value of F= 0.15, the performance of GUEST in predicting T-c could be further improved. Sidewall slumping was found to be a plausible explanation for underestimation of T-c by WEPP, which is not explicitly modeled. In contrast, GUEST takes into account any observed changes in rill morphology. The results also indicated that T-c increased as a function of flow discharge and slope gradient, but was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow discharge. Moreover, stream power was found to be a better predictor of T-c than shear stress. Yet, regression equations using unit discharge and slope gradient as independent variables, did not achieve any better estimation of T-c than did the GUEST (when F = 0.15). Accurate determination of parameter(s) used in a process-based model such as GUEST will lead to improved T-c estimations. Furthermore, Tc is a process-based parameter which should not ideally be estimated with regression equations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater vulnerability mapping is increasingly being used to design aquifer protection and management strategies. This paper presents a dynamic visualization method to groundwater vulnerability mapping. This method-called V-DRASTIC-extends the capacities of DRASTIC, an overlay/index technique that has been applied worldwide to evaluate the condition of hydrogeological factors and determine groundwater vulnerability at regional scales. V-DRASTIC is based upon psychophysics' principles (a theory that describes the people's response to a stimulus) to generate alternative groundwater vulnerability categorization schemes. These are used as inputs in a fuzzy pattern recognition procedure to enable planners, decision makers and stakeholders identify which scheme conveys meaningful information regarding groundwater vulnerability across a territory. V-DRASTIC was applied in the groundwater vulnerability assessment of two urban watersheds in Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Legal disputes as a proxy for regional conflicts over water rights in

AB Water demand and climate variability increases competition and tension between water users agricultural, industrial, mining, hydropower- and local communities. Since 1981, the Water Code has regulated water allocation through private individual property rights, fostering markets as the distribution mechanism among users. When legal conflicts occur between parties, it is the responsibility of the courts to settle the conflict. The aim of this research is twofold: first, to apply a geographical approach by mapping water conflicts using legal disputes reaching the higher courts as a proxy for conflict intensity and second, to explain the diversity of water disputes and how they vary regionally. We built a representative database with a sample of 1000 legal records corresponding to decisions issued by the Supreme Court and 17 courts of appeal throughout the country from 1981 to 2014. For geo-tagging, all records were transformed to plain text and analyzed to find words matching the entries of a geographical thesaurus, allowing records to be linked to geographical locations. The geo-tagging algorithm is capable of automatically populating a searchable database. Several maps were constructed using a color scale to visualize conflict intensity. Legal disputes represent different types of conflicts among water users, such as competition between agriculture and hydropower. Processed data allowed the identification of the regional variation of conflicts. The spatial pattern for the intensity of conflicts related to specific sections of the Water Code is explained in terms of the main geographical, climatic and productive characteristics of Chile. Geo-tagging legal records shows a strong potential to understand and define regional variation of water conflicts. However, data availability would become a barrier if measures to improve data management were not taken. Regarding the institutional framework, the same regulations for water management rules are applied throughout the highly diverse ecosystems of the country, impeding the resolution of conflicts that are strongly related to the local geographical context. This leads to a collision of interests and visions around water resources of both a public and private, extractive and non-extractive uses, national, and international nature of individuals, aboriginal communities, and corporations, especially mining industries.

AB In this paper, we introduce 2D profile analytical models describing advection solute transport induced by a recharge boundary condition in a catchment-scale aquifer represented by a sediment or rock with permeability changing with depth. The suggested mathematical formulation is based on the concept of transit time distribution (TTD), according to which the concentration trend can be derived directly from the cumulative travel time frequency or from the convolution of TTD (considered as a transfer function) with a solute input function. This approach is shown to be applicable to water flow and solute transport in an aquifer characterized by a vertical hydraulic conductivity profile, k(z), which can be described by either continuous (e.g., massive rock exhibiting an exponential or power-law dependence of k on depth) or discrete (a stratified aquifer) analytical functions. A special focus is on the problem related to advection solute transport in a rectangular anisotropic flow domain bounded by a shallow stream of finite width (downflow-converging area). The suggested analytical models and solutions, utilizing new transfer functions and accounting for different inflow and solute flux conditions, can be involved in several applications, including the assessment of the impacts of spatially variable nonpoint contamination sources on groundwater quality; groundwater dating based on the observation of environmental tracers; and the study of groundwater recharge itself. The models were shown to be applicable not only to simulating the impact on groundwater due to the contaminated recharge, but also to predicting aquifer contamination caused by a source located below the water table within the aquifer domain. Such source can be associated with a radioactive material leachate generated within a deep geological repository of nuclear waste. A relevant modeling example is given.

AB In this study, data from continuous measurement of natural rainfall and runoff rates on nine 2 m(2) runoff plots were used to analyse the dynamics of infiltration and how it relates to the evolution of the soil surface state. All measurements were performed on two cropped sites in northern France on low slope loess soils, with low rainfall intensities. Crops represented were maize, wheat and sugar beet. Infiltrability was characterized at the scale of the plot and of the rainfall event by a single parameter, the constant infiltrability that yields an excess rainfall hyetograph with a volume equal to the measured runoff volume (phi index). Results indicated that: (1) even if the runoff plots were installed on two catchments where water erosion was important, the observed runoff volumes and intensities were very small. The runoff to rainfall ratio was typically less than 5% at the season to year scale; (2) the apparent infiltrability phi cannot be defined independently from rainfall intensity when runoff at the outlet of a plot comes from only a subset of the plot area. The relationship between rainfall intensity and apparent infiltrability can be used to estimate the relative runoff contributing area (approximate to 0.10-0.35 in ourcase); (3) the development and nature of surface crusting has a major influence on the apparent infiltrability: there is a progressive shift of phi toward low values when crusting develops, which is predominantly due to an increase in the relative contributing area. From a methodological point of view, failure to include the rainfall intensity dependence of infiltrability in runoff modelling could introduce large errors on runoff predictions. This relationship between rainfall intensity and apparent infiltrability should thus be analysed when possible, and soil surface state characterization should include more information about connection between the different parts of a plot and its outlet.

AB A discrete version of the Kalinin-Milyukov-Nash-cascade is formulated for operational forecasting of stream stages when no information of rating curves is available. Model performance is slightly reduced in comparison to flow routing results using accurate, single-valued stage-discharge relationships. However, when only inaccurate rating curves are available, the present approach may yield superior forecasts. Since in practice the accuracy of the employed rating curves, used to convert stage measurements into discharge values for flow routing, may be somewhat uncertain, application of the present technique is recommended for rating-curve falsification. The method allows for stage predictions using physically based flow routing in rivers where flow rates are unknown or the available rating curves are inaccurate. The technique can also be used without modification for streams with tributaries. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recharge events in karst catchments are often accompanied by rapid changes of electrical conductivity, temperature or turbidity in associated karst springs. Turbidity is usually used as a proxy for suspended matter. However, it is not capable to characterize suspended matter in detail as it lumps signals of particles of a wide range of sizes. Changes in particle size distribution (PSD) of suspended matter have rarely been measured although they may contain information on particles' origin, transport, or mobilization. In few cases PSD could even be used to predict bacterial contamination of karst springs. This study is one among few, measuring concentrations of suspended particles in the size range of 0.5-150 mu m on-site and in real-time. The study was performed during a single snow-melt event at one individual karst spring (Gallusquelle, Germany), the findings are therefore of preliminary character. Generally, the PSDs follow a power law (Pareto distribution). In some cases, however, a two parted Pareto distribution provides a better fit. The combination of chemograph analysis and turbidigraph separation demonstrates remobilized (autochthonous) and freshly infiltrated suspended (allochthonous) matter. Visually, there is no relation between PSD and the origin of the suspended matter. This may be caused by the superposition of signals from both origins. Therefore, utilizing the PSD as an indicator for the origin of suspended matter may be restricted to local applications. Furthermore, PSD does not seem to be a clear indicator for a bacterial contamination at the investigated spring, at least for this particular event. The study indicates, that the karst system itself and the type of discharge event may play a crucial role in the successful application of PSD as an adequate source indicator for suspended matter.

AB This paper considers the imbalanced binary classification problem by focusing on the application of the short -term rainfall forecasting in arid and semi-arid regions. Specifically, we present a novel boosting-type method by utilizing the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution as the link function and applying a gradient tree boosting algorithm to capture complex interactions among covariates. The proposed method has several appealing advantages such as, it can identify rare rainfall events as well as quantifying the uncertainties; it is data-driven that without any assumption on the relationship between the covariates and the rainfall event; the fitted model is highly interpretable, making it a useful tool for studying the rainfall mechanisms in arid and semi-arid regions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms its competing methods.

AB This study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information. This was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km(2), 790 km(2), and 4400 km(2). In situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in Iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope-scale model parameters are independent. Soil moisture dry-downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data. The statistical nature of dry-downs were parameterized using a power-law decay, and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non-dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit. The resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation, sigma(theta), and skewness G(theta) as a function of the areal average. We show that the greatest information content (small spatial standard deviation) of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with sigma(theta) < 5%, while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with sigma(theta) > 20%. The differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable. However, this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub-grid and basin scale variability, documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information. These results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications.

AB Sensitivity of hydrological models to input data errors have been reported in the literature for particular models on a single or a few catchments. A more important issue, i.e. how model's response to input data error changes as the catchment conditions change has not been addressed previously. This study investigates the seasonal and spatial effects, of precipitation data errors on the performance of conceptual hydrological models. For this study, a monthly conceptual water balance model, NOPEX-6, was applied to 26 catchments in the Malaren basin in Central Sweden. Both systematic and random errors were considered. For the systematic errors, 5-15% of mean monthly precipitation values were added to the original precipitation to form the corrupted input scenarios. Random values were generated by Monte Carlo simulation and were assumed to be (1) independent between months, and (2) distributed according to a Gaussian law of zero mean and constant standard deviation that were taken as 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% of the mean monthly standard deviation of precipitation. The results show that the response of the model parameters and model performance depends, among others, on the type of the error, the magnitude of the error, physical characteristics of the catchment, and the season of the year. In particular, the model appears less sensitive to the random error than to the systematic error. The catchments with smaller values of runoff coefficients were more influenced by input data errors than were the catchments with higher values. Dry months were more sensitive to precipitation errors than were wet months. Recalibration of the model with erroneous data compensated in part for the data errors by altering the model parameters.

AB Current approaches to constructing catchment intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are dominated by the use of empirically-derived areal reduction factors (ARFs). In this paper we present an alternative methodology which is based on the spatial correlation structure of rainfall. It represents an attempt to link current scientific theories of space-time rainfall fields with design methods. The starting point is to derive the parent distribution of catchment average rainfall intensity from that of point rainfall intensity. The parameters of the two parent distributions are related through a variance reduction factor which is a function of the spatial correlation structure of rainfall and catchment area. Assuming that the parent distribution is of the 'exponential type', it is then transformed to an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type. The crucial step is to match the parameters of the extreme rainfall distribution derived above, for the particular case of zero catchment area, with those of empirical point IDF curves which have also been fitted to the Gumbel distribution. With this match, the proposed theory then naturally generalises to yield catchment IDF curves for catchments of any size, and for rainfall of any spatial correlation structure. The new catchment IDF curves have the attractive property that, with a minimum number of assumptions, they can reproduce a range of observed properties of catchment rainfall. For example, not only the mean and the standard deviation of extreme rainfall, but also its coefficient of variation, decrease with increasing catchment area. We also find that computed ARFs using the new approach depend not only on catchment area and storm duration, but also on the return period. We estimate ARFs using the new methodology for two major observed storms in Austria, and find that these estimates compare favourably with our understanding of the rainfall generating mechanisms associated with these two particular storm types.

AB Soil moisture at high spatial resolution is required for various land processes related studies. However, currently the resolution of passive microwave retrieved soil moisture is low - around 25 km. To solve this problem, a soil moisture disaggregation algorithm based on thermal inertia relationship between daily temperature change and average soil moisture modulated by vegetation conditions has been formulated. This algorithm was applied to the AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System) as well as SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite) to produce the 1 km downscaled soil moisture over the Little Washita Watershed in Oklahoma for the growing season in 2010 and 2011. The disaggregated soil moisture has been compared to in situ observations. The results of this approach are very encouraging. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB River hydrology on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) is particularly sensitive to climate change, through the serious impacts of the decline in Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall and the accelerated melting of snow and glaciers during the recent decades. Investigating the effects of meltwater and rainfall on the seasonality and quantity of river runoff in the region is crucial for improving regional hydrological monitoring and water management, and water stable isotopes can provide an effective method. Based on the event-based data of precipitation and river water isotopes, river discharge and meteorology monitored at a hydrometric station of the Nyang River on the SETP in 2011, we show that river discharge has a strong reliance on temperature and precipitation simultaneously through their controls on the meltwater and rainfall runoff, and river water deuterium excess (d) and delta 18O potentially track the meltwater and rainfall effects separately. The seasonal signals of river discharge and isotopic data provide evidence that meltwater is the key factor of river discharge and isotopic changes during the pre-ISM season (low water level period) and ISM rainfall during the early to mid-ISM season (growing and high water level period) but key factors are not clear during the mid to post-ISM season (recession period). These inferred seasonal runoff source relationships are in close agreement with the runoff source contributions estimated using a season-specific delta 18O-d mixing model approach. Specifically, the result suggests meltwater contributes-28 %,-41 % and-25 % of the total river runoff, and snowmelt does make a major contribution to the meltwater (compared to glacier melt) during the three individual hydrological periods. This study investigated the event-based river discharge and isotopic responses to temperature and precipitation and the relevance of seasonal meltwater and rainfall effects for a representative basin on the SETP, and we propose that long-term isotopic record of river water in this region may document catchment changes in runoff source relationships (especially snowmelt vs ISM rainfall).

AB A better understanding of the storm surge phenomenon is essential for coastal protection, future planning, and coastal ecosystem conservation. Using hourly sea level data from 15 tide gauges along the coastline of China the metrics, skew surge and residual water level, which are used to represent storm surges, are compared in this study. The relationship between residual water level, skew surge and predicted high tide were analyzed using two statistical measurements. The results showed that unlike the annual maximum residual water level, the annual maximum skew surge and the astronomical high tide tended to coincide more frequently (more than 50% of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide). Thus, the skew surge was more suitable than the residual water level for use in risk-based coastal planning frameworks. Using the monthly maximum value and indices of the storm surge (storm surge number, duration and intensity), we compared the performances of skew surge and residual water level in expressing changes of storm surges. These two metrics can both capture changes in storm surge activities on seasonal, decadal and long-term scales, and correlation coefficients of storm surge intensity between residual water level and skew surge were greater than 0.80 at 11 tide gauges. At most tide gauges, the skew surge was significantly correlated with 4-5 nearby tide gauges while the residual water level was correlated with only 1-2 tide gauges, the skew surge may be a better metric for risk-based coastal planning frameworks if the interpolation method is used. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can affect the storm surge frequency along the coastline of China. The effects of the ENSO were more obvious when the residual water level was selected. In conclusion, the skew surge can be selected for use in risk-based coastal planning frameworks, while the residual water level may be a better metric for capturing the relationship between storm surges and climate changes.

AB Adequate characterization of catchment storage dynamics is crucial in hydrological models, yet scale-representative storage measurements are rare. Recent developments in Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) technology and monitoring networks provide a powerful source of more scale-appropriate soil moisture data for many modelling applications. However, the potential in rainfall-runoff modelling is undeveloped. Here we present the first application of CRNS data in conceptual rainfall-runoff modelling and explore this potential in the context of a mixed-agricultural landscape in Scotland. We deployed and calibrated a CRNS in a heterogeneous soil-land use footprint over a similar to 3-year period. In this generally wet environment, the CRNS shallow sensing depth and relatively high neutron count uncertainty were identified as major challenges. However, given the better spatial coverage (up to 14 ha) and ease for maintenance, CRNS was thought to represent the simplest approach for long-term monitoring of managed mixed-agricultural sites. We used CRNS-derived, as well as single point-scale estimates, of near-surface soil storage (S-NS) to explore their characterisation of storage dynamics at the catchment-scale. Inter-comparison using linear regression showed that SNs related well to catchment-scale storage dynamics, however this relationship was stronger for CRNS (R-2 = 0.91) compared to point-scale derived estimates (R-2 = 0.76). Based on this, we evaluated the effect of using the CRNS and point scale derived S-NS data to constrain storage estimates controlling runoff generation in a common rainfall-runoff model (HBV-light). Including CRNS or point-scale field S-NS data alone in model calibration was especially useful for intermediate and wet periods. A combined model calibration using discharge and either S-NS storage estimates provided a better representation of catchment internal dynamics, additionally reducing uncertainty during low flows. In the context of mixed-agricultural landscapes in humid environments, this study showed the potential of using CRNS over point scale data (in terms of representativeness for single point data and practicality for point sensor networks) to characterise the catchment storage-discharge relationship and inform hydrological modelling.

TI The economic value of the flow regulation environmental service in a

ID STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; LAND-COVER
AB Urban flood management have often focused either on the capacity expansion of drainage systems or on artificial detention storage. While flood control should take part early on urban planning, not enough is known to guide such plans and provide incentive to land use decisions that minimize the vulnerability to localized floods. In this paper, we offer a broader perspective on flood protection, by treating the original hydrologic flow regulation as an environmental service, and exploring how the value of this environmental service drives economic land use decisions that convert original (permeable) land into urbanized (impermeable). We investigate the relationship between land use decisions and their hydrologic consequences explicitly, and use this relationship to simulate resulting land use scenarios depending on the value attached to the environmental service of flow regulation. Rainfall-runoff simulation model results are combined to an optimization model based on two-stage stochastic programming approach to model economic land use decisions. The objective function maximizes the total expected land use benefit in an urban area, considering the opportunity cost of permeable areas in the first stage and the resulting loss of the environmental service of flow regulation on the second stage, under several probable hydrological events. A watershed in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, is used to demonstrate the approach. Different values attached to the environmental service were tested, from zero to higher than the opportunity cost of land, and artificial detention infrastructure was included to calculate the resulting land use change and the loss in the environmental service value. Results indicate that by valuing the environmental service loss and discounting it from the economic benefits of land use, alternative solutions to land use are found, with decreased peak flows and lower flood frequency. Combined solutions including structural and non-structural techniques provide more cost effective results, avoiding both the depletion of the environmental service and the high opportunity cost associated to valuable commercial urban areas. Urban development under such premises will be more resilient and adapted to local flooding, instead of relying on increasingly expensive infrastructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their substantial spatio-temporal behavior, long-term quantification and analyses of important hydrological variables are essential for practical applications in water resources planning, evaluating the water use of agricultural crop production and quantifying crop evapotranspiration patterns and irrigation management vs. hydrologic balance relationships. Observed data at over 800 sites across the Great Plains of USA, comprising of 9 states and 2,307,410 km(2) of surface area, which is about 30% of the terrestrial area of the USA, were used to quantify and map large-scale and long-term (1968-2013) spatial trends of air temperatures, daily temperature range (DTR), precipitation, grass-reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and aridity index (AI) at monthly, growing season and annual time steps. Air temperatures had a strong north to south increasing trend, with annual average varying from - 1 to 24 degrees C, and growing season average temperature varying from 8 to 30 degrees C. DTR gradually decreased from western to eastern parts of the region, with a regional annual and growing season averages of 14.25 degrees C and 14.79 degrees C, respectively. Precipitation had a gradual shift towards higher magnitudes from west to east, with the average annual and growing season (May-September) precipitation ranging from 163 to 1486 mm and from 98 to 746 mm, respectively. ETo had a southwest-northeast decreasing trend, with regional annual and growing season averages of 1297 mm and 823 mm, respectively. AI increased from west to east, indicating higher humidity (less arid) towards the east, with regional annual and growing season averages of 0.49 and 0.44, respectively. The spatial datasets and maps for these important climate variables can serve as valuable background for climate change and hydrologic studies in the Great Plains region. Through identification of priority areas from the developed maps, efforts of the concerned personnel and agencies and resources can be diverted towards development of holistic strategies to address water supply and demand challenges under changing climate. These strategies can consist of, but not limited to, advancing water, crop and soil management, and genetic improvements and their relationships with the climatic variables on large scales.

AB A laboratory technique has been developed to measure the hysteretic relationship between capillary pressure and fluid saturation for a rough-walled rock fracture under different states of normal stress.  The technique incorporates a loading system and a uniquely designed capillary barrier to the nonwetting phase which allows for fracture closure and provides excellent hydraulic connection of the wetting phase in the fracture with external pressure control.  The method is applied to a single, rough-walled fracture in limestone using oil and water as the nonwetting and wetting phase, respectively.  The measured capillary pressure curves were found to be well represented by a Brooks-Corey porous media capillary pressure function.  A distinct entry pressure, giving rise to initial nonwetting phase invasion, was observed in each test.  It was found that the inferred aperture distributions became less skewed with increased normal load.  These aperture distributions were inferred using one of three conceptual models presented for nonwetting phase invasion of a rough-walled fracture under conditions of main drainage.

Hydrol. 347, 223-228] for infiltration inflow into a porous flatroofed fresh water tens floating on the interface of an ascending Darcian saline water flow is shown to be in exact match with the Polubarinova-Kochina [Polubarinova-Kochina, P.Ya., 1977. Theory of Ground Water Movement. Nauka, Moscow (in Russian)] problem for flow in a tens capped by a cambered phreatic surface with a uniform accretion. The Maas complex potential in the domain of a heavy saline water seeping beneath the tens corresponds to one of an ideal. fluid flow past an elliptical cylinder that makes possible conversion of this potential into ascending-descending seepage flows with floating (but stagnant) DNAPL-LNAPL volumes. Similar matching is possible for the velocity potential of an axisymmetric flow past an ellipsoid and hydrostatic pressure of a stagnant NAPL body stored in a semi-ellipsoidal pond.

AB The impact of changing catchment vegetation type on mean annual runoff has been known for some time, however, the impact on the variability of annual runoff has been established only recently. Differences in annual actual evapotranspiration between vegetation types and the potential effect of changing vegetation type on mean annual runoff and the variability of annual runoff are briefly reviewed. The magnitude of any change in the variability of annual runoff owing to a change in catchment vegetation type is related to the pre- and post-change vegetation types and the seasonality of precipitation, assuming that the variability of annual precipitation remains constant throughout. Significant implications of the relationship between vegetation type and the variability of annual runoff are presented and discussed for water resource management, stream ecology and fluvial geomorphology.

AB The apparent random swirling motion of water is labeled "turbulence," which is a pervasive state of the flow in many hydrological and hydraulic transport phenomena. Water flow in a turbulent state can be described by the momentum conservation equations known as the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Solving these equations numerically or in some approximated form remains a daunting task in applications involving natural systems thereby prompting interest in alternative approaches. The apparent randomness of swirling motion encodes order that may be profitably used to describe water movement in natural systems. The goal of this primer is to illustrate the use of a technique that links aspects of this ordered state to conveyance and transport laws. This technique is "dimensional analysis", which can unpack much of the complications associated with turbulence into surprisingly simplified expressions. The use of this technique to describing water movement in streams as well as water vapor movement in the atmosphere is featured. Particular attention is paid to bulk expressions that have received support from a large body of experiments such as flow-resistance formulae, the Prandtl-von Karman log-law describing the mean velocity shape, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory that corrects the mean velocity shape for thermal stratification, and evaporation from rough surfaces. These applications illustrate how dimensional analysis offers a pragmatic approach to problem solving in sciences and engineering.

AB The lack of comprehensive studies involving the quantification of groundwater depletion and aquifer deterioration has challenged the sustainable management of groundwater resources in semi-arid regions. In this study, we formulated a new pragmatic relationship consisting of a set of equations to quantify contaminated groundwater volume and groundwater virtually lost through contamination. We also used extensive monitoring of the hydraulic head and its spatio-temporal variations as well as groundwater modeling to quantify total aquifer volume, aquifer storage, and aquifer depletion. The watershed is divided into three distinct zones based on groundwater level fluctuations and recharge (Intermediate Borewell Zone-IBW, Random Borewell Zone- RBW, and Slow Borewell Zone-SBW zones). This study provides an advanced understanding of the relationship between aquifer depletion, geogenic contamination and the resultant virtual groundwater loss. Our long-term study reveals a negative change in storage/groundwater loss in poor monsoon years and a reduction in total groundwater volume which can result in aquifer depletion over time and low groundwater reserves. The decadal estimations of groundwater gain/loss for a period of ten years (2001-2010) in the IBW zone of the aquifer show a groundwater gain of 3.03 mcm (million cubic metes) but at the same time, this zone has virtually lost 1.06 mcm to contamination. Similarly, 1.3 mcm gain is estimated in the RBW zone and 0.53 mcm loss of groundwater is estimated in the SBW. The virtual groundwater losses through contamination in RBW and SBW zones are 4.5 mcm and 16 mcm. In such a situation an aquifer depletion stage beyond an economic level will be reached in most of the watershed in a few years. The contamination in these years is also high which may result in virtual loss through contamination. Under such conditions, the groundwater resource may be conditionally renewable as a part of the groundwater volume remains contaminated and unusable. These results highlight the need to understand the interconnection between groundwater contamination and continued over-exploitation which gradually moves towards aquifer depletion and conditionally renewable groundwater resources.

AB Comprising mainly fog water, dew water, and water-vapor adsorption (WVA), non-rainfall water (NRW) makes an important contribution to the local ecology in the arid and semi-arid regions. Although NRW components have been studied individually in previous work, little attention has been paid to the integrated characteristics of NRW and the corresponding relationships among the components. In fact, few other studies have considered how NRW components form and change, let alone how they contribute to land surface water (LSW) balance and influence crop water requirements in China. In this paper, a method will be established for identifying components of NRW, based on a combination of lysimeter measurements and micro-meteorological data from Dingxi Station in the summer monsoon transition zone (SMTZ) of China. Diurnal time series of NRW components will be given. The relationship between NRW and climatic and environmental factors is then analyzed. Finally, the diurnal and annual variations of NRW and how they contribute to LSW balance and crop water requirements are discussed. The results show that the influence of climatic and environmental conditions to occur dew and WVA is different even opposite affects such as relative humidity to that. There is negative feedback between soil moisture and WVA; this does not hold, however, for dew. The variation characteristics of dew and WVA are different. Their diurnal variation shows the complementary characteristics of each other. Not only that, the annual distribution of NRW also complemented with that of precipitation. Although NRW contributes to no more than 15% of the water balance in a full year, NRW plays a leading role during the non-monsoon period, wherein the amount of NRW is 1-3.5 times that of precipitation. Moreover, it is just the period of soil water conservation and sowing date for crops such as winter wheat. Therefore, the existence of NRW is fundamental for alleviating agricultural drought. It explained that NRW has great significance for reducing agricultural losses and understanding the LSW balance in the SMTZ.

TI Incorporating the effect of gas in modelling the impact of CBM
   extraction on regional groundwater systems
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Coalbed Methane; Reservoir model; Regional groundwater model; Multiphase
   flow; Richards equation
ID COALBED METHANE; PERMEABILITY; MANAGEMENT; WATER
AB Production of Coalbed Methane (CBM) requires extraction of large quantities of groundwater. To date, standard groundwater flow simulators have mostly been used to assess the impact of this extraction on regional groundwater systems. Recent research has demonstrated that predictions of regional impact assessment made by such models may be seriously compromised unless account is taken of the presence of a gas phase near extraction wells. At the same time, CBM impact assessment must accommodate the traditional requirements of regional groundwater modelling. These include representation of surficial groundwater processes and up-scaled rock properties as well as the need for calibration and predictive uncertainty quantification. The study documented herein (1) quantifies errors in regional drawdown predictions incurred through neglect of the presence of a gas phase near CBM extraction centres, and (2) evaluates the extent to which these errors can be mitigated by simulating near-well desaturation using a modified Richards equation formulation within a standard groundwater flow simulator. Two synthetic examples are provided to quantify the impact of the gas phase and verify the proposed modelling approach (implemented in MODFLOW-USG) against rigorous multiphase flow simulations (undertaken using ECLIPSE*). ECLIPSE simulations demonstrate convergence towards a time-asymptotic relationship between water saturation and pressure. This relationship can be approximated using a slightly modified van Genuchten function. Where this function is employed in combination with the modified Richards equation strategy to accommodate near-well desaturation, errors in predicted drawdown are reduced significantly, including in cases where complexities such as sloping coal layers are introduced to the model domain (the latter promoting buoyancy-driven movement of gas). Sensitivity analyses further indicate that only the general properties of the employed desaturation function need to be respected to significantly reduce errors in regional drawdown predictions that would arise if the presence of the near-well gas phase was ignored. These properties can be inferred from reservoir properties and from the outcomes of reservoir model simulations that are available at local CBM operation sites.

DE Residence times; DOC; Solute dynamics; Greenhouse gases

AB There is increasing interest in characterising the diurnal fluctuation of stream solute concentrations because observed data series derived from spot samples may be highly subjective if such diurnal fluctuations are large. This can therefore lead to large uncertainties, bias or systematic errors in calculation of fluvial solute fluxes, depending upon the particular sampling regime. A simplistic approach would be to assume diurnal fluctuations are constant throughout the water year, but this study proposes diurnal cycles in stream water quality can only be interpreted in the context of stream residence time and changing day length. Three years of hourly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and flow data from the River Dee catchment (1674 km(2)) were analysed, and statistical analysis of the entire record shows there is no consistent diurnal cycle in the record. From the 3-year record (1095 days) there were only 96 diurnal cycles could be analysed. Cycles were quantified in terms of their: relative and absolute amplitude; duration; time to maximum concentration; asymmetry; percentile flow and in-stream residence time.
   The median diurnal cycle showed an amplitude that was 9.2% of the starting concentration; it was not significantly asymmetric; and occurred at the 19th percentile flow. The median DOC removal rate was 0.07 mg C/l/hr with an inter-quartile range of 0.052-0.100 mg C/l/hr. Results were interpreted as controlled by two, separate, zero-order kinetic rate laws, one for the day and one for the night. There was no single diurnal cycle present across the record, rather a number of different cycles controlled by the combination of in-stream residence time and exposure to contrasting light conditions. Over the 3-year period the average in-stream loss of DOC was 32%. The diurnal cycles evident in high resolution DOC data are interpretable, but require contextual information for their influence on in-stream processes to be understood or for them to be utilised.

AB The St Venant equation is used to model the steady flow of water on a low slope through a grass buffer strip represented by beds of nails of various densities. The analytical solution is obtained both for flow upstream and within the buffer strip. Solution only requires the boundary conditions far upstream to be given and no curve fitting of parameters. The sensitivity of the solution to uncertainty in the measured boundary conditions and the effect of the theoretical resistive flow equation used are explored. Differences are observed between experimental observations and the theory but these are likely to be due to the presence of turbulent waves at the surface of the flow which are not part of the model.

AB The exchange of proglacial river water with active layer pore water could alter water chemical compositions in glacial outwash plains and oceanic solute fluxes. To evaluate effects of this exchange, we sampled Watson River and adjacent pore water during the 2013 melt season at two sandurs in western Greenland; one in Sandflugtdalen and the other near the confluence with Sondre Stromfjord. We measured temperature, specific conductivity, and head gradients between the river and bank over a week-long period at Sandflugtdalen, as well as sediment hydraulic conductivity and chemical compositions of waters from both sites. Specific conductivity of pore water is four to ten times greater than river water as solutes are concentrated from weathering reactions, cryoconcentration, and evaporation. Pore water compositions are predominantly altered by carbonate dissolution and sulfide mineral oxidation. High concentrations of HCO3 and SO4 result from solute recycling and dissolution of secondary Ca-Mg carbonate/sulfate salts initially formed by near-surface evaporation in the summer and at depth by freeze-in of the active layer and cryoconcentration in the winter. High hydraulic conductivity (10(-5) to 10(-4) m/s) and diurnal fluctuations of river stage during our study caused exchange of river and pore water immediately adjacent to the river channel, with a net loss of river water to the bank. Pore water >6 m from the river continuously flowed away from the river. Approximately 1-8% of the river discharge through the Sandflugtdalen was lost to the river bank during our 6.75 day study based on calculations using Darcy's Law. Although not sampled, some of this water should discharge to the river during low river stage early and late in the melt season. Elevated pore water solute concentrations in sandurs and water exchange at diurnal and seasonal frequency should impact fluxes of solutes to the ocean, although understanding the magnitude of this effect will require long-term evaluation throughout the melt season.

AB In the context of environmental remediation of contaminated sites and safety assessment of nuclear waste disposal in the near-surface zone, we investigate the leaching and non-Fickian dispersive migration with sorption of strontium (mocking strontium-90) through columns packed with sand and clay. Analysis is based on breakthrough curves (BTCs) from column experiments, which simulated rainfall infiltration and source term release scenario, rather than applying constant tracer solution at the inlet as commonly used. BTCs are re-evaluated and transport parameters are estimated by inverse modelling using two approaches: (1) equilibrium advection-dispersion equation (ADE); and (2) continuous time random walk (CTRW). Firstly, based on a method for calculating leach concentration, the inlet condition with an exponential decay input is identified. Secondly, the results show that approximately 39%-58% of Br- and 16%-49% of Sr2+ are eluted from the columns at the end of the breakthrough experiments. This suggests that trapping mechanisms, including diffusion into immobile zones and attachment of tracer on mineral surfaces, are more pronounced for Sr2+ than for Br-. Thirdly, we demonstrate robustness of CTRW-based truncated power-law (TPL) model in capturing non-Fickian reactive transport with 0 < beta < 2, and Fickian transport with beta > 2. The non-Fickian dispersion observed experimentally is explained by variations of local flow field from preferential flow paths due to physical heterogeneities. Particularly, the additional sorption process of strontium on clay minerals contributes to the delay of the peak concentration and the tailing features, which leads to an enhanced non-Fickian transport for strontium. Finally, the ADE and CTRW approaches to environmental modelling are evaluated. It is shown that CTRW with a sorption term can describe non-Fickian dispersive transport of strontium at laboratory scale by identifying appropriate parameters, while the traditional ADE with a retardation factor fails to reproduce the complex non-Fickian transport of strontium with strong sorption on clay surface.

AB Understanding dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and corresponding driving factors are essential to improve aquatic environments and protect aquatic organisms. Although several studies have been conducted to investi-gate DO dynamics on low-frequency scales, high-frequency spectral characteristics of DO and the corresponding connections with hydro-biogeochemical drivers were little known. Accordingly, this study proposed a compre-hensive framework to explore the periodic and aperiodic characteristics of DO, and the corresponding hydro-logical (water temperature) and biogeochemical (pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP)) controls in the Pearl River Basin of China based on high-frequency measurements and spectral analysis. The results showed that DO, water temperature, pH, NH3-N and TP all exhibited temporal fractal phenomena, i.e., 1/f fluctuations, in low-frequency domains. The scaling component beta of water temperature was larger, implying that the self-similarity of water temperature was stronger. In high-frequency domains, DO exhibited obvious daily and half-day periods. Of the other four elements, water temperature and pH exhibited high-frequency periods, while NH3-N and TP did not. Based on the energy distribution derived from the continuous wavelet transform, three DO transience types, swing, abrupt, and mixed swing and abrupt, were characterized. The first type was char-acterized by continuous fluctuations, while the second type was characterized by a sudden change with a peak value. The last type had traits of both swing transience and abrupt transience. Through an analysis of maximal information coefficient and correlation coefficient, we found that linear relationships existed between water temperature and DO with correlation coefficient ranging from-0.46 to-0.83. In contrast, pH, NH3-N, and TP generally exhibited nonlinear relationships with DO, and the nonlinear coefficients were above 0.2. On the whole, the driving elements were different for each DO transience type. Hydrological elements mainly corre-sponded to DO swing transience. In contrast, biogeochemical elements were mainly related to DO abrupt transience. In general, this study provided a new perspective for revealing the high-frequency fluctuations of DO and corresponding drivers. The framework and results summarized in this study broadened our understanding on DO dynamics, and were conducive to river management, such as water quality anomaly detection, water quality prediction and regulation in advance.

AB Reducing nutrient input in aquatic ecosystems has been widely recognized as a way to mitigate eutrophication. The paradigm of nutrient limitation by N and P is pervasively accepted, without considering the possibility of C limitation. However, our assumption that C might affect the aquatic biological composition, lacks fieldwork support. We tested the co-limitation of C/N/P on the growth of submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton in the Caohai Lake, a typical shallow karst lake in southwestern China. This study documented the seasonal variations in the concentration and comparative availability of nutrients C/N/P, in addition to physicochemical parameters, submerged macrophytes biomass, and phytoplankton composition in the lake. Our results show that dissolved inorganic carbon plays a substantial role in enhancing the primary production of phytoplankton and macrophytes, which suggests that primary production can be suppressed not only by P and/or N (as generally believed) but also by C, owing to the unique physicochemical characteristics that prevail in typical karst regions. Additionally, submerged macrophytes have been found to inhibit phytoplankton growth. Further analysis showed that the proportion of Cyanobacteria over Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta throughout the year was reduced at dissolved carbon dioxide/total nitrogen (CO2/TN) ratios (>0.2) and dissolved carbon dioxide/total phosphorus (CO2/TP) ratios (>10) in this study. Isotopic evidence further indicated that the abundance of Cyanobacteria was reduced when CO2 >30 mu mol/L. In summary, the combined results suggest that when controlling N and P, CO2 fertilization may significantly affect both the growth and composition of phytoplankton communities/submerged macrophytes and carbon sequestration in karst surface water ecosystems. This implies a new "paradigm" in the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms by adding more CO2 to aquatic ecosystems with low pCO2, during which carbon sequestration may also be enhanced.

AB This study provides numerical simulation and experimental evidence of flow through a rough conduit from the perspective of energy loss. We have chosen four different types of relative roughness based on the experiment of Huang et al. (2013b) for the numerical simulations. The corresponding experimental data were compared to verify the correctness of the numerical simulation. The experimental and numerical simulation results both concur that the specific discharge (q) in the rough conduit is obviously affected by different roughness of conduit. When q is somewhat the same, a larger relative roughness will lead to a larger hydraulic gradient (J). However, the q-J curves obtained experimentally and numerically are both smooth, do not show obvious dividing points of transition from Darcian flow to non-Darcian flow. We have quantified the energy loss of different rough conduits according to different flow regimes, which appear to impose different impacts on energy loss. In the laminar flow regime, the relationship between q and the energy loss is linear, while in the fully developed turbulent flow regime, such a relationship becomes quadratic. Moreover, we used the local head loss coefficient (sigma) as an indicator to reflect the energy dissipation influenced by the relative roughness, and found that decreased gradually with the increase of q, and finally tended to an asymptotic constant. In addition, we have observed the high-resolution velocity variation inside the rough conduit and the streamline distribution inside the recirculation region in detail. In the laminar flow regime, the streamlines deflect but are generally along directions somewhat parallel to the conduit wall. When the relative roughness to the maximum relative roughness reaches 1/2.4, the streamline will deflect more sharply even if q is relatively small. However, in the fully developed turbulent flow regime, the deflection of streamline and eddy will be more striking, the recirculation region becomes clearly visible even for relatively small q values within the fully developed turbulent flow regime.

AB The impacts of large-scale climate oscillations on hydrological systems and their variability have been documented in different parts of the world. Since hydroclimatic data are known to exhibit non stationary characteristics, spectral analyses such as wavelet transforms are very useful in extracting time-frequency information from such data. As Canadian studies, particularly those of regions east of the Prairies, using wavelet transform-based methods to draw links between relevant climate indices [e.g., the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)] and streamflow variability are not common, this study aims to analyze such relationships for the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario. Monthly and annual streamflow data with a record length of 55 years were used to capture streamflow variability at intra-annual, inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. The continuous wavelet transform spectra of monthly streamflow data revealed consistent significant 6- and 12-month periodicities, which are likely associated with strong seasonality factors. Its annual counterparts showed four different significant periodicities: up to 4 years, 4-6 years, 6-8 years, and greater than 8 years - all of which occurred after the late 1960s/early 1970s. Wavelet coherence analyses show that the influence of ENSO and NAO at the inter-annual scale occurs at 2-6 year periodicities, and the influence of PDO occur at periodicities up to 8 years and exceeding 16 years. Correlations between these climate indices and streamflow were computed to determine the time delay of streamflow response to the influence of ENSO, NAO, and PDO. The lag times ranged from 6-48 months (for monthly data) and 1-4 years (for annual data). This research contributes to our understanding of streamflow variability over the southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, and the role of ENSO, NAO, and PDO phenomena on this variability. These relationships can be also used to improve hydrological forecasting and water resources management in Ontario and Quebec. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water balance characteristics and rainfall-runoff relationships of karst slope, are poorly understood worldwide, even though karst landscapes occupy 10-15% the planet's land surface. Dynamic hydrological responses were monitored for 43 rainfall events on a karst slope in southwest China over two years (2018-2019). The responses included surface, subsurface, and epikarst seepage runoff (abbreviated as SR, SSR, and ESR, respectively) and soil water content at different depths (10 cm, 30 cm, and the soil-epikarst interface) in twelve plots (5 m x 20 m, total 1200 m2). Results showed that: (1) The hillslope-scale SR, SSR, and ESR coefficients were 2.2% (0.4%-5.2%), 3.8% (0.2%-12.4%), and 31.2% (0.6%-89.1), respectively. SR and SSR were relatively rare and of short duration, while ESR was a crucial component of the karst hillslope water balance and its duration was longer, demonstrating the critical role of epikarst zone in regulating flow functions such as water storage and release; (2) Soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on SR, which increased as soil deepened. Factors controlling the rainfall-SSR response were difficult to identify. They require other geophysical exploration methods; (3) Threshold-like runoff responses to rainfall inputs were observed on karst slope, and the rainfall depth (P) runoff initiation thresholds for SR and SSR were 36 +/- 2 mm and 43 +/- 7 mm, respectively. The strength of the thresholdlike input-output relationships was slightly greater when the P + ASI (antecedent soil water content index) was used as the hydrological input variable rather than without consideration of ASI. The differing shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours, such as the 'hockey stick', 'heaviside' function, or the sigmoid function were detected in karst slope. This suggests karst hydrological system complexity. Threshold values should be determined according to the shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours. These results extend the understanding of karst hydrological processes.

AB The low-resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale. Aiming to overcome this limitation, a random forest (RF)-based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) SSM product with the synergistic use of the Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. The Iberian Peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016.
   First, the performance of the RF-based approach in building the SSM relationship model with surface variables (surface temperature, vegetation index, leaf area index, albedo, water index, solar factor, and elevation) was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial-based relationship model. Good agreement was achieved for the RF-based method with a correlation coefficient (R) above 0.95 and a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.009 m(3)/m(3).
   Next, four data combinations (AM + Terra, AM + Aqua, PM + Terra, and PM + Aqua) were generated according to the different overpass times of the SMAP and MODIS observations, and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SSM with the proposed RF-based downscaling method. Validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network of the University of Salamanca in Spain. The results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.022 m(3)/m(3), and the downscaled SSM at 1-km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern.
   Finally, the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled SSM was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area, and the rainfall effect on the variation of SSM was well tracked from its temporal changes.
   Overall, this study suggests that the proposed RF-based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of SSM well, and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales.

AB Well testing in double-porosity fractured aquifers or oil and gas reservoirs is one of the long-lasting research problems in subsurface hydrology and petroleum engineering, where the double-porosity implies that the media of concern can be approximated as a two interrelated continuums (fracture network and rock matrix) with two distinctively different porosities. However, most of those studies in double-porosity fractured aquifers only concern Darcian flow in the fractured continuum. In this study, we will expand such studies from Darcian flow regime to non-Darcian flow regime, which is most likely to be the case for the field well testing site reported in this investigation. New solutions based on power law and a linearization approximation are obtained for hydraulic heads in Laplace domain and subsequently inverted to give spatiotemporal distributions in real-time domain. The non-Darcian flow model in single porosity media is obtained by setting the leakage coefficient (C) to 0 or the storage coefficient of the matrix (S-m) to 0, where C is the rate of fluid transfer between the fracture and rock matrix. Parameter analysis is conducted using dimensionless formats. A larger dimensionless quasi conductivity coefficient K-qD, a larger drawdown in the early stage, and a smaller drawdown in the late stage. The dimensionless parameters C-D and phi influence the drawdown in transitional state, and the values get larger, the drawdown in transitional state drop smaller. A pumping test conducted in Huangtun, Anhui province of China has been applied to test the non-Darcian flow effect in a double-porosity aquifer, in which a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm will be applied here to seek the optimal hydraulic parameters. As the result shows, the observed drawdown data fit well with the new model in the pumping stage. The predicted recovery drawdown curve with the calculated parameters of the new model also performs well with the field drawdown data, which supports the applicability of the new model to interpret the field data.

AB Dissolved carbon in lakes play a vital role in the global carbon cycling. The concentration and dynamics of lake dissolved carbon can be influenced by both the surrounding landscape and a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes within the lakes themselves. From 2009 to 2016, we conducted a large-scale assessment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in 249 lakes across a diverse range of climatic, geopedologic, topographical and hydrological conditions in five Chinese limnetic regions: the East Limnetic Region (ELR), the Northeast Limnetic Region (NLR), the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region (MXR), the Yungui Limnetic Region (YGR), and the Tibet-Qinghai Limnetic Region (TQR). We found that the density of the organic matter in the soil in the surrounding landscape plays an important role in the DOC and DIC in lake water, as was evidenced by the high DOC and DIC levels in the NLR, where the soil is respectively organically rich. Conditions in the arid and semi-arid environments (i.e. TQR and MXR) have created a number of brackish/saline lakes and here we found that, DOC and DIC levels (median: 21.79 and 93.72 mg/L, respectively) are significantly higher than those in the freshwater lakes (median: 5.80 and 29.38 mg/L). It also appears to be the case that the trophic state of freshwater lakes influences the spatial variation of DOC. This can be seen in the relationships between DOC and trophic state index (TSI) in agriculturally-dominated regions such as the ELR (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.01), NLR (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.001), and YGR (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Additionally, a close relationship between DOC and DIC can be found in lake waters with different trophic states (eutrophic: slp = 0.63, R-2 = 0.69; mesotrophic: slp = 1.03, R-2 = 0.65; oligotrophic: slp = 1.00, R-2 = 0.64). This indicates that human activities influence the quantity and quality of dissolved carbon in inland water across China. This study is able to provide insights regarding the potential effects of climate change and changes in land-use upon the amount of dissolved carbon in lake water.

AB In this paper we derive approximate analytical solutions for non-steady-state, non-linear flows through porous media, described by the Forchheimer equation. We demonstrate that one has to distinguish between two characteristic regimes. In early times, the hydraulic gradient is steep, and subsequently the inertial terms are dominant. One obtains the leading hydraulic behavior by neglecting linear terms describing the viscous dissipation mechanisms. In moderate times, as the disturbance introduced upstream propagates through the entire medium, the hydraulic gradient, and subsequently the inertial effects become less important: the leading behavior corresponds to the Darcy solution. The influence of the inertia mechanisms in this regime is taken into account by computing higher order correction terms, by means of perturbation analysis.
   The verification of the analytical solution is done by comparison with numerical results of a finite volume code. As application of the developed theory the water volume accumulated in an aquifer due to river flooding is presented. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of the structural heterogeneity of porous networks on the water distribution in porous media, initially saturated with immiscible fluid followed by increasing durations of water injection, remains one of the important problems in hydrology. The relationship among convergence rates (i.e., the rate of fluid saturation with varying injection time) and the macroscopic properties and structural parameters of porous media have been anticipated. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) micro-imaging to obtain images (down to similar to 50 mu m resolution) of the distribution of water injected for varying durations into porous networks that were initially saturated with silicone oil. We then established the relationships among the convergence rates, structural parameters, and transport properties of porous networks. The volume fraction of the water phase increases as the water injection duration increases. The 3D images of the water distributions for silica gel samples are similar to those of the glass bead samples. The changes in water saturation (and the accompanying removal of silicone oil) and the variations in the volume fraction, specific surface area, and cube-counting fractal dimension of the water phase fit well with the single-exponential recovery function {f(t) = a[1 - exp(-lambda t)]}. The asymptotic values (a, i.e., saturated value) of the properties of the volume fraction, specific surface area, and cube-counting fractal dimension of the glass bead samples were greater than those for the silica gel samples primarily because of the intrinsic differences in the porous networks and local distribution of the pore size and connectivity. The convergence rates of all of the properties are inversely proportional to the entropy length and permeability. Despite limitations of the current study, such as insufficient resolution and uncertainty for the estimated parameters due to sparsely selected short injection times, the observed trends highlight the first analyses of the cube-counting fractal dimension (and other structural properties) and convergence rates in porous networks consisting of two fluid components. These results indicate that the convergence rates correlate with the geometric factor that characterizes the porous networks and transport property of the porous networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Quantification of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) remains a challenge due to its large spatial and temporal variability exacerbated by natural heterogeneity (e.g., climatic conditions and hydrogeologic settings) and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., dredging, oil/gas extraction, and oil-field brine discharges). This study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of SGD during different hydroclimatic conditions in a semi-arid, anthropogenically disturbed estuary using Darcy's law (i.e., fresh/terrestrial SGD) and radon (Rn-222, total SGD) and radium (Ra-226, saline/recirculated SGD) isotope mass balances. Continuous electrical resistivity imaging and Rn-222 surveys revealed potential subsurface influences on SGD with the highest SGD rates in areas with sandier substrates and near transitions from low hydraulic conductivity to higher hydraulic conductivity bottom sediments. Darcy estimates ranged over two orders of magnitude and were slightly higher following the flooding recession (0.09-8.28 m.d(-1)) than following a period of low precipitation (-0.02-7.84 m.d(-1)). Mobile continuous Rn-222 estimates (0.79-1.81 m.d(-1)) support higher and more variable SGD rates, similar trends to those previously reported from time-series Rn-222 measurements (0.13-3.85 m.d(-1) across seasons). Radium-226 derived SGD (1.3 x 10(-2)-2.7 x(-2) m.d(-1 )using the average groundwater endmember) fall short of Rn-222-derived SGD due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment. However, local Darcy estimates agree well with the range of Rn-222, likely due to the steeper gradients near shore. Radium activity ratios and SGD rates reflect mixing of shallow and deep groundwater beneath the bay, likely due to anthropogenic disturbances with a greater influence from deep groundwater 3-6 months following major precipitation events. This study strongly suggests that semi-arid systems receive significant SGD, which in highly anthro-pogenically disturbed systems are derived from both shallower and deeper groundwater flowpaths and lag the climatic conditions by weeks (shallow inputs) and months or longer (deeper inputs).

AB In this paper we develop the regional form of Darcy's law when the condition of large-scale mechanical equilibrium is valid. This condition occurs for many steady or quasi-steady flows of practical importance, and analytical constraints are presented which define the domain of validity for large-scale mechanical equilibrium. Given a two-region model of a heterogeneous porous medium, the intrinsic region-averaged velocities can be expressed in terms of the large-scale average velocity according to
   theta(eta){(Y-beta)(eta)}(eta)=M-beta eta* (.){(v beta)}, in the eta-region
   theta(omega){(V-beta)(omega)}(omega) = M-beta omega*(.){(V-beta)}, in the omega- region
   Here the mapping tensors M-beta eta* and M-beta omega* are specified by the same closure problem used to determine the effective thermal conductivity tensor for a two-phase system, and they are directly related to the regional permeability tensors K-beta eta* and K-beta omega* Regional permeability tensors are determined far stratified systems, for a nodular model of heterogeneous porous media, and for fractured porous media. These large scale permeabilities are sensitive to the structure of the mechanical heterogeneities and in general they are not equal to the local permeability that is used to characterize the mechanical heterogeneities.

AB This paper presents a study of the hydrological behaviour of the Xallas river basin in the northwest of Spain, based on modelling the performance of the runoff produced by the river at different temporal scales. For monthly mean runoff as well as mean rainfall forecasting, Box-Jenkins models have been used. For short-term daily flow predictions, two statistical techniques were tested and compared: the classic statistical Box-Jenkins models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The performance of the ANN was an improvement on the Box-Jenkins results. The neural networks capability of modelling a complex rainfall-runoff relationship has been observed. Although the neural network's performance was not satisfactory for detecting some peak flows, the results were most promising. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building a hydraulic-based empirical model for sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) loss is significant because of the complex erosion process that includes gravitational erosion, ephemeral gully, and gully erosion for loess soils. To address this issue, a simulation of rainfall experiments was conducted in a 1 m x 5 m box on slope gradients of 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees for four typical loess soils with different textures, namely, Ansai, Changwu, Suide, and Yangling. The simulated rainfall of 120 mm h(-1) lasted for 45 min. Among the five hydraulic factors (i.e., flow velocity, runoff depth, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power), flow velocity and stream power showed close relationships with SOC concentration, especially the average flow velocity at 2 m from the outlet where the runoff attained the maximum sediment load. Flow velocity controlled SOC enrichment by affecting the suspension-saltation transport associated with the clay and silt contents in sediments. In consideration of runoff rate, average flow velocity at 2 m location from the outlet, and slope steepness as input variables, a hydraulic-based sediment and SOC loss model was built on the basis of the relationships of hydraulic factors to sediment and SOC loss. Nonlinear regression models were built to calculate the parameters of the model. The difference between the effective and dispersed median diameter (050) or the SOC content of the original soil served as the independent variable. The hydraulic-based sediment and SOC loss model exhibited good performance for the Suide and Changwu soils, that is, these soils contained lower amounts of aggregates than those of Ansai and Yangling soils. The hydraulic-based empirical model for sediment and SOC loss can serve as an important reference for physical-based sediment models and can bring new insights into SOC loss prediction when serious erosion occurs on steep slopes.

AB Deltas in coastal environments are assumed to function as chemical "buffers", filtering nutrient-rich terrestrial runoff through the island structures and aquatic ecosystems as it travels to the sea, but the magnitude of this effect cannot be accurately quantified without understanding the physical relationships between the surface water and groundwater. The groundwater hydrology of young, prograding delta systems and its relationship to surrounding surface water dynamics are poorly understood.
   This study developed a new conceptual model of the hydrology of a prograding delta island groundwater system. The study was based on field data collected at Pintail Island, a 2 km(2) island within the Wax Lake Delta in Louisiana. Hydraulic properties and processes were quantified at multiple depths and locations spanning the island elevation gradient. Groundwater and surface water levels were monitored. A weather station recorded precipitation, air, and wind conditions.
   The groundwater within Pintail Island was both spatially and temporally dynamic throughout the study period of 9-September-2013 to 4-February-2014. The aquifer within the distal limbs of the island responded to surface water dynamics as a connected, saturated unconfined aquifer would, and its groundwater was controlled by the surrounding surface water fluctuations of semi-diurnal winds and tides. The aquifer within the older, higher elevation island apex was a lower-permeability system with subaerial fine sediments overlying deeper, sandier sediments. In contrast to the more bayward zone of the island, this more interior zone was controlled by storm recharge, low-permeability sediments, and low head gradients, but little affected by diurnal surface water fluctuations. Groundwater flow was directed outward from the interior of the island apex and the levees toward the delta channels and the central island lagoon, but storms and high tides temporarily reversed flow directions at some locations and times, likely with significant biogeochemical consequences. This empirically-based conceptual model of the heterogeneous and dynamic hydrogeology of a young, prograding delta island provides an essential foundation for further study of prograding coastal delta island hydrology, ecology, and nutrient exchange.

AB A mathematical model is developed for describing three-dimensional groundwater flow induced by a fully-penetrating vertical well in aquifers between two parallel streams. A general equation is adopted to represent the top boundary condition which is applicable to either a confined, unconfined or leaky aquifer. The Robin (third-type) boundary condition is employed to represent the low-permeability streambeds. The Laplace-domain head solution of the model is derived by the double-integral and Laplace transforms. The Laplace-domain solution for a stream depletion rate (SDR) describing filtration from the streams is developed based on Darcy's law and the head solution and inverted to the timedomain result by the Crump method. In addition, the time-domain solution of SDR for the confined aquifer is developed analytically after taking the inverse Laplace transform and the time-domain solutions of SDR for the leaky and unconfined aquifers are developed using the Fade approximation. Both approximate solutions of SDR are expressed in terms of simple series and give fairly good match with the Laplace-domain SDR solution and measured data from a field experiment in New Zealand. The uncertainties in SDR predictions for the aquifers are assessed by performing the sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. With the aid of the time-domain solutions, we have found that the effect of the vertical groundwater flow on the temporal SDR for a leaky aquifer is dominated by two lumped parameters: it = K (v)x(0)(2)/(KhD2) and k'=k'(B'K-v) where D is the aquifer thickness, x(o) is a distance between the well and nearer stream, K-h and K are the aquifer horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities, respectively, and K' and B' are the aquitard hydraulic conductivity and thickness, respectively. When it < 10, neglecting the vertical flow underestimates the SDR. When it >= 10, the effect of vertical flow is negligible. When K'<= 10(-4), the aquitard can be regarded as impermeable, and the leaky aquifer behaves as a confined one. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Transport processes in heterogeneous porous media are often treated in terms of one-equation models. Such a treatment assumes that the velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration can be represented in terms of a single large-scale averaged quantity in regions having significantly different mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. In this paper we explore the process of single-phase flow in a two-region model of heterogeneous porous media. The region-averaged equations are developed for the case of a slightly compressible flow which is an accurate representation for a certain class of liquid-phase flows. The analysis leads to a pair of transport equations for the region averaged pressures that are coupled through a classic exchange term, in addition to being coupled by a diffusive cross effect. The domain of validity of the theory has been identifed in terms of a series of length and timescale constraints.
   In Part II the theory is tested, in the absence of adjustable parameters, by comparison with numerical experiments for transient. slightly compressible flow in both stratified and nodular models of heterogeneous porous media. Good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for nodular and stratified systems, and effective transport coefficients for a wide range of conditions are presented on the basis of solutions of the three closure problems that appear in the theory. Part III of this paper deals with the principle of large-scale mechanical equilibrium and the region-averaged form of Darcy's law. This form is necessary for the development and solution of the region-averaged solute transport equations that are presented in Part IV. Finally, in Part V we present results for the dispersion tensors and the exchange coefficient associated with the two-region model of solute transport with adsorption.

AB The allocation of the water resources of Southeastern United States have given rise to inter-state political conflicts for decades. The limited water resource are not only required to satisfy the demand of rapidly growing urban areas, but also the power industry, recreational needs and the environment. Although water resource variability has been attributed to various teleconnections, knowledge of long-term water resource availability is limited. In this paper historical (1952-2014) precipitation and streamflow data from 18 basins in southeast United States are analyzed for long-term changes in the hydroclimatology, possibly brought by urbanization, climate change and/or changed precipitation patterns. A Pettitt test indicates a change in the precipitation-runoff relationship in the late 1990s. After the shift, basin records indicate decreased precipitation storage and consequently increased streamflow. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An unusual application of hydrological understanding to a police search is described. The lacustrine search for a missing person provided reports of bottom-water currents in the lake and contradictory indications from cadaver dogs. A hydrological model of the area was developed using pre-existing information from side scan sonar, a desktop hydrogeological study and deployment of water penetrating radar (WPR). These provided a hydrological theory for the initial search involving subaqueous groundwater flow, focused on an area of bedrock surrounded by sediment, on the lake floor. The work shows the value a hydrological explanation has to a police search operation (equally to search and rescue). With hindsight, the desktop study should have preceded the search, allowing better understanding of water conditions. The ultimate reason for lacustrine flow in this location is still not proven, but the hydrological model explained the problems encountered in the initial search. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Increasing human activities in cold regions have led to serious environmental problems due to non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) contamination. However, the NAPLs redistribution driven by freeze-thaw (FT) cycles is not well understood. In this study, the redistribution of NAPLs in porous media subjected to FT cycles in a temperature range from 20 ? to-15 ? was investigated using the low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique. The redistribution of NAPLs in the prepared samples with NAPLs saturation ranging from 13.56% to 72.05% was confirmed using the transverse spin-spin relaxation time (T-2) distribution and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Experimental results revealed that substantial remobilization and distribution of NAPLs occurred between the macropores (T-2 greater than 300 ms) and the mesopores (60 ms < T-2 < 300 ms) while the NAPLs in the micropores (T-2 < 60 ms) remained almost unchanged during 30 FT cycles. The main reason is attributed to the fact that the redistribution rate in micropores is much lower than in macropores and mesopores. Furthermore, the NAPLs content and the number of FT cycles were positively correlated for macropores while negatively correlated for mesopores. For the samples with low NAPLs saturation (e.g., S-N=13.56% and 13.56%), the redistribution rate of NAPLs versus FT cycles exhibited an overall linear relationship for macropores and mesopores while a non-liner relationship for micropores. For all pore categories, the increment in S-N can cause a remarkable deviation extent. The balance between capillary pressure and freezing-induced pressure was evaluated by the newly introduced dimensionless pressure ratio delta P, which could help determine the ultimate mobilization and redistribution of NAPLs during FT cycles. Experimental tests suggested that the delta P was much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores. This can explain the dramatic difference in the redistribution rate among different pore categories. This fundamental study is helpful in understanding the mobilization and redistribution mechanisms of NAPLs in cold regions.

AB The correlation between physical and chemical weathering in mountainous rivers is debatable. A reliable geochemical tracer for physical erosion and chemical weathering is necessary to obtain crucial information on the relationship between weathering processes and environmental changes on the Earth's surface. Small mountainous rivers (SMRs) of Taiwan are characterized by extremely high physical and chemical weathering, and therefore, they provide the foremost natural laboratory for studying weathering processes in tectonically active high-standing islands. In this study, water samples collected from the Kaoping River, the largest river catchment in southern Taiwan, were analyzed for elemental concentrations, as well as for U and Li isotopes, to understand the weathering processes and to evaluate the use of the U-234/U-238 activity ratio, hereafter (U-234/U-238), as a probe for weathering. The average (U-234/U-238) of the Kaoping River is significantly higher than that of other rivers worldwide, and variations in (234U/238U) reflect the degree of physical and chemical weathering. The weathering environment corresponds to the weathering-limited regime, and the mountain area is a natural example of the kinetic-limited control on chemical weathering by intense physical erosion. High physical erosion predominates in the mountainous region, which increases (U-234/U-238), relatively reduces U concentrations, and inhibits chemical weathering. The decreased (U-234/U-238) and increased Na/Li and delta Li-7 downstream clearly indicate enhanced chemical weathering in the alluvial plain. Our results demonstrate that dissolved (U-234/U-238) in the SMRs of Taiwan can reflect the relative contributions of physical and chemical weathering within the river catchment. The coupling between chemical weathering and physical erosion can be observed downstream and the relationship becomes less pertinent in the mountain area due to changes in weathering kinetics. A positive correlation between (U-234/U-238) and uplift rate in the Kaoping River suggests that the riverine (U-234/U-238) is mainly controlled by uplift-induced physical erosion, which may be influenced by landslide activities in the rapidly eroding mountainous river of Taiwan.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for a substantial portion of regional water budgets in much of the southeast and fire-prone western United States (US). Even small changes in ET rates can translate to meaningful shifts in runoff patterns and makes forecasting the direction and magnitude of wildfire-induced ET alteration of critical importance. We use 1 km ET estimates from the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) product for the conterminous US (CONUS) to evaluate post-fire ET and evaporation ratio (ET/P) shifts in the first five post-fire years in approximately 5500 unique fires. Pixels with similar ET/P responses to fire are grouped through k-means clustering and the resultant cluster distribution is explored over space and time. The largest changes in post-fire ET/P are observed in the southwestern CONUS where first-year ratios are reduced by 50 to 90% and pre fire ratios are rarely recovered by post-fire year five. Regional and intra-fire ET/P response variability is also highest in the western CONUS where climatic, topographic, and ecologic gradients are steep. Post-fire ET/P modifications are small to negligible in the east-southeast CONUS, and 18% of all pixels analyzed exhibit small to moderate increases in post-fire year one ET/P. A comparison of burned and unburned pixel pairs confirms the role of fire in the shifts but also indicates a high degree of background variability in the ET and precipitation data. Although the biggest percent ET/P reductions occur in shrub/scrub landscapes in much of the west, the biggest magnitude ET changes often occur in evergreen forests. Higher burn severities are consistently correlated with greater post-fire ET/P reductions, while relationships between post-fire ET/P shifts and numerous other landscape attributes (e.g., pre-fire vegetation type) vary in both direction and magnitude in different parts of the CONUS. Further work can be conducted to refine controlling relationships within more homogeneous subregions.

ID DISCHARGE; CAPACITY; RIVER; PREDICTION; STRAIGHT; VELOCITY
AB A new stage discharge relationship is suggested for wide meandering streams (ratio of floodplain width and that of main channel in excess of 5.5 and up to 30) with overbank flow. The boundary shear data obtained from various data series with specified range of width ratio and channel sinuosity are analysed. By regression technique, new empirical relationships are derived between the channel dimensions and amount of shear generated for different flow conditions. These new boundary shear models are then used to obtain the stage discharge relation in channels with given roughness characteristics. The present method is then validated for its usefulness by applying the same to a number of data series of small scale and large scale flume experiments of other research projects from the literature. The errors (%) in discharge estimation are within limits for such methods as per practice (i.e. around +/- 10% for both smooth and rough meandering channels). The method is also compared with a number of other methods from the literature by application to different data series. The RMSE (root mean squared error) value for all the data series validated is estimated as 9.6% and the method is found to be ranked third among all the methods. The method is also able to predict satisfactorily the flow distribution in case of a number of homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened meandering channels of varying sinuosity with overbank flow for large scale flume experimental data sets. The mean error for three available data series is estimated as - 3.4% while the RMSE error is 10.68%. Due to its ease of application and simple approach, this 1D method may serve as a preliminary design tool for assessing stage discharge curve for wide two stage channels in field conditions for application in flood estimation and flood warning cum relief measures. Such a preliminary study might better decide the need for further refinement through any exhaustive deep study; the more robust and expensive 2D or 3D analysis.

AB The assessment for impacts of climate variability and human activities on suspended sediment yield (SSY) change has long been a question of great interest. However, the sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty, which give rise to extreme complexity for SSY change assessment in Newtonian approach. Consequently, few approaches can be simply but widely applied to decompose impacts of climatic variability and human activities on SSY change. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop advanced methods that are simple and robust. Since that the Newtonian approach is hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms, there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in Darwinian approach for hydrological change prediction or explanation. As streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment, SSY change are thus documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and suspended sediment concentration - water discharge (C-Q) relationships. By deduced corollaries, a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in Darwinian hydrology. Besides, a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as C-Q relationships and probability distribution of sediment concentrated flow. River sediment flux can be revealed by this representation, which simply elucidates mechanism of SSY generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall-event to long term. By the new sediment rating curves, the differential equation was partly solved using a segmentation algorithm proposed and validated in this paper, and then was submitted to water balance framework expressed by Budyko-type equation. Thus, for catchment management, hydrologists can obtain explicit explanation of how climate variation and human activities propagate through landscape and result in sediment discharge change. The differential equation is simple and robust for widely application in sediment discharge change assessment, as only discrete data of precipitation, potential evaporation and C-Q observed at gauging stations are required.

AB Subsurface saturation near the bedrock surface is an important source of runoff generation and deeper bedrock recharge. While many studies have reported the generation patterns of subsurface saturation on valley side slopes or unchanneled catchments, studies focusing on the relationship between bedrock topography and subsurface saturation dynamics in a headwater catchment are still rare. This study therefore analyzed the effects of bedrock topographic features on subsurface saturation generation based on a dataset of pore water pressure (psi) observations at the soil-bedrock interface and the spatial distributions of soil depth and the topographic wetness index (TWI) of bedrock topography in a steep natural forested headwater catchment. Temporal variations in the mean and standard deviation psi were lower at the perennially saturated points but higher at the ephemerally saturated points. The expansion patterns of subsurface saturation during storm events could be classified into four stages: fragmentary and unconnected distributions, both downward and upward expansions, interconnection from upslope to down slope, and disappearance from the middle slope. When saturation was interconnected, 41% of accumulated rainfall contributed to increases of subsurface saturation with a highly linear relationship. Soil depth correlated negatively with the increase in psi at all points and at ephemerally saturated points. These negative correlations occurred frequently after the generation of new saturation, and remained for a short period around the early peaks of rainfall when the mean of psi increased sharply. TWI correlated positively with psi and psi >= 0 among all points but not in the subsets of perennially or ephemerally saturated points. The positive correlations became more significant after generation of new saturation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the effects of soil depth and TWI on subsurface saturation vary with space and time in a steep natural forested headwater catchment. These effects are combined in a short time when new saturation is generated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study treats the catchment as a block box system with considering the rainfall input and runoff output being a stochastic process. The temporal rainfall-runoff relationship at the catchment scale is described by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale. Using the Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach, a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral is developed to the spectral analysis of runoff processes generated by temporal non-stationary rainfall events. It is shown that the characteristic time scale of rainfall process increases the runoff discharge variability, while the catchment mean travel time constant plays the role in reducing the variability of runoff discharge. Similar to the behavior of groundwater aquifers, catchments act as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain for the rainfall input signal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An approximate analytic solution is given for the first time to previously published equations describing the characteristics of dynamic soil erosion caused by overland flow. The solution describes both the variation in time in total sediment concentration since the commencement of uniform overland flow, and also the dynamic change in the settling velocity characteristics (and size distribution) of eroding sediment. Following calibration for each of the three soils investigated in order to determine unknown but physically-defined model parameters, prediction based on this theory was found to provide good agreement with experimental data. Under steady-state conditions achieved at tong time, the solution agrees with the exact solution for transport limiting conditions, and provides a simple expression for sediment concentration in other situations where soil strength affects the sediment concentration ultimately achieved.

AB Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycle in aquatic ecosystems. The relationship between CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been investigated, and this significant relationship lays the foundation for the estimation of DOC using remotely sensed imagery data. The current study examined samples from freshwater lakes, saline lakes, rivers and streams, urban water bodies, and ice-covered lakes in China for tracking the variation of the relationships between DOC and CDOM. The regression model slopes for DOC vs. a CDOM (275) ranged from extremely low 0.33 (highly saline lakes) to 1.03 (urban waters) and 3.01 (river waters). The low values were observed in saline lake waters and waters from semi-arid or arid regions, where strong photobleaching is expected due to less cloud cover, longer water residence time, and daylight hours. In contrast, high values were found in waters developed in wetlands or forest in Northeast China, where more organic matter was transported from catchment to waters. The study also demonstrated that closer relationships between CDOM and DOC were revealed when a CDOM (275) were sorted by the ratio of a CDOM. 250/ aCDOM (365), which is a measure for the CDOM absorption with respect to its composition, and the determination of coefficient of the regression models ranged from 0.79 to 0.98 for different groups of waters. Our results indicate the relationships between CDOM and DOC are variable for different inland waters; thus, models for DOC estimation through linking with CDOM absorption need to be tailored according to water types.

AB Square array electrical soundings were made at 13 sites in the Biscayne Aquifer distributed between 1 and 20 km from the shoreline. These soundings were modeled to investigate how resistivity varies spatially and with depth in the upper 15 m of the aquifer. Porosity was estimated from the modeled formation resistivity and observed pore fluid resistivity with Archie's Law. The models were used to interpolate resistivity and porosity surfaces at -2, -5, -8, and -15 m elevations. Modeled resistivity in the unsaturated zone is generally higher than 300 Omega m with the resistivity at sites with thick unsaturated zones greater than 1000 Omega m. Resistivity in the saturated zone ranges from 30 to 320 Omega m. At many sites in the western portions of the study area, resistivity is constant or increases with depth whereas sites in the center of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge exhibit a distinct low resistivity zone (rho < 45 Omega m) at elevations ranging between -5 and -10 m. At one site near the shore of Biscayne Bay, the resistivity is less than 10 Omega m at -5 m elevation reflecting the presence of salt water in the aquifer. The estimated porosity ranges between 14% and 71% with modal values near 25%. The porosity structure varies both with depth and spatially. Western sites exhibit a high porosity zone at shallow depths best expressed in a NE-SW trending zone of 40-50% porosity situated near the western margin of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge. This zone roughly corresponds in depth with the Q5 chronostratigraphic unit of the Miami Fm. which constitutes the upper flow unit of the Biscayne Aquifer. The highest porosity (>50%) is seen at elevations below -5 m at sites in the center of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and likely corresponds to solution features. The general NE-SW trend of the resistivity and porosity structure suggests a causal connection with the Pleistocene paleogeography and sedimentary environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil moisture (SM) is a very important physical parameter in land surface processes. The low-resolution microwave products are extremely useful for large-scale studies, but are limited in their ability to resolve landscapelevel variability. In this study, to overcome this limitation, we adopted three different deep learning based downscaling methods and performed a comparative analysis. Firstly, a downscaling method based on a deep belief network (DBN) model with a fully connected structure was employed to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between soil moisture and the auxiliary surface parameters. Then, to improve this simple point-to-point relationship, a neighborhood constraint based improved DBN model was developed to consider the effect of local spatial correlation among the surface factors on soil moisture. Finally, to maintain the integrity of the spatial structure in the process of model construction, a residual network (ResNet) model consisting of several residual dense blocks (RDBs) was introduced to use convolutions to obtain more complete and powerful spatial feature maps. The Tibetan Plateau was selected as the study area because of its importance to the global water cycle. The four soil moisture monitoring networks in the research area were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the downscaling of soil moisture products, and four quantitative indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods. From the verified results, it is shown that the three deep learning methods can maintain a higher correlation and better reduce the bias, on the whole, and the ResNet model, in particular, shows a higher stability. From the perspective of the spatial patterns and details, when compared to backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) models, the three deep learning methods can provide more feasible spatial patterns and details, as well as reducing the uncertainty in the central regions of the Tibetan Plateau. The ResNet model shows a superior ability to enhance the texture details with lower uncertainty, due to the fact that it can meet the requirements of fitting the soil moisture to complex surfaces. Furthermore, the results of the ResNet model can also effectively capture the temporal changes of the microwave soil moisture product well.

AB Interception loss, I, the amount of precipitation intercepted by forests and evaporated back to the atmosphere plays important roles in the water balance and the climate system by removing approximately one quarter of the annual precipitation from the terrestrial hydrologic cycle. Models are critical for simulating I and its components; the canopy storage, S, and the evaporation rate during the storm, E-r. The energy and the water balance methods commonly yield different E-r assessments. Hence, there is an urgent need for further model development, testing, and simplification in order to independently evaluate I, S, and E-r. The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop an independent model to assess I, S and E-r; (ii) compare the model based on its fitness to cumulative and event based measured data of I; and (iii) identify the strengths and limitations of the proposed model. By breaking the linear and power regression equations commonly fitted to the I vs. P, gross precipitation, relationship, the model analytically isolates S and E-p (L L-1) as a function of P. Field measurements of 44 I case studies collected from Mexico and classified into arid & semi-arid, A&S (N = 13), tropical montane cloud, TMC (N = 6), temperate, T (N = 4), and tropical dry, TD (N = 21), forests were used to calibrate the model. Results showed that even though the model was constructed independently of the common equations; it isolates S, E-r and E-p and reproduces remarkably well the conventional empirical linear and power regression equations of I vs. P; and simulates unbiased cumulative and individual-storm I values. When coupled with the function of rainfall duration, the model projects lower E-r rates than previously anticipated using other empirical approaches. Statistical analysis revealed the likely oscillation of the I vs. P relationship between the linear and power functions depending on rainfall, canopy and climate conditions. The model represents an important advancement in forest hydrology by analytically isolating S, E-r, E-p and simulating compatible I values for individual as well as for assemblages of storms. It further clarifies the large variability of E-r and helps to explain the role of forests in the water budget and the climate system.

AB The behaviour of velocity profiles and shear velocity for non-uniform flow in gravel-bed rivers is studied, with the objectives: ( a) to test a new method of shear velocity estimation in gravel-bed rivers that is based on boundary layer parameters, and to compare it with the log law and parabolic law; (b) to consider the influence of flow non-uniformity on the outer layer region of velocity profiles; and ( c) to investigate the effect of aspect ratio on velocity profiles. For the primary study river, mid-channel velocity profiles were analysed with relative submergence ranging from 9.7 to 33.3 in channel sections with aspect ratios ranging between 16.2 and 50. Velocity profiles deviated from the log law in the outer region due to flow non-uniformity or pressure gradient effects, and the vertical extent of the inner region was variable. Estimates of shear velocity using the boundary layer parameters (delta* and theta)compared well with estimates from the log law. In a second study river, boundary-layer parameter estimates of shear velocity compared well to shear velocity estimates from linear extrapolation of Reynolds stress profiles.

AB The process of interrill erosion is complex by interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow. Their relative contribution to interrill erosion is difficult to be evaluated even on bare soil. This study presents the new erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslope with the more relevant understanding of the physical processes. The effective energy, the erosivity factor, is defined as the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance. The effective kinetic energy of rainfall is determined by the horizontal component for slope of kinetic energy deducting energies dissipated by structure of vegetation canopies and a litter layer. The effective potential energy of surface runoff is equal to potential energy of the available surface water following rain-mass allocations of interception and infiltration. The data from experimental field plots with various vegetation coverage after wildfire were used to verify the effective energy equation. On densely vegetated slopes sediment yield depended greatly on effective kinetic energy of rainfall, while they from hillslopes having sparse coverage were dominated by effective potential energy of surface runoff. The dissipated energy due to interrill erosion showed the highest correlation coefficient with the effective energy under various cover conditions. The kinetic energy of raindrops was greatly reduced by the litter layer and the potential energy of rainwater decreased predominantly due to infiltration. The ratio of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy was the highest at 71.2% in the plots with low vegetation coverage. The energy efficiency for interrill erosion increased with decreasing vegetation coverage and reached maximum 1.35% in extreme rainfall event under low vegetation coverage. The constant and exponent of power-law functions between the effective energy and the soil erosion work were strongly correlated with gravel ratio and litter coverage, respectively. The results indicate that the effective energy is useful erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion occurred by the complicated interaction of rain splash and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes.

AB Slug test has been commonly applied to determine the near-well aquifer properties because of its logistical and economic advantages over other aquifer tests. Instantaneously increasing or decreasing the water level inside a slug test well will generate a significant hydraulic gradient near the well screen-aquifer interface (particularly at early stage of slug test), which may result in near-well aquifer flow deviated from Darcian behavior. However, previous studies on slug test rarely considered non-Darcian flow process associated with the slug test. In this study, a transient model of slug test in a leaky confined aquifer was established considering non-Darcian horizontal flow in the aquifer, and Darcian and vertical flow in the aquitard. The non-Darcian flow in the aquifer was described by the Izbash (power-law) equation. A finite-difference solution was presented for solving the non-linear model of slug test, the accuracy of which was tested through comparison with a previous analytical solution. By analyzing the sensitivities of dimensionless aquitard leakance (alpha(D)), non-Darcian index (n), and ratio of well screen radius versus well casing radius (chi) on the water level recovery (WLR) of slug test, one could conclude that the rate of WLR increased with the decrease of n for a given time. The WLR curve of Darcian flow (n = 1) was above the curves of non-Darcian flow, including fully developed turbulent flow. There was a deflection point for each WLR curve without the aquitard leakance in log log scales, and the slope of the curve approached a constant after such a point. The effects of aquitard leakance on WLR for non-Darcian case appeared later than Darcian case. The normalized sensitivity coefficients of WLR with respect to n, alpha(D) and chi were negative, and they were most sensitive to n and least to alpha(D). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the effect of considering reciprocal drawdown curves for the characterization of hydraulic properties of aquifer systems through inverse modeling based on interference well testing. Reciprocity implies that drawdown observed in a well B when pumping takes place from well A should strictly coincide with the drawdown observed in A when pumping in B with the same flow rate as in A. In this context, a critical point related to applications of hydraulic tomography is the assessment of the number of available independent drawdown data and their impact on the solution of the inverse problem. The issue arises when inverse modeling relies upon mathematical formulations of the classical single-continuum approach to flow in porous media grounded on Darcy's law. In these cases, introducing reciprocal draw down curves in the database of an inverse problem is equivalent to duplicate some information, to a certain extent. We present a theoretical analysis of the way a Least-Square objective function and a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm are affected by the introduction of reciprocal information in the inverse problem. We also investigate the way these reciprocal data, eventually corrupted by measurement errors, influence model parameter identification in terms of: (a) the convergence of the inverse model, (b) the optimal values of parameter estimates, and (c) the associated estimation uncertainty. Our theoretical findings are exemplified through a suite of computational examples focused on block heterogeneous systems with increased complexity level. We find that the introduction of noisy reciprocal information in the objective function of the inverse problem has a very limited influence on the optimal parameter estimates. Convergence of the inverse problem improves when adding diverse (nonreciprocal) drawdown series, but does not improve when reciprocal information is added to condition the flow model. The uncertainty on optimal parameter estimates is influenced by the strength of measurement errors and it is not significantly diminished or increased by adding noisy reciprocal information.

AB Sustainable urban surface runoff management is receiving increased attention due to environmental and ecological consequences related to urbanization. This study presents a useful new framework for green infrastructure (GI) planning for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity. The proposed framework considers physical, technical, economic, and multi-stakeholder aspects related to urban runoff management while simultaneously addressing the uncertainties of the decision-making process and model parameters. The methodology is applied to regionally locating and sizing low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) while considering the hydrologic and hydraulic impacts. A decision-making multi-objective optimization framework is developed by integrating: 1) a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network founded on a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM-MLP meta-model), 2) NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, 3) fuzzy a-cut technique, and 4) a decision-making support model based on social choice theory to elicit trade-offs among system cost and LID-BMP performance indicators. The decision-making model, based on Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) theory, is applied to simulate consensus between stakeholders for a partially cooperative group decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is explored in a catchment located in the northeastern part of Tehran, Iran. Results showed that the SWMM could be effectively replaced with a MLP-based meta-model in simulation-optimization problems for urban runoff management. In the application of FSC methods, the optimal scenarios were effective in reducing the volume of urban runoff and contamination loads while maintaining the optimality of the operation costs. Considering the optimal LID scenario, a reduction of more than 99% in runoff volume and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and a decrease of more than 92% of total suspended solids (TSS), occurred for the lower bound of uncertainty (lower (left) end of the alpha-cut = 0.3). For the upper bound of uncertainty (upper (right) end of the alpha-cut level = 0.3), a maximum reduction of 57% was obtained. In applying FSC methods through the decision-making process, the Borda Counting method considered the preferences of all stakeholders best. Moreover, the proposed framework allows decision-makers to decide on the acceptability and reliability of the optimal management scenarios considering their preferences and uncertainties.

AB The spatiotemporal dynamic of salinity concentration (SC) in saline lakes is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow into the lake, water circulation, wind speed, evaporation rate, and the phenomenon of salt precipitation and dissolution. Although in-situ observations most reliably quantify water quality metrics, the spatiotemporal distribution of such data are typically limited and cannot be readily extrapolated for either long-term projections or extensive areas. Alternatively, remotely sensed imagery has facilitated less expensive and a stronger ability to estimate water quality over a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions. This study introduces an adaptive learning model that leverages in-situ measurements, satellite imagery, and machine learning algorithms to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of water surface SC in saline lakes. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by using high-resolution Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data in the Lake Urmia (LU), where 130 points were sampled in April and July 2019 for the model calibration and validation purposes. The results showed that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) yields the most accurate relationship between SC and water surface reflectance (R-2 = 0.94; NRMSE = 6.9%; MAE = 12.3 ppt) as compared to Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models. A sharp distinction in SC between the LU's northern and southern parts was observed during high flows due to the limitation on north-south water mixing imposed by the lake's middle causeway. Nevertheless, the impact of causeway on water circulation at the other seasons is minimum. A hysteretic relationship was also found between the lake water volume and the lake-averaged SC due to the distinct role of bed-salt dissolution and high evaporation rate at different seasons. A tight agreement between the SC variations in the southern part and the whole lake proved that the southern part dominantly controls SC dynamics in the whole lake.

AB Soil moisture memory (SMM) is not only important for atmospheric weather/climate forecasting, but may also be useful in flood and drought prediction. Despite their importance, SMM studies are restricted in certain regions due to the scarcity of soil moisture data. To overcome this limitation, this study explains the variability of SMM in wet and dry basins, and shows an alternative way to predict the basin scale SMM using observed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration information only. This study presents the basin average SMM in the form of a timescale that indicates the duration of significant auto-correlations at 95% confidence intervals. The soil moisture autocorrelations were calculated using observed precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, streamflow and soil moisture data sets simulated using the XinAnJiang (XAJ) model, for 26 river basins across the USA. The XAJ model's capability to simulate seasonal cycles (temporal anomalies) of soil moisture was validated against cycles from the observed data set of the Spoon River basin of Illinois State, USA. Based on the validation experience, the XAJ model was thereafter used to simulate soil moisture data for the analysed basins.
   Basin scale SMM timescale ranges were computed from 11 to 133 days. The SMM timescale is highly influenced by precipitation variability and exhibits strong seasonality. Dry basins tend to show the highest memory during the winter months (December to February) and lowest in late spring (May). In contrast, wet basins have the lowest memory during winter and early spring (December to April) and highest in the late summer and early autumn (July to September). The SMM timescale displayed an exponential relationship with the basin aridity index, with an r(2) value of 0.9. This relationship could be a cheap source of basin scale SMM prediction from widely available observed data sets (actual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), and thus, could afford some knowledge of SMM under no knowledge conditions.

AB The Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model was used to derive estimates of suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) and suspended-sediment load (SSL), their dependence on discharge, and their trends with confidence intervals, for one site each on the lowermost Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The WRTDS model reduces uncertainty in SSCs related to variable streamflow conditions. Flow-normalized SSCs in each river were similar, and decreased from about 260 mg/L to 130 mg/L from 1980 through 2015; combined annual SSL in the two rivers decreased from about 200 Megatons per year (MT/y) to about 100 MT/y. Declines in SSC and SSL were more gradual from 2005 through 2015 and show signs of stabilizing. Our estimates of SSL in 2015 differ markedly from several recently published estimates of current and projected future Mississippi River SSLs, which were generally around 200 MT/y. However, these values came mostly from a different site upstream on the Mississippi River. The relationship between SSC and streamflow differed in an important way between the two rivers. SSC increased as streamflow increased for the entire range of observed streamflow in the Atchafalaya River. In the Mississippi River, SSC followed the same pattern during low and moderate streamflow but decreased at the highest streamflow that tended to occur between January and July. Since much of the water flowing in the Atchafalaya originates from the Mississippi River, the difference suggests a within-basin source of suspended sediment for the Atchafalaya River that is absent in the lower Mississippi River. These findings have important implications for the restoration of deltaic wetlands in coastal Louisiana. Accurate estimates of the SSL available in each river are crucial for understanding how effective diversions of river water into adjacent estuaries will be in sustaining these wetlands. Our study demonstrates that there might be far less sediment available than previously reported. Further, the difference in the relationship between SSC and streamflow in the two rivers is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion of coastal restoration strategies because the delta building that is occurring at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River is frequently used as a model of what could be expected with controlled diversions in the lower Mississippi River delta. The differences in the SSC behavior with changes in streamflow between the two rivers needs to be considered when results from the Atchafalaya River system are projected to those of the Mississippi River.

AB This paper presents the experience gained related to the development of an integrated simulation model of water policy. Within this context, we analyze particular difficulties raised by the inclusion of multilevel governance that assigns the responsibility of individual or collective decision-making to a variety of actors, regarding measures of which the implementation has significant effects toward the sustainability of socio-hydrosystems. Multi-level governance procedures are compared with the potential of model-based impact assessment. Our discussion is illustrated on the basis of the exploitation of the multi-agent platform MAELIA dedicated to the simulation of social, economic and environmental impacts of low-water management in a context of climate and regulatory changes. We focus on three major decisionmaking processes occurring in the Adour-Garonne basin, France: (i) the participatory development of the Master Scheme for Water Planning and Management (SDAGE) under the auspices of the Water Agency; (ii) the publication of water use restrictions in situations of water scarcity; and (iii) the determination of the abstraction volumes for irrigation and their allocation. The MAELIA platform explicitly takes into account the mode of decision-making when it is framed by a procedure set beforehand, focusing on the actors' participation and on the nature and parameters of the measures to be implemented. It is observed that in some water organizations decision-making follows patterns that can be represented as rule-based actions triggered by thresholds of resource states. When decisions are resulting from individual choice, endowing virtual agents with bounded rationality allows us to reproduce (in silico) their behavior and decisions in a reliable way. However, the negotiation processes taking place during the period of time simulated by the models in arenas of collective choices are not all reproducible. Outcomes of some collective decisions are very little or not at all predictable. The development and simulation of a priori policy scenarios capturing the most plausible or interesting outcomes of such collective decisions on measures for low-water management allows these difficulties to be overcome. The building of these kind of scenarios requires close collaboration between researchers and stakeholders involved in arenas of collective choice, and implies the integration of the production of model and the analysis of scenarios as one component of the polycentric political process of water management.

AB Large-scale monitoring of surface water bodies is of great significance to the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. Remote sensing is currently the main method of global earth observation. On the one hand, the traditional water index is simple and efficient, but it relies on a fixed global threshold, which leads to low accuracy for water extraction. On the other hand, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in classification of spectral data, but it consumes a substantial amount of manpower and time to label sufficient high-quality samples. Furthermore, spectral characteristics of water bodies in different areas vary greatly due to changes in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometry. In this paper, we propose a new accurate water extraction framework based on unsupervised deep learning and NDWI of multispectral images. Binarized NDWI images are used to identify potential water bodies, and deep learning training is performed using these pseudo samples and labels. This process realizes the conversion from unlabeled learning to noisy label learning. First, we proposed a simple and fast binarization algorithm to segment as many real water bodies as possible from NDWI images. Then a set of water confidence assessment rules was constructed from the four aspects of the spectrum, shape, agglomeration, and range. The water segments were scored and sorted to make the model start learning from easy samples and gradually advance to complex samples. Finally, the adjusted co-teaching learning strategy is adopted to filter errors introduced by noisy labels through peer networks with different learning capabilities during training. We tested the accuracy of our method using Gaofen Image Dataset (GID), Sentinel-2 and Landsat images of several water bodies in China. Compared with other methods, our method improved the F1 score by 18.1-40.3% and 6.8-22.2% for GID and Sentinel-2 images, respectively. In addition, our method is more stable in long-term water monitoring. The proposed method has the potential to be used for extracting water bodies with high accuracy on a large scale, especially in areas with complex environments and a lack of deep learning samples. And it provides a new idea for unsupervised learning in the current remote sensing field by fully combining remote sensing expertise and spectral information of ground objects.

AB Ecosystems in the Alps are considered hotspots of climate and land use change. In addition, alpine regions are usually characterized by complex morphologies, which make measurement (especially in the long term) of states and fluxes of water, energy and matter particularly challenging. Therefore, there is a limited availability of information and modelling tools to characterize actual ecosystem conditions, and to simulate future scenarios. Despite the fact that in high altitude areas meteorological forcing is extremely variable in space and time, much of the variability of actual evapotranspiration (AET) in the above-mentioned regions is largely related to land surface properties such as aspect, shadowing and slope. Therefore, a simple, radiation driven, calibration free, bucket hydrological model for predicting AET and estimating the soil-water balance is proposed here (i.e. CLIME-MG). Conventional meteorological data from a network of automatic weather stations together with a 10 m digital terrain model (aggregated at 30 m), and a land cover map are used to inform the model. All the parameters and values required are obtained or calculated from data provided in literature. CLIME-MG has proved to perform well for AET modelling of mountain grassland. The model is validated both temporally and spatially. Temporal validation of AET is performed using eddy-covariance datasets from two different high mountain sites: a sunny and steep abandoned pasture facing S-E at an altitude of 1730 m, and a meadow with a S-SE aspect located at an altitude of 2555 m. Spatial validation is performed by comparing CLIME-MG simulations with the Landsat-based METRIC model evapotranspiration output. Results show good daily temporal performance, especially in wetter periods with recurring rainfall events. Sensitivity of the correlation coefficient between measured and modeled AET values to some key parameters such as effective porosity, and the vegetation and stress coefficients was found to be quite low. Spatial validation of hourly results shows SPAEF values in the range 0.21-0.34 between the outputs of the two models (with a similar spatial structure ruled by the DTM). Boxplots of deviations between CLIME and METRIC with respect to morphological characteristics has highlighted some dependency on elevation and slope (but not on aspect and soil depth); this suggests an opportunity to refine the modelisation of the grassland AET processes. Finally, spatial results demonstrated the non-sensitivity of the proposed model to local elevation and to the distance from the meteorological stations.

AB The complex dynamics of partial bed-load transport in a series of well-controlled laboratory experiments are explored systematically and simulated by a stochastic model in this study. Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20-m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience bimodal transport (i.e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.

TI Merging radar and rain gauge data by using spatial-temporal local

AB Merging radar and rain gauge data is an important means of obtaining precipitation products with high accuracy and high spatial-temporal resolution. However, due to the change of the raindrop size distribution itself and the uncertainty of the radar observational data, it is an indisputable fact that A and b in the Z-R (radar reflectivity factor (Z) to rainfall rate (R)) relationship are complex functions of space and time, which has a great influence on the accuracy of radar-rain gauge quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). In this study, in an effort to further improve the accuracy of radar-rain gauge QPE, spatial-temporal local weighted linear regression (STLWLR) and its corresponding regression kriging (STLWLRK) are proposed for merging radar and rain gauge data for QPE, for which the maximum number of Z-R pairs in the spatial-temporal neighborhood N, the spatial-temporal distance transformation parameter mu, and the specified threshold C of |e/s| are three key parameters. Specifically, cases that occurred on Hainan Island and the cross-validation mode were used to calibrate the three key parameters and to evaluate the two methods with the relative mean absolute error (RMAE) and bias as evaluation indicators. The results show that compared with the real-time-adjusted Z-R relationship (AZR) scheme and the two-step calibration technique of radar QPE (the AID scheme), STLWLR and STLWLRK with optimization parameters could further improve the accuracy of radar-rain gauge QPE. For 10-fold crossvalidation of the cases occurring on Hainan Island from 1 May to 31 October 2018 and for 1-hr, 3-hr, 6-hr, 12-hr, and 24-hr time scales, the RMAE of STLWLRK decreased by 6.3%, 8.4%, 8.4%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively, compared with that of the AID scheme. The results also show that increasing time scale could reduce the error of radar-rain gauge QPE for different methods. As STLWLR is based on solid geography, mathematics, and radar meteorology and has been tested by a large number of cases, STLWLR and its optimization parameters should have certain universality. Overall, compared with traditional methods, STLWLRK is a more robust, easier to implement, more accurate, and less computationally expensive method.

AB Estimation of particle concentration distribution profile is important to understand the inherent mixing process, changes of river morphology, and nature of transportation of particles. In this study, the effects of non-locality are investigated to analyze, distinguish and predict different types of profiles of the suspended concentration distribution in turbulent flows through open channels, pipes, and mixing boxes. The effects of non-locality are captured through fractional derivatives and integrals. Starting from the fractional Liouville equation and considering the power-law jumps of particles in the carrier fluid, the fractional kinetic equation is derived through mathematical analysis. The kinetic model is solved and an analytical model is proposed using the Laplace transformation. The proposed solution contains the two parameters (as alpha the order of fractional model and mu the shape parameter) Mittag-Leffler function and is a more general one that contains several previous models as special cases. The proposed model can predict four different types of suspension concentration distributions namely type-I, type-II, plume-like, and convex type profiles under different conditions. Further, the model is validated with existing experimental data of dilute and dense flow in open channels and pipes, flows in square pipes, slurry pipelines, and fluid mud gravity currents. Satisfactory results are obtained. A detailed nonlinear multivariate regression analysis is carried out with a wide range of selected data and models are proposed to compute model parmeters. To increase the efficiency of the model, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed to predict the model parameters. The ANN-based models show better results than the regression analysis. Validation results show that non-locality has significant effects on the structure of the concentration profiles. From the analysis of the model parameters, it is found that type-I profile occurs under the subdiffusion process where alpha <= 1 and mu = 1 and other three types (type-II, plume-like and convex) of profiles are associated with the superdiffusion process when alpha > 1 and mu > 1.

AB Physics-based distributed (PBD) hydrologic models predict runoff throughout a basin using the laws of conservation of mass and momentum, and benefit from more accurate and representative precipitation input. Vflo (TM) is a gridded distributed hydrologic model that predicts runoff and continuously updates soil moisture. As a participating model in the second Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP2), Vflo (TM) is applied to the Illinois and Blue River basins in Oklahoma. Model parameters are derived from geospatial data for initial setup, and then adjusted to reproduce the observed flow under continuous time-series simulations and on an event basis. Simulation results demonstrate that certain runoff events are governed by saturation excess processes, while in others, infiltration-rate excess processes dominate. Streamflow prediction accuracy is enhanced when multi-sensor precipitation estimates (MPE) are bias corrected through re-analysis of the MPE provided in the DMIP2 experiment, resulting in gauge-corrected precipitation estimates (GCPE). Model calibration identified a set of parameters that minimized objective functions for errors in runoff volume and instantaneous discharge. Simulated streamflow for the Blue and Illinois River basins, have Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients between 0.61 and 0.68, respectively, for the 1996-2002 period using GCPE. The streamflow prediction accuracy improves by 74% in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency when GCPE is used during the calibration period. Without model calibration, excellent agreement between hourly simulated and observed discharge is obtained for the Illinois, whereas in the Blue River, adjustment of parameters affecting both saturation and infiltration-rate excess processes were necessary. During the 1996-2002 period, GCPE input was more important than model calibration for the Blue River, while model calibration proved more important for the Illinois River. During the verification period (2002-2006), calibration was more important than GCPE input for the Illinois River, but both calibration and GCPE input improved prediction accuracy within the Blue River.

AB Water erosion is a complex process driven by many factors, such as rainfall, soil, topography, vegetation, and land use management practices. Much research has been done to assess the separate effect of every single factor, while studies devoted to the interaction effects among these factors are rarely reported. The complex interactions among factors are generally poured into the pool of soil erodibility (K factor) in the LISLE-based models, which induces uncertainty of the K factor and thus causes prediction errors. The interaction between rainfall (R) and soil (K) factors is the first and foremost step to dissect the entire interaction complex, but also the objective this study intended to investigate. Quality-controlled data from long-term field observations on four bare steep slopes in different geographic regions of China were selected and standardized to exclude the effect of unconcerned factors. The interaction effects of rainfall and soil factors were visualized by the nonlinearities of accumulative rainfall-runoff-erosion relationships and then further quantified by the evaluation of prediction errors for the cases that ignore the nonlinearities and by the approach of partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that the interaction between rainfall and soil factors exists in water erosion processes and obscures the hydrological and erosion prediction. (1) The potentialities of both runoff and erosion varied with the level of rainfall erosivity in different patterns among soils, indicating diverse nonlinearities of rainfall-runoff-erosion relationships and the complex interaction effects behind it. (2) The addition of the interaction effects in the SEM model constructions increased 9.2% and 6.0% of variance explanations for the predictions of annual runoff and erosion, respectively. Whereas, the exclusion of interaction effects tended to cause overestimations on steep slopes that were hard to be calibrated by existing formulas. (3) The well-known tendency to underestimate small and overestimate large events does not suit every soil, especially for the soil with coarse texture and shallow soil with fractured bedrock. And prediction bias was found predictable and rooted in the interaction between rainfall and soil. This study yields a deeper understanding of interaction effects, and is helpful for the improvement of runoff and erosion predictions.

AB Groundwater management practices, such as sustainable drinking water extraction or contamination protection, can have significant socioeconomic impacts. A complete uncertainty analysis should ideally be performed to anticipate all possible outcomes and assess any risk. Uncertainties arise as a result of our limited understanding of the physical processes involved, as well as a scarcity of measurement data, whether directly or indirectly related to the physical parameters of interest. In this paper, we use a small number of tracing experiments (predictor) to predict the wellhead protection area (WHPA, target), the shape and extent of which are influenced by the distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K). Our first goal is to make stochastic predictions of the WHPA within the Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which uses machine learning to find a direct relationship between predictor and target. This relationship is learned using a small number of training models (400) drawn from the prior distribution of K. Forward modelling is used to obtain the 400 pairs of simulated predictors and targets. Newly collected field data can then be used directly to predict the approximate posterior distribution of the corresponding WHPA, obviating the need for the traditional step of data inversion. The number and location of data sources (injection wells) influence the posterior WHPA distribution's uncertainty range. Our second goal is to extend BEL to determine the optimal design of data source locations that minimises the WHPA's posterior uncertainty. Because the BEL model, once trained, allows the computation of the posterior uncertainty corresponding to any new input data, experimental design can be done explicitly, without averaging or approximating. We estimate the WHPA's posterior uncertainty range using the Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index metrics. Because the breakthrough curves store information on a large area of the K field surrounding the pumping well, increasing the number of injection wells reduces the derived posterior WHPA uncertainty. Our method can also estimate which injection wells are more informative than others, as demonstrated by a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of BEL to experimental design allows for identifying data sources that maximise the information content of any measurement data while keeping budget constraints and computational costs to a minimum.

AB The high solubility and conservative behaviour of chloride make it ideal for use as an environmental tracer of water and salt movement through the hydrologic cycle. For such use the spatial distribution of chloride deposition in rainfall at a suitable scale must be known. A number of authors have used point data acquired from field studies of chloride deposition around Australia to construct relationships to characterise chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast; these relationships have allowed chloride deposition to be interpolated in different regions around Australia. In this paper we took this a step further and developed a chloride deposition map for all of Australia which includes a quantification of uncertainty. A previously developed four parameter model of chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast for Australia was used as the basis for producing a continental scale chloride deposition map. Each of the four model parameters were made spatially variable by creating parameter surfaces that were interpolated using a pilot point regularisation approach within a parameter estimation software. The observations of chloride deposition were drawn from a literature review that identified 291 point measurements of chloride deposition over a period of 80 years spread unevenly across all Australian States and Territories. A best estimate chloride deposition map was developed from the resulting surfaces on a 0.05 degree grid. The uncertainty in the chloride deposition map was quantified as the 5th and 95th percentile of 1000 calibrated models produced via Null Space Monte Carlo analysis and the spatial variability of chloride deposition across the continent was consistent with landscape morphology. The temporal variability in chloride deposition on a decadal scale was investigated in the Murray-Darling Basin, this highlighted the need for long-term monitoring of chloride deposition if the uncertainty of the continental scale map is to be reduced. Use of the derived chloride deposition map was demonstrated for a probabilistic estimation of groundwater recharge for the southeast of South Australia using the chloride mass balance method.

AB The present study developed a two dimensional mechanical-hydraulic-solute transport model for rough-walled rock fractures under constant normal stiffness boundary conditions. First, the mechanical responses of a fracture during shear including the shear stress, the normal stress, the dilation and the sheared-off area of asperities at each shear step were calculated in a mechanical module. The surface roughness was characterized by two-order asperities, i.e., waviness and unevenness, and the degradation of asperities was estimated based on the principle of wear. The mechanical module was validated by comparison with laboratory experiments. The surface geometry and the dilation behavior were subsequently incorporated into a hydraulic module to estimate the hydraulic aperture and flow rate based on the cubic law. Finally, these data were input into a solute transport module to investigate the influences of the mechanical boundary conditions on the solute transport in the fracture and the matrix at different shear displacements and time. The model linked the complex mechanisms involved in the mechanical, hydraulic and solute transport processes for fractures subjected to shear, and revealed a controlling effect of normal stiffness on the transport behavior. The results show that the normal displacement, normal stress, cumulative sheared-off area and porosity of matrix change quickly in the initial stage of shear, and gradually reach some constant values when the fracture surface is sufficiently smoothed in the residual stage. In the entire shear process, the major asperities are substantially damaged, producing abundant gouge particles that contribute to the retardation of solute transport. The shear-induced dilation and the retardation induced by gouge particles from damaged asperities played competitive roles in solute transport that resulted in the nonlinear variations in the coefficient of retardation. The model established a solid platform for estimating the mechanical-hydraulic-solute transport processes in fractures subjected to shear, upon which more sophisticated modules such as pressure solution and clogging by particles may be developed to improve the understanding on the outstanding issues involved in the coupled processes.

AB Analysis of precipitation observations from Chile indicated that man-made water reservoirs might be affecting the intensity of extreme precipitation events. Fifty rain gauges were used to evaluate rainfall intensities under different climates, using the Gumbel method (T = 5 and 100 years) and average maximum recorded rainfall intensities to construct IDF curves for each station. A spatial analysis of the stations was undertaken to establish graphical relationships on documented maximum annual rainfall intensities for 1 h and those obtained by the Gumbel method as a function of latitude, longitude, elevation, and the distance from water bodies. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied with an error of 5%. Values obtained from stations located close to water bodies were compared to those located away from them. The results show significant changes in dryer climates. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wind drift has a significant influence on the rainfall-runoff relationship in urban high-rise building areas since the oblique rainfall caused by the wind drift can interact with the building walls. However, the impact of the rainfall inclination angle on the rainfall-runoff process in urban high-rise building areas has not been studied. In this study, the relationship between wind and the rainfall-runoff process in such areas was explored. A theoretical framework has been developed to describe their relationship, including a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to obtain the relationship between wind speed and rainfall inclination and a newly derived equation to describe the relationship between rainfall inclination and the runoff coefficient. Subsequently, a laboratory scale model experiment was conducted to verify the proposed framework. The main results are that (1) the runoff coefficient calculated by the proposed theoretical framework is highly consistent with that obtained from the laboratory experiment, (2) the runoff coefficient of urban high-rise building areas increases with wind speed and the increase rate is linear with the tangent of the rainfall inclination angle, and (3) the change in the runoff coefficient for the experiment with larger raindrop is 0.047 when the wind speed increases from 0 to 5.9m s(-1), while that for the experiment with smaller raindrop is 0.064, which means that the rainfall with larger droplets is less influenced by the wind.

AB Flood forecasting is an important non-structural approach for flood mitigation. The flood stage is chosen as the variable to be forecasted because it is practically useful in flood forecasting. The support vector machine, a novel artificial intelligence-based method developed from statistical learning theory, is adopted herein to establish a real-time stage forecasting model. The tags associated with the input variables are determined by applying the hydrological concept of the time of response, and a two-step grid search method is applied to find the optimal parameters, and thus overcome the difficulties in constructing the learning machine. Two structures of models used to perform multiple-hour-ahead stage forecasts are developed. Validation results from flood events in Lan-Yang River, Taiwan, revealed that the proposed models can effectively predict the flood stage forecasts one-to-six-hours ahead. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the tags associated with the input variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Droughts, like floods, represent the most dangerous, and costly, water cycle expressions, with huge impacts on society and built environment. Droughts are events occurring over a certain region, lasting several weeks or months, and involving multiple variables: thus, a multivariate, multi-site, approach is most appropriate for their statistical characterization. In this methodological work, hydrological droughts are considered, and a multivariate approach is proposed, by regarding as relevant variables the duration and the average intensity. A multivariate, multi-site, frequency analysis is presented, based on the Theory of Copulas and the joint Survival Kendall's Return Periods, by investigating the historical drought episodes occurred at five main river sections of the Po river (Northern Italy), the most important Italian basin. The tool of Dynamic Return Period is used, and the new concepts of Hazard Trajectories and Fans are introduced, in order to provide useful indications for a valuable multi-site real-time assessment of droughts.

AB The stable isotopes of water are useful tracers of water sources and hydrological processes. Stable water isotope-enabled land surface modeling is a relatively new approach for characterizing the hydrological cycle, providing spatial and temporal variability for a number of hydrological processes. At the land surface, the integration of stable water isotopes with other meteorological measurements can assist in constraining surface heat flux estimates and discriminate between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). However, research in this area has traditionally been limited by a lack of continuous in-situ isotopic observations. Here, the National Centre for Atmospheric Research stable isotope-enabled Land Surface Model (ISOLSM) is used to simulate the water and energy fluxes and stable water isotope variations. The model was run for a period of one month with meteorological data collected from a coastal sub-tropical site near Sydney, Australia. The modeled energy fluxes (latent heat and sensible heat) agreed reasonably well with eddy covariance observations, indicating that ISOLSM has the capacity to reproduce observed flux behavior. Comparison of modeled isotopic compositions of evapotranspiration (ET) against in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measured bulk water vapor isotopic data (10 m above the ground), however, showed differences in magnitude and temporal patterns. The disparity is due to a small contribution from local ET fluxes to atmospheric boundary layer water vapor (similar to 1% based on calculations using ideal gas law) relative to that advected from the ocean for this particular site. Using ISOLSM simulation, the ET was partitioned into E and T with 70% being T. We also identified that soil water from different soil layers affected T and E differently based on the simulated soil isotopic patterns, which reflects the internal working of ISOLSM. These results highlighted the capacity of using the isotope-enabled models to discriminate between different hydrological components and add insight into expected hydrological behavior.

AB This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the effects of spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation on the scaling behavior of runoff timing responses. A previous modeling study on the Illinois River Basin in Oklahoma had revealed a systematic spatial trend in the relative dominance of different runoff generation mechanisms, attributable to corresponding systematic trends in landscape properties. Considering the differences in the timing of hillslope responses between the different runoff mechanisms, this paper explores their impacts on the catchment-scale runoff routing responses, including how they change with spatial scale. For this purpose we utilize a distributed, physically based hydrological model, with a fully hydraulic stream network routing component. The model is used to generate instantaneous response functions (IRF) for nested catchments of a range of sizes along the river network and quantitative measures of their shape, e. g., peak and time to peak. In order to separate the effects of soil heterogeneity from those due to basin geomorphology, the model simulations are carried out for three hypothetical cases that make assumptions regarding landscape properties (uniform, a systematic trend, and heterogeneity plus the trend), repeating these simulations under wet and dry antecedent conditions. The simulations produced expected and also surprising results. The power law relationship between the peak of the IRF and drainage area is shown to be flatter under wet conditions than under dry conditions, even though the (faster) saturation excess mechanism is more dominant under wet conditions. This result appears to be caused by partial area runoff generation: under wet conditions, the fraction of saturation area is about 30%, while under dry conditions it is less than 10% for the same input of rainfall. This means travel times associated with overland flow (which mostly contributes to the peak and time to peak) are, in fact, longer during wet conditions than during dry conditions. The power law relationship between peak and drainage area also exhibits a scaling break at around 1000 km(2), which can be shown to be related to the peculiar geomorphology of the catchment.

AB Runoff in arid and semiarid areas is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability. The spatial component is largely associated with the high spatial heterogeneity of soil surface attributes, such as vegetation and rock fragment covers, topography, and soil crust typology. Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are a common soil cover in arid and semiarid areas, and they play an essential role in local hydrological processes, since they affect many soil surface attributes associated with hydrologic properties. Although several publications have reported on the influence of BSCs on runoff at microplot spatial scales, only a few have examined their influence on larger spatial scales. Moreover, very few studies have analyzed the effect of BSCs on runoff under natural rain conditions. This is difficult, since a complex pattern of interactions among rainfall properties, BSC characteristics and some local characteristics, such as topography or type of soil is expected. In addition, in order to achieve a realistic model of how BSCs and rainfall affect runoff, it would be necessary to consider the level of human-driven degradation of BSCs. In this study, runoff was analyzed in plots with varying cover of cyanobacterial and lichen BSCs at microplot and small hillslope scales for two hydrological years in badlands in SE Spain. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test both direct and indirect relationships of BSC cover, slope gradient, rainfall characteristics and runoff. Our model showed that rainfall characteristics were the main factors controlling runoff yield. The slope positively affected runoff at small hillslope scales, but did not influence runoff at microplot scales. Runoff decreased at both scales with increased lichen-BSC cover. However, this effect was only significant during low-intensity events. Under high rainfall intensities, neither the BSC cover nor the slope had a causal effect on runoff. Our results suggest that incorporation of BSC-crusted surfaces in models should improve their capabilities for low-intensity rainfall events in semiarid areas similar to ours, but would be less important for high-intensity events. In addition, our approach, which takes direct and indirect relationships of factors affecting runoff into consideration, provides a very accurate picture of the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper. we analyse the spatio-temporal variability of instantaneous and cumulated evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes measured during two long drying periods with a soil water balance approach on 28 point measurements located within a small maize cropped field. Then we test three sampling procedures to estimate field averaged ET and their associated uncertainty. Results of this study show that the 'within-field' spatial variability of the local scale instantaneous measured ET is large with coefficients of variation ranging between 15.5 and 46.3%. The corresponding cumulated ET for the first and the second period ranges between 39.4-107.5 and 30.3-55.7 mm, respectively. We show that this variability of ET fluxes can be related in some way to the measured spatially variable crop growth (2.2 < Leaf Area Index < 4.3). This one has directly an impact on the ratio between the measured actual ET and the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) which generally is smaller than 1 in our field. The first sampling strategy which consists in increasing the number of sampling locations shows that, for a probability level of 95%. the number of samples needed to estimate the field mean cumulated ET flux with a relative precision of 5, 10 and 20% ranges between 40 and 360, 10 and 90, and 2 and 22. respectively. The number of samples required for the estimation of 'instantaneous' ET fluxes is even larger. The second sampling strategy which exploits the concept of temporal stability can only be applied for the estimation of cumulated ET. In this case the field averaged ET is estimated with a relative precision of 10% if only one representative location is selected apriori. The third sampling strategy consists of using a covariant such as the LAI or the dry matter yield. For this case, cumulated ET equals 119 +/- 6.1 and 118.5 +/- 4.5 mm by means of the relationships existing between cumulated ET and LAI and yields, respectively. The latter strategy seems very attractive but necessitates more research to investigate the robustness of the relationships with respect to different climatic and agronomic conditions and to different plant cultivars.

AB The objective of this paper is to present a radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation algorithm and assess its quality over the complex terrain of western Iceland. The proposed scheme deals with the treatment of beam blockage, anomalous propagation, vertical profile of reflectivity and includes a radar adjustment technique compensating for range, orographic effects and variations in the Z-R relationship. The quality of the estimated precipitation is remarkably enhanced after post-processing and in reasonably good agreement with what is known about the spatial distribution of precipitation in the studied area from both rain gauge observations and a gridded dataset derived from an orographic precipitation model. The results suggest that this methodology offers a credible solution to obtain an estimate of the distribution of precipitation in mountainous terrain and appears to be of practical value to meteorologists and hydrologists.

ID DYNAMIC PERMEABILITY; PROPAGATION; FREQUENCY
AB Over the past years there has been a growing interest in the use of seismic waves to gain required information about the Earth's subsurface. Despite all achievements, the problem of accurately linking field measurement of seismic attributes to subsurface hydrological properties such as porosity and intrinsic permeability is still ambiguous. The goal of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive study on the effect of subsurface hydrological properties on seismic attributes such as wave attenuation and velocity. This is achieved by using dispersion relations obtained from equations of wave motion that are derived from Biot's theory of poroelasticity. Since the attenuation predicted from Biot's theory is only due to relative motion of the solid and fluid phases, viscoelasticity effects are introduced to consider the attenuation caused by grain to grain contact. The dispersion relations for body waves including fast wave, slow wave and shear wave are valid in both low and high frequency ranges where viscous and inertia effects are dominant, respectively.
   Numerical simulations are performed on sand samples over a wide range of frequencies (1 Hz to 1 MHz). For samples with constant porosity, but different intrinsic permeabilities, it is demonstrated that the velocity of slow wave is higher for the more permeable sample over the full frequency range. The velocity of fast wave and shear wave is higher for the more permeable sample, but the difference is significant only at intermediate frequencies (10-100,000 Hz). However, the corresponding peak velocity and attenuation of each of the wave modes are almost equal for different intrinsic permeability values and, therefore, independent of intrinsic permeability. Another series of numerical simulations are carried out on sand samples with different porosity values. It is shown that the most porous sand has higher slow wave and shear wave velocity, but lower fast wave velocity. Also, the peak attenuation of fast wave and shear wave gets larger as sand porosity increases, but slow wave behavior is opposite. Remarkable result is that all wave modes become more dispersive when porosity increases. Thus, neglecting the dependence of wave velocity on frequency can lead to significant miscalculation of wave velocity for sand samples with high porosity values. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mitigating water contamination, improving water security, and increasing sustainability involve environmental awareness and conscientious decision-making by denizens and stakeholders. Achieving such awareness requires visually compelling geospatial decision-making tools that take into account the probabilistic and spatially distributed nature of water contamination. Inspired by the success of weather maps, this paper presents a novel STochastic Reliability-based Risk Evaluation And Mapping for watershed Systems and Sustainability (STREAMS) tool that produces and effectively communicates the risk of water contamination as maps. STREAMS is integrated with ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and uses physics-based reliability theory to compute the spatial distribution of risk, which is defined as the probability of exceeding a safety threshold of water contamination within a watershed. A quantitative analysis of the efficacy of mitigation strategies is conducted by estimating risk reduction from best management practices throughout the entire watershed. Two case studies at different spatial scales are presented, demonstrating STREAMS application to watersheds with varied properties.

AB The knowledge of the rainfall drop size distribution (DSD) at the land surface is essential for understanding precipitation mechanisms affecting soil erosion processes. Rainfall erosivity is defined as the potential of rain to cause erosion and it can be evaluated by rainfall kinetic power, which is determined by DSD and raindrop terminal velocity.
   This paper firstly deals with the raindrop terminal velocity estimate. Then the most widely used DSD are reviewed highlighting the difference between the raindrop size distribution per unit volume of air and that per unit area and time. The reliability of the available kinetic power-rainfall intensity relationships and their application in several part of the world is discussed, highlighting that the use of rainfall intensity is not sufficient to determine the rainfall kinetic power everywhere. Finally, the influence of seasonality on both raindrop size distribution and rainfall energy characteristics is investigated using DSD measurements carried out by an optical disdrometer placed at Palermo experimental area.

ID ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; HUMIDITY; TERRAIN
AB Wind velocity and temperature profiles measured by radiosondes were used in combination with near-surface air temperatures, in order to derive surface fluxes of sensible heat H and of momentum u*. The role of the near-surface air temperature was to stabilize the otherwise noisy radiosonde profiles. The computational procedure was developed from standard Monin-Obukhov flux-profile relationships for the atmospheric surface layer. The measurements were made in the context of the International Alpine Experiment ALPEX at the Rietholzbach catchment in a region of complex rugged terrain of the Swiss Fore-Alps. The positive correlation (r = 0.7) between the profile derived values of H and those obtained at a central station of the catchment, supports the existence of a surface layer even above this very rough terrain. The values of latent heat flux (evaporation) obtained from these H values by means of the energy budget agreed well (r = 0.94) with lysimeter measurements at the central station.

AB Coastal aquifers are an important freshwater resource for significant portions of the global population. Understanding the dynamic relationship between aquifer recharge, storage and discharge is fundamental for sustainable groundwater management. Here we present an expanded freshwater balance equation that considers the dynamic interaction between fresh groundwater and underlying saltwater through a respective storage term, which may explain significant time lags in long-term trends between recharge, storage and discharge. We demonstrate the presence of such a time lag and its effect on freshwater budget calculations with data from a major karst spring in Florida. We develop and validate a parsimonious aquifer model and show that our expanded water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi-decadal averages of rainfall and spring discharge. Long-term trends in precipitation are known to occur in many regions of the world, and we expect our findings to have direct relevance for coastal aquifers at a global scale.

AB In this paper we explored how landscape characteristics such as topography, geology, soils and land cover influence the way catchments respond to changing climate conditions. Based on an ensemble of 15 regional climate models bias-corrected with a distribution-mapping approach, present and future streamflow in 14 neighboring and rather similar catchments in Northern Sweden was simulated with the HBV model. We established functional relationships between a range of landscape characteristics and projected changes in streamflow signatures. These were then used to analyze hydrological consequences of physical perturbations in a hypothetically ungauged basin in a climate change context. Our analysis showed a strong connection between the forest cover extent and the sensitivity of different components of a catchment's hydrological regime to changing climate conditions. This emphasizes the need to redefine forestry goals and practices in advance of climate change-related risks and uncertainties.

AB The relationship between floodwater infiltration and groundwater recharge of a shallow alluvial aquifer in a hyper-arid desert was studied in the Arava valley, Israel. The study implemented an experimental system that simultaneously monitors all three hydrological domains controlling the recharge process: (1) floodwater stages on land surface, (2) water-content variations in the deep vadose zone, and (3) groundwater response to the infiltration. This experimental system makes use of a new technique for installing flexible time-domain reflectometry probes for continuous monitoring of the vadose zone moisture profiles. Water infiltration was monitored in controlled infiltration experiments and during a natural flood. The monitoring setup allowed real-time tracking of the wetting-front propagation velocities and assessment of water fluxes through the vadose zone. The results revealed a complex infiltration process that includes matrix and preferential flow together with lateral flow. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) products have been evaluated primarily using data from northern middle latitudes; therefore, little is known about their performance at low latitudes. To address this bias, an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N. The flux data were obtained from the emerging network in Mexico (MexFlux) and from openly available databases of FLUXNET, AsiaFlux, and OzFlux. This unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing-based ET products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies. The evaluated products were: MODIS ET (MOD16, both the discontinued collection 5 (C5) and the latest collection (C6)), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) ET. Products were compared with unadjusted fluxes (ETorig) and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure (ETebc). Three common statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and productspecific vegetation match indexes. Evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes. Differences between the MOD16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products. Performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether ETorig or ETebc was used. When using ETorig, GLEAM generally had the highest R2, smallest PBIAS, and best RMSE values across the studied land cover types and climate zones. Neither MOD16 nor ALEXI performed consistently better than the other. When using ETebc, none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations. The use of ETebc instead of ETorig affected the biases more than the correlations. The product evaluation results showed no significant relationship with the degree of match between the vegetation at the pixel and site scale. The latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower R2 (all products) but better PBIAS and normalized RMSE values (MOD16 and GLEAM) for forests at low latitudes than

TI PREDICTING SOIL-SURFACE SEAL CONDUCTANCE FROM INCIPIENT PONDING AND

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

AB The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the degree of seal development at incipient ponding, and (2) the relationship between the hydraulic conductance of developing seals and rainstorm characteristics, i.e. the rain intensity and kinetic energy rate. Laboratory columns of an Atwood soil (Typic Paleudalf) were subjected to rainstorms with different combinations of duration, intensity, and kinetic energy rate. Seal conductance was determined from measured infiltration data and a solution of the Richards' equation for vertical infiltration through an infinitely thin seal. The results show that the hydraulic conductance of the sealing zone decreased rapidly during early stages of rainfall commencing before incipient ponding. The analyses indicate that for storms of relatively brief duration (less than 2 h) the hydraulic conductance of the sealing zone depends on the cumulative rainfall energy and on the rainstorm intensity.

ID RAIN; SENSITIVITY; ATTENUATION
AB Precipitation measurement by radar allows for areal rainfall determination with a high spatial and temporal resolution. However, hydrological applications require an accuracy of the precipitation quantification which cannot be obtained by today's weather radar devices. The quality of the radar-derived precipitation can be significantly improved with the aid of ground measurements. In this paper, a complete processing pipeline for real-time radar precipitation determination using a modified statistical objective analysis method is presented. Thereby, several additional algorithms, such as a dynamical use of Z-R relationships, a bias correction and an advection correction scheme are employed. The performance of the algorithms is tested for several case studies. For an error analysis, an eight months data set of X-band radar scans and rain gauge precipitation measurements is used. We show a reduction in the radar-rain gauge RMS difference of up to 59% for the optimal combination of the different algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a new method to determine the soil surface crust resistance in situ. The method is based on the assumption that the crust is well established prior to the infiltration. In this case, and for steady infiltration regime the hydraulic resistance of the crust, can be inferred from the infiltration rate and the relationship between soil conductivity and water pressure head. The proposed method combines two types of in situ experiments: (i) rain simulation experiments; and (ii) single ring infiltration tests on the same soil after removal of the crust in order to assess the soil hydraulic properties. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested by reproducing numerically the experiments. The comparison of the numerical results with observations was satisfactory. Further validation and tests on other soil types are required in order to confirm our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present an efficient semi-analytical algorithm that uses complex potential theory and superposition to delineate the capture zone curves of extraction wells. This algorithm is more flexible than previously published techniques and allows the user to determine the capture zone for a number of arbitrarily positioned extraction wells pumping at different rates. The algorithm is applied to determine the capture zones and optimal well spacing of two wells pumping at different flow rates and positioned at various orientations to the direction of regional groundwater flow. The algorithm is also applied to determine capture zones for non-colinear three-well configurations as well as to determine optimal well spacing for up to six wells pumping at the same rate. We show that the optimal well spacing is found by minimizing the difference in the stream function evaluated at the stagnation points. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used to determine spatiotemporal resistivity changes in the vadose root zone of an oak-pine forest during an 8-day period of drying following a rainfall event. Electrical images from 0 to 2 m depth, incorporating the shallow root zone, were inferred to represent spatiotemporal variability of moisture between tree and non-tree areas resulting from hydraulic redistribution (HR). Electrical resistance measurements on a grid of 96 electrodes were collected, six times a day, from July 2nd to July 10th, 2009. Images were produced from a 3-D inversion of resistance measurements that were assigned weights based on error models that accounted for both measurement (reciprocal) and modeling errors. To account for temperature variations, a sinusoidal diurnal temperature correction based on the 1-D heat conduction equation and measurements at 5 cm depth was applied to the resistivity results. Laboratory measurements of resistivity as a function of moisture content for samples from the site obeyed Archie's Law, suggesting that electrolytic conduction is the dominant current pathway in these soils. Spatiotemporal variability in moisture dynamics due to root zone processes was therefore inferred from spatial variation in changes of electrical conductivity over time. Electrical conductivity depth profiles were generated for tree versus non-tree locations using conductivities from corresponding finite element mesh voxel coordinates. These profiles reveal a stable temporal profile beneath trees relative to a pronounced decrease in electrical conductivity over time at non-tree locations. Relative changes in electrical conductivity between 6 am and 6 pm surveys revealed that both tree and non-tree locations are more conductive at 6 am, although changes are greater at tree locations. This finding is likely diagnostic of hydraulic lift (HL) overnight by tree roots. Regardless of location, the differences between 6 am and 6 pm surveys are consistent with HR, impacting moisture content across the entire survey area. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Where surface and groundwater are managed conjunctively, the stress on water supplies from climate change can significantly influence water use patterns as well as the economic value and sustainability of those uses. However, aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out. Evidence from climate-stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans. Despite these efforts, few peer-reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection. This work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of North America's Middle Rio Grande Basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection. It also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans. The model accounts for surface and groundwater storage, irrigation, urban, environmental, and recreational demands, surface water inflows under various climate scenarios, groundwater pumping and recharge, substitute water prices, crop water use, evaporation, as well as institutional constraints governing water use. The objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses, sectors, and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers. Results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios, two substitute water prices, and two system operation rules. To address impacts of aquifer protection targets, groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region's two major aquifers. We assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios. Results show that climate change, in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows, considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability, amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system. Future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination, recycling and reuse, substitution of other resources for water, better characterization of existing aquifers, and development of new groundwater supplies.

AB Perth, Western Australia (pop. 1.6 m) derives 60% of its public water supply from the Gnangara groundwater system (GGS). Horticulture, domestic self-supply, and municipal parks are other major consumers of GGS groundwater. The system supports important wetlands and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Underlying approximately 2200 km(2) of the Swan Coastal Plain, the GGS comprises several aquifer levels with partial interconnectivity. Supplies of GGS groundwater are under unprecedented stress, due to reduced recharge and increases in extraction. Stored reserves in the superficial aquifer fell by 700 GL between 1979 and 2008. Over a similar period, annual extraction for public supply increased by more than 350% from the system overall. Some management areas are over-allocated by as much as 69%.
   One potential policy response is a trading scheme for groundwater use. There has been only limited trading between GGS irrigators. Design and implementation of a robust groundwater trading scheme faces hydrological and/or hydro-economic challenges, among others. Groundwater trading involves transfers of the right to extract water. The resulting potential for spatial (and temporal) redistribution of the impacts of extraction requires management. Impacts at the respective selling and buying locations may differ in scale and nature. Negative externalities from groundwater trading may be uncertain as well as not monetarily compensable.
   An ideal groundwater trading scheme would ensure that marginal costs from trades do not exceed marginal benefits, incorporating future effects and impacts on third-parties. If this condition could be met, all transactions would result in constant or improved overall welfare. This paper examines issues that could reduce public welfare if groundwater trading is not subject to well-designed governance arrangements that are appropriate to meeting the above condition. It also outlines some opportunities to address key risks within the design of a groundwater trading scheme. We present a number of challenges, focusing on those with hydrological bases and/or information requirements. These include the appropriate hydrological definition of the boundaries of a trading area, the establishment and defining of sustainable yield and consumptive pool, and the estimation of effects of extractions on ecosystems and human users. We suggest several possible design tools. A combination of sustainable extraction limits, trading rules, management areas, and/or exchange rates may enable a trading scheme to address the above goals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Previous estimations of sediment flux for the Salinas River of central California were based on data collected in the 1970s and assumptions of time invariant suspended sediment-discharge behavior. The goals of this study were to estimate sediment flux from the Salinas River using data from 1967-2011 by incorporating time dependent behavior and reassess the role of El Nino Southern Oscillation patterns in inter-decadal sediment load. This study builds on previous findings that time-dependent suspended sediment behavior in this system is controlled in part by antecedent hydrologic conditions. The condition of temporal dependence was further tested herein through comparison of flux estimates obtained using time-dependent formulations and a multivariate approach incorporating hydrologic factors. Longer sampling records and incorporation of decadal scale behavior or antecedent hydrologic conditions resulted in average annual load estimates of 2.0-2.9 Mt/yr with 95% confidence intervals of +/- 25 to 202%, in comparison to earlier estimates of similar to 3.3 Mt/yr. Previous overestimation of sediment load is due largely to the extrapolation of suspended sediment behavior from a decade of high sediment concentrations to the entire record, and the use of log-linear regression techniques on a non-linear system. The use of LOESS methods lowered Q(ss) estimates and decreased confidence interval size. The inclusion of time-stratified and antecedent flow indices further decreased Q(ss) estimates, but increased confidence interval size. However, temporal dependence of the C-ss-Q relationship violates the assumptions of single base period regression, which suggests that time-stratified rating curves provide more realistic estimates of sediment flux means and uncertainty. The majority of suspended sediment was transported by flows of similar to 25-90 times mean discharge depending on transport constituent (fines or sand) and estimation method. Periods of differential suspended sediment behavior changed the relative importance of rare floods due to changes in the relationship of suspended sediment concentration vs. discharge. El Nino years dominated the sediment budget by producing on average ten times more sediment than non-El Nino years. Sediment load estimates provided further evidence that antecedent hydrologic conditions appear to have caused much of the temporal dependence of suspended sediment behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two innovative approaches for upscaling and regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity at watershed scale are proposed. They are based on the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may characterize large-scale properties and were tested on an unconfined granitic aquifer exposed to deep weathering, located in South India (Maheshwaram watershed, 53 km(2)). Both methods are based on field data such as water levels, discharge rates of irrigation wells, geological observations and the results of small-scale hydraulic tests. The resulting hydraulic-conductivity map uses the statistical empirical relationship between log-normal distributions of hydraulic conductivity from small-scale tests and linear discharge rates from exploited wells, i.e. the ratio between discharge rate and the saturated aquifer thickness. The empirical relationship agrees with Thiem-Dupuit's assumption for unconfined aquifers. The performance of the method was compared to the values of local hydraulic-conductivity estimates deduced from small-scale tests (not used for drawing the map). About 90% of simulated values varies less than 20% from local measurements (Log K +/- 0.4 on average), which is reasonable considering the complexity of the studied fractured aquifer. The regionalization of the effective porosity was based on a method that combines both water-table fluctuation and groundwater-budget techniques in the absence of recharge from rainfall. However, the use of these techniques at cell scale requires a good knowledge of groundwater flux to and from the cells, which here is unknown. To avoid this difficulty a coarse-graining method was used, assuming that increasing the cell size for such computations leads to a negligible contribution of these flux compared to net groundwater abstraction from the cell. Our results show that cell sizes over 520 x 520 m achieve a negligible balance. In addition, porosity maps provide average values of around 1.5% that are almost identical to the ones previously found at watershed scale.
   The proposed methods for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields provide access not only to the average large-scale values, but also to their spatial distribution, which is of prime interest in terms of flux and contaminant transport in a hard-rock environment.
   The uncertainty introduced by field data, the choice of the computation scale as the impact of cell size on the calculated effective porosity value and the possible meaning of their spatial variations are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WATER-BALANCE; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; SOIL
AB The relationship between catchment scale and climatological variability of surface-runoff volume is evaluated through theoretical and empirical analyses. Using a point description of surface-runoff volume following infiltration excess under the time compression approximation, climatological mean and variance of areal runoff volume over heterogeneous soil are evaluated by integrating second-order statistics pf point runoff volume. Second-order statistics of rainfall duration and intensity, required for evaluation of those of point runoff volume, are obtained from mean and variance of areal rainfall volume under fractional coverage considerations. Hourly Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler rainfall data were used to estimate rainfall parameters following a set of simplifying assumptions on the space-time correlation structure. Two contrasting climate-soil systems were considered in specifying soil and soil moisture parameters following a set of assumptions on spatial variability and interdependency of the soil parameters.

AB Runoff hydrology has a large historical context concerned with the mechanisms and pathways of how water is transferred to the stream network. Despite this, there has been relatively little application of run-off generation theory to cold regions, particularly the expansive treeless environments where tundra vegetation, permafrost, and organic soils predominate. Here, the hydrological cycle is heavily influenced by 1) snow storage and release, 2) permafrost and frozen ground that restricts drainage, and 3) the water holding capacity of organic soils. While previous research has adapted temperate runoff generation concepts such its variable source area, transmissivity feedback, and fill-and-spill. there has been no runoff generation concept developed explicitly for tundra environments. Here, we propose an energy-based framework for delineating runoff contributing areas for tundra environments. Aerodynamic energy and roughness height control the end-of-winter snow water equivalent, which varies orders of magnitude across the landscape. Radiant energy in turn controls snowmelt and ground thaw rates. The combined spatial pattern of aerodynamic and radiant energy control flow pathways and the runoff contributing areas of the catchment, which are persistent on a year-to-year basis. While ground surface topography obviously plays in important role in the assessment of contributing areas, the close coupling of energy to the hydrological cycles in arctic and alpine tundra environments dictates a new paradigm.

AB The physics of the rainfall infiltration under a constant rainfall flux greater than the hydraulic conductivity at saturation are investigated and compared with those pertaining to the infiltration process under flooding.  From the arguments developed theoretically the following conclusions are reached:  The moisture profile prevailing at the time the soil surface becomes saturated during the rainfall process (t = T) is identical with the profile which has been developed during flooding at an earlier time at which the infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall flux (t = t(c) < T).  The rainfall profile development after T is the same as that of the profile under flooding after T(c), the two profiles having a constant time lag equal to (T - t(c)).  The Green and Ampt analysis as has been applied to the constant flux rainfall infiltration presupposes the identity of the profiles mentioned above.  In addition to the theoretical arguments, the flow equation was solved numerically for four different soils under the conditions that define the two infiltration processes.  The numerical results obtained conform with the theory.

ID FLOODPLAINS; MANAGEMENT
AB Flood drainage rights (FDR) refer to the rights of all regions in a watershed to drain floodwaters into river reaches under the permission of law. FDR is an important measure used to manage the flooding in various regions of China. This paper explores the problem of flood drainage conflicts caused by regional competition for FDR during flood disasters. We designed an FDR allocation indicator system based on the principles of fairness, efficiency, sustainable development, respect for historical context, and flood resilience strategy. We used the interval multi-objective allocation model based on the projection method to create an FDR pre-allocation plan, and iteratively improved it until it exceeded the standards of a harmonious diagnosis method, thereby obtaining a harmonious allocation plan. The Jiangsu section of the Sunan Canal in the Yangtze River Delta region of China was taken as an example, using data from 2009 to 2018, to study the suitability of our approach and compare it with other indicator systems. Our results showed that: (1) in the FDR pre-allocation, the proportions of FDR obtained by Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Changzhou were 32.81%, 19.83%, 24.68%, and 22.69%, respectively. However, the FDR pre-allocation scheme did not pass the harmonious diagnosis and would have been objectionable to some regions. (2) After two rounds of harmonious adjustment, the model yielded a final scheme that would promote the harmonious development of the region and improve the acceptability of the FDR allocation plan. In the harmonious distribution of FDR, the proportions of FDR obtained by Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Changzhou were changed to 29.18%, 20.03%, 28.10%, and 22.69%, respectively. (3) The allocation results based on our five-principle approach were the most harmonious of the tested plans. Our method is geared toward solving the problem of flood drainage conflicts between regions to ensure an orderly flood drainage situation, reduce flood losses, and promote the harmonious development of the entire watershed. As such, it provides a reference for governments and agencies involved in FDR management.

AB Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been widely used for shallow subsurface exploration in recent decades. The Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) was proposed and has been proved as one of the most efficient algorithms for data assimilation in variational fields. In this paper, ES-MDA is first applied as the assimilation scheme to inversely model the soil hydraulic parameters by using GPR data as the observation. In a synthetic example presented, Hydrus-1D is applied to generate the water content data and later converted into GPR data as observations based on the petrophysical relationship. Several synthetic experiments are performed to evaluate the related factors and test the performance of GPR data assimilation via ES-MDA. The results show that the novel approach can accurately estimate soil hydraulic parameters and effectively characterize the water content distribution.

   The core of our model is the relationship between subsurface response and soil water content, which embeds the complex dynamics occurring at the hillslope scale and it is related to the external climatic forcing through the mass balance equation. We tested this model in four small Alpine catchments located in the North-Eastern part of Italy: the Prese Val karst spring, characterized by the absence of a surface river network; and three typical Alpine creeks: Fersina, Tresenga and Rio Risla.
   We show that the model is able to reproduce the observed streamflow signals, despite meteorological data are sparse and uncertain. In particular, in all cases the model provides a good reproduction of the cumulative streamflow volume. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Influence diagnostics aim to identify a small number of influential data points that have a disproportionate impact on the model parameters and/or predictions. The key issues with current influence diagnostic techniques are that the regression-theory approaches do not provide hydrologically relevant influence metrics, while the case-deletion approaches are computationally expensive to calculate. The main objective of this study is to introduce a new two-stage hybrid framework that overcomes these challenges, by delivering hydrologically relevant influence metrics in a computationally efficient manner. Stage one uses computationally efficient regression-theory influence diagnostics to identify the most influential points based on Cook's distance. Stage two then uses case-deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the influence of points using hydrologically relevant metrics. To illustrate the application of the hybrid framework, we conducted three experiments on 11 hydro-climatologically diverse Australian catchments using the GR4J hydrological model. The first experiment investigated how many data points from stage one need to be retained in order to reliably identify those points that have the hightest influence on hydrologically relevant metrics. We found that a choice of 30-50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study (30 points identified the most influential data 98% of the time and reduced the required recalibrations by 99% for a 10 year calibration period). The second experiment found little evidence of a change in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1, 2, 5 to 10 years. Even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high (>30% influence on maximum predicted flows). The third experiment compared the standard least squares (SLS) objective function with the weighted least squares (WLS) objective function on a 10 year calibration period. In two out of three flow metrics there was evidence that SLS, with the assumption of homoscedastic residual error, identified data points with higher influence (largest changes of 40%, 10%, and 44% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively) than WLS, with the assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors (largest changes of 26%, 6%, and 6% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively). The hybrid framework complements existing model diagnostic tools and can be applied to a wide range of hydrological modelling scenarios. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB To test the transmissivity feedback hypothesis of runoff generation, surface and subsurface waters were monitored and sampled during the 1996 snowmelt at various topographic positions in a 41 ha forested headwater catchment at Sleepers River, Vermont. Two conditions that promote transmissivity feedback existed in the catchment during the melt period. First, saturated hydraulic conductivity increased toward land surface, from a geometric mean of 3.6 mm h(-1) in glacial till to 25.6 mm h(-1) in deep soil to 54.0 mm h(-1) in shallow soil. Second, groundwater levels rose to within 0.3 m of land surface at all riparian sites and most hillslope sites at peak melt. The importance of transmissivity feedback to streamflow generation was tested at the catchment scale by examination of physical and chemical patterns of groundwater in near-stream (discharge) and hillslope (recharge/lateral flow) zones, and within a geomorphic hollow (convergent flow).
   The presence of transmissivity feedback was supported by the abrupt increase in streamflow as the water table rose into the surficial, transmissive zone; a flattening of the groundwater level vs, streamflow curve occurred at most sites. This relation had a clockwise hysteresis (higher groundwater level for given discharge on rising limb than at same discharge on falling limb) at riparian sites, suggesting that the riparian zone was the dominant source area during the rising limb of the melt hydrograph. Hysteresis was counterclockwise at hillslope sites, suggesting that hillslope drainage controlled the snowmelt recession.
   End member mixing analysis using Ca, Mg, Na, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Si showed that stream chemistry could be explained as a two-component mixture of groundwater high in base cations and an O-horizon/overland how water high in DOG. The dominance of shallow How paths during events was indicated by the high positive correlation of DOC with streamflow (r(2) = 0.82). Despite the occurrence of transmissivity feedback. hillslope till and soil water were ruled out as end members primarily because their distinctive high-Si composition hail little or no effect on streamwater composition, Till water from the geomorphic hollow had a chemistry very close to streamwater base flow, and may represent the base now end member better than the more concentrated riparian groundwater. During snowmelt, streamwater composition shifted as this base flow was diluted - not by shallow groundwater from the hillslope, but rather bq a more surficial O-horizon/overland flow water, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Rainfall monitoring is fundamental in many hydrological applications such as flood and landslide forecasting and water resources management. In-situ measurements are the traditional data source of rainfall, but the worldwide declining number of stations, their low spatial representativeness and the data access problem limit their use. Satellite products are being widely used as an alternative data source. Among them, SM2RAIN-based products, which exploit the inversion of the water balance equation to derive rainfall from soil moisture observations, have shown relatively good skills for hydrological applications. However, the need of calibrating the SM2RAIN parameter values against a reference represents one important limitation, particularly over data scarce regions.
   In this study, we explore the possibility to self-calibrate SM2RAIN and thus to obtain rainfall estimates from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture independently from any reference rainfall dataset. Four parametric relationships relating SM2RAIN parameter values to static descriptors (average rainfall, topography, soil moisture noise) are developed. To develop such relationships, a sample of 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in Australia, India, Italy and the United States is selected. A global validation of the methodology is conducted by comparing the performances of the parameterized product with the classical product in which the parameter values are estimated by calibration against a reference rainfall dataset. The Final Run of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) precipitation dataset is used for performance assessment, together with the triple collocation techniques by using the Gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) product and the Late Run of IMERG.
   The aim of the analysis is to obtain an uncalibrated SM2RAIN methodology to retrieve rainfall whose performance are similar to those obtained with calibration. The results at 1009 points show that the performances of the parameterized SM2RAIN product are in line with those of the calibrated one, with an increased capability in the detection of intense rainfall events and an acceptable reduction of the performance according to both Pearson Correlation and Root Mean Square Error indexes. The application of triple collocation confirms these findings on a global scale, showing that the SM2RAIN product outperforms both GPCC and IMERG - Late run estimations in areas characterized by low density of rain gauges and good quality of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals (i.e., Africa and South America).

AB The rainfall erosivity factor (R) represents the multiplication of rainfall energy and maximum 30 min intensity by event (EI30) and year. This rainfall erosivity index is widely used for empirical soil loss prediction. Its calculation, however, requires high temporal resolution rainfall data that are not readily available in many parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to parameterize models suitable for estimating erosivity from daily rainfall data, which are more widely available. One-minute resolution rainfall data recorded in sixteen stations over the eastern water erosion impacted regions of China were analyzed. The R-factor ranged from 781.9 to 8258.5 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) y(-1). A total of 5942 erosive events from one-minute resolution rainfall data of ten stations were used to parameterize three models, and 4949 erosive events from the other six stations were used for validation. A threshold of daily rainfall between days classified as erosive and non-erosive was suggested to be 9.7 mm based on these data. Two of the models (I and II) used power law functions that required only daily rainfall totals. Model I used different model coefficients in the cool season (Oct.-Apr.) and warm season (May-Sept.), and Model II was fitted with a sinusoidal curve of seasonal variation. Both Model I and Model II estimated the erosivity index for average annual, yearly, and half-month temporal scales reasonably well, with the symmetric mean absolute percentage error MAPE(sym) ranging from 10.8% to 32.1%. Model II predicted slightly better than Model I. However, the prediction efficiency for the daily erosivity index was limited, with the symmetric mean absolute percentage error being 68.0% (Model I) and 65.7% (Model II) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency being 0.55 (Model I) and 0.57 (Model II). Model III, which used the combination of daily rainfall amount and daily maximum 60-min rainfall, improved predictions significantly, and produced a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency for daily erosivity index prediction of 0.93. Thus daily rainfall data was generally sufficient for estimating annual average, yearly, and half-monthly time scales, while sub daily data was needed when estimating daily erosivity values.

ID DIFFUSION WAVE MODEL; ELASTIC WAVES; PROPAGATION
AB Flow profiles of surface water passing over a vegetation-free area under a uniform rainfall are investigated by a semi-analytical approach. The ground is considered to be pervious and the soil layer of finite thickness is assumed homogeneous. The Navier-Stokes equations and Blot's theory of poroelasticity are employed to govern the surface water flow and subsurface water flow, respectively. Since the velocity distributions appear to be still a function of the water depth, a numerical technique is necessary to find the flow profiles on the ground before solving the flow velocity and discharge. A dimensionless parameter related to soil porosity and permeability is proposed to reveal its effect on surface and subsurface water flow. The water depths at the upper boundary for surface water flow also verify the previous research. The present solutions are compared to the conventional solutions and numerical solutions to show the validation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new methodology and a rainfall spatial organisation index to examine the relative role of hillslope and channel residence times in the analysis of the significance of spatial rainfall representation in catchment flood response modelling. The relationship between the flood response, the hillslope and channel residence time representation and the spatial organisation of the rainfall fields is obtained by extending the 'spatial moments of catchment rainfall' statistics (Zoccatelli et al., 2011) to the hillslope system. The flood prediction error generated by assuming spatially uniform rainfall is related to the spatial organisation of the rainfall fields by means of the scaled spatial moment of order one for the channel network and the hillslope system. The methodology provides a basis for a more general consideration of the relationship between the flood response dependence to spatial rainfall organisation and catchment size. The methodology is illustrated based on data from five extreme flash floods occurred in various European regions in the period 2002-2007. Discharge data are available either from streamgauges or from post-flood surveys for 27 catchments, ranging in size between 36 and 982 km(2). High space-time resolution radar rainfall fields are also available for the analyses. These data are used to implement a distributed hydrological model simulating the runoff generation by infiltration excess and explicitly representing the surface flow paths across both the hillslopes and the river network. The hydrological model is alternatively forced with spatially-distributed and spatially-uniform rainfall input, to analyse the factors controlling the sensitivity of the model output to the spatial rainfall data. Our results show that the spatial variability of the rainfall can influence the flash-flood hydrographs for catchments as small as 50 km(2), and that the dependence of flood hydrograph shape to spatial rainfall variability cannot be treated as scale dependent relative to the size of the catchment.
   The rainfall index can be exploited as similarity index for classifying catchments and flood events according to the hillslopes/channel residence times and to provide guidance on the space and time resolution of the rainfall monitoring system required to predict the flood response.

AB This paper presents a modeling approach to simulate runoff and soil erosion at the small watersheds of the Three-Gorge Reservoir drainage area in China by using limited plot data on runoff-soil erosion. The approach coupled the empirical relationships between soil loss and runoff. This relationship is derived from the experimental plots under different land use types with a spatially distributed hydrological model, WetSpa Extension, to calculate soil loss in grid cells. A topographic factor was also developed to account for the impacts of topography on soil loss. Finally, a constant Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) was applied to calculate sediment yields transported to the catchment outlet from grid cells. The coupled model was first calibrated for the study areas using the observed continuous discharge data and event-based sediment data over the period from May 1st through October 31st of 2001 in a small sub-catchment in Sichuan, China. The calibrated model was then applied to the same sub-catchment over the same period of every year from 1993 to 2000 as well as the neighboring catchments to assess the performance and stability of the model. A comparison of observed and simulated stream flows indicates that the model performance was acceptable in six (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000) of the 8 years with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.654 and 0.729 for weekly and monthly flow discharges, respectively. A comparison between the observed and simulated sediment yields showed that the simulation of sediment yields was very satisfactory (NSE = 0.88) and the spatial variability of soil erosion rates within the catchments was predominantly controlled by land use types. Finally, the model was applied to assess the efficacy of soil conservation through land use changes in Sub-catchment No. 2. The results clearly indicated that land use changes after 1990s have been very effective in reducing both runoff and sediment. This study suggests that experimental plot data is an effective supplement to modeling spatial variation of soil erosion, albeit their various limitations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT; SURFACE; MODEL; FLOW
AB The mixing of stream water and subsurface water in the hyporheic zone is an important function of fluvial ecosystems. Among the factors that drive water exchange between a stream and its sediments, turbulence is the most ubiquitous as rivers are always in turbulent flow regime. However, there is still much uncertainty about the role of turbulent processes in hyporheic exchange, probably because of the complex nonlinearities that characterize the dynamics of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations. In this paper, we adopt a numerical modeling approach to investigate the relationship between turbulent pressure properties and the resulting features of surface-subsurface exchange. In particular, we discuss the importance of large coherent structures of turbulence in driving exchange at depths that are much larger than the penetration depth of small turbulent eddies. The results of the numerical simulations elucidate the response of turbulent hyporheic exchange to changes in stream depth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper describes the use of an integrated surface-subsurface modelling approach to estimate recharge to a semi-arid Karoo aquifer and a comparison of the results with a chloride mass balance on a sub-area scale. Parameters were not calibrated, to test the success with which the model can be applied in regions of scarce data. The chloride balance suggests a mean annual recharge of 4.5 mm year(-1) based on a mean annual rainfall of 460 mm. The model predicts 5.8 mm year(-1) from a mean annual rainfall of 483 mm during the simulation period. Recharge was found to be highly variable in space with a positively skewed distribution in time. Spatial variability was attributed to differences in the distribution of soil moisture content resulting from variations in slope, soil texture and depth. Both methods suggest that recharge is considerably less than the mean of 9.9 mm year(-1) estimated from the currently prescribed rainfall-recharge relationship for Karoo aquifers.

AB This article presents experimental results for single- and two-phase flows at high flow rates through a replica of an actual rough-walled rock fracture. The results of the single- phase flow are interpreted using non-Darcian laws: the weak inertia cubic law, Forchheimer's law, and the full cubic law. They allow the determination of the fracture's intrinsic properties (absolute permeability and inertial coefficient). These laws are then generalized to describe non-Darcian two-phase flows. The generalized cubic and Forchheimer's laws are shown to be inconsistent in terms of the relative permeabilities. The generalization of the full cubic law is used to describe the liquid and gas relative permeabilities in the non-Darcian regime with a good accuracy.

ID FORMULA; INDIA
AB A general formula for the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (idf) relationship, consistent with the theoretical probabilistic foundation of the analysis of rainfall maxima is proposed. Specific forms of this formula are explicitly derived from the underlying probability distribution function of maximum intensities. Several appropriate distribution functions are studied for that purpose. Simple analytical approximations of the most common distribution functions are presented, which are incorporated in, and allow mathematically convenient expressions of idf relationships. Also, two methods for a reliable parameter estimation of idf relationships are proposed. The proposed formulation of idf relationships constitutes an efficient parameterisation, facilitating the description of the geographical variability and regionalisation of idf curves. Moreover, it allows incorporating data from non-recording stations, thus remedying the problem of establishing idf curves in places with a sparse network of rain-recording stations, using data of the denser network of non-recording stations. Case studies, based on data of a significant part of Greece, briefly presented in the paper, clarify the methodology for the construction and regionalisation of the idf relationship.

AB Hydraulic conductivity is crucial to revealing the mechanisms of frost damage in cold regions, while the hy-draulic conductivity of coarse-grained soils during freezing process has rarely been considered. In this study, a new pattern that ice grows from the pore wall is used to describe ice formation in coarse-grained soils. In this pattern, unfrozen water confined in the pore center provides flow channels for liquid water migration. The relationship between distribution characteristics of flow channels and hydraulic conductivity can be established by redefining parameters such as porosity phi e, hydraulic radius over bar RH and tortuosity Gamma in the Kozeny-Carman equation. It thus generates a new hydraulic conductivity model for frozen coarse-grained soils. Comparing with measured result in the literature, it shows that the proposed model gives a better prediction than existing models, especially for sand. The proposed model can provide a useful tool for simulating water-heat transfer process of coarse-grained soils in cold regions.

AB Water represents an essential element for the life of all who inhabit our planet. But the random nature of this resource, which is manifested by the alternation of wet periods and dry periods, makes it even more precious. Whatever the approach (water planning, water management, drought, economy), in order to maximise the profit produced by the allocation of water it is necessary an understanding of the relationships between physical variables as precipitation, temperatures, streamflows, reservoir volumes, piezometric levels, water demands and infrastructures management. This paper attends to provide a review of fundamental water scarcity and drought indexes that enables to assess the status of a water exploitation system. With the aim of a better water management and governance under water scarcity conditions., this paper also presents a classification of indexes to help decision makers and stakeholders to select the most appropriate indexes, taking as the starting point the objectives of the analysis and the river basin features.

AB This paper presents analysis of annual water balance variability, (1) regional (between-catchment) variability and (2) between-year (interannual) variability and the symmetry between the two. This involved analysis of the annual water balance in terms of a two-stage partitioning, first, of annual precipitation into quick flow and soil wetting and, subsequently, of the resulting soil wetting into slow flow and vaporization. The nature of this water balance partitioning is explored by completing the above analysis in 377 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) catchments located across the continental United States. We fitted analytical functional relationships to the partitioning at each stage, producing expressions for the three components of quick flow, slow flow, and vaporization. They indicate that the heterogeneity of water balance partitioning among the MOPEX catchments is underlain by a universal relationship that is transferable regionally. Key nondimensional similarity parameters are identified that serve to connect this invariant regional relationship to site-specific response characteristics. These nondimensional formulations are extended to derive analytical expressions for several common metrics of annual water balance. The ability of the functional theory to predict regional patterns of mean annual water balance and interannual variability in individual catchments is assessed. Our analyses show a close symmetry between spatial (regional) variability of mean annual water balances and general trends of temporal (interannual) variability. The suggested functional theory can thus be the basis for data-based assessments of hydrologic similarity and used to assist with predictions of the effects of long-term climate variability and change, through providing a theoretical framework for "space for time'' substitutions.

AB Uncertainty assessment is becoming one of the main topics in hydrology and water resources. In this study, an Interval-Deviation Approach (IDA) was designed and incorporated into the process of model evaluation. The proposed IDA was validated in a real application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), China. Compared with the traditional point-to-point comparison between measured and predicted data, the main superiority of the IDA is its innovative theory that models should be evaluated by each absolute distance between the paired uncertainty intervals or probability distribution for each measured and predicted data. In addition, the IDA can be used to quantify the possible range of model performance in a real application of the SWAT. This proposed IDA can be useful for error form indicators and models by providing a substitute method to facilitate enhanced evaluation of watershed models within an uncertainty framework.

AB Grey relational method (GRM) has emerged in recent years as a new too] to deal with problems of small samples and insufficient information. Inexact data, short sample and incomplete hydrological data in water research are very commonly encountered. Statistical, fuzzy set and rough set theories have been applied to deal with uncertainty problems in hydrology. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for grey relational degree and apply it to water environment quality evaluation of the Han Jiang River, one of the major branches of the Yangtze River in China. Our proposed method possesses some essential and desirable properties which ensure that translational properties of relational degree do not exist and it will give a more precise and finer grading of the overall water quality. Our empirical applications of GRM have demonstrated that GRM is a useful tool for analysis of inexact data, short sample and incomplete hydrological data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a new stakeholder-based framework is proposed for groundwater resources management in arid regions. In this framework, rough set theory is used for the probabilistic classification of stakeholders considering their powers and interests, which are obtained from stakeholder analysis. Then, a system dynamics model is developed to evaluate the physical, economic, environmental, and social conditions of the system corresponding to each defined water resources management scenario. Moreover, an evidential reasoning approach is used to estimate the resilience of scenarios based on seven generic resilience principles. Finally, based on the results of stakeholder analysis, system dynamics modeling, and resilience analysis, groundwater management scenarios are ranked using a proposed social choice procedure called Electoral College Voting. The results of applying the methodology to the Rafsanjan plain in Iran illustrate that a scenario that includes modern irrigation systems and water transfer is the socially optimal scenario in the study area. Implementing this scenario reduces water consumption by 40%, improves the resilience of groundwater by about 50% and helps the aquifer to be recovered.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB Periodicity and trend, modelled with emphasis on stochastic aspects using the Gibbs procedure in Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, are incorporated in multisite daily rainfall simulation. In particular, this gives realistic results for the timing of annual maximums within an annual cycle. A truncated Fourier series of two harmonics is used to model the deterministic part of the periodicity component. A reduced-parameter two-station model is extended for multisite simulation. Results show that depth-duration curves and characteristics such as cross-correlations are adequately represented. Projections are made, after applying the Gibbs procedure to sub-samples of 25 years, to form enveloping trend curves of possible future rainfalls. These are augmented by extending a trend line back in time previous to a historic record, using the relationship with a Longer series of rainfall data from a homogeneous zone. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The magnitude of sediment yield from headwater catchments is controlled by the interactions among hydrology, geomorphology, and soil disturbance. In montane regions like the Sierra Nevada, snow is one of the main factors controlling the timing and magnitude of hydrological fluxes. However, the role of snow on modulating spatial and temporal variation of sediment yield remains unclear. Using 120-site years of sediment yield data from 10 headwater catchments (drainage area 50-475 ha), we examined the sediment yield characteristics across an elevational gradient (1,777-2,381 m elevation) in the southern Sierra Nevada. Across space and time, we calculated an average annual suspended sediment yield of 62 +/- 147 Mg/km(2). In contrast, the measured mean annual bedload yield from the study catchments was small, 1.1 +/- 2.4 Mg/km(2). A linear mixed-effects model showed that maximum annual discharge alone can only explain 24 % (marginal R-2 = 0.24) of the variance in sediment yield. Similarly, the hypsometric integral, which is often used as a metric for erosion susceptibility, showed no predictive power (marginal R-2 = 0.005). As much as 65 % of the variance in sediment yield can be explained by fixed effects when snow related drivers (i.e., center of flow timing and aspect) were included in the model along with maximum annual discharge, suggesting a strong influence of snowmelt. Moreover, the relationship between area normalized suspended sediment yield (Q(s)) and unit discharge (Q) was significantly different between rain and snow events (p = 0.001). Both average slope (alpha) and exponent (beta) terms of the Q(s) = alpha Q beta relationship across the ten catchments were higher for rainfall (alpha = 5.8, beta = 1.84) than those for snowmelt (alpha = 3.1, beta = 1.77) events. As the erosion severity and power were higher during rainfall than the snowmelt events, a shift in the precipitation form from snow to rain under a warming climate will likely increase sediment yield. These results provide critical insights on background sediment yield in the southern Sierra Nevada and likely changes under future climate.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE pumping-induced leakage; scale-invariant measurements; total leakage
AB A new approach is presented for calculation of the volume of pumping-induced leakage entering an aquifer as a function of time. This approach simplifies the total leakage calculation by extending analytical-based methods developed for infinite systems to bounded aquifers of any size. The simplification is possible because of the relationship between drawdown and leakage in aquifers laterally bounded by impermeable formations. This relationship produces a scale-invariant total leakage; i.e., the volume of leakage as a function of time does not change with the size of the aquifer or with the location of the pumping well. Two examples and image well theory are used to demonstrate and prove, respectively, the generality of this interesting phenomenon.

AB Anthropogenic activity degrades stream water quality, especially in urban areas. Quantified connections between pollution sources, degree of water quality degradation, and the disproportionate impact of degradation on un-derserved communities are not yet fully explored. Here, the anthropogenic effects on water quality and the heterogeneous distribution of degraded streams were examined in the urban watershed of the Rouge River in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan. We used benthic macroinvertebrate data collected by volunteer scientists and aggregated into a Stream Quality Index (SQI) to define long-term water quality patterns. Spatial dependence of the data was assessed with spatial stream network models incorporating socio-economic and environmental predictors. The best model included poverty as an explanatory variable with a negative relationship with stream quality. SQI predictions under true watershed conditions revealed a 1% decrease in SQI with 1% increase in poverty. This work demonstrated the benefits of volunteer science and spatial modeling methods for urban stream modeling. Our finding of inequitably distributed water quality impairment in urban streams underscores the importance of focused restoration in economically oppressed urban areas.

ID FRAMEWORK; POLICY
AB The water-food-energy Nexus has emerged as a new perspective in debates concerned with balancing potentially conflicting sectoral imperatives of large scale development investments concerned with energy, water or food security. Current frameworks are partial as they largely represent a water centric perspective. Our hypothesis is that a dynamic Nexus framework that attempts to equally weight sectoral objectives provides a new paradigm for diagnosis and investigation. Dynamic refers here to explicitly understanding (or a diagnosis of) the dynamic relationships and ripple effects whereas static-comparative refers to a comparison of states before and after change. This paper proposes a balanced Nexus framework and presents results from an application to the Mekong basin. The analysis identified the advantages of a sectorally balanced, dynamic Nexus approach, in particular the ability to reveal either the emergence of cross-sectoral connections, or changes in those connections, as a consequence of single sector interventions.

AB The transformation of hydrologic processes from nonstationarity to stationarity with increasing scales is investigated. The fundamental mechanism of this transformation is the coarse-graining of hydrologic processes by aliasing and averaging operations. These operations are investigated by means of spectral relationships and hydrologic conservation equations. It is shown that hydrologic conservation equations at large scales may still be parsimonious due to the coarse-graining of hydrologic processes with increasing scales. When a larger scale process is formed by averaging a smaller scale process, the high frequency components of the smaller scale process are eliminated by the averaging operation, rendering the average hydrologic conservation equations to be quite simple in form. It is also shown that for the ensemble average form of a hydrologic conservation equation to be equivalent to its volume-average form, the parameter functions of that conservation equation at the immediately smaller scale must be ergodic.

AB Why water diplomacy? What does diplomacy have to do with water? Is cooperation over transboundary surface and ground waters the exclusive domain of diplomats and foreign policy experts? Or mainly the purview of water professionals negotiating agreements on shared water resources? Why should non-governmental stakeholders be involved in transboundary water dialogues? These questions lie at the heart of debates and dialogues around the theory and practice of water diplomacy.
   The main aim of this Special Issue is to elaborate the intersect of science, policy, and practice and discuss ways knowledge can be distributed more equally and bridged across these spheres. In this editorial article, we summarize key messages on water diplomacy brought forward by authors in this Special Issue. We have identified the trends below as a possible future direction on water diplomacy research as well as issues that need to be addressed in the policy debate. One of the overarching themes is how to ensure that available technical knowledge informs the political tracks of water diplomacy and how to build trust effectively to ensure sustainability of water cooperation processes.

AB Water security has become a priority for adaptive policy and measures taken in response to climate change around the world. This is an opportunity and a challenge for the Taiwan government to establish a climate-resilient water supply portfolio to ensure water security. This study incorporated the costs of water production, intermittency, and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the currently available water sources and how they will be affected by climate change, and applied optimal control theory to establish a cost-effective model to plan a long-term (2031) climate-resilient water supply portfolio for Taiwan. The study then uses the Penghu area as an empirical case study for this water supply portfolio. The results showed that desalination will become the major source of water, accounting for 71.81% of the water supply by 2031. However, this high proportion of desalination water will result in a significant increase in the unit cost of water production and the carbon footprint. Therefore, water demand management is also needed, and is recommended to ensure sustainable water resources in the Penghu area.

AB The current difficulties in determining the ecological flow of rivers in northern China are the poor pertinence of methods and insufficient consideration of ecological factors. On the basis of systematic analysis of river hydrological situations and ecological protection objectives, the existing water ecological problems in river reaches were identified, a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers was given based on Nature-based Solutions (NbS), considering the ecological integrity, biological diversity, morphological diversity and ecological service functions. With help of physical habitat simulation and the Penman-Monteith formula, indicator species were selected to research the natural process of restoring river function and realizing river runoff. To meet the water requirements of riparian vegetation during the growth period of the indicated species, the water demand law of typical vegetation changing with the growth time was studied, the upper and lower water levels were set, and the ecological water requirements of vegetation at each growth stage were determined. The results showed that the ecological basic flows required for the spawning period (April-June), the juvenile period (July-November) and the growth period (December-March) of Pseudorasbora parva in the Long River (typical section) were 3.14 m(3)/s, 4.32 m(3)/s and 2.16 m(3)/s, respectively. At the end of the spawning period, a 7-day (90% guarantee rate) pulse flow with a peak flow of 11.31 m(3)/s, a small flood process with a peak flow of 24.95 m(3)/s and a small flood process in the flood season lasting for 3 days provided effective external stimulation for the spawning of Pseudorasbora parva. The minimum annual ecological water requirement of reed was 15,100 m(3). The current ecological flow of the Long River can meet the water requirements of most aquatic organisms and plants in the river ecosystem. The ecological flow calculation method based on NbS is widely applicable, and the results are representative. The method can be used to calculate the ecological flow of small and medium-sized northern rivers with a small flow and low flow rate.

AB A method to estimate sequential average unsaturated zone travel time with high temporal resolution has been developed. The method is built upon the conventional cross-correlogram analysis, while the estimation errors are significantly reduced by the proposed schemes. In addition, an analytical relationship between the estimated travel time and the corresponding parameter of a physically-based water table (WT) fluctuation model has been newly established. For validation, applications were performed using WT and precipitation data from two locations with contrasting properties. The method was found to derive distinct characteristics in the estimated travel time, which reflect the unsaturated hydraulics by estimating large means and variations in travel times for low permeability unsaturated zones; whereas, the values are typically small for highly permeable unsaturated zones. The overall results suggest that the proposed method can be potentially adopted to complement other methods in the assessment of ground-water vulnerability to surface contaminants and the hydraulic characterizations of unsaturated zones.

AB The objective of this investigation was to estimate event soil loss per unit area from bare plots in central and southern Italy using an empirical model for sediment concentration. The analysis was developed using data collected on bare plots differing in length (11-44 m) and slope (10-26%) at three Italian stations (Masse, Umbria; Caratozzolo, Calabria; Sparacia, Sicily). At first, an analysis was carried out, using the experimental data collected at Sparacia, to establish a relationship between sediment concentration and hydrological variables, such as runoff, rainfall amount and single storm erosion index. Then, an empirical model to estimate plot soil loss as a function of rainfall amount, single storm erosion index, runoff amount, and slope length was developed. Finally, using the complete data set (Masse, Caratozzolo, Sparacia), the model was extended to include soil erodibility and slope steepness effects on plot soil loss. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB A partial covering mulch of residue on the soil strongly affects runoff dynamics, which consequently substantially reduces runoff amount. Experiments were conducted in la Tinaja (Mexico) on runoff plots (RPs) (20 m(2)) of four different treatments (bare, unplanted with 1.5 t ha(-1) of residue, planted with 1.5 and 4.5 t ha(-1) of residue), to characterize mulch effects. During one crop cycle, rainfall and runoff flow were recorded at a 20 s time step. Soil moisture, crop leaf area index, saturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity were also measured. Mulch increased the infiltration rate of the topsoil layer, concentrated overland flow and slowed it down by increasing roughness and pathway tortuosity. The physically based model developed accounts for these mulch effects on runoff. The model consists of a production and a transfer module. Each RP is considered as a micro-catchment drained by a single channel. The production module accounts for rain interception by the plant and the mulch, soil retention and infiltration. The excess rainfall that cannot infiltrate defines runoff and is concentrated in the channel. The transfer module governs runoff flow out of the RP according to Darcy-Weisbach's law. The model was calibrated on 12 events (five parameters). Fitted parameters provided high Nash efficiencies ranging from 0.721 to 0.828. Both runoff hydrographs and volumes were well simulated. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on eight parameters and a partial validation was done on 14 independent events. The model can be used as a predictive tool to assess the effect of various types of mulch on runoff. All its parameters are physical and can be measured or derived from literature. The model can also simulate inner variables of interest (water depth in the channel, infiltration in the channel and the hillslopes, etc.) at any time during rainfall. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Increasing availability of high-resolution (1 m) topography data and enhanced computational processing power present new opportunities to study landscape organization at a detail not possible before. Here we propose the use of "directed distance from the divide" as the scale parameter (instead of Horton's stream order or upstream contributing area) for performing detailed probabilistic analysis of landscapes over a broad range of scales. This scale parameter offers several advantages for applications in hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology in that it can be directly related to length-scale dependent processes, it can be applied seamlessly across the hillslope and fluvial regimes, and it is a continuous parameter allowing accurate statistical characterization (higher-order statistical moments) across scales. Application of this scaling formalism to three basins in California demonstrates the emergence of three distinct geomorphic regimes of divergent, highly convergent, and moderately convergent fluvial pathways, with notable differences in their scaling relationships and in the variability, or spatial heterogeneity, of topographic attributes in each regime. We show that topographic attributes, such as slopes and curvatures, conditional on directed distance from the divide exhibit less variability than those same attributes conditional on upstream contributing area, thus affording a sharper identification of regime transitions and increased accuracy in the scaling analysis.

AB Measurements of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation and drip stream water at drip site XY5 in Xiaoyan Cave in Guilin City were conducted to investigate the infiltration and vadose flow processes, and to characterize precipitation-discharge relationship in the overlying karst hillslope area. A marked seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes was observed in precipitation ranging from -18.7 parts per thousand to -0.6 parts per thousand, for delta O-18 and -139 parts per thousand to +5 parts per thousand for delta D, respectively during the study period from November 2013 to October 2014. However, the narrow range observed for cave drip stream water (delta D of -43 parts per thousand, to -22 parts per thousand, delta O-18 of -7.3 parts per thousand to -4.3%0 was attributed to homogenization via mixing of meteoric waters in the unsaturated zone above the cave. Although drip stream waters plot close to or slightly above the local meteoric water line, the weighted average delta O-18 value of precipitation is depleted than in dripwater, which is attributed to evaporation predominantly in the rainy season when cave air circulation is most active. The relationship between surface infiltration or leakage and cave discharge is connected by the distinct models of flow through the epikarst zone. Vadose flow showed high peaking hydraulic responses but buffered rain isotope responses with an attenuate magnitude of 5.0-9.4%0 for delta O-18. The sudden hydrochemical proxy variability was related closely to increase of discharge and the flushing out of old water with higher dissolved calcite. A threshold of flow generation expressed by precipitation amount must be exceeded to create a peak in discharge, as a function of excessing the field capacity of soil and residual capacity of epikarst zone. The sources of vadose seepage are soil and epikarst reservoir water with the attenuation of the isotopic fluctuations (-4.28 parts per thousand to -5.92 parts per thousand for delta O-18) and slight hydrological response, indicating mixed signals of infiltration water in epikarst storage reservoir. The total discharge volume of percolating water is 2084 L derived from piston flow due to the increased hydraulic head in the dry season, which provides a quantitative evidence of the potential adaptive capacity of the system to deal with the extreme droughts.

AB Annual, monthly and daily streamflows from 99 unregulated rivers across northern Australia were analysed to assess the general surface water resources of the region and their implications for development. The potential for carry-over storages was assessed using the Gould-Dincer Gamma method, which utilises the mean, standard deviation, skewness and tag-one serial correlation coefficient of annual flows. Runs Analysis was used to describe the characteristics of drought in northern Australia and the potential for 'active' water harvesting was evaluated by Base Flow Separation, Flow Duration Curves and Spells Analysis. These parameters for northern Australia were compared with data from southern Australia and data for similar Koppen class from around the world. Notably, the variability and seasonality of annual streamflow across northern Australia were observed to be high compared with that of similar Koppen classes from the rest of the world (RoW). The high inter-annual variability of runoff means that carry-over storages in northern Australia will need to be considerably larger than for rivers from the RoW (assuming similar mean annual runoff, yield and reliability). For example, in the three major Koppen zones across the North, it was possible (theoretically) to only exploit approximately 33% (Koppen Aw; n = 6), 25% (Koppen BSh; n = 12) and 13% (Koppen BWh; n = 11) of mean annual streamflow (assuming a hypothetical storage size equal to the mean annual flow). Over 90% of north Australian rivers had a Base Flow Index of less than 0.4, 72% had negative annual tag-one autocorrelation values and in half the rivers sampled greater than 80% of the total flow occurred during the 3-month peak period. These data confirm that flow in the rivers of northern Australia is largely event driven and that the north Australian environment has limited natural storage capacity. Hence, there is relatively little opportunity in many northern rivers to actively harvest water for on-farm storage, particularly under environmental flow rules that stipulate that water can only be extracted during the falling limb of a hydrograph. Streamflow drought severity, the product of drought length and magnitude, was found to be greater in northern Australia than in similar climatic regions of the RoW, due to higher inter-annual variability increasing the drought magnitude over the course of normal drought lengths. The high likelihood of severe drought means that agriculturalists seeking to irrigate from rivers in northern Australia should have especially well developed drought contingency plans.

AB Accurate inflow forecasting is very important for the operation of reservoirs. However, in the actual inflow forecasting, the differences between various parameters and external conditions will affect the forecast results of the model, so it is necessary to correct the forecast results. Most of the existing researches on the correction of forecast results focus on considering the model uncertainty as a whole, and there are few studies on the influence of different external factors on the forecast results. In view of this, the differences of external environment when the forecast occurs and the differences of forecast errors under different forecast scenarios are both considered in this paper. According to the differences in key influencing factors, such as rainfall conditions and foresight periods, the forecast scenarios are divided, and the forecast error distribution law under different scenarios is deduced based on the past forecast error data. On this basis, using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network Model, a new multi-dimensional and multi-attribute inflow forecast correction method considering forecast errors and forecast scenarios is established. This method breaks through the single-dimensional, single-attribute time series limitations of the traditional inflow forecast correction methods. Through the case study of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), it was found that compared with the actual situation, the average relative error of the inflow forecast was reduced from the actual 8.32% to 6.36%, a decrease of 1.96%, and the reduction rate reached 23.6%. In addition, other indexes such as mean absolute error, root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient have all been improved to varying degrees. It showed that the proposed method in this paper can simultaneously consider both the forecast error information of the previous periods and its corresponding forecast scenario information, and increase the effective information input of the correction model to improve the accuracy of the inflow forecast model.

AB Brinkman's model is one of the common mathematical formulations used in modeling fluid flow in karst aquifers. The Brinkman's model is a hybrid formulation that allows the use of a single transport equation to model fluid flow in both the free-flow and porous regions of a karst aquifer, by transitioning between the Stokes equation and the Darcy's law. However, the Brinkman's model is computationally expensive, requiring the solution of four different equations to obtain the pressures and velocities in a three-dimensional aquifer. Darcy's model provides a cheaper alternative, because it allows the substitution of the Darcy's equation into the mass conservation equation and thus requires the solution of only one parabolic equation. However, while the Darcy's model produces accurate results within the porous medium, it fails to provide satisfactory results in the free-flow regions of the karst aquifers. We propose a sector modeling approach to model fluid flow in karst aquifers. The sector modeling approach takes advantage of both the computational inexpensiveness of the Darcy's model and the accuracy of Brinkman's model in the caves. This method was compared to the Brinkman's model and the Darcy's model. Three examples are presented to study the effectiveness of the sector modeling technique. The first example is a simple model consisting of a straight conduit surrounded by porous regimes on either side while the second and third examples are more complicated structures consisting of complex geometrical caves embedded in a highly heterogeneous porous medium. Results show that the sector modeling approach provides an excellent match to the Brinkman's model and with much faster computations. Specifically, sector modeling was 4.6 times faster than the Brinkman's model in the first example, 13 times faster in the second; and 25 times faster in the third example. We also observed negligible deterioration in accuracy of results from sector modeling when the size of the extracted sector relative to the full-field is reduced.

AB Annual total suspended solid (TSS) loads in the Mae Sa Catchment in northern Thailand, determined with an automated, turbidity-based monitoring approach, were approximately 62,000, 33,000, and 14,000 Mg during the three years of observation. These loads were equivalent to basin yields of 839 (603-1170), 445 (217-462), and 192 (108-222) Mg km(-2) for the 74.16-km(2) catchment during 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The yearly uncertainty ranges indicate our loads may be underestimated by 38-43% or overestimated by 28-33%. In determining the annual loads, discharge (Q) and turbidity (T) values were compared against 333 hand-sampled total suspended solid concentrations (TSS) measured during 18 runoff events and other flow conditions across the three-year period. Annual rainfall varied from 1632 to 1934 mm; and catchment runoff coefficients (annual runoff/annual rainfall) ranged from 0.25 to 0.41. Measured TSS ranged from 8 to 15,900 mg l(-1); the low value was associated with dry-season base flow; the latter, a wet-season storm. Storm size and location played an important role in producing clockwise, anticlockwise, and complex hysteresis in the Q-TSS relationship. Turbidity alone was a good estimator for turbidity ranges of roughly 10-2800 NTU (or concentrations approximately 25-4000 mg l(-1)). However, owing to hysteresis and high sediment concentrations that surpass the detection limits of the turbidity sensor during many annual storms, TSS was estimated best using a complex multiple regression equation based on high/low ranges of turbidity and Q as independent variables. Turbidity was not a good predictor of TSS fractions >2000 mu m. Hysteresis in the monthly Q-TSS relationship was generally clockwise over the course of the monsoon season, but infrequent large dry-season storms disrupted the pattern in some years. The large decrease in annual loads during the study was believed to be related to depletion of fine sediment delivered to the stream by several landslides occurring the year prior to the study. The study indicated the importance of monitoring Q and turbidity at fine resolutions (e.g., sub-hourly) to capture the TSS dynamics and to make accurate load estimations in this flashy headwater stream where hysteresis in the Q-TSS signature varied at several time scales.

AB A novel methodology has been developed to quantify important salt water intrusion parameters in a sandbox experiment using image analysis. Existing methods found in the literature are based mainly on visual observations, which are subjective, labour intensive and limit the temporal and spatial resolutions that can be analysed. A robust error analysis was undertaken to determine the optimum methodology to convert image light intensity to concentration. Results showed that defining a relationship on a pixel-wise basis provided the most accurate image to concentration conversion and allowed quantification of the width of the mixing zone between salt water and freshwater. A high image sample rate was used to investigate the transient dynamics of salt water intrusion, which rendered analysis by visual observation unsuitable. This paper presents the methodologies developed to minimise human input, promote autonomy, provide high resolution image to concentration conversion, and allow the quantification of intrusion parameters under transient conditions.

AB In this work we compare the recently developed two-region mass transfer theory reported by Ahmadi et al. [A. Ahmadi, M. Quintard, S. Whitaker (1998), Transport in chemically and mechanically heterogeneous porous media, V, two-equation model for solute transport with adsorption, Adv. Water Resour. 1998;22:59-86] with experimental results reported by Zinn et al. [Zinn, B., L. C. Meigs, C. F. Harvey, R. Haggerty, W. J. Peplinski, C. F. Von Schwerin. Experimental visualization of solute transport and mass transfer processes in two-dimensional conductivity fields with connected regions of high conductivity. Environ Sci Technot 2004;38:3916-3926]. We find that the constant mass transfer coefficient predicted by the steady-state closure to the theory, when used with the macroscale transport equation, provides a reasonable prediction of the observed breakthrough curve. However, the use of a constant mass transfer coefficient does not allow good representation of the tailing that is observed in the data. We show that the mass transfer coefficient can be represented in terms of the eigenvalue expansion of a Green's function. For a steady solution to the closure problem, this expansion leads to the effective mass transfer coefficient being defined in terms of the harmonic average of the eigenvalues of the expansion; this is consistent with previous work on this topic. To further investigate the influence of using a single, constant value for the mass transfer coefficient, we examine the solution to the mass transfer problem in terms of a mixed model, where the eigenvalues of one region (the inclusions) are kept, while the second region (the matrix) is treated as a homogenized material. The results from this comparison indicate that the mass transfer coefficient predicted via volume averaging using a quasi-steady closure could potentially be improved upon by development of new methods that retain more of the eigenvalues of the system.

AB To simulate the impacts of within-storm rainfall variabilities on fast hydrological processes, long precipitation time series with high temporal resolution are required. Due to limited availability of observed data such time series are typically obtained from stochastic models. However, most existing rainfall models are limited in their ability to conserve rainfall event statistics which are relevant for hydrological processes. Poisson rectangular pulse models are widely applied to generate long time series of alternating precipitation events durations and mean intensities as well as interstorm period durations. Multiplicative microcanonical random cascade (MRC) models are used to disaggregate precipitation time series from coarse to fine temporal resolution.
   To overcome the inconsistencies between the temporal structure of the Poisson rectangular pulse model and the MRC model, we developed a new coupling approach by introducing two modifications to the MRC model. These modifications comprise (a) a modified cascade model ("constrained cascade") which preserves the event durations generated by the Poisson rectangular model by constraining the first and last interval of a precipitation event to contain precipitation and (b) continuous sigmoid functions of the multiplicative weights to consider the scale-dependency in the disaggregation of precipitation events of different durations.
   The constrained cascade model was evaluated in its ability to disaggregate observed precipitation events in comparison to existing MRC models. For that, we used a 20-year record of hourly precipitation at six stations across Germany. The constrained cascade model showed a pronounced better agreement with the observed data in terms of both the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series (e.g. the dry and wet spell durations and autocorrelations) and event characteristics (e.g. intra-event intermittency and intensity fluctuation within events). The constrained cascade model also slightly outperformed the other MRC models with respect to the intensity-frequency relationship.
   To assess the performance of the coupled Poisson rectangular pulse and constrained cascade model, precipitation events were stochastically generated by the Poisson rectangular pulse model and then disaggregated by the constrained cascade model. We found that the coupled model performs satisfactorily in terms of the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series, event characteristics and the intensity-frequency relationship.

ID GAME-THEORY; CONFLICT
AB Groundwater resource exploitations, as one of the most valuable water resources, cause conflicts among beneficiaries due to different priorities in decision-making processes. These conflicts lead beneficiaries to decide non-cooperatively. Consequently, it is essential to consider non-cooperative decision-making in order to manage groundwater resources properly. In this study, non-cooperative game theory was applied to groundwater resource management. This methodology was employed in Bad-Khaledabad study area located in the center of Iran. Also, quantity and quality simulation and optimization models were used to calculate the payoffs of beneficiaries including farmers and government. In order to understand beneficiaries' non-cooperative decision-making, three games were examined called cropping pattern shift, efficiency improvement, and linked game. The stable solution obtained for the linked game was the scenario where farmers choose to change their cropping patterns which will increase the farmers' profit by up to US$3,280,000, and government limits groundwater withdrawals to 66.5 MCM and pays for efficiency improvements which will raise the groundwater table 2m at the end of the fifth year.

AB This article considers stream flow discharge moving through channels subject to the lateral inflow and described by a linearized diffusion wave equation. The variability of lateral inflow is manifested by random fluctuations in time, which is the only source of uncertainty as to flow discharge quantification. The stochastic nature of stream flow discharge is described by the probability density function (PDF) obtained using the theory of distributions. The PDF of the stream flow discharge depends on the hydraulic properties of the stream flow, such as the wave celerity and hydraulic diffusivity as well as the temporal correlation scale of the lateral inflow rate fluctuations. The focus in this analysis is placed on the influence of the temporal correlation scale and the wave celerity coefficient on the PDF of the flow discharge. The analysis demonstrates that a larger temporal correlation scale causes an increase of PDF of the lateral inflow rate and, in turn, the PDF of the flow discharge which is also affected positively by the wave celerity coefficient.

AB Entropy theory has been increasingly applied in hydrology in both descriptive and inferential ways. However, little attention has been given to the small-sample condition widespread in hydrological practice, where either hydrological measurements are limited or are even nonexistent. Accordingly, entropy estimated under this condition may incur considerable bias. In this study, small-sample condition is considered and two innovative entropy estimators, the Chao-Shen (CS) estimator and the James-Stein-type shrinkage USS) estimator, are introduced. Simulation tests are conducted with common distributions in hydrology, that lead to the best-performing JSS estimator. Then, multi-scale moving entropy-based hydrological analyses (MM-EHA) are applied to indicate the changing patterns of uncertainty of stream flow data collected from the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, China. For further investigation into the intrinsic property of entropy applied in hydrological uncertainty analyses, correlations of entropy and other statistics at different time-scales are also calculated, which show connections between the concept of uncertainty and variability.

AB It is indispensable for the sustainable water supply of the human society to distribute the available water resources with maximal efficiency among the different consumers while assuring the needed time for recharge. The theoretically established, effective tool for the solution of this allocation problem is mathematical modelling with special regard to the methods of game theory.
   In the present paper, a differential game is proposed to describe the consumption and the (natural) recharge of a limited water resource. Then the general course of the solution of the allocation problem is given aiming at maximizing the players' yields through the discretization of the strategy sets. In case of two consumers, the solution is given in more details along with several practical examples. The Pareto optimality of the non-co-operative solution (Nash equilibrium) is checked and the Pareto optimal strategy pair, which provides maximal sum payoff for the players, is suggested for cooperation (after a possible re-distribution of the payoffs). This cooperative solution generally provides higher payoff for each player than if they consumed according to conflicting non-cooperative behaviour. In addition, examples with three consumers are provided similarly.

AB We conducted a field monitoring experiment examining throughfall in Japanese cypress plantations located in Tochigi Prefecture, eastern Japan. A set of 20 tipping-bucket rain gauges and throughfall collectors were placed in a lattice-like distribution throughout a 10 x 10-m experimental plot to investigate the effect of the forest canopy on the spatial variability of throughfall. The isotopic composition of throughfall and open rainfall were analyzed and compared for each rainfall event. A clear relationship between throughfall rate and the radial distance to the nearest tree trunk was observed when the influence of wind was negligible; however, such a systematic pattern of throughfall was not observed during rainfall events that occurred during windy conditions. The delta O-18 and delta D values in throughfall varied considerably, reflecting different rainwater flow paths in the saturated canopy. The analysis of stable isotope ratios in the throughfall and its comparison with isotopic composition of rainwater hitting the canopy can help elucidate the interception processes in the forest canopy.

AB In the context of flood management, this paper investigates the relationship between spatial rainfall and runoff production, based on 15 years of radar data, 16 raingauges and 12 flow stations from the 1400 km(2) Lee catchment, UK. Event-based, semi-distributed rainfall-runoff modelling is undertaken. Alternative rainfall, estimators (radar data and raingauge networks of various density) are considered and their effects on simulated runoff evaluated as a function of rainfall type, catchment type and catchment scale. An index of spatial variability is defined, based on the difference between the reference rainfall (defined by the full raingauge network) and alternative rainfall estimators. A modified Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion measures the performance of the simulated runoff with respect to reference simulated runoff. Results show a complex picture. The dominant effect is the spatial variability of the rainfall. No clear pattern emerges as a function of catchment scale, or response time, except that the impact of spatial variability is damped at the whole catchment scale. The sensitivity to spatial rainfall is enhanced on urbanised catchments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sap flow rate was continuously measured in six trees of Laurus azorica at the experimental site of laurel forest in Agua Garcia mountains, Tenerife, Canary Islands, over 1 year from June 1993 to May 1994. Sample trees were of different sizes and covered the whole range of species. A sigmoid-like relationship based on basal area was applied to scale up the transpiration data from sample trees to the whole stand. Maximum transpiration for the stand was 7 mm day(-1). There was strong competition among the medium-sized trees in the high-density stand. The annual course of transpiration was very variable, owing to weather conditions, and was mainly controlled by the evaporative conditions. Contrasting with conditions in colder regions of the world with pronounced seasons, relatively high transpiration persisted over the mild winter. The annual total of transpiration was thus significantly higher, amounting to 636 mm year(-1) (about 500 mm from April to October). Nevertheless, the transpiration represented only a small portion of stand water balance (65% of potential evaporation and 80% of annual precipitation in the open).

AB NE Italy presents high-quantity, high-quality and easily exploitable groundwater resources that are seriously threatened by anthropogenic pressures. This study analyzes the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of 2250 precipitation samples collected in 36 sites across the north-easternmost region of Italy, Friuli Venezia Giulia, between 1984 and 2015. This is an unprecedented dataset for North Italy with a high density of sampling sites and a decadal temporal extension. A series of both routine and original chemometric approaches were applied to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the isotopic composition through relationships with geographical and weather variables. New statistical approaches were presented to model the seasonal and spatial patterns of isotopic composition as well as to summarize the large amount of isotopic data. Significant gradients of delta O-18 and delta H-2 were detected in the area due to the peculiar orography and climate of the region; the amplitude of the monthly patterns also presented similar gradients. The deuterium excess did not present a clear seasonality, but higher values were found in autumn. The deuterium excess-to-delta O-18 ratio exhibited typical patterns throughout the region when grouping the sites for altitude and continentality; in winter, large differences of delta O-18 were detected among groups, but deuterium excess remained almost unchanged. The inter-site correlations were moderately high across all the territory even for deseasonalized data. The local meteoric water line (using all the single samples delta H-2 = 7.8.delta O-18 + 8.9) was also estimated at annual and seasonal basis, evidencing the presence of spatial gradients according to the orographic and weather characteristics of the region. Statistically significant increasing interannual trends (0.23-0.87 parts per thousand/y) were detected in 11 sites for deuterium excess; the presence of these trends was linked to local processes. Two multiple linear regression models were applied to reconstruct the isotopic composition of precipitation at a regional scale. The stepwise approach returned the best results with root mean square errors in the 0.5-1 parts per thousand, 3.5-8.2 parts per thousand and 0.9-1.5 parts per thousand intervals for delta O-18, delta H-2, and deuterium excess, respectively. The deuterium excess was not modelled in winter, where no relationships were found with geographic variables.

AB The utility of a particular tracer to perform hydrograph separations depends on the dominant watershed properties combined with meteorological patterns; therefore, drawing conclusions from one tracer can be misleading. Combining information from multiple tracers can reveal complimentary insights that advance our knowledge of runoff generating processes. We performed hydrograph separations during spring snowmelt and for one summer rain event at two seasonally arid, montane watersheds in southeastern Wyoming using two independent tracer systems: Stable water isotopes (O-18 and H-2; 1-4 h resolution) and specific conductance (SC; 15 min resolution). Event water dominated streamflow generation during snowmelt using both tracers, but much lower uncertainty in hydrograph separations were achieved during this period with SC than with stable isotope tracers; the stable isotopic composition of pre-event and event water were too similar which led to large degrees of uncertainty. Stable isotopes of stream water did not vary as much as SC throughout the year and indicated the dominance of stream water derived from snowmelt. During the main snowmelt period, high frequency stream water isotopic composition was remarkably consistent, despite considerable variability measured in snowpack and snowmelt samples. Stable isotope measurements were useful for partitioning streamflow during a summer rain event when source waters were more isotopically distinct and suggested the dominance of pre-event water at generating streamflow. Despite the inability to partition event and pre-event streamflow during snowmelt, relationships between isotopic composition, SC, and watershed properties helped to understand mechanisms for streamflow generation. For instance, line conditioned excess (lc-excess) on the rising limb of the main snowmelt period was significantly positively correlated to the amount of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions, the fastest moving compartment of event flow, supporting evidence that freshly melted snow, with relatively higher lc-excess, preferentially contributed to rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions. During fall low flow stream conditions, the isotopic value of streamflow was significantly positively correlated to elevation, where the highest-elevation watersheds had the highest delta values. This relationship was contradictory to what was expected (i.e. "elevation effect") and may be explained by extensive snowpack fractionation occurring later in the season in deeper snowpacks located at higher elevations, or by a larger amount rainfall, with enriched isotopic composition relative to snowmelt, occurring at higher elevations. Through synthesizing patterns in two different natural tracers in conjunction with watershed properties, insights into the dominant controls on streamflow generation were gained from seasonally arid, snowmelt-dominated, headwater watersheds.

AB The relationship between concentration c and discharge Q in a stream is one of the aspects of hydrochemical catchment response that has been used widely as a diagnostic. In particular, loops in the c-e curve, commonly referred to as hysteresis loops, are used to infer particular mixing patterns. At the South Fork of Brokenback Run (SFBR) in the Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, we have evidence that stream dynamics reflect a system composed of an ephemeral subsurface stormflow zone perched above a perennial water table. The relationship between dissolved silica and stream discharge exhibits hysteresis in the clockwise (CW) direction. Modelling this relationship in the context of three-component mixing with constant-concentration end members failed to reproduce the observed c-e pattern. In this paper we examine the possibility that temporal variation in soil-water concentrations of silica can explain how CW hysteresis loops in the c-e curve can arise. In particular, we examine the role of the ratio of a hydrological time scale to a chemical time scale in determining the nature of hysteresis loops. The CW loops that we observe in SFBR can be explained by time variability in soil-water concentrations only if the chemical (leaching) time constant is less than (or only slightly greater than) the hydrological time constant. The near equality of these time constants is consistent with reports from hydrological measurements and leaching experiments. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The transfer function for an input-output aquifer system has often been used for regional groundwater studies as it allows the simulation of the system response to any varying input at any time resolution. The existing transfer function models available in the literature are limited to dealing with the temporal stationary random input and output flow fields. The stochastic nature of temporal nonstationary inflow-outflow processes is ignored. The present research is therefore devoted to generalizing the previous result by considering the effect of nonstationary inflow-outflow processes of the unconfined aquifer system. It is shown that a closed-form expression for the transfer function can be obtained using the Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach and the representation theorem. The effects of the controlling parameters in the models on the transfer function are analyzed. An application of the present stochastic theory to the prediction of the outflow discharge is demonstrated. The proposed transfer function model should have potential for the analysis of the influence of climate fluctuations on the variation of the aquifer discharge.

AB Rainfall is considered the hardest weather variable to forecast, and its cause-effect relationships often cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms. This study introduces a novel hybrid model to month ahead forecasting monthly rainfall amounts which is motivated to be used in semi-arid basins. The new approach, called MPSA-MGGP, is based on integrating multi-period simulated annealing (MPSA) optimizer with multigene genetic programming (MGGP) symbolic regression so that the hybrid model reflects the periodic patterns in rainfall time series into a Pareto-optimal multigene forecasting equation. The model was trained and verified using observed rainfall at two meteorology stations located in north-west of Iran. The model accuracy was also cross-validated against two benchmarks: conventional genetic programming (GP) and MGGP. The results indicated that the proposed gene-annealing model provides slight to moderate decline in absolute error as well as noteworthy augment in Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. Promising efficiency together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice, particularly in semiarid regions.

AB The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), defined an aridity index (AI) by the ratio of the annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) totals. In this work, specific humidity was used instead of PET and a new aridity index (I-q) has been defined using the ratio of annual precipitation totals and annual mean specific humidity (S-h). As shown in this study, S-h can be easily computed with very high accuracy (3.569% error rate) with mean temperature, relative humidity and local pressure which are most commonly and widely measured meteorological data. The single point correlation graph of S-h which shows the entrance of aridity through the South Eastern Anatolia Region into Turkey and the distribution of the aridity over Turkey explains the relationship with S-h and aridity. According to the common and different aspects of arid zones found with AI, I-q and Erinc aridity index (I-m), I-q found to be applicable for monitoring climate change and distribution of arid zones.

AB Regional maps and equations for the magnitude and frequency of 1, 7 and 30-day low flows were derived and are presented in this paper. The river gauging stations of neighbouring catchments that produced similar low flow frequency curves were grouped together. As such, the Peninsular Malaysia was divided into seven low flow regions. Regional equations were developed using the multivariate regression technique. An empirical relationship was developed for mean annual minimum flow as a function of catchment area, mean annual rainfall and mean annual evaporation. The regional equations exhibited good coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.90). Three low flow frequency curves showing the low, mean and high limits for each region were proposed based on a graphical best-fit technique. Knowing the catchment area, mean annual rainfall and evaporation in the region, design low flows of different durations can be easily estimated for the ungauged catchments. This procedure is expected to overcome the problem of data unavailability in estimating low flows in the Peninsular Malaysia. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chongming Dongtan, located in the center of the Yangtze estuary, is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance and National Nature Reserve. The dramatic decrease in river sediment load has attracted considerable scientific interest to this area, but few studies have paid attention to the shoreline dynamics. This study uses Landsat images spanning from 1987 to 2010 and an orthogonal transect method, which was previously developed by the authors, to model the spatial and temporal characteristics of shoreline change and explore its relationship to reduced river sediment load by use of regression analysis on three different spatial scales. Results show a general decrease in the average rates of shoreline change throughout the entire study period. The maximum average shoreline change rate of +115.5 m/year occurred in the 1987-1990 interval and the minimum rate of +20.4 m/year occurred from 2006 to 2008. Based on average rates of shoreline change, the coast of Dongtan was divided into three segments: the erosion segment, eastern accretion segment, and northern accretion segment. The temporal pattern of the northern accretion segment is almost completely opposite to that of the eastern accretion segment. The strongest-correlation transects are located on the northern side of the eastern tip of Dongtan and the next strongest transects are located on the south side. Other transects have a very low correlation. Transect 19 near the easternmost tip of Dongtan has a near zero correlation (r(2) = 0.0045) but has the fastest accretion rate, and in general an increase in the shoreline change rate. The average rate of shoreline change and the net accretion area in Dongtan as a whole are significantly associated with sediment discharge at Datong Station (r(2) = 0.69 and 0.75, respectively). This implies that shoreline accretion in Dongtan will probably slow down gradually, if the river sediment load continues to decrease in the future. The shoreline change rates achieved using our approach are consistent with previous studies, but the relationship with the river sediment load is different from results in a previous study on intertidal wetland based on bathymetric maps. The results and methods may be helpful in coastal management and understanding the evolution of the entire delta from the perspective of shoreline change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presented study explores the prediction of soil water retention and its variability from soil texture and bulk density measurements, using a physically-based scaling technique. Specifically, the Arya-Paris (AP) physico-empirical model is applied to two soil datasets that are collected from two catchments located in different areas of Southern Italy. Laboratory-measured soil water retention functions are scaled to characterize soil variability. The laboratory-measured and AP-predicted reference water retention functions are compared by evaluating the lognormal distribution of derived scaling factors, relative to the mean reference retention function. Since the scaling theory assumes geometric similitude for the investigated soils, successful application of using particle-size distribution to estimate soil water retention requires separation of soils with different textures, using variance analysis. We conclude that variability in soil water retention can be determined from limited soil water retention data using the scaling approach when combined with particle-size distribution measurements. This method can potentially be used as an effective tool for identifying soil hydrologic response at catchment scales. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recognising the utility of grass buffer strips in sediment retention, a fundamental hydraulic interpretation of flow through such strips is sought. In order to ensure reproducibility of results, a model porous resistive element consisting of beds of nails of various densities was used to simulate the hydraulic resistance offered by grass strips. In 14 experiments, the hydraulic consequences were measured for steady flow in a flume through nail beds of various densities at various flume slopes. A newly devised staining technique was used to measure the spatial variation in water depth to and through the resistive element. Provided nail density was not too low or slope too high, the maximum depth of water occurred as flow entered the nail bed. In such cases. momentum theory was able to provide a reasonably good prediction, both of the shape of the water profile within the nail bed. and of the slope and extent of the region of hydraulic adjustment formed upslope of the resistive element.

AB Suction in subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction of the pavement. The equilibrium suction has a direct influence on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil. In the current mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide, equilibrium suction is determined based on the empirical relationship with water table depth. However studies have shown that other critical factors also influence equilibrium suction. In this study, a new mechanistic-empirical model is presented to predict equilibrium suction considering the effects of physical properties of the soil and climatic factors. A simple regression model is also generated to predict the equilibrium suction from readily available parameters i.e., Thornthwaite moisture index (TMI), plasticity index (P1), and dry suction value at surface (u(dry)). In the final section of this paper, the effects of TMI and vegetation on equilibrium suction are evaluated for various soil classes and TMI ranges, respectively. A contour map of the equilibrium suction values for the entire continental United States has been generated using the geographic information system (GIS) platform and followed by the model predictions.

AB Empirical relationships coupled with the field measurements were used to assess water discharge and sediment load from an anthropogenically-altered drainage basin into Sepetiba Bay in southeastern Brazil. Discharge into Sepetiba Bay is modified by large-scale water diversion from the Paraiba do Sul River, which is one of the more important and impacted rivers in Brazil. The discharge into Sepetiba Bay has increased threefold, from 41 to 129 m(3)/s on average, since the water redistribution began. Sediment budget calculations indicate retention of a large fraction of the sediment load by five reservoirs within the drainage system but with highly variable infilling rates. As a consequence the water diversion scheme has lead to a 28% increase in sediment delivery to Sepetiba Bay or 270 x 10(3) t/yr. The Paraiba do Sul River contributes most of the freshwater input into Sepetiba Bay, whereas the sediment load to the bay is mainly contributed by the local drainage basins. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Previous measurements of water loss from small-dish evaporimeters mounted at the height of irrigated crops grown under conditions of extreme local advection in the Sudan are reexamined. From these evaporimeter measurements, it is possible to calculate fractional changes in the saturation deficit. Relationships between canopy conductance and saturation deficit are briefly reviewed and introduced into the Penman-Monteith equation to calculate transpiration rates as a function of distance downwind of the boundary between the upwind desert and the irrigated crop. In contradiction to most theoretical predictions, these new calculations show rates of transpiration to undergo only modest changes with increasing fetch. This occurs because of the feedback interaction between saturation deficit and stomatal conductance. This result is in good accord with a recent study suggesting that a dry-moist boundary transition may be best modelled as a simple step change in surface fluxes and further that the advective enhancement of evaporation may have been overestimated by many advection models. Larger effects are expected on dry matter yields because of the direct influence of saturation deficit on the yield-transpiration ratio.

AB Nitrate (NO3-) excess in rivers harms aquatic ecosystems and can induce detrimental algae growths in coastal areas. Riverine NO3- uptake is a crucial element of the catchment-scale nitrogen balance and can be measured at small spatiotemporal scales, while at the scale of entire river networks, uptake measurements are rarely available. Concurrent, low-frequency NO3- concentration and stream-flow (Q) observations at a basin outlet, however, are commonly monitored and can be analyzed in terms of concentration discharge (C-Q) relationships. Previous studies suggest that steeper positive log (C)-log (Q)slopes under low flow conditions (than under high flows) are linked to biological NO3- uptake, creating a bent rather than linear log (C)-log (Q) relationship. Here we explore if networkscale NO3- uptake creates bent log (C )-log (Q) relationships and when in turn uptake can be quantified from observed low-frequency C-Q data. To this end we apply a parsimonious mass-balance-based river network uptake model in 13 mesoscale German catchments (21-1450 km(2)) and explore the linkages between log (C)-log (Q) bending and different model parameter combinations. The modeling results show that uptake and transport in the river network can create bent log (C)-log (Q) relationships at the basin outlet from log- log linear C-Q relationships describing the NO3- land-tostream transfer. We find that within the chosen parameter range the bending is mainly shaped by geomorphological parameters that control the channel reactive surface area rather than by the biological uptake velocity itself. Further we show that in this exploratory modeling environment, bending is positively correlated to percentage of NO3- load removed in the network (L-r.perc) but that network-wide flow velocities should be taken into account when interpreting log (C)-log (Q) bending. Classification trees, finally, can successfully predict classes of low (similar to 4 %), intermediate (similar to 32 %) and high (similar to 68 %) L-r.perc using information on water velocity and log (C)-log (Q) bending. These results can help to identify stream networks that efficiently attenuate NO3- loads based on low-frequency NO3- and Q observations and generally show the importance of the channel geomorphology on the emerging log (C)-log (Q) bending at network scales.

AB This study presents an unconditional approximate spectral method (ASM) to delineate well capture zones in nonstationary groundwater systems. Taking advantages of spectral theories in solving unmodeled small-scale variability in hydraulic conductivity (K), the proposed spectral method can efficiently estimate flow uncertainties. Such velocity uncertainties associated with the concept of particle tracking can delineate well capture zones for groundwater systems with practical complexities and scales. In this study the developed ASM is assessed to quantify the accuracy of delineated well capture zones under a variety of conditions, including bounded flow domains, flow systems with multiple wells, multiple hydraulic conductivity scales, and nonstationary flows caused by complex sources and sinks in the modeling areas. The ASM solutions are systematically compared with the corresponding numerical solutions of nonstationary spectral method (NSM) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Simulation results reveal that the proposed ASM is computationally efficient and the solutions of velocity variances agree well with the corresponding numerical solutions of NSM and MCS. Based on the simple and efficient approximations, the developed ASM can delineate accurately the mean and variance dynamics of capture zones in complex large-scale groundwater flow systems.

AB The risk of urban inundation has been increasing worldwide. The integrated green-gray-blue (IGGB) drainage system is considered to have great potential in urban areas, as it has not only the resilience and sustainability of green and blue infrastructure, but also the reliability of gray infrastructure on stormwater drainage. This study aims to identify whether there is synergistic effect in IGGB drainage system and how to optimize it. An automatic optimization tool is needed for scenario generation and optimal decision-making because of the diversity, complicacy and decentrality of IGGB drainage system. So far, existing optimization frameworks focus on green infrastructure which cannot be applied to explore synergistic effect of IGGB drainage system. This paper proposed an integrated framework to combine hydrological model and optimization algorithm. Based on this framework, seven optimization strategies including green, gray, blue, green-gray, green-blue, gray-blue and green-gray-blue, were established with the optimization objectives of flood risk reduction rate (FRRR), life cycle cost (LCC) and land occupied (LO). A case study was conducted in Dongying, Shandong province, China. Based on the Pareto fronts of the seven optimization strategies, the average FRRRs of green, gray, blue, green-gray, green-blue, gray-blue and green-gray-blue strategy under the 24-hour rainfall with 30-year return period are 56.0%, 7.7%, 14.5%, 66.1%, 78.3%, 18.4% and 85.5% respectively. The green-gray-blue strategy shows the best performance. Then the existence of synergistic effect in IGGB drainage system is confirmed. The synergistic effect of green-gray, green-blue and green-gray-blue optimization strategies was 5.7%, 9.7% and 10.6%, respectively. However, synergistic effect was not generated in the gray-blue optimization strategy in this study. The synergistic effect is influenced by the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility. The results provide more evidence for the outstanding performance of the green-gray-blue integrated urban drainage system and provide technical support and greater clarity to decision-makers on how to integrate the green, gray and blue infrastructure.

AB The successful management of groundwater dependent shallow seasonal wetlands requires a sound understanding of groundwater fluxes. However, such fluxes are hard to quantify. Water volume and solute mass balance models can be used in order to derive an estimate of groundwater fluxes within such systems. This approach is particularly attractive, as it can be undertaken using measurable environmental variables, such as; rainfall, evaporation, pond level and salinity. Groundwater fluxes estimated from such an approach are subject to uncertainty in the measured variables as well as in the process representation and in parameters within the model. However, the shallow nature of seasonal wetland ponds means water volume and surface area can change rapidly and non-linearly with depth, requiring an accurate representation of the wetland pond bathymetry. Unfortunately, detailed bathymetry is rarely available and simplifying assumptions regarding the bathymetry have to be made. However, the implications of these assumptions are typically not quantified. We systematically quantify the uncertainty implications for eight different representations of wetland bathymetry for a shallow seasonal wetland pond in South Australia. The predictive uncertainty estimation methods provided in the Model-Independent Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis software (PEST) are used to quantify the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on the modelled fluxes. We demonstrate that bathymetry can be successfully represented within the model in a simple parametric form using a cubic Sexier curve, allowing an assessment of bathymetric uncertainty due to measurement error and survey detail on the derived groundwater fluxes compared with the fixed bathymetry models. Findings show that different bathymetry conceptualisations can result in very different mass balance components and hence process conceptualisations, despite equally good fits to observed data, potentially leading to poor management decisions for the wetlands. Model predictive uncertainty increases with the crudity of the bathymetry representation, however, approximations that capture the general shape of the wetland pond such as a power law or Bezier curve show only a small increase in prediction uncertainty compared to the full dGPS surveyed bathymetry, implying these may be sufficient for most modelling purposes.

AB Scaling approaches are widely used by hydrologists for Regional Frequency Analysis (RFA) of floods at ungauged/sparsely gauged site(s) in river basins. This paper proposes a Recursive Multi-scaling (RMS) approach to RFA that overcomes limitations of conventional simple- and multi-scaling approaches. The approach involves identification of a separate set of attributes corresponding to each of the sites (being considered in the study area/region) in a recursive manner according to their importance, and utilizing those attributes to construct effective regional regression relationships to estimate statistical raw moments (SMs) of peak flows. The SMs are then utilized to arrive at parameters of flood frequency distribution and quantile estimate(s) corresponding to target return period(s). Effectiveness of the RMS approach in arriving at flood quantile estimates for ungauged sites is demonstrated through leave-one-out cross-validation experiment on watersheds in Indiana State, USA. Results indicate that the approach outperforms index-flood based Region-of-Influence approach, simple- and multi-scaling approaches and a multiple linear regression method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solute transport in aggregated soils is controlled by pores both inside and between the aggregates. Because the intra-aggregate pores are much smaller than the inter-aggregate pores, in chemical transport modelling the water in the former was often assumed to be immobile in comparison with water in the latter. How to describe mass transfer between the two waters has been studied intensively for saturated soils but poorly for unsaturated soils. In this paper, we investigated this using pore-scale modelling and tomography. The binary structures of porous materials acquired using tomography in our previous work served as the aggregated soils. Since the sizes of the intra-aggregate pores were smaller than the resolution of the tomography, they cannot be explicitly resolved in the tomography. As a result, the solids in the binary structures were porous aggregates and their impact on solute movement was described by an effective diffusion coefficient. In all simulations, the aggregates were assumed to be fully saturated and water distribution between the aggregates was determined by inter-aggregate pore sizes and pore connectedness. Solute movement from water within the inter-aggregates into the aggregates under different saturations was simulated using a pore-scale model. The simulated concentration and flux at pore scale were spatially averaged, and they were then used to calculate the volumetric average mass transfer rate between the two waters. The calculated average mass transfer rates were linked to the memory function widely used in the literature to model solute transport in structured soils. The results indicate that the commonly-used linear mobile-immobile transfer model with its transfer rate coefficient proportional to water content cannot fit the memory function calculated at any saturation. We fitted the simulated results to an empirical formula. The comparisons reveal that in the earlier stage, the memory function decreases with time in a power-law, and in the later stage it decreases exponentially. The time it takes such a transition to complete increases as the saturation decreases. We also explained and proved how to extend these results to simulate reactive solutes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB A central issue in the successful application of acoustic wave method to detect subsurface hydrological properties is a better understanding of the influence of soil texture on the propagation and attenuation of acoustic wave as moisture content is varied, which was numerically investigated in the present study. Our earlier studies have demonstrated the existence of three different modes of acoustic wave in an elastic porous medium containing two immiscible, viscous, compressible fluids. Based on the dispersion equation obtained in the Lo-Sposito-Majer (LSM) model, the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the P1 and P2 waves which respectively propagate the fastest and second,fastest were determined as a function of water saturation for 11 soil texture classes. The slowest wave (133) was not characterized in this study since it does not travel far, due to very high attenuation. To provide a more general result, the calculated phase velocity and attenuation coefficient for different soil textures were normalized by those computed for sand. The normalization leads the resulting dimensionless parameters to be frequency independent throughout the whole range (up to 500 Hz) with Darcy's law remaining valid for the description of each fluid flow under wave excitation. The normalized phase velocity of the P1 wave was shown to have a substantially constant value at higher water saturations, but in the tower saturation range it first increases to reach a certain maximum value for different soil types and then decreases. The physical. parameter controlling this phenomenon is the ratio of two effective non-wetting fluid storativity factors. Numerical results reveal. that the normalized attenuation coefficient of the P1 wave is sensitive to soil texture and water saturation. Sand and loamy sand have the highest and second highest attenuation coefficients for the P1 wave, respectively. The magnitude of the normalized phase velocity of the P2 wave is found to be, with very few exceptions at nearly full saturations, linearly associated with the intrinsic permeability, white relating to the normalized attenuation coefficient of the P2 wave in an opposite manner. These results provide a quantitative clue for acoustic wave method to explore the physical properties in the shallow subsurface. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions require soil moisture (SM) estimates at fine-resolutions. Soil moisture estimates of current satellite missions are normally at coarse spatial resolutions, such as 25-36 km for Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SM data. Many spatial downscaling approaches have been developed to get finer resolution SM. Apparent thermal inertia (ATI), as a reliable approximation of thermal inertia (TI) that could be derived from daily fine-resolution optical/thermal remote sensing (RS) data, has been testified to be highly related to SM. However, the empirical relationship between ATI and SM varies with vegetation cover density. The main purpose of this study is to develop an ATI-based SM downscaling method that is free of vegetation cover effects. The study was conducted in Naqu areas in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) in southwest China, where spatially intensive in-situ SM measurements were routinely obtained. European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture combined product (version 4.2) was used for this study. The fine-resolution (1 km) ATI data were derived from the Collection 6 MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. A modified quantile-quantile (Q-Q) adjustment method was applied to correct the bias of the CCI SM data before downscaling. A non-linear regression model between bias -corrected CCI SM and fine resolution ATI was built to disaggregate the bias-corrected SM to spatial resolution of 1 km. In this model, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was introduced to globally and quantitatively adjust the vegetation effect in the relationship between SM and ATI. The bias-corrected CCI SM and the downscaled 1 km resolution SM were evaluated using the in-situ SM measurements obtained from the Multi-scale Soil Moisture and Temperature Monitoring Network on the central TP (CTP-SMTMN) in the study area. The results indicate that the proposed modified Q-Q adjustment method effectively reduced the bias of the original CCI SM data (bias = 0 m(3)/m(3)). The downscaled 1 km resolution SM shows fine scale spatial variability of soil moisture and preserves the accuracy (R = 0.552) and temporal variability of the bias-corrected CCI SM. The accuracies of the downscaled SM over areas with different vegetation cover show quite good consistency. The uncertainties of the proposed SM spatial downscaling method were comprehensively analyzed. The proposed ATI-based SM downscaling algo-rithm is applicable to generating representative and consistent high spatial resolution SM over areas with different vegetation cover density.

AB Streamflow forecasting has always been a challenging task for water resources engineers and managers and a major component of water resources system control. In this study, we explore the applicability of a Self Organizing Radial Basis (SORB) function to one-step ahead forecasting of daily streamflow. SORB uses a Gaussian Radial Basis Function architecture in conjunction with the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) used in data classification. SORB outperforms the two other ANN algorithms, the well known Multi-layer Feedforward Network (MFN) and Self-Organizing Linear Output map (SOLO) neural network for simulation of daily streamflow in the semi-arid Salt River basin. The applicability of the linear regression model was also investigated and concluded that the regression model is not reliable for this study. To generalize the model and derive a robust parameter set, cross-validation is applied and its outcome is compared with the split sample test. Cross-validation justifies the validity of the nonlinear relationship set up between input and output data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION
AB Continuous rainfall-runoff modeling is essential to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship in water resource projects. The performance of a rainfall-runoff model heavily depends on suitable choice of model parameters, which are normally calibrated by using an objective function. This study presents a fuzzy multi-objective function (FMOF) to improve the performance of conventional objective functions, such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percent error (MPE), Daily rainfall and flow discharge measurements, as well as monthly evaporation estimates are used to calibrate and verify a rainfall-runoff model, over a 9-year and a 4-year period, respectively. The model calibrated with RMSE and MPE as objective functions tends to match high and low flow periods, respectively. The FMOF leads to improved simulation of a wide range of flow stages as it can combine various objective functions with different acceptable levels. The method suggested herein is shown to be more appropriate for basins with extremely heterogeneous temporal flow distribution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID REGIONAL-CLIMATE MODEL; PATTERNS
AB The daily precipitation of Bern, Neuchatel and Payerne in Switzerland is statistically linked to atmospheric circulation and temperature. For ail three stations, there is a marked increase of the mean precipitation amount with increasing temperature for wet days with temperatures between -5 and 20 degrees C. The amount of precipitation is also controlled by the direction and strength of the atmospheric flow. To lake these dependencies into account, the daily precipitation amounts are modelled as a function of temperature and strength of the flow for three categories of flow direction. Both parametric and nonparametric techniques from the statistical literature on generalized linear models are applied, The nonparametric technique is a helpful tool for the selection and evaluation of parametric models. The non-linear effects of temperature and strength of the flow on the amount of precipitation are described by natural cubic splines and piecewise linear functions. The use of the modelled relationships for climate-change scenario production is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Potential evaporation from a wet bare soil field was measured with a large sensitive weighing lysimeter on a 20 min time step for 5 days at Davis, California. The diurnal evaporation rate modeled with the Penman-Brutsaert model for potential evaporation with atmospheric stability corrections resulted in the best description of the measured fluxes. The Priestley-Taylor model was accurate for short intervals except when conditions of minimal advection were exceeded during the day. It was noted that the Priestley-Taylor formulation with alpha = 1.26 performs best under unstable atmospheric conditions. During stable conditions, the value of alpha = 1.26 underpredicts the measured potential evaporation. The advection-aridity model for actual evaporation based on the Bouchet complementary relationship was studied. Strong advection explains the tendency found in other experimental studies to underpredict daily potential evaporation. A methodology to account for the excess advection is discussed in the complementary model, and the flux predictions were equivalent to the Penman-Brutsaert formulation for wet surfaces.

AB We analyze scale-dependent statistics of correlated random hydrogeological variables and their extremes using neutron porosity data from six deep boreholes, in three diverse depositional environments, as example. We show that key statistics of porosity increments behave and scale in manners typical of many earth and environmental (as well as other) variables. These scaling behaviors include a tendency of increments to have symmetric, non-Gaussian frequency distributions characterized by heavy tails that decay with separation distance or lag; power-law scaling of sample structure functions (statistical moments of absolute increments) in midranges of lags; linear relationships between log structure functions of successive orders at all lags, known as extended self-similarity or ESS; and nonlinear scaling of structure function power-law exponents with function order, a phenomenon commonly attributed in the literature to multifractals. Elsewhere we proposed, explored and demonstrated a new method of geostatistical inference that captures all of these phenomena within a unified theoretical framework. The framework views data as samples from random fields constituting scale mixtures of truncated (monofractal) fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). Important questions not addressed in previous studies concern the distribution and statistical scaling of extreme incremental values. Of special interest in hydrology (and many other areas) are statistics of absolute increments exceeding given thresholds, known as peaks over threshold or POTs. In this paper we explore the statistical scaling of data and, for the first time, corresponding POTs associated with samples from scale mixtures of tfBm or tfGn. We demonstrate that porosity data we analyze possess properties of such samples and thus follow the theory we proposed. The porosity data are of additional value in revealing a remarkable cross-over from one scaling regime to another at certain lags. The phenomena we uncover are of key importance for the analysis of fluid flow and solute as well as particulate transport in complex hydrogeologic environments.

AB Steady-state theories have been developed for flow into an auger hole in a homogeneous and anisotropic soil medium when (i) there is an impermeable layer at the bottom of the auger hole and (ii) there is an impermeable barrier at a finite distance below the bottom of the auger hole. The proposed theories can be modified easily for an isotropic Soil condition and the partially penetrating auger hole theory presented here is simpler than the existing theories (Kirkham, 1958; Boast and Kirkham, 1971) for the same soil condition. Furthermore, the theories can be applied directly, i.e. without transformation of coordinate axes, to determine the directional conductivities of an anisotropic medium (and hence also the hydraulic conductivity of an isotropic medium since ah anisotropic medium can be transformed into an isotropic one simply by treating the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the medium as equal to its vertical hydraulic conductivity) from auger hole experimental data below a water table.

ID AGE
AB Georgius Agricola's 1546 book De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum (On the Source and Causes of What is Underground) was the first European work since antiquity to focus on hydrology and helped to shape the thought of Nicolaus Steno, Pierre Perrault, A.G. Werner, and other important figures in the history of hydrology and geology. De Ortu contains the first known expressions of numerous concepts important in modern hydrology: erosion as an active process, groundwater movement through pores and fissures, hydrofracturing, water-rock reaction, and others. The concepts of groundwater origins, movement, and nature in De Ortu were also the foundation for the theories of ore deposit formation for which Agricola is better known. In spite of their importance, most of Agricola's contributions to the study of groundwater are unrecognized today because De Ortu, alone of his major works, has never been translated out of Latin and no existing vernacular summary of it is longer than two pages. This article presents the first detailed description of Agricola's work on hydrology and discusses the derivation and impact of his ideas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Insights into seismic precursors have been obtained in the last decades. However, a detailed understanding of hydrogeochemical anomalies prior to earthquakes still remains the aim of many research teams worldwide. In order to investigate the earthquake-groundwater relationship, between 2018 and 2020, we performed sampling surveys coupled with continuous multiparametric monitoring in Grassano spring fed by the Matese aquifer (central-southern Apennines, Italy). Hydrogeochemical changes were observed before the onset and during the 2019 Benevento seismic sequence, including dissolved CO2 increase, pH lowering, and anomalies in major ions (i.e., Ca2+, Na+, HCO3-) that later recovered to their typical concentrations. We suggest that variations in groundwater geochemistry were induced by dilatative preparatory phases of earthquakes, typical of the extensional setting. This condition allowed the deep CO2 upwelling along tectonic discontinuities, as testified by the C-ext (carbon from external sources) behaviour detected in Grassano groundwater during the 2019 year. Despite the small-intermediate magnitude of the mainshock, results highlight and confirm the occurrence of a potential pre-seismic geochemical process in the fractured carbonate aquifers, similar to the one proposed in literature for the stronger 2016-2017 Amatrice-Norcia seismic sequence.

In this study, stressor-response models, land use-nutrient regression models, and terrestrial ecosystem health states were used to determine the criterion values of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) using field data from lakes and reservoirs in Heilongjiang Province. Analysis of covariance and nonlinear regressions were used to quantitatively characterize the impact of climate change on the development of nutrient criteria. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the nutrient criteria obtained by the various methods. Climate change factors (such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) are predicted to influence the relationships between nutrients and Chl a, as well as land use and nutrient concentrations, as climate change persists. Climate change should be considered during the development of nutrient criteria, as climate-driven change and achieving a desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication in the future will require stricter nutrient criteria than those needed under the current climate conditions.

TI Validation and reconstruction of FY-3B/MWRI soil moisture using an

AB Soil moisture is a key variable in the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) which is climatically and hydrologically sensitive as the Earth's 'third pole'. Large-scale spatially consistent and temporally continuous soil moisture data sets are of great importance to meteorological and hydrological applications, such as weather forecasting and drought monitoring. The Fengyun-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI) soil moisture product is a relatively new passive microwave product, with the satellite being launched on November 5, 2010. This study validates and reconstructs FY-3B/MWRI soil moisture across the TP. First, the validation is performed using in situ measurements within two in situ soil moisture measurement networks (1 degrees x 1 degrees and 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees), and also compared with the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture product from multiple active and passive satellite soil moisture products using new merging procedures. Results show that the ascending FY-3B/MWRI product outperforms the descending product. The ascending FY-3B/MWRI product has almost the same correlation as the ECV product with the in situ measurements. The ascending FY-3B/MWRI product has better performance than the ECV product in the frozen season and under the lower NDVI condition. When the NDVI is higher in the unfrozen season, uncertainty in the ascending FY-3B/MWRI product increases with increasing NDVI, but it could still capture the variability in soil moisture. Second, the FY-3B/MWRI soil moisture product is subsequently reconstructed using the back-propagation neural network (BP-NN) based on reconstructed MODIS products, i.e., LST, NDVI, and albedo. The reconstruction method of generating the soil moisture product not only considers the relationship between the soil moisture and NDVI, LST, and albedo, but also the relationship between the soil, moisture and four-dimensional variations using the longitude, latitude, DEM and day of year (DOY). Results show that the soil moisture could be well reconstructed with R-2 higher than 0.56, RMSE less than 0.1 cm(3) cm(-3), and Bias less than 0.07 cm(3) cm(-3) for both frozen and unfrozen seasons, compared with the in situ measurements at the two networks. Third, the reconstruction method is applied to generate surface soil moisture over the TP. Both original and reconstructed FY-3B/MWRI soil moisture products could be valuable in studying meteorology, hydrology, and ecosystems over the TP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal flow transitions between wet and dry conditions are a primary control on river conditions, including biogeochemical processes and aquatic life-history strategies. In regions like California with highly seasonal flow patterns and immense interannual variability, a rigorous approach is needed to accurately identify and quantify seasonal flow transitions from the annual flow regime. Drawing on signal processing theory, this study develops a transferable approach to detect the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series using an iterative smoothing, feature detection, and windowing methodology. The approach is shown to accurately identify and characterize seasonal flows across highly variable natural flow regimes in California. A quantitative error assessment validated the accuracy of the approach, finding that inaccuracies in seasonal timing identification did not exceed 10%, with infrequent exceptions. Results for seasonal timing were also used to highlight the statistically distinct timing found across streams with varying climatic drivers in California. The proposed approach improves understanding of spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and informs environmental water management efforts by delineating timing of seasonal flows.

AB This study is devoted to simulation of the interannual variability of daily rainfall, such as the mean and variance of seasonal rainfall totals and the correlation between seasonal rainfall totals and a seasonal climate variable (e.g., an index of atmospheric or oceanic circulation). Prior work established that a mixture of chain-dependent processes, involving conditioning on an observed seasonal circulation index, results in improved representation of the interannual variance of seasonal rainfall totals, as well as of the correlation between rainfall and this index. The present study extends this work through consideration of a mixture model of generalized chain-dependent processes. Here "generalized" refers to the inclusion of a generalized linear model in accounting for the relationship between daily rainfall statistics and the circulation index. It is shown that this extension results in further improvements in the simulation of the interannual variability of seasonal rainfall and, especially, in its correlation with the circulation index.

AB Communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face annual dry seasons, during which water shortages and conflicts between different water use sectors may erupt. These difficulties increase following wet seasons with low rainfall, such as in relation to El Nino events in the wet-dry tropics of Central America. Hydrologic data are typically scarce in this region, making the development of drought adaptation strategies challenging. Many communities in the region depend on groundwater as their primary water source. For instance in the Province of Guanacaste in Costa Rica, groundwater supplied 78% of the total domestic water demand in 2015 and groundwater recharge from the wet season provides the primary water supply for the subsequent dry season. In this research we present a 'groundwater recharge indicator' that can support water managers in preparing for seasonal droughts. We developed this tool for an aquifer in northwestern Costa Rica where we conducted hydrological monitoring of streams and groundwater levels for 2.5 years, obtained further hydrological data (groundwater levels from 2005 to 2016), and worked with communities to assemble water use data. We combined these datasets in a hydrologic model (the Water Evaluation And Planning system, WEAP) and modelled groundwater recharge from 2005 to 2016, permitting a characterization of the relationship between rainfall and groundwater recharge. The groundwater recharge indicator is based on this relationship, and allows estimating total groundwater recharge for a wet season from cumulative rainfall measured to date. The indicator permits water managers to assess if the current year will likely fall into a low recharge category prior to the end of the wet season. This information can then be used to trigger short-term adaptation strategies with the goal to 'bank' groundwater while surface water sources are still available in the wet season. This indicator-based tool was refined through feedback provided in local stakeholder workshops. We also assessed the overall accuracy of predicting end-of-wet-season groundwater recharge with cumulative rainfall to date, and found that after the first 2-3 months of the wet season, prediction accuracies are high, leaving 5-6 months of wet season to respond adaptively to the prediction. The indicator can help water managers to plan ahead, and communicate the need for water conservation (demand management) and consideration of other water sources such as rain and surface water (supply management). This idea is transferable to other communities in regions with seasonal rainfall, and can support decision makers in increasing the socio-hydrological resilience of communities to seasonal droughts.

AB Estimating the transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity field to characterize the heterogeneity of a crystalline aquifer is particularly difficult because of the wide variations of the parameters. We developed a new approach based on the analysis of a dense network of water-table data. It is based on the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may give information on large-scale aquifer parameters. The method assumes that flux into the aquifer is mainly sub-horizontal and that the water table is mostly controlled by topography, rather than recharge. It is based on an empirical statistical relationship between field data on transmissivity and the inverse slope values of a topography-reduced water-table map. This relationship is used to compute a transmissivity map that must be validated with field measurements. The proposed approach can provide a general pattern of transmissivity, or hydraulic conductivity, but cannot correctly reproduce strong variations at very local scale (less than10 m), and will face of some uncertainties where vertical flows cannot be neglected.
   The method was tested on a peridotite (ultramafic rock) aquifer of 3.5 km(2) in area located in New Caledonia. The resulting map shows transmissivity variations over about 5 orders of magnitude (average LogT: -5.2 +/- 0.7). Comparison with a map based on measured water-level data (n = 475) shows that the comparison between LogT-computed values and LogT data deduced from 28 hydraulic tests is estimated with an error less than 20% in 71% of cases (LogT +/- 0.4), and with an error less than 10% (LogT +/- 0.2 on average) in 39% of cases. From this map a hydraulic-conductivity map has been computed showing values ranging over 8 orders of magnitude. The repeatability of the approach was tested on a second data set of hydraulic-head measurements (n = 543); the mean deviation between both LogT maps is about 11%. These encouraging results show that the method can give valuable parameter estimates, and can characterize aquifer heterogeneity. The computed LogT and LogK maps highlight the spatial distribution of parameters that show a pattern clearly controlled by the fault network of this ultramafic massif. However, the faults are mainly characterized by low-permeability zones; this differs from results on other crystalline aquifers and may be due to the fact that weathering products of peridotite are claylike materials.
   The resulting transmissivity map can be used as a starting point for modelling or to direct additional fieldwork. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oscillatory pumping tests were conducted at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site. A periodic pressure signal is generated by pumping and injecting water into the aquifer consecutively and the pressure response is recorded at many points around the source. We present and analyze the data from the field test after applying Fourier analysis. We then match the data with a recently derived analytical solution for homogeneous formations to estimate the equivalent aquifer properties: conductivity K, specific storage Ss and specific yield S-y. The estimated values are shown to be in agreement with previous estimates conducted at this site. We observe variations in the estimated parameters with different oscillation periods of pumping. The trend of the parameters with changing period is discussed and compared to predictions by existing theory and laboratory experiments dealing with dynamic effective properties. It is shown that the results are qualitatively consistent with recent works on effective properties of formations of spatially variable properties in oscillatory flow. To grasp the impact of heterogeneity, a simple configuration is proposed, helping explain the observed increase in effective conductivity with decreasing period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The local approximation prediction model (LPM) is a forecasting approach based on chaos theory. It uses the Euclidean distance to evaluate the spatial proximity between two phase points, which is a measure of "quantity" similarity. This study improved LPM by proposing a coupled "quantity-pattern" similarity model (CQPSM). The "pattern" similarity is defined as the similarity of two phase points on internal structure, and measured by a cumulative unit-step function. The forbearing stratified sequencing method is employed to solve the double objective optimization problem. The proposed model was tested using the data from the Danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12-monthly precipitation forecasting with lead times from a month to a year. Four performance measures (R, RMSE, MARE and NSE) were computed and compared to those of LPM and autoregressive (AR) model. The results show a better performance of CQPSM and indicates the importance of considering "pattern" similarity between two phase points. Moreover, the weighted Euclidean distance based on partial information logic was discussed and applied to further improve the "quantity" similarity. Consequently, the proposed CQPSM could provide a new alternative for hydrological forecasting.

AB Bouchet's complementary relationship and the Budyko hypothesis are two classic frameworks that are interconnected. To systematically investigate the connections between the two frameworks, we analyze precipitation, pan evaporation, and potential evaporation data at 259 weather stations across the United States. The precipitation and pan evaporation data are from field measurement and the potential evaporation data are collected from a remote-sensing dataset. We use pan evaporation to represent "apparent" potential evaporation, which is different from potential evaporation. With these data, we study the correlations between precipitation and potential evaporation, and between precipitation and "apparent" potential evaporation. The results show that 93% of the study's weather stations exhibit a negative correlation between precipitation and "apparent" potential evaporation. Also, the aggregated data cloud of precipitation vs. "apparent" potential evaporation with 5312 warm-season data points from 259 weather stations shows a negative trend in which "apparent" potential evaporation decreases with increasing precipitation. On the other hand, no significant correlation is found in the data cloud of precipitation vs. potential evaporation, indicating that precipitation and potential evaporation are independent. We combine a Budyko-type expression, the Turc-Pike equation, with Bouchet's complementary relationship to derive upper and lower Bouchet-Budyko curves, which display a complementary relationship between "apparent" potential evaporation and actual evaporation. The observed warm-season data follow the trend of the Bouchet-Budyko curves. Our study shows the consistency between Budyko's framework and Bouchet's complementary relationship, with the distinction between potential evaporation and "apparent" potential evaporation. The formulated complementary relationship can be used in quantitative modeling practices.

AB The relationship between streamwater mean residence time (MRT) and landscape characteristics is poorly understood. We used tritium (H-3) to define our MRT. We tested the hypothesis that baseflow water MRT increases with increasing absolute catchment size at the Maimai catchments. These catchments are simple hydrologic systems relative to many catchments around the world, with uniformly wet climatic conditions, little seasonality, uniform and nearly impermeable bedrock, steep short hillslopes, shallow soils, and well-characterized hillslope and catchment hydrology. As a result, this is a relatively simple system and an ideal location for new MRT-related hypothesis 1960s nuclear testing spike, atmospheric H-3 levels have now approached near background levels and are often complicated by contamination from 4 the nuclear industry. We present results for H-3 sampled from our set of nested catchments in nuclear-industry-free New Zealand. Because of high precision analysis, near-natural atmospheric H-3 levels, and well-characterized rainfall H-3 inputs, we were able to estimate the age of young (i.e. less than 3 years old) waters. Our results showed no correlation between MRT and catchment size. However, MRT was correlated to the median sub-catchment size of the sampled watersheds, as shown by landscape analysis of catchment area accumulation patterns. These preliminary findings suggest that landscape organization, rather than total area, is a first-order control on MRT and points the way forward for more detailed analysis of how landscape organization affects catchment runoff characteristics.

AB As a significant hydrological parameter, the water level of complex and shallow river-lake wetland has important implications for a number of hydrological, biological, physical and chemical processes. Current in-situ and satellite-based methods both have disadvantages in capturing water levels over smaller surface water bodies with spatial heterogeneity or complexity. Interferometric imaging radar altimeter (InIRA) is a latest generation of Ku-band radar altimeter onboard Tiangong-2 (TG-2), the Chinese space laboratory, launched in 2016. Similar to the design idea of NASA's SWOT, it is expected to improve this situation through wide-swath altimetry. However, the capacity of the TG-2 InIRA to measure water levels within small surface water bodies remains unexamined. To explore these performances, particularly their potential impact on hydrology research, an assessment and comparison between in-situ and TG-2 derived measurements was performed over the largest river-lake wetland in China. The results showed that the TG-2 InIRA, with a broad range of coverage, was able to effectively capture most of the surface water at its elevation. For the focused shallow depressions, a relatively good correlation was observed between the in-situ and InIRA-derived water surface elevations (WSEs), with an R-2 of 0.97, RMSE of 0.29 m, and absolute difference ranging from 3 to 55 cm. The accuracy of InIRA-derived WSEs was highly controlled by the depression sizes, and the absolute biases broadly increased in a power law fashion as the size of the depression decreased. In addition, surface water profiles along the Ganjiang and Xiushui River channels indicated that the TG-2 InIRA could also measure river WSEs, with absolute differences below 0.43 m. Although differences were observed, the results of the river gradient distribution were consistent with the practical situation and showed overall slopes of 18.72 cm/km and 12.43 cm/km for the Xiushui and Ganjiang Rivers, respectively. Such results demonstrated that TG-2 InIRA measurements can satisfactorily capture spatial patterns of the surface water gradient, which is useful for accurately estimating river discharge. This study will not only bridge the gap between in-situ measurements and forthcoming SWOT products but also contribute to water resource management and hydrologic service assessments over data-sparse regions of river-lake systems within the study area.
